Chairman’s Statement
“Value and transparency for
customers has delivered good
growth in proﬁt for shareholders”
Dennis Stevenson
Chairman HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 3
As I write in early 2004, it is only too easy to
forget that 2003 was a year heavy with
uncertainty, most obviously collapsing
stockmarkets and the war in Iraq. As it turned
out, trading conditions in many of our
businesses were comparatively benign and it
was another year of opportunity for HBOS.
Value for customers and growth 
for shareholders
A strategy that delivers value and transparency
for customers has delivered good growth in
profits for shareholders, which in 2003, rose
27% to £3,885m. The Board has therefore
decided to recommend a final dividend of
20.6p, bringing the total dividend per share to
30.9p, 5% higher than last year and in line with
the policy of increasing dividend cover to 2.5
times.
For the year as a whole, HBOS shares
outperformed their peers, even after losing
some ground in the second half as the market
worried about rising interest rates.
In Retail, value for money and simplicity
remains a distinctive and compelling
proposition for customers. Once again our
team showed just how to convert the
resultant market share gains into significant
profits growth for shareholders. 
The early achievement of our market share
goal in SME banking and the associated rapid
rise in profits confirms our position as the
only credible Business Banking competitor to
the Big 4. In Corporate Banking credit
conditions are now improving. Our traditional
strategy, so evident in 2002 and 2003, of not
standing back from customers just as their
need and our opportunity is greatest has
therefore paid huge dividends. 
As we extend our General Insurance
capabilities, in motor and household risks, 
so we become better at realising the full
potential of a business where as a low cost
bank with a huge number of customers, we
are particularly well placed to succeed. In
every year of the bear market, our investment
businesses gained market share and improved
efficiency. After a poor start, equity markets
improved over the year and investor
confidence has begun to return. At long last
we now can look forward with more
confidence to improving returns.
Last year we acquired the minority in
BankWest. This enables us to optimise our
investments there by bringing all our Australian
interests closer together as HBOS Australia. I
particularly want to welcome our new
Australian colleagues to HBOS.
In Treasury, serving the internal product needs
of our divisions and our customers has
proved to be a very sensible focus, without
the downside of the more esoteric forays into
wholesale banking that can introduce
unwelcome earnings volatility.
In each of our businesses we have proven
strategies for growth. However, it would be
wrong to pursue growth in all businesses at
all times. So in 2004 the growth emphasis in
HBOS will change, most obviously in Retail
where the case for greater caution is clear.
Embracing regulatory change
We are not among those who rail against the
growing tide of regulation – despite our
having received some £2m of fines from the
FSA for historical inadequacies. Regulation
represents both Society’s consent to our
activities and an opportunity to create
advantage versus our competitors. It is our
job to learn how to live with a huge
regulatory agenda, whether from Europe, the
UK or the USA and in particular to learn from
our mistakes. It is also, I believe, our duty to
be as demanding of the regulator in ensuring
high standards of regulation as they are of us.
Through the inaugural HBOS Governance
Forum and extensive individual consultation,
we have established a much more active
dialogue with investors. Our public support
for the new Higgs regime has been followed
by early adoption in this report of the new
combined code. Each decision on whether to
comply or explain has been determined by
the sole criterion of what is in the interests of
the company and its shareholders. Where we
judge it to be in our shareholders’ interests
for us to explain rather than comply, we will
always eschew the bland “it is in the
shareholders’ interests” in favour of as full
and frank an explanation as possible.
In Scotland, the effects of the merger
continue to be very positive – some 3,000
new jobs have been created and the Scottish
economy is benefiting from one of the largest
companies in the UK being managed and
driven from central Scotland. This said,
merger integration is rarely without problems
and the reaction of some customers, even
former colleagues to our plans to restore our
headquarters on The Mound here in
Edinburgh so as to create an HQ fit for the
21st Century has taught us a lesson in
communication. We have learned from these
experiences and now move on.
After 27 years service with Bank of Scotland
and HBOS, Gordon McQueen, Chief Executive 
of HBOS Treasury Services retired at the end
of 2003. His legacy to HBOS lies in the
creation of a successfully merged Treasury
from the best of the Halifax and Bank of
Scotland operations. He had one of the
toughest jobs following the merger and
leaves with a job well done.
The Board also loses Sir Bob Reid and Louis
Sherwood at the forthcoming AGM. Bob
became a Director of the Bank of Scotland in
1987 and has served as Deputy Governor
since 1997. As the Senior Independent
Director he took to the task of appraising the
Chairman on behalf of the Board with alacrity
and sensitivity, the latter not of course
getting in the way of the desired feedback!
Louis has served with equal distinction since
joining the Board of the Halifax in 1997,
serving on the Board of Clerical Medical as
Chairman and playing a key role on the HBOS
Audit Committee. We will miss their wise
counsel and thank them for their
contributions.
We welcome two new Non-executive
Directors to the Board. As former Senior
Partner in Scotland with Deloitte & Touche,
David Shearer brings broad business and
financial experience. Kate Nealon joins us
from Standard Chartered plc where latterly
she acted as Senior Counsel, Risk &
Regulatory compliance and also brings very
relevant experience to the Board. 
A clear agenda
In the following pages James Crosby and 
his fellow executives chart last year’s
performance in detail and set out a very clear
agenda for 2004. This will also see the Group
reporting results through four divisions;
Retail, Insurance & Investment, Corporate 
and International Operations. The expanded
Retail and Corporate Divisions will take
Business Banking’s growth to the next stage
with Treasury developing its capabilities
within the Corporate Division. The
International Operations Division will bring
together our interests in Ireland and Australia
to provide a focus for future development.
Your Board has confidence in this strategy to
deliver superior value for shareholders. They
would be the first to acknowledge however,
that the real heroes are our 60,000 plus
colleagues who convert strategy into results.
And it is for their efforts, both individual and
collective, that I wish to record the Board’s
greatest appreciation.

Chief Executive’s Statement
“Last year’s performance
was characterised by
increased market share,
improved efﬁciency and
good growth in proﬁts 
for shareholders”

Chief Executive HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 5
Proﬁt before
tax and
exceptional
items up 27%
to £3,885m 
Creating value for shareholders
HBOS’s distinctive strategy continues to
create value for shareholders and customers.
Our determination to offer customers value
for money and transparency makes HBOS the
most powerful force for competition in UK
financial services. Across HBOS, last year’s
performance was characterised by increased
market share, improved efficiency and good
growth in profits for shareholders. 
Profit before tax and exceptional items 
rose by 27% to £3,885m. Each division
recorded growth in profits with Retail up
19%, Corporate up 21%, Business Banking 
up 32%, Insurance & Investment up 51% and
Treasury up 3%. 
Underlying earnings per share increased 
by 22% to 68.5p. In line with our policy 
of increasing the level of dividend cover to
2.5 times, the Board is proposing a full year
dividend of 30.9p, 5% higher than last year,
which takes underlying dividend cover to 
2.2 times (1.9 in 2002).
The Group RoE rose to 17.7% (15.9% 2002).
As expected, the impact of capital raising
combined with lower underlying returns 
from Insurance & Investment resulted in only
a modest increase in Group Target RoE to
17.7% (2002 17.5%).
A marked acceleration in the growth of
deposits (up 16%), an increased requirement
for wholesale funding and reduced capital
earnings partly offset by improved business
mix were the main reasons for the 6bps
reduction in the Group net interest margin 
to 177bps. Retail and Corporate margins
declined by 9bps and 6bps to 190bps and
171bps respectively. Largely the result of 
a shift in business mix arising from its
expansion, Business Banking margins were
265bps against 295bps in 2002. 
As was the case in 2003, we do not expect
competitive pressures to bear down on
margins in 2004. We therefore expect our
deposit growth ambitions and increased
wholesale funding to result in a not
significantly different movement in the 
Group net interest margin this year.
HBOS’s stable credit performance is a
reflection of the resilient performance of the
UK economy, the effectiveness of our credit
assessment techniques and the comparative
bias within our balance sheet towards higher
quality asset classes. Relative to our UK peers,
we believe we are heavier in residential
mortgages whilst remaining comparatively
light in unsecured personal and SME lending
and in corporate lending. 
Total non-performing assets as a percentage
of advances were unchanged at 1.75% (2002
1.75%). Closing provisions as a percentage of
advances were 0.79% (0.84% end 2002). The
provisions charge of £1,025m (£832m 2002)
sees coverage of non-performing advances 
by total closing provisions and interest in
suspense at 48% (51% in 2002).
Strong income growth, sound cost control
and the realisation of merger synergies
enabled HBOS to achieve further significant
improvements in efficiency with the
cost:income ratio falling to 41.6% against
45.2% in 2002.
The increase in underlying costs of 9%
included £46m as a result of the acquisition
of Rothschild Asset Management, an
additional pension charge of £62m and £30m
in respect of the exchange rate movement on
BankWest’s expenses. For 2004, the growth in
underlying operating expenses is targeted to
be 5% or less.
During 2003, HBOS deployed its capital
resources to support 15% growth in risk
weighted assets, to finance the £436m
acquisition of the BankWest minority and 
to fund the previously disclosed £500m
injection into Clerical Medical. Nonetheless 
a 67% increase in retained earnings, the issue
of £641m of innovative Tier 1 capital and an
increase of £3.7bn in Tier 2 capital saw the
total capital ratio rise from 10.4% to 11.1%.
And at 7.6% (7.9% in 2002) the Tier 1 ratio
remained firmly within our target range.
During 2003, £296m of revenue synergies 
and £286m of cost synergies contributed 
a combined £582m to the Group’s results,
comfortably exceeding the full year target of
£470m. We remain on track to deliver our
target of £800m of merger synergies by 2005.
IT integration is now largely complete and in
particular, the process of decommissioning all
legacy systems in Retail remains on target.
Divisional Performance:
Retail
HBOS’s distinctive consumer strategy
continued to generate strong sales and
income growth from a tightly controlled cost
base. Profit before tax and exceptionals rose
by 19% to £1,698m.
As promised, growth in savings balances
accelerated. Taken together with credit
balances in bank accounts, total balances
increased by £11bn (£7bn in 2002) to £115bn,
increasing HBOS’s share of UK Household
Sector Liquid Assets to an estimated 15.7%
(2002 15.5%).
In 2003 our strategy in the mortgage market
continued to de-emphasise re-mortgages,
given their comparatively unfavourable risk
reward characteristics. Nonetheless, the
collective reach and service quality of the
five HBOS mortgage brands delivered an
above target market share for net mortgage
lending of 25% (target 23%). The average LTV
on new lending fell to 61% (63% 2002) at the
end of the year and the average LTV across
the whole book remained at 43%.
In traditional banking products HBOS
continued to gain at others’ expense with
sales of 1m new credit card accounts and
1.2m bank accounts. These gave us an
estimated 16% market share of new sales 
of credit cards with balances rising 21%. 
An estimated 25% of the “new and switcher”
market in bank accounts helped us to achieve
a 55% growth in credit balances.
As targeted, a substantial increase in
operating income achieved on a stable 
cost base saw Intelligent Finance break even 
in December. For the year as a whole its
losses reduced significantly to £53m from
£147m in 2002.
Retail asset quality remains robust. Non-
performing assets were stable at 1.80% of
closing advances (1.78% 2002). The charge 
for provisions as a percentage of average
advances was 0.30%, 5bps higher than in 2002
with the increase in provisions reflecting both
the changing mix of lending and the normal
ageing of the loan portfolio. 
The Retail cost:income ratio fell to 47.8%
(2002 52.5%), the direct consequence of sales
growth, improved productivity and continuing
tight cost control, as costs grew by 3.2%
(target 3%).
Insurance & Investment
In both Insurance & Investment, in rapidly
consolidating markets, HBOS’s distribution
strength and low cost advantage enabled us
to record further market share gains in the
UK. Sales of general insurance products rose
by 19%. In a contracting market, investment 6 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
product sales were stable as we closed in on
our goal of being No.1 for investment
product sales in the UK. Coupled with a
significant turnround in short-term
fluctuations in investment returns, this
enabled profit before tax and exceptionals to
increase by 51% to £887m. 
Insurance profits rose by 11% to £445m 
as HBOS turned its low cost distribution
advantage directly into value for consumers
and attractive returns for shareholders. 
Sales of household and repayment insurance
products increased by 20% and 9%
respectively, whilst sales of motor insurance
policies were up 69%. esure saw almost
800,000 motor and household policies 
sold and is expected to break even in the 
first half of 2004.
In the 4th quarter we launched two new
developments designed to enhance future
growth. First Alternative, our newest joint
venture with Peter Wood, capitalises on
esure’s existing investment in infrastructure.
By enabling HBOS to meet the needs of non-
standard drivers it extends our distribution
reach for motor insurance. As from the end
of December we started to underwrite our
household insurance business (previously
with Royal & Sun Alliance) and all such
business will transfer to HBOS on renewal
during 2004. As an underwriter, HBOS will
recognise its profits from household
insurance later than was the case as a
commission earning introducer. As disclosed
previously, this will have the one off effect
of reducing reported profits in 2004 by
around £76m.
A significant reduction in negative short-term
fluctuations in investment returns meant that
investment profits rose by 134% to £442m
(£189m in 2002). However, reduced margins
on in force business and assets under
management as a consequence of lower
average stock market levels during the year
and one-off costs associated with the
acquisition of Rothschild Asset Management
saw profits based on long-term assumptions
(i.e. excluding short-term fluctuations and
changes to economic assumptions) fall by
19% to £416m.
Last year we began a significant re-structuring
of our intermediary and bancassurance
operations. To be completed in early 2005,
this will result in a significant enhancement to
the long-term profitability of our investment
business. In the meantime, progress made to
date contributed to the improvement in new
business profitability to 25% of equivalent
premium income (22% in 2002), achieving our
medium term target of 25%.
Bancassurance sales, which rose 21%, once
again underlined the power of simplicity and
value for money, even in difficult investment
product markets. With profits products
accounted for only 8% of Clerical Medical’s
intermediary sales in the UK. Nonetheless,
total UK intermediary sales were resilient,
down just 10%, whilst overall intermediary
sales fell 17% in tough markets. Wealth
management sales showed real signs of
improvement in the second half. Down 
17% at the half year, for the year as a 
whole, sales for St. James’s Place Capital
were only 3% lower than a year earlier, 
as high net worth investors’ confidence
began to recover.
Business Banking
Business Banking started to deliver the
required payback for the major investment
made in taking our SME products and services
into England and Wales. We have achieved
our interim SME market share target of 6%,
one year early. Profit before tax and
exceptionals rose by 32% to £404m.
The newly established business hunters field
force and the direct business bank are both
gaining customers at the expense of our
peers. Customer lending balances increased
by £7.5bn (32%) while deposits grew by 40%
to £17bn. The investment required in people,
systems and infrastructure was substantially
completed in the second half of last year
leading to an 11% increase in underlying
operating expenses in 2003. However, as
targeted, for 2003 as a whole, the cost:income
ratio reduced to 53.0% from 55.7%.
A more stable market in motor residuals
made for better trading from both our motor
finance and contract hire/vehicle management
businesses, both of which benefited from the
withdrawal of key competitors. 
Bank of Scotland (Ireland) has proven to be
particularly successful in challenging the
existing providers of financial services with a
number of product innovations. Bank of
Scotland (Ireland) now has over 19% SME
market share with lending growth of 17% and
growth in deposit balances of 34% in local
currency in 2003.
Growth in Business Banking has not been at
the expense of credit quality. Such strong
growth in assets meant that, as a percentage
of advances, non-performing assets fell to
1.97% (2.21% end 2002) whilst the provisions
charge, as a percentage of average advances,
fell to 0.49% against 0.70% in 2002.
Corporate Banking
Increasingly benign market conditions and
attractive margins allowed Corporate to
sustain momentum without any increase in
risk appetite or a move outside long
established areas of expertise. Profit before
tax and exceptionals rose 21% to £826m.
Customer lending growth (£5.2bn) slowed 
to 11%, the direct result of our improved
capability and success in selling down debt
together with the planned repayment of
some large high profile exposures. The same
strategy saw an acceleration in the growth 
of non-interest income, 26% higher than 
a year earlier. Deposit balances advanced by
43% to £20.2bn.
Accounting for around a third of loans, our
largest industry sector continues to be
construction and property. Our focus here
lies primarily in the property investment
sector where in the first instance the credit
exposure is assessed against quality rental
covenants. We continue to have limited
exposure to commercial developments.
Credit quality was relatively stable which is
reflected in a slightly reduced provisions
charge of 0.70% of average advances (0.72% in
2002). Non-performing assets were 1.65% of
advances (1.56% at end 2002). 
A long standing reputation for innovation,
coupled with the ability to make things
happen, have enabled Corporate to seize the
huge opportunities presented by the creation
of HBOS. In the process we have built market
leading positions, most notably with our
Structured Finance, Integrated Finance and
Joint Venture offerings where our positioning
as the “one stop shop” for the full range of
underlying banking products continues to be
a clear source of competitive advantage. 
Treasury
Treasury profit before tax and exceptionals 
of £239m were 3% above those achieved 
last year. Growth in sales of Treasury products
to the HBOS Group and its customers 
Underlying
earnings per
share up 22%
to 68.5p  HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 7
(up 65% on a like for like basis) very largely
offset a decline in the wholesale interest
margin and enabled Treasury to sustain 
2002’s performance.
Our Treasury operation is focused on the
generation of high quality earnings. In 2003,
70% of revenues were derived from the
management of funding and liquidity and 
the provision of products and services to the
HBOS Group and its customers. Consistent
with such an internally focused strategy, asset
quality is very strong. We avoid sub
investment grade investments and at the end
of 2003, over 99% of our total portfolio was
rated A or above. No credit provisions were
required in the period.
HBOS Treasury Services was very active in
funding for the Group, successfully launching
the first two covered bond issues in the UK
market as well as raising £11.5bn from
mortgage securitisations.
BankWest
Last year saw BankWest’s profits recover
strongly, rising 25% in local currency. Strong
growth in both retail and business lending,
coupled with robust margins and an
improving credit experience, all contributed
to this step-change in performance.
In September HBOS completed the
acquisition of the minority in BankWest. 
We are currently engaged in bringing
BankWest closer together with our other
Australian activities, BOSIAL, Capital Finance
and St. Andrew’s Insurance, to create HBOS
Australia. This will greatly enhance our ability
to create value for shareholders from our
Australian assets.
Outlook and prospects
As previously announced, the Group is 
now organised around four Divisions; Retail,
Insurance & Investment, Corporate and
International Operations. The results for 
2004 (with re-stated comparatives for 2003)
will be presented on this basis.
The UK economy is strengthening and the
interest rate cycle has turned. However,
despite the increase in public sector
spending, the need to achieve a smooth
transition from consumer to investment led
growth points to only modest rate rises. 
Low interest rates, a benign employment
market and the shortage of housing stock 
will continue to underpin the housing market
in 2004. And indeed the market has seen 
a buoyant start to the year. Even so, after 
3 years of a strong housing market, there is 
no room for complacency. We have, and will
continue to tighten our lending criteria. In the
short-term therefore, this will be reflected in
HBOS’s mortgage strategy where we now
expect to trade at or, if appropriate, below
our stock share for net lending (23%).
The rate of growth in demand for unsecured
personal credit has slowed. Although there
are few signs of deterioration in retail credit
conditions, here too we remain vigilant for
any contrary indicators.
We do not expect corporate credit
conditions to deteriorate. Our work in
progress remains strong and we expect 
to benefit from a further recovery in
corporate activity.
More stable equity markets should see
confidence gradually return to investment
product markets. More specifically the
significant reduction in demand for with
profits products and the advent of
depolarisation both favour HBOS’s multi-
brand distribution led strategy. 
Both the UK and European authorities are
proposing extensive regulatory change,
stretching from capital adequacy to treating
customers fairly. Regardless of the scale of
such change, which should in any case favour
larger companies such as HBOS, it is
important that everything we do runs with
the grain of regulatory policy. Indeed our
shareholders have every right to demand that
we regard regulation as another opportunity
to create comparative advantage versus 
our competitors.
As we complete the task of extracting the
promised merger synergies, so 2004 should
see HBOS reach some important financial
benchmarks. With cost growth restricted to
5%, the underlying cost:income ratio is
expected to fall through 40%. As promised at
the time of the 2002 capital raising, retained
earnings will be capable of supporting double
digit balance sheet growth without straining
the Tier 1 ratio. Most important of all, 2 years
of strong asset growth with significant gains
in efficiency and now an acceleration in non-
interest income, should see us reach our
benchmark return on equity (20%). Under
current industry structures, we regard these
benchmarks as sustainable. 
The inherent growth characteristics of UK
financial services will be the backdrop for
HBOS growth beyond 2004, particularly as 
UK market shares re-align in the aftermath 
of consolidation. As a number of competitors
also look outside the UK for their primary
growth prospects, the opportunities increase
for a strong HBOS to grow at the expense of
the competition.

12% higher at £809m (2002 £721m), total
operating income grew by 13% year on year.
Our continued focus on cost management
and productivity gains enabled us to contain
year on year operating expense growth to
3.2%. Our cost management performance
continues to reflect the successful delivery of
merger cost synergies.
Asset quality remains robust. Whilst the
provisions charge increased by 44% year on
year, this mainly reflects the significant
growth in unsecured lending balances in
recent years. Non-performing assets (“NPAs”)
as a percentage of period end loans and
advances were stable at 1.80% (2002 1.78%).
We have experienced some increase in
provisions and NPAs as our portfolio matures.
This is a natural consequence of our relative
growth in balances over the past few years
where the normal seasoning of loan
performance is therefore more pronounced.

Margin trends in our asset based businesses
proved to be resilient in the face of
competitive market conditions. The mortgage
spread contribution improved by 5bps,
reflecting the benefits of our multi-brand
strategy and improved spreads in the
mainstream lending segment. The contribution
from both credit cards and Intelligent Finance
each improved by 2bps. On the liability side
of the balance sheet, the savings and banking
spread contribution declined by 7bps in total
as we targeted significant growth in deposit
balances. An increased requirement for
wholesale funding resulted in a 7bps margin
reduction, of which 2bps was attributable to
the increased level of mortgage securitisation.
The benefit from earnings on free capital was
2bps lower at 12bps.
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income increased by 12% to
£809m (2002 £721m). Fees and commissions
receivable were £170m higher at £1,250m,
reflecting solid growth in fee income across
our principal product lines. This was partly
offset by a £102m increase in fees and
commissions payable, mainly reflecting 
a volume led increase in mortgage
intermediary fees.

Operational Performance
Mortgages
In 2003 we have continued to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our five-brand strategy.
By competing effectively through all
channels, and across the complete range of
mainstream and specialist mortgage
segments, we have delivered record net
lending of £25.5bn to give an estimated full
year net lending share of 25%, ahead of our
stock related share target of 23%.
Gross mortgage lending at £71.8bn was 26%
up on 2002 and represents an estimated 26%
market share. We have grown the retail
mortgage book by £25.5bn to £176bn of 
assets in 2003.
Asset quality has not been sacrificed in order
to drive sales. The average income multiple
remains prudent at just over 2.5 times. The
Operating Expenses
Strong sales volumes, which in turn led to
higher than planned sales related bonus costs,
saw operating expenses increase by only 3.2%
to £2,019m (2002 £1,956m). The combined
impact of strong income growth and tight
cost control enabled us to further reduce 
the cost:income ratio to 47.8% (2002 52.5%).
The analysis of operating expenses by cost
type in 2003 reflects changes to the
classification of direct and recharged
expenditure. The total costs of the division
are not materially affected by these 
changes and comparative figures have not
been restated.
Provisions
Closing provisions as a percentage of period
end loans and advances were slightly lower at
0.69%, down from 0.72% at the end of 2002.
Total provisions (including interest in
suspense) coverage of NPAs was 40%,
compared to 43% at the end of 2002. The
apparent dilution in provisions cover mainly
reflects the benefit of continuing house price
inflation, which means that growth in secured
NPAs has not resulted in a substantially
increased specific provisioning requirement.
The bad debt charge represented 0.30% (2002
0.25%) of average loans and advances. The
total charge comprises £486m (2002 £356m)
for unsecured and £50m (2002 £17m) for
secured advances. The growth in the
unsecured charge reflects the significant
growth in balances in recent years. The
increase in the secured charge reflects our
increased lending to specialist segments of
the mortgage market. Overall, the secured
charge continues to benefit from a
combination of significant house price
inflation, a stable mortgage arrears profile,

average loan to value (“LTV”) for the entire
book on year-end valuations, was 43%, the
same as at the end of 2002. The average LTV
for new business was 61% (2002 63%).
We remain the market leaders in providing
support for First Time Buyers and Home
Movers, delivering more than our asset based
share in these segments. We have retained
our deliberately underweight position in the
remortgage sector as the lower longevity of
these customer relationships continues to
mean that remortgages deliver lower returns
through the lifetime of the product.
Throughout 2003 we have continued to 
take a measured approach to the higher
margin specialist lending segments of buy-to-
let, self-certification and near prime. At the
year end, the LTV of our specialist book was
stable at 66% (2002 66%).
We continue to benefit from our investment
in “best in class” processing technology. Our
investment in a B2B platform allows us to
process intermediary business through the
internet and, in 2003, over 80% of the Halifax
intermediary business came through this
channel. This puts us in an excellent position
to support our intermediary partners through
Regulation and is a key factor in delivering
industry-leading service levels which have
once again been widely recognised.
We were again awarded “Best Overall Lender
2003/2004” by Your Mortgage magazine and
“Best Mortgage Provider 2003” by Personal
Finance magazine.

Our net to gross lending ratio remained
slightly better than the market average at
35.5% in 2003 after reaching a high of 40.7% in
2002. Redemption experience was principally
driven by the maturing profile of the IF book
after two years of strong growth, and
cessations of low margin re-mortgage products
in the Halifax brand in the fourth quarter.
Mortgage credit quality remains strong. Total
mortgage arrears remained unchanged at 1.1%
of the value of the portfolio and total
mortgage provisions as a percentage of
period end loans and advances were 0.23%
(2002 0.26%). The following tables
demonstrate the relatively stable profile of

The percentage of mortgage cases in arrears
partly reflects the maturing of the Intelligent
Finance portfolio, but is mainly driven by our
risk-based collections strategy which focuses on
the potential for loss (as measured by loan size
and LTV) and supports the CML/Government
Partnership initiative to promote sustainable
home ownership. This strategy is proving
extremely successful in helping customers
keep their homes and can be evidenced by 
our industry leading possession levels which
declined by 63% in 2003 against the CML
average reduction of 36%.
Bank Accounts
Our market leading current accounts
combining attractive interest rates and value
added features, backed up by aggressive
marketing, have allowed HBOS to sustain 
its attack on the incumbents in the UK
banking market. The strong sales performance
delivered in 2002 has been maintained with
1.2m new bank accounts opened in 2003. 
The HBOS share of the new and switchers
market is now estimated to be 25%.
New account openings and attractive
interest rates have contributed to the 
strong growth in credit balances to £13.8bn
(2002 £8.9bn). Credit quality remains high
following significant improvements in the
first half of 2003. Provisions as a percentage
of period end loans and advances have
fallen to 3.5% from 4.7% at the end of 2002
and non-performing assets have declined 
to 5.3% of period end loans and advances
(2002 6.8%).
Bank account customers have continued 
to migrate to lower cost distribution
channels. Internet registered users have
grown by 39% to 2.2m and the number of
online transactions has increased by 47% in
the last twelve months. The current account
has continued to be a strong driver of cross
sales with the number of customers holding
three additional products increasing by 38%
over the year. We further enhanced our
product range with the introduction of 
our innovative fee free packaged account
“Extras” in August.
Credit Cards
The HBOS credit card business continues to
benefit from an extensive multi-branded
product range coupled with the broadest
distribution base of any UK Retail bank
Donald Snodgrass,
Management Trainee HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 13
(ranging from branches to direct mail and
our partnership and affinity arrangements).
We acquired 1m new accounts (1.4m
including those acquired through our joint
venture partners) in 2003, resulting in an
estimated HBOS market share of 16%.
Balances have increased by 21% to £4.7bn
(2002 £3.9bn).
We constantly monitor leading credit
indicators as the following table illustrates:

Whilst the proportion of balances entering
arrears has significantly reduced to 3.7% (2002
4.5%), NPAs have increased to 9.4% (2002 8.4%)
reflecting the maturing of our portfolio.
Personal Lending
Our broad distribution, competitive pricing
and innovative product features have
confirmed HBOS as the No.1 lender within
the personal loan market during 2003. Against
the backdrop of a 12% reduction in the
unsecured personal loan market balances
outstanding have grown by 4% since the end
of 2002, evidence of our successful retention
strategy which has seen our closure rate
improve by 6%.
Balance sheet provisions as a percentage of
period end loans and advances remained
stable at 7.5% (2002 7.5%). NPAs also
remained stable at 11.8% (2002 11.8%) of
period end loans and advances.
Savings
Against a background of the Bank of England
Base Rate falling to its lowest level for almost
50 years, the market for customer deposits
remained fierce in 2003. Our aggressive multi-
brand strategy helped us to grow savings
balances by £5.9bn during the year.
The savings margin came under some
pressure in 2003 as a consequence of the
low interest rate environment, increasing
competition for new deposits and our value
led strategy. The low rate environment has
limited our ability to pass on the full extent
of base rate reductions. Furthermore, 
our value led strategy, which actively
encourages customers into the most
appropriate Savings and Investment product,
has created short-term margin pressures, 
but it has also improved customer retention
and driven record balance growth whilst
continuing to support our growing
Bancassurance business.
During the second half of 2003 we started
selling Halifax branded savings accounts in all
Scottish branches and launched an improved
Savings Review process. Collectively, these
actions have enabled us to further
consolidate our position as the No.1 Savings
provider in the UK with an estimated overall
market share of Household Sector Liquid
Assets of 15.7% (2002 15.5%).
Intelligent Finance
Intelligent Finance (“IF”) has met our declared
goal of reaching break even by the end of
2003, delivering a small profit in the month of
December. Continued strong growth in net
interest income and a reduction in operating
costs were the key factors behind a £94m
reduction in losses compared to 2002.

grown by £900m including a trebling of Cash
ISA balances. Operating income increased
fourfold compared to 2002, whilst operating
expenses started to decline reflecting
improved efficiency in the maturing business.
IF, like Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Birmingham
Midshires and The Mortgage Business 
will play a vital role in our integrated
distribution strategy.
Prospects
Retail Banking’s performance in 2003 provides
further evidence that our strategy, based on
delivering value and simplicity to customers
combined with a disciplined approach to cost
management, continues to drive real
shareholder value.
HBOS expects another good year in the
housing market during 2004 underpinned by
low unemployment, good affordability and 
a severe shortage of housing stock. Even so,
after three years of a strong housing market
there is no room for complacency. We have,
and will continue, to tighten our lending
criteria. In the short-term therefore this will be
reflected in HBOS’s mortgage strategy where
we now expect to trade at or, if appropriate,
below our stock share for net lending (23%).
In the long-term we see attractive growth
prospects in all of our main Retail businesses
and we believe that our uniquely strong sales
and distribution model will allow us to achieve
long-term market shares above 15% in all
markets in which we compete. In 2004 we are
confident that continued strong income
growth, coupled with stringent cost control
and a prudent attitude to credit quality, will
drive a further improvement in profitability.

increased by 134% to £442m. Investment
profits based on long-term investment return
assumptions, i.e. after eliminating the effect of
short-term fluctuations in investment returns
and changes to economic assumptions,
reduced to £416m (2002 £511m) due to lower
margins on in-force business and assets under
management as a result of lower stock market
levels during the year, and the additional
integration costs associated with the
Rothschild Asset Management acquisition.
The positive momentum of the Insurance
Business was maintained in 2003 with sales 
up by 19% overall and each major line of
business showing healthy growth. Of
particular note was the performance of esure,
where motor insurance sales increased by
69% against the previous year.
Against the backdrop of a shrinking
investment market, the Investment Business
performed resiliently with overall sales
marginally ahead of 2002 and UK sales 5%
ahead. The trends by channel seen in previous
reporting periods continued with strong
performance in Bancassurance, where sales
increased by 21%, being balanced by lower
sales in Intermediary and Wealth Management.
Based on the new business results reported by
the ABI, we made further progress towards our
ambition of being number one in the UK
investment market.

recognition of net income as we move from
commission (accounted for in the year of
receipt) to premiums (accounted for as the
premiums are earned) will result in a one-off
reduction in reported pre-tax profits of an
estimated £76m in 2004. 
Halifax Home Insurance’s position as a leading
provider in the UK was reaffirmed in 2003 by

commenced business. First Alternative 
is designed to meet the insurance needs 
of customers who currently fall outside of
esure’s target customer segments. Cover
offered by First Alternative will be made
available to Halifax and Sainsbury’s Bank
customers in addition to being offered 
under its own brand directly by telephone
and internet.

The increase in reported profits for the
Investment Business is primarily the result of
significantly smaller negative short-term
fluctuations in investment returns in 2003
compared to 2002 – the direct consequence
of the recovery in the stock market during
2003. Despite this stock market recovery,
however, short-term fluctuations in 2003
were negative overall, being adversely
affected by the impact of increased gilt yields
on shareholder funds. 
Profit for the Investment Business based on
long-term assumptions, i.e. after eliminating
the effect of short-term fluctuations in
investment returns and changes to economic
assumptions, reduced to £416m (2002 £511m).
This was largely due to lower margins on in-

rose as a result of improvements to pricing,

assumptions. Overall, the contribution fell
relative to last year as a result of revised
assumptions regarding the future mix of
investments in our policyholders funds and 
a strengthening of mortality assumptions for
annuity business.
The embedded value of long-term assurance
business at 31 December 2003 was £3,950m
(2002 £3,544m) of which 43% (2002 51%) was
shareholder funds and the balance was the value
of in-force business. The economic assumptions
used in the calculation of the embedded values
are set out below. The reduction in discount rate
from 8.5% to 8.0% concludes our previously
flagged intention to move progressively towards
more active economic assumptions.

Modiﬁed Statutory Solvency Basis
Profits calculated using the modified 
statutory solvency basis (“MSSB”) use the same
long-term assumptions as required to assess
regulatory solvency but with certain
prescribed accounting adjustments, e.g. the
deferral of acquisition expenses. Because of
the conservative nature of these regulatory
solvency requirements, new business is
normally reported as a loss in the year of sale.
This depresses the MSSB result for businesses
enjoying healthy sales and does not reflect
the future value of such new business.
The consolidated MSSB result compared 
to the embedded value reporting basis is set
out in the following table.

Operational Performance
Investment sales increased marginally 
to £1,227m EPI in 2003, underlining the
resilience of the HBOS multi-brand/
multi-channel strategy in an otherwise
shrinking investment market. Total UK
investment sales grew by 5% to £1,150m EPI.
Based on the new business figures reported
by the ABI, HBOS has again increased market
share and made further progress towards our
aim of becoming number one in the UK
investment market.
Bancassurance
Sales of investment business distributed via
our Bancassurance channel (Halifax and Bank
of Scotland retail branches and the Bank of
Scotland Investment Service) increased 
by 21% to £612m EPI. This growth re-
confirms our position as the UK’s leading
bancassurer, underlining the success of our
customer champion strategy which offers
simple, transparent, value for money products
suited to our customers’ needs. 
Intermediary
Clerical Medical’s strong intermediary franchise
underpinned a resilient performance in the UK
and despite a fall in sales by 10% to £389m EPI,
our share of the UK intermediary channel has
increased once again in the face of a steeper
decline in the overall market. In the past two
years, Clerical Medical has successfully moved
away from with profits business towards less
capital intensive products. In 2003, with profits
business accounted for only 8% of UK
intermediary sales in contrast to the same
period two years ago when the percentage was
49%. As a consequence of these actions, new
business profitability for the channel once
again improved. The free asset ratio of Clerical
Medical as at 31 December 2003 was estimated
to be 7.5% (31 December 2002 7.2%), excluding
implicit items and before deduction of the
required minimum solvency margin.
Sales outside the UK, down 40%, have been
significantly affected by economic downturns
in the major markets in which we operate,
Germany and Hong Kong being the most

significant. Whilst non-UK intermediary sales
represent only 16% of the overall intermediary
channel, the decline nonetheless contributed
to a 17% overall fall in intermediary sales to
£466m EPI.
Wealth Management
Sales at St. James’s Place Capital (“SJPC”) 
were 3% lower at £149m EPI for the year as 
a whole with the last quarter of 2003
showing very positive signs of a return in 
the confidence of higher net worth investors
with sales up 24% on the same period in
2002. Funds under management increased
34% to £8bn at 31 December 2003.
Overall Partner numbers increased in 2003 
by 23 to 1,124, a 50% increase in new recruits
being balanced partially by the forecast
reduction in the number of lower producing
Partners. Nearly half of the new recruits came
from the IFA market, confirmation that SJPC 
is seen as one of the winners from the
forthcoming changes to polarisation. 
To underline this point, fees from additional
wealth management services increased 
to £21m.
Asset Management 
Insight Investment’s funds under management
increased by 23% to £70bn, the acquisition of
Rothschild Asset Management in January 2003
contributing £9bn to this total. The successful
integration of the two businesses is expected
to deliver cost savings of 27% of the
combined expense base and has accelerated
Insight’s positioning as a major player in the
institutional fixed income market and one of
the UK’s leading fund-of-funds providers. 70%
of Insight’s revenue now comes from clients
outside the HBOS Group.
Total Group assets under management,
including assets managed by SJPC, were 
£78bn at 31 December 2003 (31 December
2002 £64bn).
Prospects
Low cost distribution, efficient
manufacturing and simple, transparent
products are the major strategic advantages
enjoyed by the HBOS Insurance and
Investment businesses. 
In our Insurance business, the prospects for
growth, linked as it is to our core banking
businesses, remain strong. These prospects
are likely to be further advanced by the
introduction of insurance regulations in late
2004 which will favour the larger, lower
cost distributors. The move to underwrite
household insurance in-house has helped
secure the long-term benefits of our
current operating model. The anticipated
move of esure into profitability in 2004 is
also a demonstration of the power of
access to distribution and scale.
In our Investment business, the much
anticipated but delayed reforms being driven
by the Treasury are expected to favour those
bancassurers that are able to provide capital
efficient, simple products through low cost
distribution to the mass market. At the same
time, against the background of further
consolidation in the UK intermediary market,
the repositioning of Clerical Medical’s
proposition in recent years provides the
platform for it to be one of only a few
winners in that sector in the future. The
significant restructuring of our intermediary
and bancassurance operations, which is
expected to be completed by early 2005,
will enhance our ability to create
shareholder value from these growth
opportunities.
More broadly, we expect SJPC to be a
winner in 2004 as evidenced by the recent
upturn in sales in response to the returning
confidence of high net worth investors and
as the beneficial effect of de-polarisation
bites. Similarly, the fortunes of Insight
Investment are linked in the near term to
the market recovery but increasingly its
reputation for fixed income management
will provide the opportunity for
differentiation in the market.

The growth in business levels throughout

– one year ahead of schedule. The significant
increase in customer numbers has delivered
strong growth in both lending and deposit
balances following a period of focused

Operating income has grown by a healthy
16% to £1,401m (2002 £1,204m) driven by
strong growth in both interest and non-
interest income. Net interest income has
increased by 18% and non-interest income
has increased by 15% with all parts of the
Division contributing to the growth.
Operating expenses excluding operating lease
depreciation increased by 11% as 2003 saw
the fulfilment of our recruitment drive. This,
combined with the growth in income saw the
cost:income ratio improve to 53.0% from
55.7% in 2002.
The net interest margin contracted from
2.95% to 2.65% over the year, mainly due to a
change in the business mix and reduced
capital earnings.

Assisted by dedicated deposit taking teams
across the Division and a competitive suite of
products, deposits grew by an exceptionally
strong 40% to £17.2bn compared to £12.3bn
at the end of 2002.
Loans and advances have also grown
significantly in the year as our customer 
base increased, benefiting in particular from
the strategic expansion into England and
Wales. We now have almost £31bn of loans
and advances to customers, which is 32%
ahead of 2002. Correspondingly, risk weighted
assets have grown by 31% to £35.1bn (2002
£26.7bn). The growth in Construction and
Property exposure over the year reflects our
drive into the business community. The
portfolio remains largely investment related,
supported by good quality covenants with the
limited development element normally
mitigated through pre-sale and pre-letting
conditionality. The sector has continued to
perform well, exposure is well spread
geographically and numerically and there 
is no evidence of stress.

Strong growth in assets and a solid credit
performance meant that the bad debt charge
improved to 0.49% of average advances from
0.70% at the end of 2002, whilst provisions
also improved to 1.21% of closing advances
and non performing assets fell to 1.97% of
closing advances, both measures improving
significantly on the previous year (1.48% and
2.21% respectively).
Business Performance
During 2003, Business Banking generated
significant growth and recorded meaningful
market share gains to build on the investment
of the previous year, with business customer
numbers in the UK increasing 28% to over
350,000 (2002 273,000). We have now
achieved our target UK SME market share of
6% – a year ahead of target.
In the UK, our Field New Business Hunters,
who identify and generate new business
opportunities, have delivered particularly
impressive growth on both sides of the
balance sheet with assets growing 33% and
deposits growing 40%. The Field Relationship
Management team, who provide a value
added bespoke relationship service to
customers, have achieved significant cross-
sell and organic growth from their portfolios.
The Direct Business Bank, which is dedicated
to serving small business customers, has
continued to grow with almost 35,000 new
customers in the year. Increasing numbers of
new customers are supported by the “Easy to
Join” process, which facilitates the transition of
the customer’s principal account to the bank,
and therefore strengthens the long-term quality
of the relationship and the cross-sale potential.
Across the division, other key UK business
areas have delivered impressive results: 
• In a very competitive market, our Motor
Finance area has seen an increase in assets
with new business up 11% on the previous
year, albeit at tighter margins. RFS, our long-
standing joint venture with Renault, has had
a record-breaking year with a very strong
performance. The number of agreements
has grown 11% and passed the 100,000 mark
during the year.
• Our Specialist Finance team, which provides
financing for larger property, fleet and
public sector relationships, as well as a
variety of specialist financial products, has
delivered new business of £3.4bn in 2003
with an encouraging favourable margin
variance during the year. 
• The Asset Finance business has contributed
almost £1.5bn of new business in 2003, whilst
developing the contribution to cross-selling
opportunities throughout the division. 
• The contribution from our Vehicle
Management Operations (including Lex
Vehicle Leasing) increased by 116% in the
year, helped by a robust outcome for residual
values. Fleet size overall is now almost
187,000, a 10% increase on the 2002 fleet size
of around 170,000. 
• Hill Hire, our heavy vehicle management
arm, has achieved record results of £10.8m
profit before tax (2002 £8.9m). The contract
hire base has grown considerably with a
46% increase year on year. 
Our overseas operations have delivered a
record profit performance, which represents
28% of the Divisional profit before tax, with
strong growth in activity levels. Capital
Finance Australia produced record year end
receivables of A$5.1bn in 2003, an increase of
21% over 2002, with the three business
divisions, Property, Motor and Business
Equipment all contributing. Bank of Scotland
(Ireland) now has over 19% share of the SME
market in Ireland and has seen significant
growth on both sides of the balance sheet,
including a 34% increase in deposits of
c1.2bn. This has been combined with a
reduction in the cost:income ratio to an
impressive 34%, and a further fall in
provisioning levels. Our approach in Ireland 
of challenging the existing providers of
financial services has proven very successful,
with a number of new product initiatives
delivered, including Ireland’s first interest
bearing business current account. More
initiatives are planned.
For the second year running, we were
awarded both the UK “Business Bank of 
the Year” and UK “Online Banking Provider 
of the Year” by the National Association of
Commercial Finance Brokers, and for the first
time, won “Commercial Mortgage Provider 
of the Year” . Challenging the face of business
banking remains at the heart of our approach
and 2003 saw further new product
innovations such as our Smartfinance
commercial offset mortgage.
We are committed to providing a wide range
of options for supporting new businesses 
and are now the second largest lender under
the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme. 
We are also active in a number of equity and
growth funds.
Customer service was significantly
strengthened during the year when 47
Business Centres were created throughout
Scotland and 175 Business Managers were
recruited during 2003, making professionally
qualified staff available throughout local
business communities.
We are comfortably ahead of target on
delivery of merger synergies and have
continued to work on the ongoing integration
of IT systems to the extent that both business
and retail customers can now be serviced
through all of our delivery channels. 
Prospects
During 2004, our business banking activities
will be restructured to more closely support
the needs of our small and medium-sized
customers. The provision of products and
services to smaller businesses will be
integrated with Retail Divisional activities,
within a more focused “Bank of Scotland
Business Banking” brand. Support for medium-
sized and larger business customers will be
managed by experienced teams as part 
of an expanded Corporate Banking offering.
The overseas activities will become part 
of the newly created International 
Operations Division.

A 19% increase in net interest income and an
even stronger 26% increase in non-interest
income saw our total operating income rising
by 21% to £1,435m. Our focus on added value
growth aligned to sound credit quality,
backed up by increased sell-down activity 
has resulted in a planned moderation in asset
growth. However, this policy of controlled
growth does not inhibit our continuing ability
to attract high quality new transactions and
our willingness to support existing customers
as they expand and diversify. We have an
enviable reputation for working closely with
our customers to provide tailored, added
value solutions to meet their financing needs,
often with innovative, leading edge product
design all supported by high quality delivery.
We continue to combine true relationship
banking with transactional excellence.
A further increase in net interest spread was
achieved, up 2bps from last year, although the
overall net margin fell by 6bps, due to a
reduction in net earnings on capital.

Non-interest income again increased strongly,
up 26% to £560m. Growth in net fees and
commissions, which rose by 15% to £409m,
was well spread across all areas of our
business, while investment gains were up 83%
to £42m, an extremely encouraging outcome
against a difficult exit environment. Operating
lease rental income also increased, up by 68%
to £94m, reflecting the continued expansion
of our successful asset finance activities.
The cost:income ratio was broadly stable at
16.1% (2002 15.5%). Cost efficiency is and will
remain a cornerstone of our Operating
Philosophy and we will continue to invest in
our people and infrastructure as we build for
the future.
Whilst we cannot be completely immune
from the pressures being faced by certain
sectors of the economy, our overall
provisioning experience was very satisfactory
given the challenging economic environment
throughout the year. Some strain was evident
in certain parts of our manufacturing book
and across elements of our power portfolio
but encouragingly the split capital investment
trust sector and the telecoms sector both
showed distinct improvement.
The total charge for bad and doubtful debts
in 2003 was £338m, equivalent to 0.70% of
average advances. This was a reduction from
the ratio recorded in 2002, underpinning 
our belief that the worst of the current
provisioning cycle may now be behind us.
Non-performing assets were £838m, a
reduction of £68m from the position at the
end of June 2003. Expressed as a percentage
of closing advances, this represents 1.65%
which is an increase over the 2002 closing
position but, encouragingly, down
significantly from the 1.81% at the end of
June 2003. Balance sheet provisions as a
percentage of advances decreased to 1.00%
compared to 1.01% at the end of 2002. 
As planned, our lending growth continued to
slow. Total loans and advances to customers
increased by 11% to £50.7bn whilst risk
weighted assets increased by 10% to £58.6bn.
The vast majority of this growth came in
asset backed sectors that are very well known
to us and where we have a wealth of
experience. We also continued to syndicate
participations in larger transactions.
Since the merger, our higher profile and
increased balance sheet strength have
resulted in an ever increasing number of
lending opportunities. However, we do not
seek growth for growth’s sake and any
transactions must meet our demanding risk
and return requirements. Our business is
based on our ability to identify, understand,
accept and manage risk effectively and we
continue to decline a large number of
transactions that do not meet our lending HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 27
criteria. On the other hand, we are not and
never will be simply a fair-weather lender. 
We have always been of the view that there 
is quality business to be transacted even in
more difficult times and our business
continues to benefit significantly from this
“can do” approach.
Our largest overall concentration continues
to be property which represents around one
third of our total lending. Approximately half
of this exposure is to the property investment
sector where our facilities are supported by
robust rental streams from a wide range of
acceptable covenants. Our next largest sub-
sector is residential backed lending including
lending to Housing Associations. Our
development exposure is largely supported
by pre-sales, pre-lets or acceptable additional
security. Our office-related development
exposure in Greater London continues to be
safe and well secured.
Customer deposits continued to grow
strongly and significantly faster than
advances, increasing by 43% to £20.2bn. This
was as a consequence of a specific focus on
this area, assisted by the introduction of
attractive and innovative products. As a result
our self-funding ratio now stands at 40%
(2002 31%). Continued growth in such
deposits remains a key focus for the Division. 
Operational Commentary
Key Markets
Operating from 22 offices in the UK and 13
overseas, the markets in which Corporate
Banking operates are large and diverse and
have the potential to deliver sustainable
profitable growth for many years to come.
We provide a comprehensive and growing
range of products and services,
predominantly to mid-market corporates,
principally in the United Kingdom, but
increasingly we are extending our core
competencies to appropriate overseas markets.
Internationally, we concentrate on niche areas
where we have proven skills and a competitive
edge, often seeking to partner with local
banks. Our franchise now includes profitable
activities in Europe, North America and
Australia. To supplement our continental
European representation, in October 2003 we
opened an office in Antwerp, which operates
as a satellite to our Amsterdam office. In
North America, a recent initiative has been
selective partnering with regional US banks on
their larger customer transactions. This is a
non-threatening, mutually beneficial approach
to a real problem faced by these institutions as
they attempt to compete with the larger
indigenous banks.
We continue to lead the market in many
areas. Our Structured Finance, Integrated
Finance and Joint Venture offerings, often
incorporating a “one stop” mix of mezzanine
and equity in addition to traditional senior
debt and working capital, continue to attract
significant new volumes of business whilst at
the same time optimising our return on
capital. In the public/private partnership
arena, we continue to work closely with the
public sector in the provision of social and
economic infrastructure. We also continue to
build selectively our Project and Asset
Finance activities, moving up the value chain
when suitable opportunities arise. 
We established a Client Acquisition and
Development team to drive a focused client
acquisition programme and in conjunction
with Treasury Division, we have developed
Capital Markets capability to support our key
product offerings in the leverage and
specialist finance markets and to further
improve our overall client offering.
Customer Service
We continue to challenge, consolidate and
redesign our back office operations to
improve customer service, increase cross-
sales and drive down costs. Central to this is
the ongoing rollout and development of best
of breed systems solutions. As well as the
ongoing migration of accounts to “Core
Banking” , our new real time relationship
banking system, 2003 saw the successful
delivery of our new state of the art internet
enabled on-line banking platform – iCHOBS.

mix of the division’s credit exposure:

Country Exposure
United Kingdom 82
USA 7
Mainland Europe 7
Australia 3
Rest of the world 1

This business mix is little changed from the
position at 31 December 2002. Our key focus
remains on areas of the world that enjoy a
stable political, economic and legal
environment. We do not enter unfamiliar
geographic areas with untested products.
Prospects
Our reputation as a strong, well focused
corporate lender is excellent and is
underpinned by highly talented, experienced
and committed colleagues. Our work in
progress levels remain strong, providing
confidence in our earnings progression. We
do not expect corporate credit conditions to
deteriorate and we are confident in the
outlook for 2004.

Overall Treasury performance was robust with
profit before tax and exceptional items of £239m
(2002 £231m), 3% up on last year. Increased sales
of Treasury products to Corporate Banking and

decline in the net interest margin.

Interest Income
Net interest income was £174m (2002 £200m)
with the fall reflecting margin erosion from a
change in funding maturity and currency mix.
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income increased to £157m up
26% on last year. Our core sales function
contributed strongly to the growth in
revenues with increased sales of Treasury
products to Corporate and Business Banking
customers. The enhancement of the Division’s
customer flow income remains a key strategic
priority and progress continues to extend the
product range, improve our customer
information and develop closer links with our
Group colleagues and their customers. The
majority of dealing profits arose from activity
related to customer sales, but the results
were supported by a strong performance
from non-sales activities. 
Costs
Costs for the period were £92m (2002
£89m), resulting in a stable cost:income
ratio of 27.8% (2002 27.5%). Staff and other
costs rose due to increased resources
required to support new business initiatives
and the associated costs for setting up the
infrastructure. However, these were offset
by reductions in recharged technology
costs following a review of Group
technology spend. 
Asset Quality
We maintain a cautious policy to avoid sub-
investment grade investments, reflected by
the continued high quality of our interbank
and structured investment portfolios, with
99.3% of total assets rated A or above. During
the year no credit provisions were required
(2002 £4m).
Operational Performance
Business Overview
Treasury provides and manages prudential 
and regulatory liquidity and wholesale 
multi-currency funding for the HBOS Group.
Treasury is also responsible for arranging the
Group’s debt capital issuance and asset
securitisation programmes. In addition, a 
range of treasury services is provided to 
SMEs and large corporate customers of the
Business and Corporate Banking Divisions. 
The sales function within Treasury works with
customers to develop risk management
solutions tailored to meet their specific
needs. Sales revenues of Treasury products 
to the HBOS Group and its customers were
up 65% from last year. Our overriding 
focus continues to be on high quality 
business which, in the main, is derived 
from both internal and external customer
flow business.
During the year, responsibility for overseas
treasury activities (excluding BankWest) 
was transferred to HBOS Treasury Services
and we have now established a branch of
HBOS Treasury Services plc in New York. 
This is part of our strategy to diversify our
sources of funding and seek new pools of
investors, by utilising the US market as a 
long-term and reliable source of funding for
the HBOS Group.
We have also expanded our capital market
capabilities and are now able to manage the
origination of own asset backed and third
party transactions, where some form of
securitisation is required, as well as working
closely with our Corporate Banking 
colleagues and their clients to provide capital
market solutions.

Funding
In addition to arranging securitisation issues
and co-ordinating and executing HBOS plc
subordinated debt issues, one of Treasury’s
other key responsibilities is to provide
wholesale funding and liquidity for the
Group. In support of this role Treasury further
diversified the range and sources of funding
during 2003. The Group maintains a number
of funding programmes. In April the US and
Euro Medium Term Note (“MTN”) Programmes
were increased in size from a combined
US$40bn to US$65bn in order to meet the
continuing growth in the Group’s wholesale
funding. The Group also operates a US$15bn
US Commercial Paper (“CP”) Programme and
Euro CP and Certificate of Deposit
Programmes of c15bn and C$4bn. The C$4bn
programme was increased from C$2bn in
December 2003. In December a c5bn French
Domestic CP Programme was established. All
four CP Programmes operate in the name of
HBOS Treasury Services plc.
In July 2003, HBOS successfully launched 
and priced the first UK Covered Bond. The
Covered Bond was issued by HBOS Treasury
Services plc, secured over a pool of
mortgages originated by Halifax plc. The 
issue of c3bn with a maturity of 7 years 
was well received by investors, notably from
continental Europe, thereby achieving our 
aim of funding diversification and spreading
our liabilities. In October 2003, a second
Covered Bond was issued for c2bn with a 
10 year maturity. 
Further diversification of funding was satisfied
by issues of CHF500m 2% Fixed Rate Notes
due 2008, US$750m 3.75% Guaranteed 
Senior Notes due 2008, US$1.5bn Floating
Rate Notes due 2005 and JPY50bn 0.8% 
Fixed Rate Notes due 2008. 
Prospects
With integration successfully completed
more effort can be channelled towards
meeting the business needs of the Group’s
banking divisions and their customers. The
programme in the coming year aims to
develop further our Sales business to secure
and improve on the current year’s
performance whilst maintaining asset quality.
Our position within the Group and increased
sales penetration means that we can continue
to benefit from the growth potential of
Group businesses and their customers.

** Including income representing the fully tax equivalent
gross up of A$9m (December 2002 A$11m).
*** Before securitisation.
Total operating income increased by 15%
against the previous year. Strong volume
growth and an increase in net interest margin
from 2.07% to 2.13% as a result of a flat to
negative yield curve resulted in a 15%
increase in net interest income. 
Non-interest income, which increased 
by 14%, was positively impacted by a first
half fee review of many consumer and
business products. This increase was offset 
by a small reduction in ATM and credit card
interchange fees.
Operating expenses increased by 10%
compared with the previous year. This
included increases in personnel expenses
reflecting inflationary increases and A$11m 
of redundancy costs. These costs resulted
from the reduction of about 160 full-time
equivalent staff in management and sales
support areas following the implementation
of a number of efficiency and cost control
initiatives. In addition, other expenses
increased with A$10m of non-deductible
costs incurred in relation to the HBOS
acquisition of the minority interests in
BankWest. These costs impacted the
cost:income ratio of 58.2%. Although this 
was an improvement on the 60.7% in 2002,
the figure would have been 56.9% if the 
costs relating to the HBOS acquisition 
were excluded.
The combined charge for specific and general
provisions was A$42m. The charge to the
general provision was greater than that of the
previous year as no securitisation issue was
completed in 2003. Net non-performing
assets as a percentage of total lending to
customers including non-returnable finance
were 0.4% (2002 0.8%). 
Consistent with previous years the mortgage
book continued to grow strongly, increasing
by 21% to A$12.5bn since December 2002.
The business book increased by 9% to
A$9.8bn over the year. This growth was
boosted by the purchase of Australian
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s subsidiary 
API Finance Ltd and its A$304m loan and
lease book in April 2003. The business book
accounts for 42% of the total loan book
(2002 44%), and the mortgage book accounts
for 54% (2002 50%). 
Interstate lending as a proportion of total
lending increased to 48.8% (2002 45.8%).
National market share was 3.6% as at
December 2003 (December 2002 3.5%).
Operational Performance
During the year BankWest made good
progress with its strategies aimed at
extracting more value from its strong
position in the West Australian market, 
while expanding nationally in niche markets.
At the beginning of the year, the Bank
undertook a major review of its operations,
which resulted in the implementation of 
a number of efficiency and cost control
initiatives. The measures support the Bank’s
performance improvement and growth
strategies, and respond to longer-term
changes in the competitive environment.
These initiatives began to have an impact in
the second half of the year. Within Western
Australia (“WA”), the Bank continued its
network transformation programme,
increasing the number of Neighbourhood
Banks to 26 and refurbishing a number of
branches, providing more face-to-face
banking locations in direct response to
customer demand for this type of service. 
The Bank’s strategic focus on extracting 
more value from the WA franchise was

to customers
up 12% to

Dan Scott, BankWest 34 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
BankWest continued
reflected in success in credit cards, deposits
and home loans. The credit card book grew
22%, reaching A$300m for the first time in
December 2003. This was largely as a result 
of the introduction of the MasterCard Lite
low interest credit card in 2002, which
resulted in the Bank capturing an increased
share of the cards market.
As a result of the success of MasterCard Lite,
the Bank launched the new BankWest Lite
Home Loan, a special low variable interest
rate product with no monthly fees. This was
well received by consumers and already
represents 9% of the home loan book.
Customer deposits grew by 13% to A$11.8bn
as a consequence of more competitive
pricing and continued growth in third party
deposits through brokers. The Bank’s self-
funding ratio was 50.6% (2002 51.0%).
In the second half of 2003 the Bank
progressed the rollout of a PC based 
Teller system providing both productivity
improvements and enhanced capabilities 
to support the Bank’s Retail operating model.
The Business Bank performed strongly with
continued growth reflecting the success of
the industry specialisation programme and
East Coast growth strategies, profitability
enhancement initiatives through fee and
pricing reviews and strict cost containment. 
The Structured and Property area continued
to leverage off its strong relationship with key
intermediaries providing specialised funding in
the small to mid-structured facilities market.
The Small Business initiative continued
impressive interstate penetration with strong
growth in new customers and high levels of
customer satisfaction, under its “Champion of
Small Business” proposition based on product
innovation and superior service. 
Throughout the year the business also
completed a number of systems reviews and
projects to prepare itself for the introduction
of Financial Services Reform Act and the
revised Code of Banking Practice. 
Financial Markets finalised the installation of
new technology, which provides greater
processing efficiencies with significantly
enhanced risk management capabilities.
Prospects 
Plans were announced in January 2004 that
HBOS’s Australian operations, which included
BankWest, will be brought closer together
under the one umbrella of HBOS Australia.
The new group, which will be put in place
progressively during 2004 will refocus HBOS’s
four Australian operations, BankWest, Capital
Finance, St. Andrew’s Insurance and BOSIAL,
to provide an integrated platform for future
growth and expansion. 
BankWest is well positioned to derive
maximum benefit from 100% ownership by
HBOS plc. The funding advantage provided by
full HBOS ownership will enable more
competitive product pricing and leveraging
HBOS back-office processes will deliver
improved efficiencies. 
The Bank’s national growth strategies are
positioned to take advantage of the strength
in the Australian economy, which rebounded
after a soft start to 2003. Consumption has
picked up, the unemployment rate has fallen
to a 13-year low of less than 6% and business
investment has consolidated at high levels.
The strength in the domestic economy and
the strength of the housing market triggered
two 25bps increases in the cash rate in late
2003. Further modest tightening of monetary
policy is expected to constrain housing
construction in 2004, but as the rural sector
recovers from drought, less robust housing
activity is expected to be offset by a
turnaround in net exports. 
During 2004 BankWest will continue to make
progress in its national growth strategies with
the implementation of new initiatives, while
continuing to build on existing projects.
National expansion across all business lines
will continue with a particular emphasis on
the commercial and small business sectors. A
number of initiatives will also be progressed
to increase the number and value of deposits
held by the Business Bank.
The Retail Bank will concentrate on
continuing the significant momentum
created by the Lite home loan and credit
card products, ensuring their long-term
viability by improving back-office support
efficiencies. In parallel to this momentum, 
a concerted push will be made to grow
deposit balances significantly.

Group profit before tax and exceptional 
items at £3,885m is 27% higher than a year
ago. Strong, asset led growth in net interest
earnings, with non-interest income 26%
higher than a year ago and underlying
operating expenses growth of 9% produced
excellent results. 
Basic earnings per share increased by 26% to
63.6p (2002 50.6p). Underlying earnings per
share (before exceptional items and 
goodwill amortisation) rose 22% to 68.5p
(2002 56.1p) and the proposed final dividend
is 20.6p, which is 5% higher than the previous
financial year. The basic dividend cover is 2.1
times and 2.2 times on an underlying basis, 
up from 1.7 times and 1.9 times respectively
in 2002. Our stated policy is to increase
underlying dividend cover progressively 
to 2.5 times. If approved at the Annual
General Meeting, the final dividend will be
paid on 21 May 2004 to shareholders on the
register on 12 March 2004.
Ordinary shareholders are again being offered
the choice of electing under the Share
Dividend Plan to receive the whole of their 
final dividend in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2003 in new ordinary shares
credited as fully paid instead of cash. 
A circular containing details of the Plan, key
dates in respect of the new shares to be
allotted to shareholders who elect to join 
the Plan and the relevant mandate form will
be sent to shareholders during March and 
April 2004.
Group Post Tax Return on Mean Equity
Group post tax return on mean equity (“RoE”)
increased from 15.9% for the year ended 
31 December 2002 to 17.7%. Group post tax
return on mean equity is calculated by
dividing profit attributable to ordinary
shareholders before exceptional items 
by the monthly average of equity
shareholders’ funds. Previously, mean equity
shareholders’ funds were calculated on 
the basis of the simple average of equity
shareholders’ funds (i.e. opening plus 
closing equity shareholders’ funds divided 
by 2) which is a less precise calculation of
average equity employed by the Group. 
2002 figures are presented on this new basis. HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 37
Group Net Interest Income
Group net interest income, increased by
£689m to £5,459m. The growth in net 
interest income primarily reflects strong 
asset growth partly offset by a modest
decline in Group margins.

ﬁnance. Trading assets within treasury operations are excluded
from the net interest margin calculation.
The decline in the Group net interest margin
is mainly attributable to increased funding
costs, including securitisations, and lower
earnings on capital. 
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income increased by 26% to
£3,487m led by our investment business
which benefited from a significant reduction
in negative short-term fluctuations in
investment returns compared to 2002. Strong
growth was also achieved across our banking
businesses and, in particular, in Corporate
Banking and Treasury.

variances include an additional pension
charge of £62m in respect of the Halifax
Retirement Fund reflecting the impact of the
triennial valuation of the Fund on the profit
and loss charge from 31 March 2003, the
effective date of the valuation. In addition,
the stronger Australian Dollar accounted for
£30m growth in BankWest expenses when
converted into Sterling.
The increase in goodwill amortisation is
mainly attributable to the acquisition of the
minority interest in BankWest which
completed in September 2003 and the
acquisitions of Rothschild Asset Management
in January 2003 and Transnational Financial
Services Ltd in April 2003.

accommodation and other shared services
such as cheque clearing, mailing etc. The costs
of technology, accommodation and other
shared services (other than those borne
directly by Group Functions) are subsequently
recharged to divisions according to their usage
and are shown under the operating expense
analysis for each division. The net cost of
Group Items increased by £35m, including an
£11m increase in goodwill amortisation.

As part of our continuous cost management
programme we have reviewed the
management and classification of direct and
recharged costs, which has resulted in some
changes in the classification of direct and
recharged costs but has no material impact
on overall costs incurred by divisions. Due to
the nature of such changes it is not possible
to restate the comparative analyses for
previous periods.
Share Based Compensation
The Group believes that share ownership by
colleagues throughout the Group enhances
the alignment of their interests with those of
shareholders. Accordingly, the Group
operates certain share option plans, including
Inland Revenue approved and unapproved
share option plans and save-as-you-earn
plans. In addition to the share option plans,
share grants are provided to colleagues. These
include incentive plans, which require certain
performance criteria to be met over a three
year period before any shares are released,
and the “Sharekicker” facility. The Sharekicker  38 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
Financial Review and Risk Management continued
facility enables colleagues who have elected
to take their annual incentive in shares rather
than cash to enhance by 50% the number 
of shares, if the shares are held for at least
three years. 
Under existing UK GAAP the cost of shares 
to be released under the share grants is
recognised as an expense in the profit and
loss account over the three year period of
these schemes. The total expense recorded in
2003 in respect of such schemes was £42m
(2002 £24m).
In respect of share option plans, existing 
UK GAAP only requires an expense to be
recorded where the exercise price is set at a
discount to the market price at the date the
share option is granted. The save-as-you-earn
plans are the only plans where such a
discount is provided and the Group relies on
the exemption under UITF Abstract 17.
Accordingly no cost has been recognised in
the profit and loss account in respect of the
share option plans. 
In November 2002, the Accounting Standards
Board issued FRED 31 “Share Based Payments” .
The principles set out in this exposure draft
require the fair value of the share option
granted to be recorded as an expense. It is
estimated that the adoption of FRED 31
would result in a total charge to the profit
and loss account (inclusive of the amount
under existing UK GAAP) in 2003 of £100m
(2002 £72m).
Pension Costs
Under SSAP 24, £156m has been charged in
respect of pension costs (2002 £93m). This
charge increased in 2003 following the
triennial valuation of the Halifax Retirement 
Fund at 31 March 2003 reflecting, inter alia,
deterioration in stock market conditions.
Under the transitional arrangement of FRS 17,
the Group continues to account for
retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP 24.
Had FRS 17 been implemented in 2003, the
charge in respect of retirement benefits
would have been £180m and the deficit on all
Group schemes would have been £1,496m
(2002 £1,136m). Taking into account the
deferred tax asset, the net pension liability
for all schemes is £1,047m (2002 £795m).

of £119m associated and necessary in
achieving the synergies and benefits were
charged in 2003. £153m was charged in 2002,
£132m in 2001 and in total, by end 2004, we
expect to have incurred costs of £450m. 
International Accounting Standards
For accounting years commencing on 
1 January 2005, the Group will be required 
to report its results under International
Accounting Standards (“IAS”). The Group 
has made substantial progress towards
implementing the changes required 
to convert to IAS, despite the additional
pressure caused by the delay in publishing
certain standards, notably the final text of 
IAS 39. 
New Divisional Structure
Following an internal reorganisation of
responsibilities, for the financial year
commencing 1 January 2004 the Group 
will report through four divisions, Retail,
Insurance & Investment, Corporate and
International Operations. HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 39
Loans and advances to customers increased by
18% to £283.5bn. During the year £11.5bn of
loans were securitised. Within Retail Banking,
loans and advances increased by 17%.
Corporate advances grew 11%, and Business
Banking by 32%. Customer deposits grew
£23.3bn (16%) to £173.5bn and wholesale
funding by £14.2bn (11%) to £140.6bn.

The issue of US$1,000m of innovative Tier 1
securities in March 2003 raised a further £641m
of Tier 1 capital. In addition, £331m of Tier 1
capital was generated as a consequence of
certain shareholders electing to receive their
2002 final dividend and 2003 interim dividend
in the form of shares under the Share Dividend
Plan in May and October. Tier 1 capital was
further strengthened by internally generated
capital from retained profits offset by
additional goodwill and reduction in minority
interest mainly arising from the acquisition of
the minority interest in BankWest.
Tier 2 capital was increased during the year by
undated subordinated debt issues of £600m in
April 2003, c750m and US$1,000m in October
2003 and dated subordinated debt issues of

October 2003. In sterling equivalent terms,
these new issues totalled £3.7bn. 
Mortgage loans securitised during the year
were £4.8bn in March 2003, £2.2bn in June
2003 and £4.5bn in November 2003. These
securitised loans are not included within risk
weighted assets.
Supervisory deductions mainly reflect
investments in subsidiary undertakings that are
not within the banking group for regulatory
purposes. Deductions are made for the
investments in Clerical Medical, St. James’s Place
Capital and St. Andrew’s Group. Total
deductions increased from £4,064m to £5,100m,
mainly as a result of the Group injecting £500m
into Clerical Medical, £128m into St. Andrew’s
Insurance plc, £75m into First Alternative
Holdings Ltd and increases of £399m in the
embedded value of life policies held.
The free asset ratio of Clerical Medical as at
31 December 2003 was estimated to be 7.5%
(2002 7.2%) excluding implicit items and
before deduction of the required minimum
solvency margin.

Financial Review and Risk Management continued
The Group continues to monitor government
developments and remains actively involved
in discussions within the Banking industry 
and other sectors of the economy to help
assess the implications for the Group and 
its customers.
The Group’s Operating Controls
This section reviews the Group’s approach 
to risk management by describing:
• general principles for internal control and
operating practices;
• the governance structure for the 
Group’s controls;
• the Group Risk functions which oversee 
risk management activities; and
• the major types of risks to which the 
Group is subject.
Internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for the
Group’s system of internal control and for
reviewing its effectiveness. This system has
been in place throughout the period to the
date of approval of the Report and Accounts,
with refinements where needed during the
period to meet changing business needs. It is
regularly reviewed by the Board and accords
with the Turnbull guidance on internal control.
In addition the Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the system of internal control
specifically for the purposes of this statement.
The system of internal control is designed
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives, and can
provide only reasonable – and not absolute –
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The system provides for a documented and
auditable trail of accountability and applies
across the Group’s operations. It covers
strategic, financial, regulatory and operational
risks and provides for assurances to
successive levels of management and,
ultimately, to the Board.
Operating Principles and Practices
The Group seeks to maintain high standards of
business conduct across all of its operations.
The risk appetite of the Group is set by the
Board. The strategy for managing risk is
formulated by the senior management and
recommended to the Board for approval. The
Group Management Board also reviews the
effectiveness of the risk management systems
through reports from management and from
the Group risk committees. Management has
the prime responsibility for identifying and
evaluating significant risks to the business and
for designing and operating suitable controls.
Internal and external risks are regularly
assessed, including control breakdowns,
disruption of information systems,
competition and regulatory requirements.
The assessment process is consistent across
the divisions and Group Functions and uses
an iterative challenge process to provide
successive assurances to ascending levels of
management up to the Board.
In judging the effectiveness of the Group’s
controls, the Board reviews the reports of 
the Audit Committee and management. It 
also considers key performance indicators 
and reviews monthly financial and business
performance showing variances against budgets.
Group Level Control
The Group committee structure considers
risks and risk management from the Group’s
perspective and is supported by the Group
Risk functions which are described under
“Group Risk Functions” below, namely Group
Financial Risk (“GFR”), Group Operational Risk
(“GOR”) and Group Regulatory Risk (“GRR”).
Together they provide central oversight by
reviewing and challenging the work of the
business divisions’ own risk committees and
by providing functional leadership in the
development and implementation of risk
management techniques.
Audit Committee
The full responsibilities of the Audit
Committee are described in the Corporate
Governance Statement on page 53. This
section describes the Committee’s role in the
monitoring of risk.
Without diminishing its own accountability,
the Board has delegated certain
responsibilities to the Audit Committee
including ensuring that there is regular review
of the adequacy and efficiency of the internal
control procedures and that there is a proper
compliance structure throughout the Group.
The Group’s Audit Committee acts as the
audit committee for Bank of Scotland and
Halifax plc and is supported by divisional 
Risk Control Committees and the BankWest
Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee, which meets at least
quarterly, inter alia, reviews management’s
procedures for:
• identifying business risks and controlling
their financial impact;
• preventing or detecting fraud; 
• ensuring compliance with regulatory and
legal requirements; and
• monitoring the operational effectiveness of
policies and systems.
The Audit Committee, which summarises 
its findings to the Board, obtains assurance
about the internal control and risk
management environment through regular
reports from GFR, GOR and GRR and
consideration of external auditors’ reports
and review of the minutes and work of
divisional Risk Control Committees.
The Divisional Risk Control Committees
(which are described under “Divisional Level
Controls” below) and the BankWest Audit
Committee operate under delegated
authority from the Audit Committee and the
planning and co-ordination of their activities
is reviewed by the Audit Committee. The
Divisional Risk Control Committees review,
on behalf of the Audit Committee, the
adequacy of the business divisions’ systems of
internal control (including financial,
operational and regulatory risk management).
Group Internal Audit supports the Audit
Committee, Divisional Risk Control
Committees and senior management by
reviewing independently and objectively the
effectiveness of the control and risk
environment. The Head of Group Internal
Audit has direct access to the Chairman of the
Audit Committee and the Chief Executive.
Group Credit Risk Committee
The Group Credit Risk Committee (“GCRC”) is
responsible for assisting the Board to
formulate the Group’s risk appetite, policies
and strategies for managing the credit risk
facing the Group.
It is also responsible for the implementation
and maintenance of the Group’s Credit Risk
Management framework. It is supported 
by GFR, which monitors compliance with
Group policies, standards and limits and
aggregates credit risks to monitor the overall
Group position independently from the
business divisions.
Group Asset and Liability Committee
The Group Asset and Liability Committee
(“GALCO”) is responsible for the
implementation and maintenance of the
overall risk management framework relating to
balance sheet structure, market risks, trading,
funding and liquidity management across the
Group’s banking businesses. It recommends
market risk appetite, policy and guidelines to
the Board. It is supported by GFR, which
monitors compliance with Group policies,
standards and limits and aggregates market
risks to monitor the overall Group position
independently from the business divisions.
Group Insurance and Investment Risk
Committee
The Group Insurance and Investment Risk
Committee (“GIIRC”) is responsible for the
implementation and maintenance of the
overall risk management framework relating to
investment, credit, market and insurance risks,
together with asset and liability management,
within the Insurance & Investment Division of
the Group. It recommends policy and
guidelines to the Board. 
It is supported by GFR, which recommends
with the relevant Group policies, standards
and limits and aggregates certain risks to
monitor the overall Group position. HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 41
Group Operational and Regulatory 
Risk Committee
The Group Operational and Regulatory Risk
Committee (“GORRC”) is responsible for the
overall operational and regulatory risk
management framework across the Group. It
recommends policy and guidelines to the
Board. It is supported by GOR and GRR,
which recommend and monitor compliance
with Group policies and standards.
Group Risk Functions
The Group Chief Financial and Operational
Risk Officer and the Head of Group
Regulatory Risk report directly to the Group
Finance Director and have direct access 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and the Chief Executive. Prior to 1 January
2004 the same senior executive had
responsibility for GOR and GRR.
The Group Risk Functions provide functional
leadership for specialist personnel
throughout the Group’s business areas. They
also provide independent oversight of risk
management activities across the Group to
ensure minimum standards are met and
monitor aggregate risk data at Group-wide
and cross-divisional regulated entity levels.
GFR has three main areas of focus:
•Group Asset and Liability Management
monitors compliance with Group policies,
standards and limits and aggregates market
risks to monitor the overall Group position.
•Group Credit Risk monitors compliance
with Group policies, standards and limits
and aggregates all credit risks to monitor
the overall Group position. In addition,
specified Group Credit Risk colleagues have
the authority to sanction specific
transactions.
•Group Insurance and Investment Risk
monitors compliance with the relevant
Group policies, standards and limits and
aggregates certain risks to monitor the
overall Group position.
GOR monitors compliance with Group
policies and standards on operational risk,
providing operational risk oversight of the
implementation of those policies and
standards. In addition a number of specialist
support functions provide centralised
expertise in operational risk areas such as
information security, fraud, corporate
insurance and business continuity planning.
GRR focuses on supporting the GORRC to
recommend policies and standards on
regulatory risk and control issues for approval
by the Board. It monitors compliance with
those policies and standards and oversees the
Group’s adherence to regulatory requirements
and communications with regulators on a
Group-wide basis, with direct responsibility for
relations with the Financial Services Authority
(FSA), the Group’s principal regulator.
Divisional Level Controls
Divisional Chief Executives have responsibility
for managing strategic, market, credit,
insurance, regulatory and operational issues
affecting their own operations within the
parameters of the Group policies set by the
Board. Divisional Risk Control Committees,
which comprise at least two independent
Non-executive Directors and an Executive
Director independent of that division, provide
objective assurance on the effectiveness of
each division’s internal control and risk
management. These committees meet
regularly to review the risks facing the
relevant division’s business and the
techniques used to identify, assess and
manage them. Each business division also has
its own specialist risk functions, and its own
risk management committee or committees,
which relevant Group Risk personnel attend.
Regulatory Controls
The Group’s business areas are regulated by a
range of authorities including the FSA, the
Group’s principal regulatory authority, and
regulators in overseas jurisdictions in which
the Group operates. 
The Group’s activities are monitored by the
regulators through periodic reviews and
inspections. Skilled persons report to the
regulators if requested. The findings of such
reports would also be considered by the
appropriate divisional Risk Control
Committees, Audit Committees and Boards.
Mapping and Managing Risk
The Group is subject to risks, inherent in
financial services activity. The Group’s
principal activities are the provision of retail,
business and corporate banking, treasury
services, investment management, insurance
and life assurance. It consequently makes
loans to and takes deposits from customers
and wholesale counterparties while the
activities of Insurance & Investment Division
carry investment management and insurance
underwriting risks.
Credit Risk
This is the risk of financial loss from a
customer’s failure to settle financial
obligations as they fall due. GCRC, which 
is chaired by the Group Finance Director, and
is comprised of senior executives, meets
monthly (in general) and reviews the Group’s
lending portfolio to ensure a Group-wide
understanding and control of credit risk. It
also assists the Board in formulating the
Group’s credit risk appetite.
Day to day management of credit risk is
undertaken by specialist credit teams working
within each business area in compliance with
policies approved by the Board. Typical
functions undertaken by these teams include
credit sanctioning, portfolio management and
management of high risk and defaulted
accounts. A specialist support function within
GFR provides centralised expertise in the area
of credit risk measurement and management
techniques. In addition to reporting on the
performance of each divisional portfolio to
GCRC, GFR provides a challenge role in terms
of adherence to laid down standards, policies
and limits.
In Retail Banking Division use is made, where
it is practical to do so, of software
technology in credit scoring new applications.
In addition, where practical, behavioural
scoring is used to provide an assessment of
the conduct of a customer’s accounts in
granting extensions to, and setting limits for,
existing facilities. Collections activity for
credit card and current accounts, and for
personal loans, is centralised for the various
products, and software systems are used to
prioritise action. Mortgage collection is
conducted through a number of payment
collection departments.
Corporate Banking Division typically conduct
a full credit assessment of the financial
strength of each potential transaction and/or
customer, awarding an internal risk rating.
Internal ratings are reviewed regularly. The
same approach is also used for larger SME
(small to medium enterprise) customers.
Small business customers may be rated using
scorecards in a similar manner to retail
customers. 
For HBOS Treasury Services plc (“HBOSTS”), a
subsidiary of Bank of Scotland, policies are
established and reviewed by the Group
Wholesale Credit Committee, a sub-
committee of GCRC. 
An additional measure within the credit risk
framework is the establishment of industrial
sector and country limits. All such limits are
set and monitored by GCRC. The controls
applied to lending assessment processes
consider environmental risk and the potential
impact this may have on the value of the
underlying security.
Target and benchmark standards have been
established across the Group for the
management of credit risk. All divisions are
committed to continuously improving all
facets of credit risk management and there
have been significant levels of investment in
the development of risk rating tools,
including scorecards, better able to
discriminate risk across the portfolio.
Insurance and Investment Risk
Insurance risk is the potential for loss, arising
out of adverse claims and persistency
experience, from both life and general
insurance contracts. Investment risk is the 42 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
Financial Review and Risk Management continued
potential for financial loss arising from the
risks associated with the asset management
activities of the Group. This includes both
those assets which correspond to liabilities 
to policyholders and the free assets
corresponding to liabilities to shareholders. 
It also includes indirect risks associated with
the management of assets held on behalf 
of third parties.
Day to day management of these categories
of risk is undertaken both by line
management and by specialist teams within
the Insurance & Investment Division. Use is
made of the statutory Appointed Actuary
role, both to ensure regulatory compliance 
in respect of the authorised insurance
companies in the Group and to meet Group
control standards. 
GIIRC receives regular reports on specified
aggregate risks across the Division.
Operational Risk
The Group has adopted the industry standard
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
definition of operational risk:
“The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, people and systems
or from external events.” 
The management of operational risk is an
intrinsic part of every business manager’s role.
The Group’s approach is to ensure business
managers identify, assess, prioritise and manage
all substantial risks in a cost effective and
consistent manner. To this end the Group uses
a combination of risk self-assessment, risk
event and key risk indicator analysis, appropriate
insurance cover and contingency arrangements,
together with sound control procedures and
systems. This approach is entirely consistent
with the current requirements under the new
Basel Capital Accord.
Each division and Group function is required
half yearly to compile an operational risk
profile which sets out the internal assessment
of risk and controls against consistent
categories as a form of self certification.
These profiles are presented to the divisional
Risk Control Committees, the Audit
Committee and the Board, and are subject to
independent review by the relevant risk
teams. They are also validated by Group
Internal Audit during the course of their work.
Regulatory Risk
This is the risk that the Group, or any part of
it, fails to meet the requirements or
expectations of regulatory authorities or
supervisors responsible for enforcing
legislation, codes, or regulations governing
the way that the Group’s business activities
are conducted within the UK or elsewhere.
Regulatory risk can also arise where the
Group fails to anticipate and manage
regulatory change adequately.
Day to day management of regulatory risk is
undertaken both by line management and
specialist teams of experts working within
business areas. Reports on regulatory risk
management are made by business areas and
divisions to their Risk Control Committee 
and individual company Audit Committees.
GRR provides a high level assessment to the
Audit Committee.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be
unable to meet financial commitments arising
from cashflows generated by its business
activities. This risk can arise from mismatches
in the timing of cashflows relating to assets,
liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments.
Liquidity policy, including specific limits 
and guidelines, is set by the Board. The
responsibility to direct the management of
liquidity and to report against policy is
delegated to GALCO. Liquidity is managed on
a Group basis. Overseas units may be subject
to specific regulatory requirements, but the
activities in such units are also reflected
within Group policy. 
Policy is reviewed at least annually to ensure
its continued relevance to the Group’s current
and planned operations. Operational liquidity
management is delegated to HBOSTS; GALCO
oversees the controls exercised by HBOSTS. 
The Group uses the FSA’s Sterling Stock
Liquidity approach. The key element of the
FSA’s Sterling Stock Liquidity policy is that a
bank should hold a stock of high quality
Sterling liquid assets that can be sold quickly
and discreetly in order to replace funding
that has been withdrawn due to an actual or
perceived problem with the bank. The
objective is that this stock should enable the
bank to continue business, whilst providing an
opportunity to arrange more permanent
funding solutions.
The FSA have a prescriptive regime for retail
banks that specifies the formula for
determining both the quantum and type of
assets qualifying for Sterling Stock Liquidity.
Sterling Stock Liquidity is regarded as a cost
of doing business. It is not regarded as an
operational liquidity pool as it will always be
required in case of emergency. From an
operational perspective, the Group will place
greater reliance on market access to funding
sources and the retention of a pool of
diversified assets that can be sold in an
efficient and discreet manner.
The Board requires that prudential liquidity
limits should be set by GALCO at both
aggregate levels and for individual currencies
in which the Group has significant wholesale
funding. These limits are established by way of
cashflow mismatch and are quantified over
two time horizons – for sight to eight days
and for sight to one month. 
For the purpose of calculation, marketable
assets are subject to both instrument
concentration limits and prudential discount
factors. An assessment is also made for the
possible outflow from customer deposits and
committed facilities, determined by
prudential behavioural modelling. 
The funding capacity of the Group is
dependent upon factors such as the strength
of the balance sheet, earnings, asset quality,
ratings and market position. GALCO assesses
the Group funding mix to ensure that
adequate diversity is maintained. It is Group
policy to manage its balance sheet profile to
ensure customer deposits sourced outside of
HBOSTS represents a significant component
of its overall funding. Within HBOSTS, the
Group avoids undue concentration by
maintaining both a widespread mix of
counterparties and inward credit lines and a
core set of bank and non-bank depositor
relationships providing a stable source of
funding. GALCO approves the appropriate
balance of short to medium term funding. 
The Group has established a comprehensive
Liquidity Contingency Planning Framework to
identify liquidity stress situations at an early
stage.
Market Risk
Market risk is defined as the potential loss in
value or earnings of the organisation arising
from:
• changes in external market factors such 
as interest rates (interest rate risk), foreign
exchange rates (foreign exchange risk),
commodities and equities; or
• the potential for customers to act in a
manner which is inconsistent with business,
pricing and hedging assumptions.
The objectives of the Group’s market risk 
framework are to ensure that:
• market risk is taken only in accordance with
the Board’s appetite for such risk;
• such risk is within the Group’s financial
capability, management understanding and
staff competence;
• the Group complies with all regulatory
requirements relating to the taking of
market risk;
• the quality of the Group’s profits is
appropriately managed and its reputation
safeguarded; and
• appropriate information on market risk is
known to those making decisions, such that
the taking of market risk is designed to
enhance shareholder value.
Risk appetite is set by the Board who allocate
responsibility for oversight and management
of market risk to GALCO. Market risk is HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 43
controlled across the Group by setting limits
using a mixture of measurement
methodologies. Detailed market risk
framework documents and limit structures
have been developed for each division. 
These are tailored to the specific market 
risk characteristics and business objectives 
of each operating division. Each Divisional
policy document requires appropriate
Divisional sanction, and is then forwarded to
GALCO for approval on at least an annual
basis. Group items (net free reserves,
subordinated debt and structural foreign
exchange) are governed by separate policies
and limits/mandates as set by GALCO.
Interest Rate Risk
The primary market risk faced by the Group is
interest rate risk. Interest rate risk exists
where the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities have interest rates set under
different bases or reset at different times.
The Board limit for structural interest rate risk
is expressed in terms of potential volatility of
net interest income in adverse market
conditions using an Earnings at Risk (“EaR”)
methodology. The EaR methodology
combines an analysis of the Group’s current
on and off-balance sheet risk position
overlaid with behavioural assessment and
repricing assumptions of planned future
activity. In addition to this primary control, a
number of other risk methodologies are
applied to manage risk, including:
• Present Value of a Basis Point (“PVBP”) – PVBP
is a measure of market value sensitivity and
quantifies the change in present value of
cash flows for a one basis point change in
interest rates. This method is primarily used
for Treasury Banking Book activities where
there is a limited impact from behavioural
and/or internal re-pricing issues.
• Net asset/liability repricing maturity
matrices – EaR analysis focuses on positions
over the detailed planning horizon and can
be directly related back to reported
performance. To ensure that the Group
does not have long-term embedded risks
that are not being appropriately controlled,
limits are set on net asset/liability positions
that re-price beyond one year.
The Board has delegated authority to GALCO
to allocate limits to business areas as
appropriate within the overall risk appetite. In
turn, GALCO has granted limits which
represent the risk tolerance for each division.
Core risk is required to be transferred to
HBOSTS from the banking divisions. The
residual risk in the banking divisions is
primarily that related either to behavioural
characteristics or to basis risk arising from
imperfect correlations in the adjustment of
rates earned and paid on different
instruments with otherwise similar
characteristics. Risk in the business divisions is
measured by EaR. With respect to HBOSTS
the primary risk measure is the impact
attributable to a 1 basis point move in the
yield curve. This is a more appropriate control
given the nature of exposures that HBOSTS’s
banking book carries. These two measures
have been calibrated and expressed as an EaR
equivalent. GALCO undertakes to ensure that
the aggregate exposure does not exceed the
total Group risk appetite.
Sensitivity to interest rate movements is shown
in Note 42 to the Accounts on page 113 to
114 which provides the year end repricing
profile for the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities in the non-trading book, which
includes lending funding and liquidity activities.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Board has delegated authority to GALCO
to set structural foreign exchange limits.
GALCO has established limits for foreign
exchange transaction and translation risk.
Transaction exposures arise primarily from
profits generated in the overseas operations,
which will be remitted back to the UK and
then converted into sterling. 
Translation exposures arise due to earnings
that are retained within the overseas
operations and reinvested within their own
balance sheet. 
Structural foreign exchange exposures are set
out in Note 44 to the accounts on page 115.
Trading
The Group’s market risk trading activities are
principally conducted by HBOSTS. This Group
activity is subject to a Trading Policy
Statement which is approved by the Board
and limits set by GALCO.
Treasury trading primarily centres around two
activities: proprietary trading and trading on
the back of customer flows. Both activities
incur market risk, the majority being interest
rate and foreign exchange rate exposure. The
framework for managing the market risk in
these activities requires detailed and tailored
modelling techniques and is the responsibility
of the Treasury Market Risk team.
The Group employs several complementary
techniques to measure and control trading
activities including: Value at Risk (“VaR”),
sensitivity analysis, stress testing and position
limits. The VaR model used forecasts the
Group’s exposure to market risk within an
estimated level of confidence over a defined
time period.
The average VaR value in 2003 was £11.9m.
The calculation is based upon a confidence
level of 99% with a one day holding period.
The principal areas of market risk taken are
interest rate (outright positioning, basis,
spread and volatility risk), and foreign
exchange risk. There is no material
commodity or equity exposure. 
The current methodology for providing an
aggregated VaR for the business uses very
conservative assumptions. In order to assess
the effectiveness of VaR the Group uses a
technique known as backtesting which
compares the daily profit and loss from
trading activities to the VaR estimate for that
day. Daily standard deviation of trading profit
and loss was £1.6m. 
The Group recognises that the VaR
methodology cannot guarantee the maximum
loss that may be suffered in any trading
period, particularly in the event of market
turmoil. Therefore, stress testing is used to
simulate the effect of selected adverse
market movements.
The Group’s trading market risk exposure for
the year ended 31 December 2003 is analysed
in Note 43 on page 114 of the Accounts. The
regulatory capital charge for market risk
trading exposures represents only 1.57% of
the Group’s capital base.
Derivatives
In the normal course of banking business, the
Group uses a limited range of derivative
instruments for both trading and non-trading
purposes. The principal derivative instruments
used are interest rate swaps, interest rate
options, cross currency swaps, forward rate
agreements, forward foreign exchange
contracts and futures. The Group uses
derivatives primarily as a risk management
tool for hedging interest rate and foreign
exchange rate risk.
The following table provides an illustration of
the traditional banking services and activities
which can give rise to market risk exposures
and the way in which this can be managed
and mitigated by using derivatives.
The Group’s activity in derivatives is
controlled within risk management limits set
by the Board and overseen by GALCO. This
framework recognises the principal risks
including credit, operational, liquidity and
market risk associated with derivatives.
Details of derivative contracts outstanding at
the year end are included in Note 39 of the
Accounts on pages 109 to 110.
The Basel Capital Accord
Due to the growing complexity of the financial
markets since 1988 the banking industry has
responded by developing a suite of
sophisticated risk management techniques. The
new Basel Capital Accord (BIS II) was conceived
against this background and is intended to
encourage improvement in banks’ ability to
measure risk and to align capital requirements
closely with risk management practices. 44 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
Financial Review and Risk Management continued
Since the publication of the first
Consultative Document on BIS II, the
Group has worked to ensure that its 
strategic programme to prepare for BIS II 
has complemented our own internal drive 
to invest in the development of market
leading risk management and reporting
systems.
The Group remains committed to the
construction of an environment that
improves the risk management practices of
the industry. Whilst a delay to the publication
of the final rules to mid-2004 has been
announced, the Group remains committed to
working towards the expected date of 1
January 2007 for the BIS II implementation.

Phil Hodkinson
Chairman of the CR Forum
Corporate Responsibility HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 47
In 2003, we published our first Corporate
Responsibility (“CR”) Report covering our
marketplace activities, environmental impact,
employment practices and contribution to
local communities. In that report, we made 
it clear that although we are very much at the
start of a journey, we are committed to
bringing CR to the heart of our activities
across the Group.
CR Policies
An Impact Assessment of our Community
Investment has been carried out by the
Corporate Citizenship Company. In future we
will benchmark our impact against our
competitors and against recognised best
practice. We have also undertaken an
independent audit of our CR reporting and
our external consultants, Casella Stanger, have
verified the measurements we have used for
submission to published indices.
We have a full set of CR policies in place
which are approved and monitored by the
Board and led by a Board Member, Phil
Hodkinson who chairs The CR Forum, a group
whose membership is drawn from every part
of the business. Our Board review and
approve annually our policies on Community
Investment, Diversity and Environment.
As evidence of our commitment to CR we
have sponsored Business in the Community’s
(“BITC”) CR index and were one of the few
financial services companies to submit
themselves for assessment in the inaugural
index, achieving second quintile status. Phil
Hodkinson has joined the Board of BITC and
of the CARES Leadership Group (which
promotes a business led volunteering
programme) and chairs its Business Impact
Review Group. Insight Investment, HBOS’s
asset management business which is a leading
exponent of socially responsible investment,
has launched its “Global Business Principles”
and has made a commitment to developing
deeper understanding of CR issues.
A critical achievement this year has been
agreement on an Ethics Statement which will
be communicated across the whole Group 
in 2004 to ensure not only compliance but
colleague ownership.
The Marketplace
A focus on providing value for money
products is at the heart of our approach 
to CR. For example, our current account pays
a significantly higher rate of interest than
most High Street banks. As the largest savings
institution in the country, HBOS is the only
major bank which offers an annual savings
review to customers; as a result, over £18bn
of balances have been moved to better
paying accounts.
HBOS is the established UK leader in social
banking through our Easycash and Cardcash
products. Our community banking initiatives
have contributed to the financial well being
of a number of communities such as Wester
Hailes in Edinburgh, Mercian Housing
Association in Birmingham and Paddington
Development Trust in London. Halifax is the
only bank partnering the Government’s Savings
Gateway Scheme in 5 pilot locations in England.
We have introduced a number of initiatives to
ensure that our products and services are as
accessible as possible by all members of the
community. For example, we have produced
product literature in Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi and
Gujarati for branches in areas with substantial
Asian populations. We are also working with
the National Forum of Wheelchair User
Groups and the Royal National Institute for
the Blind (“RNIB”) to make branches more
accessible. A full audit has been undertaken
covering over 1,100 premises and induction
loops have been installed in over 800
locations. We also offer brochures in large
print and Braille, Textphones and Typetalk
and we have a network of sign language
interpreters. As a leading online bank with a
strong commitment to digital inclusion, over
650 of our branches are linked to our internet
service through “Click and Call” units in our
banking halls making HBOS the largest UK
provider in the area.
Environmental Impact
We have set stretching environmental targets:
•To increase recycling of general office
waste to 50% by the end of 2005.
•To achieve a 10% reduction of gas and
electricity consumption by the end of 2004.
•To achieve a 6% reduction in water
consumption by 2005.
We aim to lend and invest responsibly 
and have produced a lenders guide to
environmental risk management for use 
by our managers.
Our environmental responsibilities extend 
to our customers too and as the biggest
mortgage lender in the UK, the impact of
flood risk on our customers is immensely
important. We are currently the only lender
to offer full insurance cover to our customers
and this year we announced that our Flood
Risk Policy would continue for at least
another 5 years, providing a flood risk
guarantee for 1.8m customers. In May 2003,
we conducted a survey of our suppliers with
a view to setting up supplier forums to share
best practice in environmental management.
HBOS has also launched a new programme to
address waste minimisation and recycling in
the branch network.

Corporate Responsibility continued
The Workplace
We believe that our total reward package,
which enables colleagues to select the
benefits which best suit their circumstances,
is both comprehensive and competitive. 
We focus particularly on share ownership
through Sharesave, Sharekicker and Share
Option Schemes which produces alignment 
of interest between Board, shareholders and
employees. We have developed family friendly
policies such as flexible work patterns, and 
are committed to diversity and equal
opportunities. Our progress over the years
has been recognised by The Chartered
Institute of Personnel and Development
(“CIPD”), BITC, Queen Elizabeth Foundation,
Opportunity Now, Personnel Today and the
British Diversity Awards. We benchmark our
performance on diversity in the workplace
both internally and externally using the Race
for Opportunity and Opportunity Now indices.
We are Gold Standard performers in both.
Our commitment to diversity has helped us
to improve the profile of our workforce but
we are committed to increasing the numbers
of women in senior management.
HBOS encourages volunteering, charitable
giving and fundraising by colleagues. In 2003
the Board agreed to give colleagues up to one
day’s leave for volunteering and hosted an
awards ceremony to recognise colleagues who
had made exceptional efforts in these areas or
had made distinctive contributions to Diversity
or Environmental best practice. We aim to
encourage more colleagues to volunteer and
have set a target for 2004 of 3,000 volunteers.
Internal Communication is a key ingredient in
achieving success in colleague motivation and
in stimulating a positive attitude in the
workplace. HBOS has one of the largest
Business TV networks in Europe, extended in
2003 to Bank of Scotland branches at a cost
of £1.3m. In addition to regular TV
programmes covering performance
information, sales targets and live interviews
with the Chief Executive, colleagues also
receive electronic Newsletters and have
access to employment data on “Groupnet” an
intranet which also carries news bulletins and
items of general interest to colleagues.
Community
HBOS invested £19.6m in the community 
in 2003.
The HBOS Foundation, which was launched as
an independent charity at the AGM in 2002
to lead our community investment activities,
has made substantial donations to Money
Advice Trust, Groundwork Trust, RNIB,
National Deaf Children’s Society (“NDCS”),
National Care Homes (“NCH”), National
Debtline and Centrepoint. A separate portion
of the annual budget of £4m was distributed
locally to smaller projects selected by the
businesses. Over 400 charitable projects were
supported in this way in 2003.
The Foundation concentrates on two themes:
improving financial literacy and developing
local communities. A new departure for
HBOS last year was the selection of a Charity
of the Year. By a telephone poll following a
live TV broadcast, over 14,600 HBOS
colleagues voted for Macmillan Cancer Relief,
National ChildLine and Alzheimers (with
Macmillan recording most votes). The
Foundation challenged colleagues to raise
£500,000 for Macmillan which they agreed to
match £ for £. The £1m target was reached in
September and by the year-end over £1.5m
was raised, with the “excess” being shared
with the other two shortlisted charities.
The £1m Challenge also provided the focus
for many fundraising and volunteering events
across the country. Over 1,300 colleagues
participated in “It’s a Knockout” events held in
Halifax, Edinburgh and Bristol and over
£164,000 was raised from our on-line auction
and a holiday raffle.
Bank of Scotland delivered an outstanding
sponsorship programme in 2003 with over
£4m being invested in Sport and in the Arts.
Alongside high profile projects such as the
Premierleague and the Ring Cycle at the
Edinburgh International Festival we supported
many projects targeted at deprived areas,
socially excluded children and the disabled.
For example, we launched the Bank of
Scotland Midnight League – to encourage
youngsters to participate in a football
tournament at night. Partnering the Police and
the Premierleague Clubs this project has been
successfully piloted in Scotland and plans are
now under way to roll this initiative out in
England. During 2003, 20,000 young people
took part in sporting events made possible by
our sponsorship. Of these, 60% came from
Social Inclusion Partnership areas. During
2004, we aim to increase the social inclusion
benefits of our sponsorship investment and
to increase the number of children from
deprived areas to 65% of those involved.
Future plans
HBOS believes that CR is not something that
can be pursued separately from our business
goals. It is an integral part of the way we 
do business. We are committed to developing
further the Group’s policies on social
environmental and ethical risk. We are also
committed to measuring and reporting our
performance in these fields, in accordance with
the Association of British Insurers’ guidelines on
disclosure of information to the public and to
investors through the Annual Report.

“Our public support for the new Higgs
regime has been followed by early
adoption of the new code”
Dennis Stevenson
Chairman
Consistent with our promise 
to embrace both the letter and
spirit of the new Code, we are
taking the opportunity in this
Report of measuring ourselves
– and reporting to shareholders
– against the requirements of
the new Code, even though
they apply only in respect of
accounting years beginning on
or after 1 November 2003.
As still required to do, we are
also reporting on compliance
with the principles and
provisions of the original
Combined Code.
In our 2002 Annual Report 
and Accounts we welcomed
the reviews of Corporate
Governance conducted by 
Sir Derek Higgs and Sir Robert
Smith, together with their
proposals for a revised
Combined Code.
After a period of further 
public consultation, the
Financial Reporting Council
published the new Combined
Code in July 2003, and this 
has now been annexed to the
Listing Rules by the Financial
Services Authority.

The Board 1. The Combined Code on Corporate
Governance
In the Company’s Annual Report and
Accounts 2002 we welcomed the review of
best practice in the boardroom conducted 
by Sir Derek Higgs and Sir Robert Smith and,
in particular, the guiding principle of “comply
or explain” that was stressed in Sir Derek
Higgs’ report, and which is now enshrined 
in the Preamble to the new Combined Code
on Corporate Governance (the “new Code”).
This Corporate Governance Report explains
key features of the Company’s governance
structure, how it applies the principles in the
new Code, and the extent to which the
Company has complied with the “provisions”
– or requirements – of the new Code.
Each of the provisions set out in the new Code
has been reviewed. Where necessary, steps
have been taken to ensure that the Company
is in compliance with all of those provisions 
as at the date of this Report, save that:
• an “explanation” is provided below 
in respect of the Board’s view of the
continuing independence of Sir Bob Reid,
who first joined the Board of Bank of
Scotland in 1987.
• the Company has a comprehensive
programme of meetings and dialogue with
institutional investors and ensures that the
views of investors expressed through this
dialogue, and through the Annual Audit of
Investor Opinion (referred to in more detail
on page 53) are communicated to the
Board as a whole, so that all directors can
develop a balanced understanding of the
issues and concerns of major shareholders.
Feedback from a number of shareholders
also suggests that the current arrangements
for communication between the Company
and its shareholders are considered to be
satisfactory and effective, and that regular
or routine meetings between shareholders
and the Senior Independent Director are
not considered necessary.
Accordingly the Senior Independent Director
did not attend meetings with major
shareholders in 2003, as suggested by new
Code Provision D.1.1. Nevertheless the Senior
Independent Director is always available to
meet shareholders on request and to ensure
that the Board is aware of shareholder
concerns not resolved through the existing
mechanisms for investor communication.
The Company has complied with all
provisions of the original Combined Code
throughout 2003.
2. Directors
Brief biographical details of current Directors
are set out on pages 50 and 51. Gordon
McQueen retired as a Director on 
31 December 2003. Sir Bob Reid and Louis
Sherwood will retire at the conclusion of the
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 
27 April 2004 (the “2004 AGM”) and will not
seek re-election by shareholders. Kathleen
(Kate) Nealon and David Shearer have been
appointed Directors of the Company with
effect from 23 March 2004 and, in
accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association, will present themselves for
election by shareholders at the 2004 AGM.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are
separate and there is a clear, written division
of responsibilities between those roles. There
is also a Non-executive Deputy Chairman 
(Sir Ron Garrick) whose role is also separately
defined. In addition to the Chairman and prior
to the retirement of Gordon McQueen, the
Board comprised seven Executive Directors
and nine Non-executive Directors. All of the
Non-executive Directors are considered to be
independent, including Sir Bob Reid, who
joined the Board of Bank of Scotland in 1987.
The Board is satisfied that Sir Bob remains fully
independent in character and judgement, and
his extensive business experience and
expertise is a valuable addition to the Board’s
mix of skills. During 2003, Sir Bob’s extensive
knowledge and experience of the Australian
market provided significant challenge and
value in relation to the acquisition of the
minority interest in BankWest. As referred to
above, Sir Bob will stand down from the Board
at the 2004 AGM, and will not seek re-election
by shareholders. Following Sir Bob’s retirement,
Sir Ron Garrick, the Company’s Non-executive
Deputy Chairman, will undertake the role of
Senior Independent Director.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of
Association, which provide for all Directors to
stand for re-election at intervals of no more
than three years, James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson
and Brian Ivory will retire by rotation, and will
each seek re-election by shareholders, at the
2004 AGM. The Chairman is pleased to
confirm that, following formal performance
evaluation, Brian Ivory’s performance
continues to be effective, and he continues to
demonstrate commitment to the role of Non-
executive Director (including in respect of his
Chairmanship of the Remuneration
Committee, and his membership of other
boards and committees).
On appointment to the Board, Directors are
provided with a full, formal and tailored
programme of induction, to familiarise them
with the Group’s businesses; the risks and
strategic challenges they face; and the
economic, competition, legal and regulatory
environments in which they operate. A
programme of strategic and other reviews,
together with other training provided during
the year, ensures that Directors continually
update their skills; their knowledge and
familiarity with the Group’s businesses; and
their awareness of sector, risk, regulatory,
legal, financial and other developments; 
to enable them to fulfil effectively their role
on the Board and committees of the Board.
Particulars of Directors’ remuneration and
interests in shares of the Company are given
in the Report of the Board in relation to
Remuneration Policy and Practice (the
“Directors’ Remuneration Report”) on 
pages 55 to 72.
3. The Board
The Board meets regularly to determine the
strategic direction of the Group and to review
operating, financial and risk performance.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved
to the Board which includes approval of the
Group’s annual Business Plan, that defines the
operating and strategic objectives of the
Group and the risk framework within which
the Group will operate; Group policies and
standards on financial and non-financial risks;
significant transactions, above defined limits,
or entering into significant new business
activities; and the scope of delegations to
Board Committees, subsidiary boards and
executive management of the Group. The
executive management of the Group is
responsible to the Board for developing
strategy; the profitability and overall
performance of the Group; and for managing
the Group’s businesses in accordance with the
Group Business Plan, and policies and
standards approved by the Board. Details of
the full list of matters reserved to the Board
can be found on the Company’s website.
The Board has overall responsibility for the
Group’s system of internal control and
annually reviews its effectiveness, including a
review of financial, operational, compliance
and risk management controls. The
implementation and maintenance of the risk
management and internal control systems are
the responsibility of the Executive Directors
and other senior management. The system is
designed to manage the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives, and provide
reasonable assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The Group Management Board is the senior
executive team of the Group and has
mechanisms for monitoring the risk management
practices approved and adopted by individual
business areas. Information about these
mechanisms and the Group’s compliance with
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on
the Combined Code” (the “Turnbull Guidance”)
is set out in the Financial Review and Risk
Management Report on pages 35 to 44.
In addition to two formal meetings of 
the Board held to authorise release of the
Company’s preliminary and interim results,
following consideration by the Audit
Committee and the full Board, which are
Corporate Governance Report
52 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
Corporate Governance Report discounted for this purpose, there were ten
Board meetings during 2003 at which all
Directors were present with the exception of
Charles Dunstone (apologies given for three
meetings), John Maclean (one), Coline
McConville (one), Gordon McQueen (one)
and Louis Sherwood (one).
During the year the Chairman led the formal
evaluation of the Board and its principal
Committees, and of the performance and
commitment of each individual Director,
through a process that included detailed
questionnaires, in-depth one-to-one
discussions with the Chairman, and debate at
the Board. Sir Bob Reid, as Senior
Independent Director, led the Non-executive
Directors in evaluating the performance of
the Chairman (taking into account the views
of Executive Directors), including at a meeting
of Non-executive Directors held during the
year where the Chairman was not present.
4. Committees of the Board
The terms of reference of the principal
Committees of the Board – Audit,
Remuneration and Nomination – are available
on the Company’s website. Those terms 
of reference are reviewed at least annually.
The work carried out by the Audit and
Nomination Committees in discharging their
responsibilities is summarised below. The
work carried out by the Remuneration
Committee is described within the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 72.
Audit Committee
Anthony Hobson (Chairman)
John Maclean
Sir Bob Reid (appointed 10 June 2003)
Louis Sherwood
This Committee consists entirely of Non-
executive Directors, and is chaired by
Anthony Hobson who has significant recent
and relevant financial experience. It is
supported by Risk Control Committees for
each division, comprising Non-executive and
Executive Directors. The Terms of Reference
of the Committee include all matters
indicated by the original and the new
Combined Code.
During 2003 the Committee met seven times
with all members present with the exception
of John Maclean (apologies for one meeting).
It meets with Executive Directors and
management, as well as privately with both
the external and internal auditors, to:
• review and advise the Board on the Group’s
interim and annual financial statements, its
accounting policies and on the control of
its financial and business risks; review the
nature and scope of the work to be
performed by the external and internal
auditors, the results of this audit work and
of the response of management;
• review the activities, resources,
organisational structure and operational
effectiveness of the internal audit function;
• review the effectiveness of the Group’s
system of internal control (including
financial, operational, compliance and risk
management), as well as the appropriateness
of “whistleblowing” procedures;
• make recommendations on the
appointment and remuneration of the
external auditors and to monitor the
performance of the auditors; and
• review the non-audit services provided to
the Group by the external auditors and
monitor the independence of the auditors.
Both the Board and the external auditors
have safeguards in place to prevent the
compromise of the auditors’ independence
and objectivity. Each year the Audit
Committee establishes a limit on the fees
that can be paid to the external auditors in
respect of advisory and consultancy work.
The external auditors also report regularly to
the Committee on the actions that they have
taken to comply with professional and
regulatory requirements and current best
practice in order to maintain their
independence. This includes the rotation of
key members of the audit team.
The Committee reviews the auditors’
independence annually. During 2003, the
Committee commissioned a report into the
effectiveness and independence of the
external auditors. The results of this review
were satisfactory. An audit tender process will
be undertaken at least every five years,
commencing in 2005.
Nomination Committee
Sir Ronald Garrick (Chairman)
Dennis Stevenson
James Crosby
Brian Ivory
Sir Bob Reid
Philip Yea (appointed 5 April 2003)
Coline McConville (appointed 5 April 2003)
The Committee has met on three occasions
during the past twelve months with all
members present. The Committee leads the
process for making appointments to the
Board; ensures that there is a formal, rigorous
and transparent procedure for the
appointment of new directors to the Board;
reviews the composition of the Board
through a full evaluation of the skills,
knowledge and experience of directors; and
ensures plans are in place for orderly
succession for appointments to the Board,
and to other senior executive management
positions. With assistance from external
search and recruitment consultants, the
Committee maintains a standing list of
potential candidates for appointment as Non-
executive Directors of the Company, and
ensures that list is updated and refreshed. In
relation to the appointment of David Shearer
and Kate Nealon, two firms of external search
consultants were used; a short list was
created and followed by a series of interviews
with the Chairman and other members of the
Committee, including Dennis Stevenson and
James Crosby, prior to recommendations
being submitted to the Board.
5. Relations with Shareholders
The Company co-ordinates its
communications with shareholders, through
two channels. The Investor Relations team
manages communications with institutional
shareholders through a combination of
briefings to analysts and institutional
shareholders, both at the interim and year
end results, site visits and individual
discussions with Board Members and key
members of the management team. There is
regular dialogue to help to ensure that the
Company’s strategy is understood and that
any issues are addressed in a constructive
way. The Shareholder Services team oversees
communication with private shareholders. 
There is also an Annual Audit of Investor
Opinion, undertaken on behalf of the Board,
which takes the form of structured interviews
with individual investors through an
independent external adviser. The 2003
report gathered opinion on strategy,
operational performance, corporate
governance and management capability from
investors in the UK, Europe and North
America. The non-attributable opinions give
the Board direct access to investor feedback.
The Annual Audit complements the monthly
market view on investor sentiment and
opinion, which is a standard part of the
monthly Board management information. 
Each year shareholders receive the Annual
Review and Summary Financial Statement or,
at the choice of the shareholder, the Annual
Report and Accounts. The Company takes the
Annual General Meeting around the UK
allowing more shareholders the opportunity
to attend, hear about and question the
Group’s performance and the Directors’
stewardship in an open manner. The Chairmen
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees attend the meeting along with
other Directors and are available to answer
shareholders’ questions on the activities of
their own Committees.
During the year shareholders can receive up-
to-date information through the Company’s
website, www.HBOSplc.com. This provides
share price information, financial results,
analyst presentations and answers to
frequently asked questions. A telephone
helpline is available on 0870 702 0102
providing a contact point for shareholders on
issues such as dividends and announcements.
Corporate Governance Report
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 53 Directors’ Accounting Responsibilities
54 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
Corporate Governance Report
The following statement, which should be
read in conjunction with the Independent
Auditors’ Report on page 74, enables
shareholders to distinguish the respective
responsibilities of the Directors and the
Auditors in relation to the accounts.
Company law requires the Directors to
prepare accounts for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the Group
and of the profit or loss for that period. In
preparing those accounts, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting
standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Company and the Group will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
proper accounting records which disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and to
enable them to ensure that the accounts
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to
safeguard the assets of the Group and to
prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities. Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
This is the second year for which we will be seeking approval for the HBOS Remuneration Committee Report from shareholders at our Annual
General Meeting.
Following the first such report and the advisory vote at our AGM in April 2003, the Committee received valuable input from stakeholders on
our remuneration policy and practice and on the way in which we communicate with shareholders in this area. In addition, we have met with
over 20 of our major shareholders in late 2003 and early 2004, specifically to discuss remuneration issues. These shareholders, collectively,
represent about one third of the HBOS equity. These meetings have assisted us in addressing a number of issues on reward policy and practice
and sought to improve the clarity of our report.
The disclosure regulations mean that the focus of this report is on Directors and, to a lesser extent, their most senior colleagues. In reality, the
Committee’s focus extends to all our 67,500 colleagues in the HBOS Group: we believe that it is important to have consistent remuneration
principles across the Group regardless of business area and seniority.
More specifically:
• our salaries are managed around median levels in the financial services sector;
• our annual incentives have performance targets consistent with those in our operating plan; are generally team based; and focus on issues for
which each team has prime accountability. Annual incentives are a material part of reward – and all colleagues know that there is a distinct
possibility of zero payments as well as possibilities of high rewards where targets are significantly exceeded;
• our longer-term incentives allow most of our colleagues to enjoy a “share in success” of HBOS; and for our most senior colleagues, the long-
term arrangements are strongly driven by the Group’s relative performance against key comparator companies. Rewards are only paid if the
Group’s performance is better than the average of the key comparator companies;
• wherever possible, our annual and longer-term incentives are denominated in shares rather than in cash – so that our colleagues are also our
shareholders. The Committee has also set out clear requirements for all Directors to own shares in the Group;
• our benefits offering is positioned at the market median and gives colleagues as much flexibility over their choice of benefits as possible; and
we have an extensive colleague product offering – so that our colleagues are also our customers.
This reward philosophy has applied in HBOS since inception, did not change during 2003 and will continue to apply in 2004 and beyond.
However, at a more detailed level, it is clear that some aspects of our reward policy in 2002 for our most senior colleagues (broadly the 45
colleagues whose salary levels generally exceed £175,000, including all our Executive Directors) did not align in some respects with shareholders’
expectations and so we have made a number of changes, or clarified our existing practice for 2004, as a result of the feedback we received.
More detail is contained within the full report, where necessary, but the key features are:
• we have removed the option to re-test performance under long-term share incentive plans starting in 2004 and beyond;
• we have clarified the role of the Chairman who was independent of the organisation at the time of appointment but plays a key role in
influencing the strategic direction of the Group. It therefore remains entirely appropriate that his reward structure includes a long-term
incentive plan equivalent to that applying to the Executive Directors;
• we have made it clear that share options will not be granted at the most senior levels during 2004 and, if they are granted in future years, they
will be subject to appropriate performance conditions. Sharesave will still be available at these levels;
• we have restructured the annual incentive scheme for our most senior colleagues so that it is denominated in shares which are subject to a
three-year deferral, with a significant discount in the value of this reward element applying to those who wish to take immediate cash instead
of shares;
• we have confirmed our requirement for our most senior colleagues to hold shares in the Group to a value of one year’s salary/fee; and
• we have specified how the Committee would deal with interests under our various share schemes in the event of a change in control where,
other than in exceptional circumstances, the Committee would take account of performance delivered up to the time of the change in control
in determining the amount, if any, of the value of existing interests to be released.
A number of new issues were also addressed by the Committee during 2003. More detail is contained within the full report. Shareholder
interests are central to our decision making process on reward, and we believe that it is important to explain any key changes in our
remuneration arrangements. In 2003 there were three such changes:
• firstly, salary increases for Executive Directors. We have implemented salary increases for all the Executive Directors, two such increases being
significant (for the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Executive of our Retail Division), and for two reasons. First, reports commissioned
from a number of advisors confirmed our internal assessment that these salaries generally, and two particularly, had fallen well below the
medians of other comparable financial services companies. Our second, and more important, reason for making these increases is to ensure
that salaries for our top team are consistent with our stated policy, given the great deal that has been achieved over the last two to three
years. The Committee had chosen, both at the time of merger and in 2002, not to make significant salary increases simply because the Group
was substantially larger than either of its predecessors, but to defer such increases until it could be clearly displayed to shareholders that the
merger was working;
• secondly, a special retention incentive. To counter specific attempts by others to employ the Chief Executive of our Retail Division and, in
particular, a very attractive approach for him to become Group Chief Executive of a major FTSE company, we have implemented a

performance related retention package. The package is designed to retain his services until at least 2008 with significant rewards, contingent
on growing profitability of the Retail Division by at least 60% over the three-year period to December 2004; and
• thirdly, severance arrangements. We have clarified terms on employer instigated severance in relation to mitigation and staged payments, so
that it is very clear as to how we would deal with termination, particularly in circumstances of inadequate performance where naturally there
are no rewards for failure.
In the full report which follows, we have provided transparent and extensive technical details, as we did last year.
We welcome questions and feedback from all shareholders on both the report content and the report transparency.
We believe our reward policy is right for our colleagues and right for our shareholders – and we encourage all shareholders to support 
the resolution.

HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 57
1. What this report covers
This report to shareholders:
• sets out our remuneration policy;
• explains the policy under which our Chairman, our Executive Directors, the next most senior group of colleagues and our Non-executive
Directors were remunerated for the year ended 31 December 2003; and
• sets out tables of information showing details of the salary, incentive, share and pension interests of all the Directors for the year ended 
31 December 2003.
2. Compliance with regulations
This report has been approved by the Board. A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting inviting them to consider
and approve this report, as required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the “Regulations”) as now incorporated in the
Companies Act 1985.
The report complies with the requirements of the Regulations.
As required by the Regulations, section 13 of this report has been audited by KPMG Audit Plc, with the exception of section 13.3.1 (Shares),
Note 8 to Table 6 within section 13.3.3 (TSR performance), section 13.3.6 (Interest in Shares under Trusts) and section 13.3.8 (Statutory
Performance Graph), which do not fall to be audited.
3. Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board. Your Board believes that a properly constituted and effective Remuneration
Committee is key to ensuring that Executive Directors’ and other colleagues’ remuneration is aligned to shareholders’ interests and that it
motivates Executive Directors and other colleagues to enhance the absolute performance and the relative competitiveness of the Group. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are summarised in Appendix 1.
4. Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee during 2003 were all independent Non-executive Directors, as shown below:
Brian Ivory (Chairman)
Sir Ronald Garrick
Coline McConville
Philip Yea
At the invitation of the Chairman, the Group’s Chairman and the Chief Executive attend Committee meetings to provide background and
context on matters relating to the remuneration of the other Executive Directors and other colleagues in the Group, but do not attend when
their own remuneration is discussed. No Director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration or contractual terms.
During 2003, the Committee met on seven occasions and the attendance of Committee members is as shown below:
Brian Ivory (Chairman) – 7 meetings
Sir Ronald Garrick – 7 meetings
Coline McConville – 6 meetings
Philip Yea – 7 meetings
5. Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
During 2003 the Head of Group Reward & Recognition acted as Secretary to the Committee and provided advice to it, as did the Company
Secretary. The Committee also sought independent external advice on remuneration matters. The Committee does not retain advisors but uses
organisations best suited to undertake specific projects from time to time. During 2003, the Committee took advice, directly or indirectly, from:
• Watson Wyatt, in relation to pension issues; this organisation also advises the Group and the trustees of various Group pension plans on a
range of pension issues;
• Hay Group Management and Towers Perrin, in relation to reward issues; these organisations also advise the Group on a range of reward issues;
• New Bridge Street Consultants, in relation to various policy issues and in relation to the preparation of this report; this organisation also
provides independent performance measurement results for grants under the long-term incentive plan which applies to most senior
colleagues;
• Linklaters, in relation to various policy issues and in relation to the preparation of this report; this organisation also provides legal advice to
the Group in relation to remuneration and other issues.
In addition, during 2003, the Committee asked New Bridge Street Consultants to undertake a wholly independent review of reward practice in
comparison with reward policy, in relation to Executive Directors. The consultants confirmed that, taken overall, the reward practice position
was a wholly appropriate one.
6. Compliance with the Combined Code
Full details of the Group’s approach to Corporate Governance, including compliance with original and revised versions of the Combined Code,
are included in the Corporate Governance Report on page 52.
The Board has followed and complied with both the original and the revised versions of the Combined Code as well as the Regulations in
preparing this Report and in designing performance-related incentive plans for senior colleagues. 7. Service contracts
The arrangements relating to the provision of the services of the Chairman are covered by a contract which extends to June 2005. If the
contract is terminated by the Group prior to the expiry of the term, compensation up to the equivalent of one year’s fees may be payable. 
All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which can be terminated by the Group on one year’s notice and by the Director on six
months’ notice. If any contract is terminated prior to the expiry of the term, contractual compensation up to the equivalent of one year’s basic
salary may be payable. There is no contractual compensation entitlement for any of the Directors beyond this. Executive Directors are expected
to make reasonable efforts to mitigate for loss arising from early termination of their contracts.
It is the Committee’s policy to design service contracts for any newly recruited Executive Directors in a comparable form to the contracts of
existing Executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years with an expectation that in most cases, and subject to satisfactory
performance, they will be invited to serve a second three-year term. In exceptional circumstances, where the Board is satisfied that it is in the
interests of the Group and its shareholders, a Non-executive Director may be asked to serve a third three-year term. 
8. External appointments
The Group recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other companies and that such
appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Group. Provided that it does not impact materially on their
executive duties, Executive Directors are generally encouraged to accept one such appointment. They may retain any resulting fee. Only in
exceptional circumstances will two such appointments be permitted.
9. Share ownership
The Group believes that share ownership by colleagues throughout the Group enhances their alignment with shareholders’ interests. Therefore
colleagues in the Group are able to acquire shares as a result of:
• the Sharesave plan;
• short-term incentive plans. All colleagues can opt to take the whole or part of their annual incentive in shares rather than in cash, with those
who take their annual incentive in shares, retain them for three years and remain with the Group receiving a 50% enhancement of their
shareholding;
• long-term incentive plans. Share grants of varying percentages of salaries were made to the 150 most senior colleagues effective from the start
of 2003. Share options equivalent to 20% of salary were made to all Group colleagues, other than the 45 most senior colleagues, early in 2003;
and
• personal purchase using the Group’s sharedealing facility or by other means.
These arrangements assist the vast majority of colleagues throughout the Group to acquire shares. They form a key element in the Group’s
commitment to creating a competitive, flexible and performance-oriented reward structure.
The Group expects all of its Directors (including the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors), together with other senior colleagues, to
acquire and retain significant numbers of shares relative to base salaries or fees. In the case of the Directors the value of the shareholding is
expected to be at least 100% of base salary or base fee within three years of appointment or by 1 January 2006 whichever is the later.
10. Remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other senior colleagues
To deliver its objective of creating real increases in shareholder value relative to the finance sector, the Group needs to attract and retain the
most capable and committed people and create the right employment conditions and reward opportunities for them. 
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors and their most senior colleagues is aligned with this objective. Accordingly, the focus of
remuneration policy is not primarily on salary but is on incentive plans that are closely aligned with the delivery of both operating plans and
increases in shareholder value.
Therefore, for 2004, as was the case for both 2002 and 2003:
• salary policy is set at around market median for the financial services sector;
• short-term incentive plans are based on the delivery of annual operating plans; and
• long-term incentive plans are focused on share grants. Participants do not receive any of these shares unless the Group’s relative total
shareholder return is above that of the finance sector as measured using the weighted average total shareholder return of a comparator group
of companies. This long-term plan is highly geared so that average performance generates no reward but outstanding performance generates
relatively high levels of reward.
There are no plans, at present, to make any changes to this remuneration policy in 2005 and beyond. We have, however, committed to review
our long-term incentive plans in 2005.
In broad terms, for every £100 of target reward for Executive Directors, about £52 is guaranteed and £48 is performance contingent. Sustained
exceptional performance can result in a further £59 of reward. Of the performance element of reward, between 20% and 30% is based solely on
annual performance with the rest based on triennial performance or retention.
For remuneration purposes, roles in HBOS fall into one of nine Levels, 1-8 and the Executive Directors. This report covers Directors and 
other senior colleagues who fall into Level 8, about 45 colleagues in all. Appendix 2 gives broad details of remuneration arrangements for 
those in Levels 1-7.
Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice
continued
58 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
Remuneration Policy 10.1. Salary
Salary benchmarks are reviewed annually, taking account of information from independent sources on salary rates for comparable jobs in the
finance industry and in other selected major public companies. Actual salaries are normally reviewed annually but can be reviewed at any time.
There is no automatic annual salary increase. 
The benchmarking process is both extensive and rigorous. It is designed to ensure that the median salary policy adopted by the Committee
demonstrably applies in practice.
Current base salaries of the Executive Directors after the most recent review with effect from May 2003 (February 2003 in respect of 
Andy Hornby) are:
James Crosby £775,000, Mike Ellis £540,000, Phil Hodkinson £400,000, Andy Hornby £575,000, Colin Matthew £390,000, George Mitchell £540,000.
At the date of his retirement on 31 December 2003, and from May 2003, Gordon McQueen’s base salary was £410,000.
10.2. Incentive Plans
The purpose of the incentive plans is to provide a direct link between each individual’s remuneration and his or her performance, that of 
the business he or she works in and that of the Group, both annually and over the longer term.
All Executive Directors and a substantial majority of other senior colleagues participate in incentive plans which are Group-wide. Performance
targets and levels of participation differ in order to align overall individual remuneration with the Group’s policy objectives outlined earlier.
Different, market-appropriate, arrangements exist for a small number of senior colleagues within the Group.
Payment of incentives, for Executive Directors and certain other individuals, is subject to the approval of the Committee. Except in certain
circumstances in respect of initial periods of employment, no Executive Director has a contractual right to an incentive. 
Incentive arrangements to apply during 2004 are set out below.
10.3. Short-term incentive plans
The levels of incentive payments are dependent on the extent to which participants achieve their operating plan objectives. In 2004, for
Executive Directors, payment of the target incentive will require the achievement of targets which include earnings per share (“EPS”) and return
on equity (“RoE”) and the attainment of a certain level of profit before tax (“PBT”). Examples of benchmark payment levels which apply for 2004
are as follows:
Category Incentive as a % of salary
Target Maximum
Executive Directors 60 90
Level 8 52.5 78.75
EPS, RoE and PBT outcomes are reviewed by the Audit Committee for the purposes of determining outcomes under the plan.
The levels of incentives shown in the table above require participants to take their annual incentive in shares rather than in cash; to retain 
their shares for three years and remain in Group employment; or to rank as a qualifying leaver during the three-year period. The Committee
believes that this feature clearly aligns the interests of participants and shareholders by encouraging participants to be both long-term
colleagues and long-term shareholders, having first achieved stretching performance targets in relation to their operating plans. Participants may
take their annual incentive in cash in which case the incentive is released at two-thirds of the level which would normally apply were the
incentive taken in shares.
In overall terms, these incentive levels are the same as applied in 2003.
10.4. Long-term incentive plans
Participants are granted conditional shares shortly after the start of the financial year equal to the number of shares secured by a percentage of
the participant’s salary and based on the price of the Group’s shares, using the average market price in the last ten business days of the previous
financial year. For awards in 2004, grant levels will be as follows:
Category Conditional share grant as a % of salary
Executive Directors 100
Level 8 66.67
The number of shares ultimately released to participants under the plan is dependent on the Group’s annualised total shareholder return (“TSR”)
(defined as the gross overall return on ordinary shares of HBOS after all adjustments for capital actions and re-investment of dividends or other
income) over three-year periods, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies: Abbey National;
Aviva; Barclays; Legal & General; Lloyds TSB; Prudential; Royal Bank of Scotland and Royal & Sun Alliance, over equivalent periods.
For awards in 2004, the releases early in 2007 will be as follows:
Group’s relative TSR performance Amount released as a % of share grant
0% p.a. (or below) 0
+3% p.a. 100
+6% p.a. (or above) 200
Remuneration Policy
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 59 Intermediate positions are determined by interpolation.
If the relative TSR performance does not exceed 0% p.a. after three years, the conditional share grant lapses. There is no retest.
The Committee believes that TSR is an appropriate performance measure because it is a robust and transparent measure of the creation of
shareholder value; that a relative measure is more motivational and competitively robust than an absolute one; and that a weighted average
group made up of the biggest domestic banking and insurance companies is a robust comparator and gives a more effective performance test
than a traditional ranking-based league table.
Calculations of TSR performance are performed independently of the Group by New Bridge Street Consultants for the purposes of determining
outcomes under the plan.
The Executive Directors and other senior colleagues who fall into Level 8 have never been granted share options with HBOS and will not be
granted share options in 2004. Currently, there is no intention to grant share options to these individuals in future years. 
The Executive Directors and other senior colleagues may, however, participate in the Sharesave plan. This is a standard tax-approved scheme
available to all colleagues, with no performance conditions.
These overall incentive levels are the same as applied in 2003 except that there is now no retest under the conditional share grant arrangements.
10.5. Beneﬁts
Each senior colleague is provided with benefits, which principally comprise a company car (or cash in lieu), pension arrangements, paid leave,
healthcare cover and preferential terms for Group products.
Individuals are generally eligible for membership of tax-approved final salary pension arrangements and, for certain individuals who joined the
Group after 1989, for membership of separate final salary pension arrangements. These arrangements, taken together, provide a personal
pension benefit based on salary only, with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary (in broad terms, the last 12 months’ salary) at normal
retirement age (age 60), subject to the necessary pensionable service. The arrangements also provide a lump sum life assurance benefit of four
times salary and pension benefits for spouses/dependants and qualifying children. All tax-approved benefits are subject to Inland Revenue
limits. Pension entitlement is based on salary only.
11. Remuneration policy for the Chairman
The remuneration policy for the Chairman recognises that, whilst the Chairman was independent of the organisation when he joined it, he is 
not now regarded as an “independent Director” . The Chairman plays a key role in influencing the strategic direction of the Group and ensuring
performance delivery. It is therefore entirely appropriate that the Chairman’s reward arrangements are based on a mixture of guaranteed pay and
performance-related long-term incentive. 
The current base fee of the Chairman after the most recent review, effective from July 2003, is £525,000.
In addition, the Chairman is included in a long-term incentive plan equivalent to that described in section 10.4 and receives an annual
conditional grant based on 100% of his fee and subject to the same performance conditions as apply to Executive Directors. 
The Committee established the long-term incentive plan for the Chairman through a separately constituted scheme, for two reasons. Firstly, so
that shareholders could vote on this scheme quite separately from any vote on the scheme applying to Executive Directors. Secondly, for legal
reasons because the Chairman is not an employee of the Group and cannot therefore be included in the share-based long-term incentive plan
described in section 10.4 as that plan is available to employees only. In practice, however, the scheme which applies for the Chairman is a mirror
image arrangement of the scheme applying to Executive Directors.
There is no short-term incentive plan and there are no benefits for the Chairman.
The Chairman’s overall remuneration is at about 45% of that of the Chief Executive with a similar proportion of such remuneration dependent
on performance. The Committee, however, does not slavishly cross-reference reward to a particular time commitment: in practice the Chairman
is always available and, in broad terms, spends about half his working time on HBOS business.
12. Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors
Remuneration for Non-executive Directors consists solely of fees. There are no short-term incentive plans or long-term incentive plans 
or benefits for Non-executive Directors.
The current base Board membership fee for each Non-executive Director after the most recent review, effective from May 2003, is £40,000. 
In addition, fees are paid for services on committees and for directorships of subsidiaries and joint ventures. 
Fees are set based on comparisons with other Non-executive Director fees and time commitments in comparable companies.

Notes to Table 1a
Note 1:
The annual cash incentive amounts, approved by the Committee, relate to performance under the short-term incentive plan in 2003 against
targets for earnings per share and return on equity and the attainment of a certain level of profit before tax. The target cash incentive was 40%
of salary and the maximum cash incentive was 60% of salary. Annual cash incentive figures exclude potential “Sharekicker” enhancements for
any element of the incentive taken in shares. Details of potential “Sharekicker” enhancements from earlier years can be found in Table 5.
Note 2:
Sir Peter Burt retired as Executive Deputy Chairman very shortly after the end of the 2002 financial year. His retirement arrangements were fully
disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for 2002 including the cost of waiving the actuarial reduction of £614,000. Gordon McQueen
retired as an Executive Director on 31 December 2003. As was the general practice in relation to early retirement under the Bank of Scotland
1976 Pension Scheme, Gordon McQueen’s pension was based on accrued benefits with no actuarial reduction for early payment. The cost of
waiving the actuarial reduction for Gordon McQueen was £270,000. 
Note 3:
The fee payment to Dennis Stevenson comprises payments made to him personally in respect of the provision of his services as Chairman of the
Group of £510,000 (2002 – £472,500).
Note 4:
From 1 May 2002 the basic Board membership fee payable to Non-executive Directors was at a rate of £35,000 p.a. and from 1 May 2003 it was
increased to a rate of £40,000 p.a. The basic Board membership fee covers the range of duties and responsibilities associated with Non-
executive directorship, including Board meetings and the Annual General Meeting. 
The figures shown in the table above also include fees for services on committees of the Board, details of which are set out in section 4 of the
Corporate Governance Report. The levels of fees for some Non-executive Directors reflect the significant time spent by them on such
committee duties.
The figures shown also include fees for services as directors of subsidiaries and joint ventures; and for services on other committees. The fees in
relation to these committees, subsidiaries and joint ventures were as follows:

The salaries shown for James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby are the amounts of salary they would have received had they not 
given up £19,980, £315 and £5,398 respectively as additional pension contributions. Short-term incentives and long-term incentives have been
calculated by reference to salaries prior to the reductions for additional pension contributions.
Note 6:
Certain Executive Directors are Non-executive Directors of other companies. Their roles and fees were as follows:
James Crosby was a Non-executive Director of Granada plc throughout 2003. The annual rate of fee (which he retained) was £30,000. He was also
appointed a Non-executive Director of ITV plc on 3 December 2003. Granada plc became a subsidiary of ITV plc on 2 February 2004. The annual
rate of fee from ITV plc (which he retains) is £50,000 effective from 20 October 2003 and inclusive of the fees from Granada plc from that date.
James Crosby was appointed a Non-executive Director of the Financial Services Authority from 15 January 2004. The annual rate of fee (which
he will donate to charity) is £20,000.
Andy Hornby was appointed a Non-executive Director of GUS plc from 21 January 2004. The annual rate of fee (which he will retain) is £30,000.
In addition, the annual rate of share-based fee (which he will retain) is 2,500 ordinary shares in GUS plc.
Gordon McQueen was a Non-executive Director of the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust plc throughout 2003. The annual rate of fee (which
he retained) was £16,000.
Note 7:
Taxable benefits principally comprise the benefits in kind values of company cars, healthcare, additional life assurance and concessionary 
rate mortgages.
13.2 Pension beneﬁts
Details of each Executive Director’s pension and lump sum life assurance entitlement, and the annual contributions (as percentages of
pensionable salaries) required to meet the costs of providing those benefits, are as follows:

Notes to Table 2
Note 1:
Pension is generally based on retirement from service at normal retirement age (age 60) and is based on final salary disregarding, where relevant,
the earnings cap as defined in the Finance Act 1989. Pension and lump sum life assurance is provided from the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension
Scheme (the “Scheme”) and from the Halifax Retirement Fund (the “Fund”) to the extent permitted by legislation, and otherwise from separate
arrangements with the Group. The pension shown generally accrues at a rate of one thirtieth of salary for each year of service (for members of
the Fund) and one sixtieth of salary for each year of service (for members of the Scheme).
Note 2:
Costs are based on estimates, by the actuaries to the Scheme and to the Fund, of the costs to the Group over the future service periods of the
Executive Directors using “attained age” rates. Costs are calculated on funding assumptions adopted for actuarial valuations of the Scheme and
the Fund and do not distinguish between the costs of providing benefits from the Scheme and the Fund and the costs of providing benefits
from separate unfunded arrangements. The costs exclude those covered by personal contributions from Executive Directors but include
allowance for the current cost of self-insuring the risk benefits for death in service and ill-health retirement.

Remuneration Policy Note 3:
On death after retirement or after leaving service, a spouse’s pension equal to 50% of the member’s pension for the Scheme and 66.7% of the
member’s pension for the Fund may be payable. Children’s benefits may also be payable. 
Under the Scheme, Executive Directors require the consent of the Company before retiring early. Under the Fund, Executive Directors have a
contractual right to retire at age 55 or above with a non-reduced pension and at age 50 or above (but below age 55) with a reduced pension.
Pension increases after retirement are a mixture of guaranteed and discretionary. Scheme pensions in respect of service before 6 April 1997 are
not guaranteed to increase. Scheme pensions in respect of service after 5 April 1997 are guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail Prices
Index, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum. The Fund guarantees to increase pensions in line with the Retail Prices Index, subject to a
maximum of 5% per annum and a minimum of 3% per annum (no minimum for pensionable service after 31 March 2004). There is an established
policy of reviewing pensions on a discretionary basis taking account of increases in the Retail Prices Index.
Allowance is made in transfer values on leaving in respect of the guaranteed and discretionary increases outlined above.
The pension entitlements of the Executive Directors are set out in the table below:

Notes to Table 3
Note 1:
The accrued pension at 31 December 2003 is the pension which the Director would have been entitled to receive based on his completed
pensionable service, had he left on 31 December 2003, payable from normal retirement age (age 60) and subject to revaluation increases
between leaving and retirement.
Note 2:
The increase in accrued pension is the accrued pension at 31 December 2003 less the accrued pension at 31 December 2002. The amount
shown in square brackets is calculated on the basis of the disclosure methodology under the requirements of the Listing Requirements of the
UK Listing Authority. 
Note 3:
The transfer values are based on the accrued pensions at 31 December 2002 and at 31 December 2003 and are calculated as at 31 December
2002 and 31 December 2003 respectively based on factors supplied by the actuaries of the relevant pension schemes. The transfer values are
the notional lump sums which would have been paid to another pension scheme for the benefit of the Director had he left service at the
respective dates. It is not possible for a transfer value to be paid directly to the Director personally. The amount shown in square brackets is
calculated on the basis of the disclosure methodology under the requirements of the Listing Requirements of the UK Listing Authority. 
The arrangements for George Mitchell currently provide for some of his benefits to be paid on an unreduced basis only from age 65 (and, in
these circumstances the transfer values (£000) at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 are £2,093 and £2,981) but he has a right, shortly
before age 60, to elect that all his benefits are paid on an unreduced basis at age 60. The transfer values shown in the table for George Mitchell
assume that all of his benefits would be taken on an unreduced basis at age 60. 
Note 4:
The Director’s contribution is the personal contribution required under the terms of the Fund. No personal contribution is required under the
terms of the Scheme. The contribution for James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby are aggregates of the personal contributions required
under the terms of the Fund, subject to the statutory limit, together with the amounts of salary they gave up as additional pension
contributions as outlined in Note 5 to Table 1a. Members of the Group’s pension schemes have the option to pay additional voluntary
contributions; neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table. 
There were no contributions by the Group to any money purchase pension arrangements in respect of any Director during 2003.
Note 5:
The figures for Gordon McQueen ignore the additional cost of awarding a pension without actuarial reduction on retirement on 31 December
2003 of £270,000.

Remuneration Policy Note 2:
The grant effective from January 2000 for Andy Hornby includes 44,248 shares which are related to his joining arrangements.
The grants effective from January 2001 and January 2002 for Phil Hodkinson include 53,435 shares and 43,750 shares, respectively, which are
related to his joining arrangements. 
Note 3:
Awards are not pensionable.
Note 4:
The performance period for the July 1999 grant ended on 31 December 2002. HBOS’s (and previously Halifax’s) TSR over the performance period
exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 5.55% p.a. so 138.75% of the share grant has been released to the grant recipient.
The performance period for the January 2000 grant ended on 31 December 2002. HBOS’s (and previously Halifax’s) TSR over the performance
period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 9.02% p.a. so 200% of share grants have been released to grant recipients.
The shares granted in July 1999 and January 2000 vested on 3 March 2003. The closing market price of the Group’s ordinary shares on that date
was £6.68. In addition, dividend reinvestment shares have been released to grant recipients as set out in the table and as provided for under the
rules of the Plans. The dividend reinvestment shares are the additional shares which would have accrued on the overall share grants actually
released had dividends due during the performance period been reinvested in shares. The shares received by the Executive Directors and the
Chairman from those grants are, after any sales to discharge their personal tax and National Insurance liabilities on such shares, retained by them
or on their behalves for at least an additional two years and are included in Table 4. 
Note 5:
Subject to performance and subject also to a minimum release of 60% of the grant, as agreed by Halifax shareholders at the time of the merger,
the shares granted under the long-term plan effective from January 2001 will be released to most individuals shortly after the three-year
anniversary of the grant date. However, the shares receivable by the Executive Directors and the Chairman from those grants will, after any sales
to discharge their personal tax and National Insurance liabilities on such shares be retained by them or on their behalves for at least an
additional two years.
For the 2002 and 2003 grants, all participants can choose to take any shares released after three years based on the three-year performance
outcome or can continue to participate in the scheme for a further two years and take shares at that point based on the better of the three-
year and the five-year performance outcomes. This design feature seeks to motivate participants continually to sustain strong performance or to
improve lesser performance for their benefit and the benefit of shareholders. This feature will not apply for the 2004 grants or for any grants in
subsequent years.
Note 6:
In the case of the Chairman, it is not possible to include him in the standard Long-term Incentive Plan. Nor is it possible to include him in such
an arrangement where the grant is denominated in shares. He is therefore included as the sole participant in the Special Long-term Incentive
Plan where the grants are awards of notional shares. He will become entitled to the cash value of the relevant shares on vesting but has agreed
that this value will, subject to any withholdings for tax or National Insurance, be applied in acquiring shares on his behalf.
Note 7:
The number of shares to be released to participants is dependent on the Group’s TSR over a three-year (three and a half year in respect of the
grant effective from July 1999) period, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies over an equivalent
period. For the grants effective from January 2002 and January 2003, a five-year period can also apply. This basket of companies comprises:
• For the July 1999 and January 2000 grants: Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester, Bank of Scotland*, Barclays, Britannic Assurance, Legal &
General, Lloyds TSB, NatWest*, Northern Rock, Norwich Union*, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance, Royal Bank of Scotland and Woolwich*;
• For the January 2001 grants: Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester, Bank of Scotland*, Barclays, Britannic Assurance, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB,
Northern Rock, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland;
• For the January 2002 and 2003 grants: Abbey National, Aviva, Barclays, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal
Bank of Scotland.
* For the periods for which they were independent entities.
Shares will be released as follows:
Group’s relative TSR performance Amount released as a % of share grant

+4% p.a. 100*

HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 67 Note 8:
The performance period for the January 2001 grant ended on 31 December 2003. HBOS’s (and previously Halifax’s) TSR over the performance
period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 13.45% p.a. as illustrated in the chart below, so 200% of share grants will be
released to grant recipients, subject to Note 5 above. 
In addition, dividend reinvestment shares will be released to grant recipients as provided for under the rules of the Plans. The dividend
reinvestment shares are the additional shares which would have accrued on the overall share grants actually released had dividends due during
the performance period been reinvested in shares. 
Full details concerning these shares, which will be released to the Chairman and the Executive Directors during 2004, will be contained in the
2004 Annual Report and Accounts.
Performance of Halifax/HBOS for January 2001 awards 
Note 9:
The second grant effective from January 2002 for Andy Hornby relates to a different arrangement which applies only to him. Early in 2003, the
Committee became aware of activity, principally from the retail sector, to secure Andy Hornby’s services. Specifically, he had received a very
attractive job approach to become Group Chief Executive of a major FTSE company. The Committee decided that, at that point in time, it
would clearly be in the interests of shareholders to secure Andy Hornby’s continued services but to do it on a basis where additional reward 
was performance contingent. 
The Committee therefore decided to introduce a special incentive arrangement which gives Andy Hornby the opportunity to receive up to
260,000 shares in April 2005, dependent on growth in the profitability of the Retail Division over 2002 to 2004. In broad terms, the maximum
release under this special arrangement is delivered in April 2005 only if there is at least a 60% increase in the profitability of the Retail Division,
using a like for like comparison, over the three-year period, and provided that Andy Hornby is in the service of the Group at 31 March 2005
having not given notice on or before that date. The Committee established that the incentive would accrue in three equivalent tranches based
on profitability performance to the ends of 2002, 2003 and 2004. At the time of establishment of the incentive, the satisfaction of performance
criteria to the end of 2002 established an immediate retention feature within the scheme. Since then, performance criteria to the end of 2003
have also been satisfied. 
If Andy Hornby leaves employment as a qualifying leaver or in the event of change of control before April 2005, shares will vest by reference 
to the performance targets and his period of employment during the performance period. If he leaves in certain other circumstances, he will
not receive any shares. Changes to certain key terms of the arrangement, in future, will require shareholder approval.
The special incentive is not pensionable. At maturity it will be eligible for the 50% share enhancement described in section 9 if Andy Hornby
retains the shares and remains in the service of the Group until 31 March 2008.
Taken overall, this special incentive increases the maximum annual overall reward value for Andy Hornby by about 25% in each of the three
years until the end of 2004 and by about 12.5% in each of the subsequent three years until the end of 2007.
13.3.4 Long-term Incentive Plan – Former Bank of Scotland Directors
Share options granted between 1995 and 2000 under Bank of Scotland’s plans were subject to a performance pre-condition that options were
not capable of being exercised unless growth in diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) exceeded the growth in the Retail Prices Index over a period
of at least three consecutive financial years by not less than 2% per annum. 
No performance target applied in respect of unapproved share options following the third anniversary of grant, as agreed by Bank of Scotland
stockholders at the time of the merger.
The performance target in respect of approved share options was satisfied on 31 December 2002 for all grants and consequently all approved
options are exercisable in accordance with the rules of the plans.
No further share options have been or will be granted under any of these plans.

of exercise was £7.555. Gordon McQueen retained ownership of these shares as at the date of this report. Details of the market price of the
Group’s ordinary shares during 2003 are given in section 13.3.7.
13.3.5 Sharesave Plan
The Sharesave plan is available to most Group colleagues.
The plan allows colleagues to save a fixed amount of money on a monthly basis. At the end of a pre-determined period, of three, five or seven
years, colleagues have the right, if they so choose, to use the funds accumulated to purchase shares in the Group at a fixed price, based on a
market price or an average market price determined shortly before the effective grant date and discounted by 20%.
Certain Executive Directors have taken up membership of the plan and the projected numbers of shares which they would be entitled to
purchase at the end of the relevant pre-determined periods are set out below:

13.3.6 Interest in Shares under Trusts
Certain Executive Directors, together with certain other colleagues, are deemed to have or have had an interest or a potential interest as
potential discretionary beneficiaries under:
• the Group’s Employee Share Ownership Trust. As such, they were each treated as at 31 December 2003 as being interested in the 9,884,870 ordinary
shares (31 December 2002 – 8,606,603 ordinary shares) held by the trustee of this Trust. The shares held in the Trust will be used to satisfy share
awards under the former Halifax Short-term and Long-term Incentive Plans and the HBOS Short-term and Long-term Incentive Plans. The relevant
Executive Directors’ specific individual interests are shown in Tables 5 and 6;
• the Group’s Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust. As such, they were each treated as at 31 December 2003 as being interested in the 10,154,710
ordinary shares (31 December 2002 – 14,626,075 ordinary shares) held by the trustee of this Trust. On 12 June 2002 HBOS plc purchased the shares
held by the Halifax plc Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust for a consideration of £1,000 and on the same day HBOS plc issued the same
number of new ordinary shares, at their nominal value of 25p per share, to the Trust. The transaction, which was approved by shareholders at the 2002
Annual General Meeting, resolved an outstanding matter from the corporate restructuring of Halifax plc in 1999 and the subsequent merger of Halifax
Group plc and Bank of Scotland in 2001. The Trust was established to satisfy the exercise of rights granted under the HBOS Sharesave Scheme and to
satisfy entitlements of employees of Halifax plc arising on the exercise of options under the Sharesave schemes operated by HBOS plc. The relevant
Executive Directors’ specific individual interests are shown in Table 8; and
• the Group’s Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (previously the Bank of Scotland Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust). However, as the
Trust was not pre-funded, they were each treated as at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 as having no interest as a consequence of this Trust.
The Trust was established to satisfy the exercise of rights granted under the former Bank of Scotland S.A.Y.E. Stock Option Schemes. The relevant
Executive Directors’ specific individual interests are shown in Table 8.
All of the Group’s share plans empower new issue shares to be allotted to satisfy share requirements. The Group’s current practice on releases in
relation to share grants, namely conditional share awards for senior colleagues and both colleague financed and Group matched shares under
the Sharekicker arrangement, is to purchase shares in the market. For share interests through the Group’s share option and Sharesave plans, new
shares are issued.
13.3.7 General
The market price of the Group’s ordinary shares at 31 December 2003 was £7.235. The market price of the Group’s ordinary shares at 31
December 2002 was £6.55. The range during the year was £5.38 to £8.12.
Other than as disclosed in the notes to Table 7, there has been no change in the Directors’ interest in shares or options granted by the Group
between the end of the financial year and 24 February 2004, the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts. 
13.3.8 Statutory Performance Graph
The following graph illustrates the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance compared to that of a “broad equity market index”
since the Group’s inception on 10 September 2001. As HBOS has been a constituent of the FTSE 100 since inception and as performance against
sector companies is illustrated in the chart on page 68, the Group believes that the FTSE 100 is a suitable comparator index to use for the
purposes of this graph to satisfy regulatory requirements.

Remuneration Policy
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 71 Appendix 2
Remuneration in HBOS generally
This section outlines the structure of remuneration in HBOS for the vast majority of colleagues. Each role in HBOS is positioned in one of nine
levels, 1-8 and the Executive Directors. The level of a role is determined by the knowledge required to do it, the challenge of delivering the
required job outputs and the accountability which the role carries. The level then, in broad terms, determines the salary range which can apply
for the role; the short-term and long-term incentive structures; and the range of benefit and product offerings available.
The table below sets out the number of colleagues and full-time equivalents (FTE) in each level and the typical inter-quartile full-time
equivalent salary range applying to colleagues in such a level. Different ranges apply to different groups of colleagues depending on role
specialism and geographic location.
Number of Number of Salary
Level Colleagues FTE Colleagues Range (£’000)
1 37,750 32,750 10.7 – 16.0
2 12,250 11,500 16.1 – 24.1
3 9,250 9,250 22.9 – 34.3
4 4,500 4,500 31.7 – 47.5
5 1,750 1,750 44.7 – 67.0
6 600 600 59.7 – 89.5
7 100 100 97.8 – 146.7
Details of the remuneration arrangements which apply to those in Level 8 and to Executive Directors are given in the main body of the report.
Remuneration is best described, for all colleagues, in terms of four elements, namely salary; short-term incentives; long-term incentives and
benefits. HBOS is increasingly seeking to adopt a “total reward” approach so that colleagues appreciate the totality, the flexibility and the
performance drivers of their reward package.
Salary
HBOS salary policy is to manage salaries in aggregate, by Level, around the appropriate medians. Whilst finance sector generic medians establish
baseline positions, businesses benchmark according to role specialism and to geographic location. The alignment of practice with policy is one
we aspire to deliver by matching average salaries with the market median position, whilst managing actual salaries generally within an 80%-120%
window of the median, reflecting personal skills, experience, performance and business vulnerability.
Short-term incentives
HBOS has moved away from a “one size fits all” share in success bonus (with relatively modest target and maximum payments) to annual
incentives which are operating plan aligned, generally team based and built around line of sight issues. Participants know that these incentives
give a real chance of a zero outcome and, equally, a real chance of a maximum outcome which, in cash terms, is a minimum of 20% of salary.
The cash incentive levels are generally as follows:
Incentive as a percentage of salary
Level Minimum Target Maximum
1-4 0% 10%-12% 20%-30%
5 0% 17.5% 35%
6 0% 25% 50%
7 0% 30% 45%
Long-term incentives
Almost every colleague in HBOS enjoys three (for one Level, four) long-term incentive propositions, each share-based.
Firstly, Sharekicker. Colleagues who choose to buy shares with their net cash incentive get 50% more shares after three years provided they
remain in the service of the Group.
Secondly, Sharesave. Colleagues who choose to save up to £250 per month for between three and seven years are given the option to buy
shares based on the share price at the start of the savings period, discounted by up to 20%.
Thirdly, share options. Colleagues (excluding those at Level 8 and above) have been given share options over 20% of salary in both 2002 and
2003, and these can be crystallised after a minimum of three and a maximum of six years.
Fourthly, share grants. Colleagues in Level 7 have been given share grants over 33.33% of salary in both 2002 and 2003. The level of grant
released is conditional on relative TSR performance against a weighted finance sector basket, over a three-year or five-year period with no grant
released for performance which matches (or is worse than) the average and with twice the grant released for outperformance of 6% p.a. or more
(intermediate positions being determined by interpolation).
Beneﬁts
Our key benefits traditionally fell into the five areas of pensions, holidays, cars, healthcare and mortgage subsidies. We now package them as an
overall flexible benefits proposition and a comprehensive product offering.
Most existing colleagues have defined benefit pension arrangements but all new colleagues are eligible for defined contribution pension
arrangements which include death and ill health benefits.

Financial Statements Directors’ Report
Financial Statements
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 73
The Directors have pleasure in presenting the
Report and Accounts of HBOS plc for the
year ended 31 December 2003.
Principal Activities
HBOS plc is the holding company of the
HBOS Group. The principal activities of the
Group are the provision of banking and other
financial services in the UK and overseas. The
Group’s existing business and future prospects
are reviewed by the Chairman on pages 2 and
3, the Chief Executive on pages 4 to 7 and 
in the Divisional Reviews on pages 8 to 34.
Financial aspects are covered in the Financial
Review and Risk Management report on 
pages 35 to 44. A list of the main subsidiary
undertakings, and the nature of each
company’s business, is given in Note 53 to 
the Accounts on page 119.
Results and Dividends
The Group profit attributable to shareholders
for the year ended 31 December 2003, as
shown in the Consolidated Profit and Loss
Account, was £2,452m. An interim dividend 
of 10.3p per Ordinary Share was paid on 
17 October 2003. The Directors propose 
a final dividend of 20.6p per Ordinary Share 
to be paid on 21 May 2004 to shareholders 
on the register on 12 March 2004, subject to
approval at the 2004 AGM. Under the
Company’s Share Dividend Plan shareholders
will be offered the choice of receiving
additional ordinary shares rather than cash 
in respect of this dividend. 
Directors
Details of the present Directors are given on
pages 50 and 51. Sir Peter Burt and Gordon
McQueen retired as Directors on 6 January
2003 and 31 December 2003, respectively. 
Sir Bob Reid and Louis Sherwood will retire 
at the conclusion of the 2004 AGM and are
not seeking re-election. James Crosby, Phil
Hodkinson and Brian Ivory will retire by
rotation and resolutions for their re-election
will be proposed at the meeting. Kathleen
(Kate) Nealon and David Shearer have been
appointed Directors of the Company with
effect from 23 March 2004 and will both retire
at the forthcoming 2004 AGM and 
offer themselves for election. Particulars of
Directors’ remuneration and interests in shares
of the Company are given in the Report of the
Board in relation to remuneration policy and
practice on pages 55 to 72. 
Going Concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in business
for the foreseeable future and consequently
the going concern basis continues to be
appropriate in preparing the accounts.
Employees
The Group encourages applications for
employment from disabled people and gives
full consideration to such applicants based on
their skills and abilities. In the event of an
existing employee becoming disabled, the
Group provides counselling and training
support and seeks to provide a suitable
alternative position within the Group if the
individual is unable to continue in their
previous role. The Group offers training and
career development for all disabled staff. The
views of colleagues with a disability are
sought through disability forums to ensure
that the Group’s policies continue to
recognise their requirements.
Employee communication issues are reviewed
on page 48. 
Charitable and Political Donations
During the year the Group made charitable
donations in the UK of £5.8m. Additionally
£2.2m in total has been made available to
charities as a result of their affinity to the
Visa Charity credit cards offered by Halifax
plc and Bank of Scotland. 
Payment Policy
For the forthcoming period the Group’s
policy for the payment of suppliers will 
be as follows:
• payment terms will be agreed at the start of
the relationship with the supplier and will
only be changed by agreement;
• standard payment terms to suppliers of
goods and services will be 30 days from
receipt of a correct invoice for satisfactory
goods or services which have been ordered
and received unless other terms are agreed
in a contract;
• payment will be made in accordance with
the agreed terms or in accordance with the
law if no agreement has been made; and
• suppliers will be advised without delay
when an invoice is contested and disputes
will be settled as quickly as possible.
HBOS plc complies with the Better Payment
Practice Code. Information regarding this
Code and its purpose can be obtained from
the Better Payment Practice Group’s website
at www.payontime.co.uk.
The Company’s main trading subsidiary
undertakings, Halifax plc and Bank of
Scotland, had trade creditors outstanding at
31 December 2003 representing 22 days of
purchases for each company.
The Company itself owed no amounts to
trade creditors at 31 December 2003.
Share Capital
Full details of the movements in the
authorised and issued share capital of the
Company during the year are provided in
Note 34 to the Accounts on page 105.
The Company has the authority to purchase
up to 378,564,324 of its ordinary shares. The
authority remains valid until the 2004 AGM
or, if earlier, 29 July 2004. A resolution will be
put to shareholders to renew the authority at
the 2004 AGM. 
At the date of this report there is a
disclosable interest in the issued share capital
notified to the Company in accordance with
sections 198 to 208 of the Companies Act
1985, by Barclays PLC, in respect of
136,610,593 ordinary shares being 3.55% of
the current issued ordinary share capital.
Properties
The Directors are of the opinion that 
the current market value of the Group’s
properties is not significantly different from
the amount at which they are included in 
the balance sheet.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc 
as auditors will be put to shareholders at 
the 2004 AGM.
On behalf of the Board
H F Baines
Company Secretary
24 February 2004 Independent Auditors’ Report
74 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
We have audited the accounts on pages 75 to
120. We have also audited the information in
the Report of the Board in relation to
remuneration policy and practice that is
described on page 57 as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s
members, as a body, in accordance with
section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we
might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing
the Annual Report and Accounts and the
Report of the Board in relation to remuneration
policy and practice. As described on page 54,
this includes responsibility for preparing the
accounts in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our
responsibilities, as independent auditors, are
established in the United Kingdom by statute,
the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority, and by our
profession’s ethical guidance. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether
the accounts give a true and fair view and
whether the accounts and the part of the
Report of the Board in relation to
remuneration policy and practice to be
audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the
accounts, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the
Group is not disclosed. 
We review whether the statement on pages 52
to 53 reflects the Company’s compliance with
the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and
we report if it does not. We are not required
to consider whether the Board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and controls,
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Group’s corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in
the Annual Report and Accounts, including
the corporate governance statement and the
unaudited part of the Report of the Board in
relation to remuneration policy and practice,
and consider whether it is consistent with 
the audited accounts. We consider the
implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the accounts. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the accounts and the part of the Report of
the Board in relation to remuneration policy
and practice to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the accounts, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as 
to obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the accounts 
and the part of the Report of the Board in
relation to remuneration policy and practice
to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information
in the accounts and the part of the Report of
the Board in relation to remuneration policy
and practice to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the accounts give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the Group
as at 31 December 2003 and of the profit of
the Group for the year then ended; and 
• the accounts and the part of the Report 
of the Board in relation to remuneration
policy and practice to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985.

Registered Auditor
Edinburgh
24 February 2004
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of HBOS plc Accounting Policies
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 75
Accounting Convention 
The accounts have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention in compliance
with the special provisions of Part VII of the
Companies Act 1985 applicable to banking
groups modified by the revaluation of items
held for trading purposes and the revaluation
of investment properties. The accounts have
been prepared in accordance with applicable
accounting standards and pronouncements of
the Urgent Issues Task Force (“UITF”) and in
accordance with applicable Statements of
Recommended Practice, being those issued 
by the British Bankers’ Association and the
Finance and Leasing Association.
Accounting policies are reviewed regularly to
ensure they are the most appropriate to the
circumstances of the Group for the purposes
of giving a true and fair view.
Changes in Accounting Policy
Own shares held for the purpose of satisfying
obligations arising from certain share based
compensation schemes amount to £15 million
at 31 December 2003 (2002 – £17 million).
Previously, these were presented within other
assets and as own shares within the
consolidated and company balance sheets,
respectively. Own shares held by the long-
term assurance business policyholders’ fund
amount to £37 million (2002 – £33 million).
Previously, these were presented within long-
term assurance assets attributable to
policyholders within the consolidated balance
sheet. In accordance with UITF Abstract 37
“Purchases and sales of own shares” and UITF
Abstract 38 “Accounting for ESOP trusts” these
shares have been reclassified and are now
shown within other reserves as a deduction
from Shareholders’ Funds.
Basis of Consolidation
i. Consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the results
of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings. The accounts of all principal
subsidiary undertakings are made up to 
31 December. The value of the long-term
assurance business attributable to
shareholders and the assets and liabilities
attributable to policyholders are presented
separately on the consolidated balance 
sheet from those of other businesses in 
order to reflect the different nature of 
the shareholders’ and policyholders’ 
interests therein.
ii. Associated Undertakings (including 
Joint Ventures)
The Group’s share in associated undertakings
is stated in the consolidated balance sheet at
the Group’s share of their net tangible assets
plus attributable goodwill. Joint ventures in
which the Group has a long-term interest and
shares control under a contractual agreement
with other parties are accounted for using the
gross equity method. The attributable share
of results of other associated undertakings,
generally based on audited accounts, is
included in consolidated profit using the
equity method of accounting. 
iii. Goodwill
The excess of the fair value of purchase
consideration over the fair value of net assets
at the date of acquisition of subsidiary
undertakings, associated undertakings
(including joint ventures) and other businesses
arising on acquisitions after 31 December
1997 is capitalised. This goodwill is amortised
by equal instalments over its estimated useful
life, not exceeding 20 years. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 
1 January 1998 was written off to reserves 
in the year in which it arose and has not 
been reinstated, as permitted by Financial
Reporting Standard (“FRS”) 10 “Goodwill 
and Intangible Assets” . On the disposal of
subsidiary undertakings and other businesses
any related goodwill charged directly to
reserves prior to 1 January 1998 is reinstated
and included in the calculation of the profit
or loss on disposal.
Goodwill carried in the consolidated balance
sheet is subject to impairment review when
events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable and is written down by the
amount of any impairment loss identified 
in the year. Impairment charges, if any, are
included within goodwill amortisation.
Long-term Assurance Business
The Group accounts for the income from its
long-term assurance business using the
embedded value basis. The income represents
the change in the surplus attributable to the
Group, including minority interests, and the
net present value of the in-force business.
The value is a prudent estimate of the net
present value of future cash flows
attributable to the shareholders, based on 
the market value of the assets at the balance
sheet date, using assumptions which reflect
experience and a long-term outlook for the
economy and then discounting at an
appropriate risk discount rate. 
General Insurance Business
The Group both underwrites and acts as
intermediary in the sale of general insurance
products. For each general insurance policy
underwritten, premiums (net of refunds) 
are credited to net operating income over 
the duration of the insurance policy.
Premiums received relating to future
accounting periods are deferred as accruals
and deferred income and credited to net
operating income when earned.
The cost of claims notified but not settled 
and claims incurred but not reported at the
balance sheet date are estimated and provided
for. Estimates are based upon an assessment 
of the likely costs taking account of all known
facts. Where the outcome of outstanding cases
is unclear, statistical techniques are used which
take into account the cost of recent similar
claim settlements. Claims equalisation
provisions are calculated in accordance with
relevant legislation and guidance.
Where the Group acts as intermediary,
commission income net of provisions for
expected future policy cancellations and claims
handling is credited to fees and commissions at
the commencement of each insurance policy.
Loans and Advances
Loans and advances are held at cost 
less provisions.
Specific provisions are made for advances that
are recognised to be bad or doubtful. Specific
provisions are assessed on a case by case 
basis or, where this is not practical, as part 
of a portfolio of similar advances using loan
loss estimation models. A general provision, 
to cover advances that are latently bad or
doubtful, but not yet identified as such, is 
also maintained based on loan loss estimation
models. The models reflect the historical 
loan loss experience relevant to the particular
market segment or product and include
adjustments for economic and business
climate factors and management experience. 
Provisions made during the year are charged to
the profit and loss account, net of recoveries.
If the collection of interest is considered
doubtful, it is suspended and excluded from
interest income in the profit and loss
account. Provisions and suspended interest
are written off to the extent that there is no
longer any realistic prospect of recovery. 
Securitisation
Loans and advances to customers include
advances that are subject to non-returnable
finance arrangements following securitisation
of portfolios of mortgages and other advances.
The principal benefits of these advances were
acquired by special purpose securitisation
companies which fund their purchase primarily
through the issue of floating rate notes. In
accordance with FRS 5, “Reporting the
Substance of Transactions” , the proceeds of
these note issues are shown as a deduction
from the securitised assets on the face of the
balance sheet.
Finance Leases, Instalment Credit and
Operating Leases
Assets leased to customers which transfer
substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the customer are classified as
finance leases and, together with instalment
credit agreements, are recorded within loans
and advances to customers or loans and
advances to banks. The net investment in
Accounting Policies Accounting Policies continued
Accounting Policies
76 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 
finance leases and instalment credit
agreements represents total minimum
payments less gross earnings allocated to
future periods. Obligations under finance
leases with third party lessors are included 
in customer accounts.
All other assets leased to customers are
classified as operating leases. These assets 
are separately disclosed in the balance sheet
and are recorded at cost less aggregate
depreciation.
Income from finance leases and instalment
credit agreements is credited to interest
receivable using an actuarial method to give 
a constant periodic return on the net cash
investment. Operating lease rentals are
recognised in other operating income on 
a straight line basis with depreciation charged
using an actuarial method to give a constant
periodic return on the net cash investment. 
Unguaranteed residual values in respect of
both finance lease and operating lease assets
are reviewed regularly and any impairments
identified are charged to operating expenses.
Debt Securities
(i) Debt securities and other fixed interest
securities held for trading are included at
market value with gains or losses included in
dealing profits. The difference between the
cost and market value of securities held for
trading is not disclosed as its determination 
is not practicable.
(ii) Debt securities and other fixed interest
securities held for the longer term are
included at cost less amounts written off and
adjusted for the amortisation of premiums or
discounts arising on purchase of investments
redeemable at fixed dates. Such premiums or
discounts are taken to interest receivable on a
straight line basis over the period to
redemption. The use of a straight line basis
does not result in a material difference to the
amount of amortisation taken to interest
receivable compared to the amortisation had
a level gross yield basis been used. Gains or
losses on realisation are recorded in other
operating income as they arise.
(iii) Debt securities sold subject to repurchase
agreements are retained within the balance
sheet where the Group retains substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Funds received under these arrangements 
are included within deposits by banks or
customer accounts. Conversely, debt securities
acquired under commitments to resell are 
not recognised in the balance sheet as debt
securities where substantially all the risks and
rewards do not pass to the Group. In this case,
the purchase price is included within loans
and advances to banks or loans and advances
to customers. The difference between sale
and repurchase prices for such transactions is
reflected in the profit and loss account over
the lives of the transactions, within interest
payable or interest receivable as appropriate.
Equity Shares
Equity shares held for investment are stated
at cost less amounts written off. Income from
listed equity shares is credited to other
operating income on the ex-dividend date
and from unlisted equity shares on an
equivalent basis.
Investment Properties
Investment properties are accounted for in
accordance with Statement of Standard
Accounting Practice (“SSAP”) 19, “Accounting
for Investment Properties” and are revalued
annually to open market value. Changes in
market value are reflected in the revaluation
reserve except when an impairment is deemed
to be permanent, when the loss is charged
directly against the current year’s profit.
No depreciation is provided in respect of
investment properties. This treatment is a
departure from the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985 which requires all
properties to be depreciated. However, the
Directors consider that these properties are
not held for consumption but for investment
and that to depreciate them would not give a
true and fair view. The amount of depreciation
which might otherwise have been charged
cannot be separately identified or quantified as
it is not practical to assess the estimated useful
lives for investment properties.
Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold
and leasehold property, other than freehold
investment properties, is stated at cost and
depreciated over 50 years or the length of
the lease term if shorter. Improvements to
leasehold properties with unexpired lease
terms of 50 years or less are stated at cost
and are depreciated in equal instalments over
the lesser of the remaining life of the lease or
eight years. Premiums are amortised over the
period of the lease.
The cost of equipment, including fixtures 
and fittings, vehicles and computer hardware,
less estimated residual value, is written off 
in equal instalments over the expected lives
of the assets, generally between three and
fifteen years. Software development costs
which lead to the creation of a definable
software asset, subject to a de minimis limit,
are capitalised and depreciated over their
expected lives, generally four years.
Provision is made for the diminution in value
of any tangible fixed asset where impairment Accounting Policies
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 77
account as incurred. For certain categories of
business, fees are amortised over a period not
exceeding four years.
Mortgage Incentives
All costs associated with mortgage incentive
schemes are charged in full in the year in
which the expense is incurred.
Retirement Beneﬁts
The cost of providing retirement pensions
and related benefits is charged against profits
on a systematic basis over the employees’
service lives in accordance with SSAP 24
“Accounting for pension costs” . 
Foreign Currencies
Assets, liabilities and profit and loss
accounts are translated at the rates of
exchange ruling on the balance sheet date 
or at the forward exchange rate, as
appropriate. Exchange differences arising 
on the translation of foreign equity
investments are taken to reserves and are
offset by corresponding differences arising
on the translation of related borrowing. 
All other exchange differences are included
in dealing profits.
Collateral and Netting
The Group nets loans, deposits and derivative
transactions where it enters into master
agreements with counterparties to ensure
that if an event of default occurs all amounts
outstanding with these counterparties will be
settled on a net basis. Where the master
agreements are collateralised, the collateral
will take the form of a lien over the
counterparty’s assets thereby enabling the
Group to claim on these assets in respect of
existing and future liabilities.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments used for
trading and non-trading purposes include
interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps,
futures, options, forward rate agreements 
and caps, floors and collars.
(i) Trading derivatives, which include customer
driven and proprietary transactions and
hedges thereof, are carried in the accounts 
at fair value with gains or losses included in
dealing profits. The fair value is based on
quoted market prices. Where representative
market prices are not available, the fair value
is determined from appropriate financial
models using the actual or modelled cash
flows. Fair value adjustments are made, where
appropriate, to cover credit risk, liquidity risk
and future administrative costs. 
(ii) Non-trading derivatives, which are used
primarily as a risk management tool for
hedging interest rate and foreign exchange rate
risk arising on on-balance sheet assets and
liabilities, are accounted for on the same basis
as the underlying items being hedged.
In order to qualify as a hedge, a derivative
must effectively reduce any risk inherent in
the hedged item from potential movements
in interest rates, exchange rates and market
values. Changes in the fair value of the
derivative must be highly correlated with
changes in the fair value of the underlying
hedged item over the life of the hedge
contract. Gains and losses on instruments
used for hedging purposes are not recognised
until the exposure that is being hedged is
itself recognised. Where a hedge transaction
is terminated early, any profit or loss is spread
over the remainder of the original life of the
hedge contract. In other circumstances,
where the underlying item subject to the
hedge is extinguished, the hedge transaction
is measured at fair value and any profit or loss
is recognised immediately.
is identified. The resulting net book value 
of the asset is written off over its remaining
expected economic life. Impairment charges
are included within operating expenses.
Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting,
in respect of all timing differences between
the treatment of certain items for taxation
and accounting purposes which have arisen
but not reversed by the balance sheet date
(except as otherwise required by FRS 19),
based on the corporation tax rate expected
when the timing differences reverse.
Dated and Undated Loan Capital
Dated and undated loan capital is included 
at the nominal value adjusted for premiums,
discounts and expenses, all of which are
amortised evenly over the period to
redemption or reset. This does not result 
in a material difference to the amount of
amortisation had a level gross yield basis
been used.
Interest Receivable and Payable
Interest receivable and payable is recognised
in the profit and loss account on an accruals
basis.
Fees and Commissions
Arrangement fees and commissions receivable
for the continuing servicing of loans and
advances are recognised on the basis of 
work done. Those receivables in respect 
of bearing risk, including premiums received
by the Group on high loan to value
mortgages, are recognised on a straight 
line basis over the expected period of the
advance or risk exposure. Other fees are
recognised when receivable. 
Fees and commissions payable to third parties
are normally charged to the profit and loss Consolidated Proﬁt and Loss Account

8. Pension Costs 
The Group operates several pension schemes. The principal defined benefit schemes are the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 
1976 Pension Scheme (together, “the Schemes”), which are funded schemes. These Schemes cover 89 per cent of the Group’s pensionable
employees in schemes providing defined benefits, based on final pensionable salary. The assets of the Schemes are held in Trust Funds which
are independent of the Group’s own assets.
In determining the level of contributions required to be made to the Schemes and the relevant charges to the Group’s profit and loss account,
the Group has been independently advised by Watson Wyatt LLP, Actuaries and Consultants. The most recently published formal valuations of
the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme were carried out as at 31 March 2003 and 31 December 2001,
respectively. The financial assumptions are derived based upon the economic conditions prevailing at the date of valuation. The different
assumptions between the two Schemes are as a consequence of their differing valuation dates. The main financial assumptions adopted for
these calculations were as follows:
Bank of Scotland
Halifax Retirement Fund 1976 Pension Scheme
Rates per annum Rates per annum
Future price inflation 2.50 per cent 2.50 per cent
Return on new investments 6.75 per cent 6.60 per cent
Return on existing investments 7.10 per cent 6.00 per cent
Increases in earnings
(1)
3.50
(3)
per cent 3.50 per cent
Increases in pensions
(2)
3.25
(4)
per cent 2.50 per cent
Notes:
(1) In addition to the general assumed rate of salary increases, there is a separate assumed salary scale of increases due to promotions and increasing seniority.
(2) The pension increase is on the excess over the Guaranteed Minimum Pension.
(3) This assumption applies for the first five years and thereafter 4% pa is assumed.
(4) The pension increase assumption reflects the guaranteed minimum increase of 3% pa applying in the Halifax Retirement Fund.
The pension costs for accounting purposes have been calculated using the same assumptions as those adopted for the formal valuations with
the exception that note (3) above does not apply.
The following disclosures are based on these assumptions using the projected unit method of valuation:
Bank of Scotland 
Halifax Retirement Fund 1976 Pension Scheme
Effective date of valuation 31/3/2003 31/12/2001
Market value of assets £1,339m £1,409m
Asset cover level 85 per cent 98 per cent
Regular pension charge 15.0 per cent* 15.9 per cent
(as a percentage of pensionable salaries)
* This charge will reduce to 12.9% from April 2004 following a change to the scheme rules to remove a 3% pa minimum pension increase. 86 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003

8. Pension Costs continued
The asset cover levels disclosed in the previous table represent the ratios of the respective Schemes’ assets to the value of the benefits that 
had accrued to members and pensioners at the valuation dates after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pensions.
The regular pension charges have been adjusted by spreading surplus assets or shortfalls in each of the Schemes over the average future
working lifetimes of the memberships (15 years for the Halifax Retirement Fund and 16 years for the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme) 
by fixed capital instalments plus interest on the reducing balances. These elements, together with interest on the opening balance sheet
positions result in a charge of £74 million (2002 – £12 million) in respect of the Halifax Retirement Fund and £56 million (2002 – £54 million) 
in respect of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme. Included within the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme charge is an exceptional
charge of £1 million (2002 – £1 million). The increase in the current pension cost for the Halifax Retirement Fund reflects the formal triennial
valuation at 31 March 2003.
Contributions to the Schemes of £138 million were paid over the period. As contributions differed from the amount charged in the Profit and
Loss Account a pension prepayment of £36 million (2002 – £35 million) in respect of the Halifax Retirement Fund and a provision of £75 million
(2002 – £82 million) for future contributions in respect of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme are included in the Balance Sheet. This
leads to an aggregate provision of £39 million (2002 – £47 million). The Group currently contributes to the Halifax Retirement Fund at a rate of
15.1% of pensionable salaries, plus 0.3% of life assurance only members’ pensionable salaries plus additional lump sum payments of £2.5 million
per month and to the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme at a rate of 16.6% of pensionable salaries.
The pension costs charged in the Profit and Loss Account include £26 million (2002 – £27 million) relating to schemes other than the Schemes.
These costs are net of an amount of £6 million (2002 – £7 million) in respect of The Equitable Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (“The
Equitable Pension Scheme”) which The Equitable is obliged to reimburse to the Group. 
Other Post-Retirement Beneﬁts
The Group also provides post-retirement health care benefits and concessionary rate mortgages for certain pensioners and dependent spouses.
An independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2003 estimated the present value of the accumulated other post-retirement benefit
obligations at £40 million for the Group (2002 – £38 million). The main additional financial assumption used was that over the long-term the
rate of increase in health care costs would be 6.75% per annum, being 4.25% per annum higher than the rate of inflation. The charge for the
year ended 31 December 2003 for other post-retirement benefits was £3 million (2002 – £2 million). Included in provisions for liabilities and
charges is £37 million (2002 – £35 million) which represents the accrued amount for other post-retirement benefits.
FRS 17
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 the Group continues to account for retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP 24 as detailed
above. The following additional disclosures under FRS 17 are required by way of narrative only.
The actuarial valuations used in assessing the FRS 17 disclosures are:
• the Halifax Retirement Fund valuation as at 31 March 2003
• the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme valuation as at 31 December 2001
These are the principal schemes for the Group but additional FRS 17 disclosure has been provided for all other defined benefit schemes within
the Group. These are detailed below under the heading “Other Schemes” . 
For the Schemes and Other Schemes, each actuarial valuation is updated by qualified actuaries, principally Watson Wyatt LLP, to take account 
of the requirements of FRS 17 and to assess the assets and liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2003. Scheme assets are stated at their
market value at 31 December 2003. 
The liabilities of the Schemes and Other Schemes under FRS 17 were calculated using the Projected Unit method using the following financial
assumptions:
Rates per annum Rates per annum Rates per annum
31 December 2003 31 December 2002 31 December 2001
Future price inflation 2.8 per cent 2.4 per cent 2.5 per cent
Discount rate 5.6 per cent 5.8 per cent 6.0 per cent
Increases in earnings
(1)
3.8 per cent 3.4 per cent 3.5 per cent
Increases in pensions
(2)
2.8 per cent 2.4 per cent 2.5 per cent
Notes:
(1) In addition to the general assumed rate of salary increases, there is a separate assumed salary scale of increases due to promotions and increasing seniority.
(2) The pension increase is on the excess over the Guaranteed Minimum Pension. Pensions which are guaranteed to increase at a rate of 3.0 per cent per annum have been assumed to increase 
at 3.25 per cent for the 2003 calculations (3.0 per cent for previous calculations).
The above rates apply to all Other Schemes with the exception of the schemes within Bank of Scotland (Ireland) Ltd, which are not significant.
The Schemes are closed to new entrants. Under the Projected Unit method, the current service cost will increase as members of the Schemes
approach retirement. HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 87

Other Post-Retirement Beneﬁts
An independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2003 estimated the present value of the accumulated other post-retirement benefit
obligations under FRS 17 at £44 million (2002 – £40 million) for the Group. There are no assets backing these obligations, and hence the
notional balance sheet provision under FRS 17 is also £44 million (2002 – £40 million). The notional charge in relation to these benefits
amounted to £3 million (2002 – £3 million). The main additional financial assumption used was that the long-term rate of increase in health
care costs would be 5.6% per annum, which is in line with the discount rate.

12. Earnings per Ordinary Share
Basic and diluted earnings per Ordinary Share are based upon Group profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders of £2,415 million 
(2002 – £1,879 million). The underlying earnings per Ordinary Share are based upon Group profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders (before
exceptional items and goodwill amortisation but after tax) of £2,602 million (2002 – £2,083 million). For the basic and underlying earnings per
Ordinary Share the weighted average number of 25p Ordinary Shares of 3,800 million (2002 – 3,716 million) is used and for the diluted earnings per
Ordinary Share the weighted average number of actual and potential 25p Ordinary Shares of 3,823 million (2002 – 3,743 million) is used. Group
profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders equals profit attributable to shareholders of £2,452 million (2002 – £1,916 million) less preference
dividends of £37 million (2002 – £37 million). The weighted average number of actual and potential Ordinary Shares in issue is detailed below:

These special purpose companies, all of which are ultimately beneficially owned by charitable trusts, have been funded primarily through the
issue of floating rate notes. Neither the Company nor its subsidiary undertakings are required to support any losses that may be suffered by the
noteholders in accordance with the terms of the notes nor is it intended to do so. Repayment of the non-recourse funding facilities will be
made solely from the cashflows generated by the underlying loan portfolios. When all liabilities to the noteholders have been discharged any
proceeds from assets in addition to the non-returnable amounts already received in the securitisation companies accrue to the Company or its
subsidiary undertakings.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiary undertakings have the right or obligation to repurchase any securitised advance unless it has been in
breach of warranty.
HBOS Group undertakings and third parties have entered into a number of interest rate swaps with the securitisation undertakings, the
intention of which is to swap all or part of the interest flows from customers into variable rate interest flows to match the variable rate interest
payable to the noteholders. 
In March 2003 £4,762 million of mortgage loans were securitised through Permanent Financing (No. 2) PLC. In June 2003 £2,261 million of
mortgage loans were securitised through Mound Financing (No. 3) PLC. In November 2003, £4,500 million of mortgage loans were securitised
through Permanent Financing (No. 3) PLC.
In aggregate the securitisation undertakings had net interest income of £27.4 million (2002 – £8.8 million), operating expenses of £17.6 million
(2002 – £6.3 million), provisions for bad and doubtful debts of £9.8 million (2002 – £2.5 million), resulting in a profit for the year of £nil million
(2002 – £nil). HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 93

15. Loans and Advances to Customers continued
Loans and advances include mortgage advances of £6,415 million which have been sold by a subsidiary of the Company to bankruptcy remote
special purpose vehicles, funded by the issue of Covered Bonds on terms whereby the rewards and some of the risks of the portfolio have been
retained by the subsidiary. Accordingly, these mortgage advances have been retained on the Group’s balance sheet with the Covered Bonds
being included within debt securities in issue (Note 30). During 2002, the Group securitised a portfolio of mortgage advances which also did
not qualify for linked presentation. At 31 December 2003, loans and advances include £290 million (2002 – £300 million) in respect of this
securitisation (Note 30).
16. Non-performing Assets
Non-performing loans and advances amount to £4,951 million (2002 – £4,206 million) including £1,107 million (2002 – £1,192 million) of
advances on which interest is being held in suspense. Net of provisions and interest in suspense, non-performing loans and advances amount 
to £2,551 million (2002 – £2,041 million).

27. Long-term Assurance Business
The value of long-term assurance business comprises the surplus attributable to the Group, including minority interests, together with the net
present value of in-force business. This method is known as the embedded value approach.
The principal economic assumptions are reviewed annually and are as follows:
2003 2002
% %
Risk discount rate (net of tax) 8.0 8.5
Return on equities (net of tax credits) 7.5 7.5
Return on Gilts (gross of tax) 5.0 5.0
Expense inflation 3.0 3.0
In-force business is defined as all live policies where the first premium has been paid. For traditional with profits business, the surplus
attributable to the Group equates to one ninth of the bonuses declared in any year. The level of assumed future bonuses is calculated by
projecting the portfolio of with profits business forward and applying reversionary and terminal bonus rates so as to exhaust the projected
surplus of assets attributable to with profit policyholders. For all other business, the entire surplus is attributable to the Group.
The income from long-term assurance business is calculated as follows:
2003 2002
£ million £ million
Closing value of Group’s interest in long-term assurance business including minority interests 3,950 3,544
Opening value of Group’s interest in long-term assurance business including minority interests (3,544) (3,065)

Derivatives (options and futures) are used for efficient portfolio management of the long-term assurance business and to match obligations 
to policyholders. These derivatives are included within investments above at market value.
In accordance with UITF 37 “Purchase and sales of own shares” , long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders have been reduced by
£37 million (2002 restated – £33 million) in respect of a holding in HBOS plc shares within the policyholders fund.
Insurance companies and insurance groups report their income from long-term assurance business on the “Modified Statutory Solvency Basis”
(“MSSB”) in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers which is only applicable to
the accounts of such companies and groups. Under this approach, the profit reported is the surplus or deficit calculated for statutory solvency
purposes with prescribed adjustments to technical provisions and the deferral of certain costs of acquiring business.

Profits calculated using MSSB use the same long-term assumptions as required to assess the regulatory solvency but with certain prescribed
accounting adjustments. Because of the conservative nature of the current solvency regulations new business is normally reported as a loss in
the year of sale.

Unclaimed shares comprise the net sale proceeds of certain Halifax Group plc ordinary shares which, following the Halifax Group restructuring
which took effect on 1 June 1999, represented Halifax plc ordinary shares. These shares were issued to meet claims for Halifax plc ordinary shares
from qualifying members of Halifax Building Society and others following the transfer of business from Halifax Building Society to Halifax plc in
1997. This liability also includes the related unclaimed dividends up to the date of sale and the unclaimed capital payments arising from the
Halifax Group restructuring in 1999. These amounts are being held on behalf of the persons who would have been entitled to claim the shares
before they were sold. Amounts representing the sale proceeds together with the unclaimed capital payments can be claimed during a period of
nine years from the date of sale (30 August 2001), after which time they will be forfeited. Amounts representing the related unclaimed dividends
can be claimed during the period of twelve years from the date of the resolution for payment of each dividend, after which time they will be
forfeited. Following an internal reorganisation on 1 July 2002, responsibility for these balances was assumed by HBOS plc.

40. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are based on market prices where available, or are estimated using other valuation
techniques. Where they are short-term in nature or reprice frequently, fair value approximates to carrying value.
Derivatives held for trading purposes as disclosed in Note 39 are carried at fair values. Derivatives held for non-trading purposes are accounted
for in the same way as the underlying transaction being hedged. Fair values are based on market prices where available, or are estimated using
other valuation techniques.

43. Trading Value at Risk
The Group’s Value at Risk (VaR) methodology of estimating potential losses arising from the Group’s exposure to market risk is explained on
page 43 of the Financial Review and Risk Management report. The Group’s trading market risk exposure for the year ended 31 December 2003 is
analysed below.

48. Acquisitions and Disposals
(a) Acquisitions
On 31 January 2003 the Group acquired Rothschild Asset Management International Holdings BV (“RAM”) for £60 million including costs of
acquisition. The book value of net assets acquired was £17 million with no fair value adjustments required, creating a balance of goodwill on the
acquisition of £43 million.
On 4 April 2003 the Group acquired the business of the Joint Affinity Credit Card Business developed through Transnational Group Services
International Inc. and its UK based subsidiary, Transnational Financial Services Ltd (“Transnational”) for a cash consideration of £96 million
including costs of acquisition. The book value of net assets acquired was £23 million with no material fair value adjustments required creating a
balance of goodwill on the acquisition of £73 million.
On 26 August 2003, HBOS plc, through its subsidiary undertaking Scottish Western Australia Holdings Pty Ltd acquired all of the ordinary shares
of Bank of Western Australia Ltd (“BankWest”) which it did not already own. The total consideration including costs of acquisition amounted to
£436 million. The minority interest acquired amounted to £229 million with no material fair value adjustments being required creating a balance
of goodwill on the acquisition of £207 million.
The acquisition method of accounting has been applied to each of these acquisitions. Goodwill is being amortised over 10 years in respect of
RAM and 20 years in respect of Transnational and BankWest reflecting the periods over which the economic benefits are expected to arise.
The following table summarises the effects of these acquisitions.

The effect on the Group’s profit and loss account from the respective dates of acquisition to 31 December 2003 is not material.
(b) Equitable Life Assurance Society (“The Equitable”)
In accordance with the terms of the acquisition of the operating assets, sales-force and unit-linked and non-profit business of The Equitable 
in March 2001, contingent consideration of up to £250 million may become payable. This is dependent on the extent to which certain new
business sales and profitability targets are achieved in 2003 and 2004 by the distribution channel acquired. No provision has been made at 
31 December 2003 as it is not currently expected that any payment will be made.

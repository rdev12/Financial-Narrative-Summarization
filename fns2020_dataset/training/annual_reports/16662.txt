Introduct Ion to vesuv Ius Steel division
The continuous casting of steel is a highly demanding 
process that is critically dependent upon consistent product 
quality and optimised production. Vesuvius provides systems, 
products and services that allow steel mills to control the 
flow of molten metal in the continuous and ingot casting 
processes. Our products protect the steel from oxidation and 
chemical contamination, increasing efficiency and productivity, 
enhancing quality, reducing environmental footprint and 
improving the safety of the casting process. 
Steel Flow Control supplies products used to channel 
and control the flow of molten steel from ladle to tundish 
and from tundish to mould; slide-gate refractories for 
furnace, ladle and tundish; slide gate systems; temperature 
measurement and slag level detection; tundish and mould 
fluxes; and control devices to monitor and regulate steel flow 
into the mould. 
These products have been designed to resist extreme 
thermomechanical stress and corrosive environments. The 
majority of these products are consumed during the process of 
making steel and, consequently, demand is primarily linked to 
steel production volumes. 
Products of the Advanced Refractories product line include 
specialist refractory materials for lining steelmaking vessels 
such as blast furnaces, ladles and tundishes. These are in the 
form of powder mixes, which are spray-applied onto the vessel 
to be lined (“monolithics“) and, to a lesser extent, refractory 
shapes (e.g. bricks, pads and dams). Vesuvius is one of the 
world’s largest manufacturers of monolithic refractory linings 
for vessels subject to extreme temperatures, corrosion and 
abrasion. Key success factors in the Advanced Refractories 
product line are installation technologies, products adapted 
to fit customers’ processes and effective and efficient logistics 
services. These factors are successfully combined by Vesuvius’ 
R&D centres, its knowledge of customers’ processes and its 
project management capability to deliver market-leading 
solutions to our customers.
Foundry division
Vesuvius’ Foundry division, trading as Foseco, is a world leader 
in the supply of consumable products and associated services 
for use in the foundry casting industry.  
The foundry process is highly sequential and, similar to 
the continuous casting of steel, is critically dependent on 
consistency of quality and productivity optimisation. The 
Foundry division’s solutions allow foundries to reduce defects 
(and hence reduce labour-intensive fettling and cleaning), 
minimise metal usage requirements (hence reducing 
cost, energy usage and mould size), influence the metal 
solidification process (increasing metal performance and 
reducing the weight of pieces) and automate the moulding 
and casting process for gains in productivity, ease of 
reproduction and overall yield. 
 The conditioning of molten metal, the nature of the mould 
used and, especially, the design of the way metal flows into 
the mould are key parameters in a foundry, determining both 
the quality of the finished castings and the labour, energy 
and metal usage efficiency of the foundry. Vesuvius provides 
consumable products and associated services to foundries 
that improve these parameters.

John McDonough CBE
Chairman
I am pleased to be able to report on a successful 
first year for Vesuvius plc (the”Company”). There 
is no doubt that your Company has benefited 
from the independent status and greater focus it 
has enjoyed since its creation as a result of the 
demerger of Cookson Group in December 2012. 
This is reflected both in our very solid trading 
performance and in the strategic progress 
achieved. 
Since the demerger, the Board has taken 
important further steps structurally to transform 
the business. In the first quarter of 2013, we 
completed the restructuring of the Fused Silica 
business and in May we completed the disposal 
of the Precious Metals Processing division. As 
a result, Vesuvius is now a fully focused molten 
metal engineering company, principally serving 
the global steel and foundry industries. We enjoy 
global leadership positions in those markets, 
providing technologically advanced products 
and services that are critical to our customers’ 
efficiency and therefore their profitability.
The benefits of this greater focus and strong 
competitive positioning can be seen in our 
financial results for 2013. Against stable but 
relatively subdued market conditions overall, our 
profit performance improved over the prior year 
with, importantly, our margins benefiting from 
the internal performance improvement initiatives 
that have been implemented. Cash generation 
remained strong, and our balance sheet is robust.
Strategy
The Board is responsible for setting the strategic 
direction of your Company, and for ensuring 
that the business model, remuneration and 
all associated key performance indicators are 
aligned to its successful delivery. 
Our strategy, which remains consistent with that 
set out at the time of the demerger, is to capitalise 
on our leading position in molten metal flow 
engineering to create sustainable shareholder 
value. We aim to do this by:
•	 reinforcing our technology and innovation 
leadership positions
•	 enlarging our addressable markets through 
the increasing penetration of existing and new 
value-creating solutions
•	 leveraging our strong positions in developing 
markets to capture the growth opportunities 
that they represent
•	 improving our cost leadership and our 
margins, and
•	 building organically, and where appropriate 
through carefully evaluated acquisitions, 
an increasingly comprehensive product and 
technical services offering.
Our flexible business model is capable of 
delivering attractive levels of profit and cash over 
the cycle and in the face of changing market 
conditions. Firm financial and capital discipline is 
a central strategic priority. 
Further detail on our strategy, and on its 
execution during 2013, is set out within the 
Strategic Report on pages 10 to 47. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend 
of 10.25 pence per share for 2013. This would 
result in a total dividend for the year of 15 pence 
per share, an increase on Vesuvius’ share of 
the full year Cookson Group dividend for 2012 
of 5.3%. The final dividend, if approved at the 
Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 
23 May 2014 to shareholders on the register 
at 25 April 2014.

A successful first year for Vesuvius plc
Vesuvius plc
 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 06
www.vesuvius.com 22904-04  26 March 2014 4:57 PM  Proof 2
Vesuvius is a cash generative and well-invested 
business. Our dividend policy aims to deliver 
long-term dividend growth, provided that 
this is supported by underlying earnings, cash 
flows, capital expenditure requirements and the 
prevailing market outlook. 
Capital Discipline
Alongside dividends, capital discipline plays a 
part in our commitment to delivering superior 
returns to our shareholders. Having completed 
the disposal of the Precious Metals Processing 
division for €56.8 million in May 2013, the 
Company returned some £30 million of those 
proceeds to shareholders by way of an on-
market share repurchase programme which 
concluded in September, with the balance 
being applied to the reduction of net debt. 
Consequently, during the year we returned  
£70 million to shareholders as a result of the 
payment of dividends and the repurchase of our 
shares. 
In December, we further strengthened our 
financial position through the issue of  
c.US$100 million of US Private Placement 
loan notes with a good mix of maturities out 
to 2028. With our balance sheet strength and 
cash generative characteristics, we remain in a 
strong position to fund attractive future growth 
opportunities. 
Reporting
The Board has concluded that this Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and that it provides the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, 
business model and performance, as well as our 
approach to and performance in the important 
areas of gender diversity, human rights, 
environmental impact and specifically our direct 
carbon emissions. Further detail on these can 
be found within the Strategic Report referred to 
above.
Board Composition 
A substantially new Board of Directors was 
appointed in late 2012 as a result of the 
demerger and strengthened further on 1 March 
2013 by the appointment of Nelda Connors as a 
Non-executive Director. Having served nine years 
as Non-executive Directors of Cookson Group plc 
prior to the demerger, both John Sussens and Jan 
Oosterveld retired from the Board, as planned, 
at the close of the Annual General Meeting on 4 
June 2013. I would like to thank them for their 
considerable contribution to the successful start- 
up of Vesuvius plc. John Sussens was succeeded 
as Senior Independent Director by Jeff Hewitt 
and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
by Jane Hinkley. There have been no further 
changes to the Board since that date. With our 
strong diversity and appropriate mix of skills and 
experience, I am confident that the Board has 
operated effectively in its first full year.
In September 2013, Henry Knowles was 
appointed as Company Secretary and General 
Counsel, succeeding Richard Malthouse. On 
behalf of the Board, I thank Richard for his 
important contribution to the Company over 
many years.
The composition, responsibilities and operation 
of the Board, and Directors’ Biographies are set 
out within the Governance Report on pages 54 
to 60 and 50 to 51, respectively. 
Governance 
The Board is responsible for setting Group 
strategy and charging the executive with 
the delivery of that strategy, including the 
management of resources and associated risks 
and controls. Given the broad international 
spread of the business, the Board considers that 
risk management is a significant priority and 
consequently places considerable emphasis on 
this area within its overall governance agenda. 
Throughout 2013 we have operated under a 
robust governance structure which also complied 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code. We 
continue to evolve our governance arrangements 
to comply with emerging best practice and we 
firmly believe that strong corporate governance 
is central to the delivery of sustainable long-term 
shareholder value.  
The Board is committed to embedding the 
right culture throughout the Group and the 
Company’s Code of Conduct clearly sets out the 
values and behaviour that we expect from all our 
people. Further details are set out on page 39 of 
the Strategic Report.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 
11.00 am on 15 May 2014 at the Lincoln Centre, 
18 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London. The Notice of the 
Meeting and explanatory notes accompany this 
Annual Report. I look forward to the opportunity 
to meet as many of our shareholders as possible 
at that time.
Our People
Our success over the past year has been in 
large part down to the talent and efforts of our 
people. We continue to invest in our people – in 
their training, development (see pages 39 to 
43), and in their health and safety on which 
we continue to place increasing emphasis, as 
reported on pages 32 and 33.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all our people for their significant contribution 
to a very successful first year as a stand-alone 
company.

François Wanecq  
Chief Executive
In our first complete year as an independent 
company, we have successfully initiated the 
recovery of margins across the Group despite 
the unfavourable economic environment. 
Market conditions remained challenging in 
2013 continuing from the reduced levels of 
activity seen in the second half of 2012, and 
sterling strengthened substantially in the second 
half of 2013, impacting our reported growth 
numbers. Against this backdrop we have taken a 
disciplined approach to implementing our stated 
strategy. We streamlined our business portfolio 
and activities, exiting non-core low-margin 
businesses, further improved the quality of our 
products and services and implemented self-help 
measures to increase the productivity of our own 
businesses. The result is improved profitability, 
strong cash flow and a more focused Group. This 
gives us a strong platform from which to pursue 
our growth strategy.
Group Trading Performance
Group revenue from our continuing operations 
was £1,511million, a reduction of 2.4% 
compared to 2012. Underlying revenue, 
excluding impact of exchange rate movements, 
acquisitions and disposals, declined by 0.8%. 
Trading profit for the year was £140.0 million, up 
6.6% from £131.3 million in 2012, up 10.9% 
on an underlying basis, reflecting the success of 
management’s focus on self-help initiatives in 
light of continuing weak market conditions. 
Market Trends and Business 
Performance
Our business comprises two divisions, Steel and 
Foundry, with the Steel division operated as two 
principal product lines, Steel Flow Control and 
Advanced Refractories. Divisional reports are set 
out on pages 24 to 31 of this Strategic Report.
Steel Division
After steep downturns in the steel industry in 
mid-2012, activity stabilised at those lower 
levels through the second half of 2013. Whilst 
world steel production grew by 4.8% driven 
primarily by growth in China, volumes outside 
China were flat, with year-on-year production 
reductions of 2.3% and 1.9% in the EU and 
the USA, respectively. To date, the Chinese 
steel market has been predominantly focused 
on ‘long’ products for use in infrastructure and 
construction, the production of which requires 
fewer Vesuvius products. In the coming years, 
with the evolution towards a more consumer-
driven economy, a significant restructuring of 
the Chinese steel industry is anticipated, leading 
to a greater focus on quality and performance 
rather than volume. This will require more ‘flat’ 
steel production, and with our advanced process-
enhancing solutions, we are in a very good 
position to participate in this development. 
Revenue performance in the Steel division 
remained broadly flat versus 2012, with 
the effect of disposals offsetting underlying 
growth of 1.9%. The division reported a 
6.7% improvement in trading profit, and a 
9.9% increase in underlying profits. This also 
demonstrates that the self-help initiatives and 
streamlining of the portfolio, implemented from 
mid-2012 and throughout the year, has improved 
the strength of the underlying business. 
Steel Flow Control
Steel Flow Control products supplied by 
Vesuvius include: the Viso
TM
 product range, 
which are isostatically pressed alumina graphite 
refractories; slide-gate refractories; temperature 
measurement and slag level detection; fluxes; 
and control devices to monitor and regulate 
steel flow. The majority of these products are 
consumed during the process of making steel. 
Consequently, demand for Vesuvius’ products 
is primarily linked to steel production volumes, 
with global steel representing almost 100% of 
the end-market for Vesuvius’ Steel Flow Control 
products. 
In the face of overall subdued market conditions 
outside China we delivered top line growth 
and performed ahead of the underlying steel 
production trend. We were able to do so because 
of our ability to innovate and to help customers 
improve process productivity and therefore 
extract more value from their products. This 
c hief executive’s r eview
In 2013 we have strengthened the platform from which to 
pursue our growth strategy

capability is particularly valued by customers in 
periods when their focus is on quality and cost 
rather than on volume.
Underlying Steel Flow Control revenue in the 
Americas and EMEA was broadly in line with 
the underlying steel production trend. Steel 
production in the Americas was 2.1% lower 
than in 2012, with US and Brazilian steel output 
lower by 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively. In EMEA, 
steel production was 0.1% lower than in 2012, 
with a 2.4% reduction in Europe and C.I.S, more 
than ofsetting a 20.7% increase in the Middle 
East and Africa. Revenue in EMEA grew 5.4% 
despite a lack of underlying market growth, 
owing predominantly to increased sales in the 
Middle East and in the UK and strong sales of 
fluxes through Metallurgica, a recent acquisition 
which was integrated successfully in 2013.
Trading in Asia-Pacific, however, showed stronger 
progression versus 2012. Growth in the Indian 
steel market (volumes up 5.9% versus 2012), 
following the start-up of new capacity which 
uses our higher value technology solutions, and 
increased penetration of our products in South 
Korea contributed to revenue growth in Asia-
Pacific of 6.5%.
During the year we successfully commissioned 
our first robotic handling operation for Hyundai  
in Korea. This system brings reliability and speed 
to the steel production process whilst improving 
quality through a more precise and repeatable 
sequence of operations. It also enhances safety 
at our customers’ facilities by allowing them 
to isolate employees from a dangerous work 
environment.
In conjunction with this improved penetration 
of new products and solutions, the Steel Flow 
Control product line commissioned an extension 
of its successful Viso
TM
 operation at Trinec in the 
Czech Republic, and an integrated raw material 
mixing facility in Brazil. The latter will allow us 
to take advantage of local raw materials in local 
currency and to reduce our carbon footprint 
through more efficient logistics.
Advanced Refractories
The Vesuvius Advanced Refractories product 
line offers a full range of specialist refractory 
materials for lining steelmaking vessels such 
as blast furnaces, ladles and tundishes, and for 
applications in other high temperature process 
industries.
As previously outlined, a change in focus has 
been adopted for the Advanced Refractories 
product line to concentrate on more 
differentiated, higher-margin products and 
solutions. In line with this strategy, non-core 
low-margin businesses in Germany and Canada 
were disposed of in February and July 2013, 
respectively. 
Revenue in the Americas and EMEA were each 
1.8% lower than 2012, owing primarily to the 
initiative to withdraw from non-core low-margin 
business which more than offset the effect of 
increased penetration of our more specialised 
solutions. 
In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down by 8.9%, 
reflecting the impact of the disposal in 2012 
of the Andreco-Hurll construction business in 
Australia, which more than offset underlying 
growth. 
A positive development was the increased 
penetration achieved by our ELBY
TM
 ladle 
bottom, a product which allows steel makers to 
maximise the quantity of clean steel they can tap 
from a ladle before slag pollution occurs. Having 
already been well received in the North American 
market, this concept is now gaining traction in 
Europe and Asia-Pacific.
In addition, two new plants were commissioned 
in Port Kembla (Australia) and in Ras al 
Khaima (United Arab Emirates). These are now 
ramping up production and sales in line with 
expectations.
Combined, these developments clearly 
demonstrate our innovative approach, our 
focused investment, and our ability to deliver 
more engineering services to our customers 
in addition to the sale of our technologically 
advanced consumables.
Foundry Division
The Foundry division of Vesuvius, trading under 
the Foseco brand, is a world leader in the 
supply of consumable products and services 
to the global foundry industry, which produces 
castings used in a wide variety of engineered 
components. Some 40% of castings are 
produced for the vehicle sector, comprising 
approximately 25% for cars and light trucks 
(“light vehicle”) and 15% for heavy trucks. 
Other end-markets include machinery for the 
construction, agriculture and mining industries, 
power generation equipment, railroad and 
general engineering. 
The foundry market was significantly impacted 
in 2013 by the difficulties in the mining industry 
and, in particular, the reduction of investment 
spending in the extraction of hard rock metallic 
ores. This impacted sales in the USA, Brazil and 
Australia in particular. Furthermore, the truck 
and railroad markets remained stagnant, and 
the overall market in India and ASEAN was 
disappointing. However, Vesuvius’ Foundry 
division made good progress in China where our 
solutions started to gain wider adoption. 
Revenue in the Foundry division was down 7.0% 
year-on-year, reflecting the reduced end-market 
activity and the restructuring of the Fused Silica 
product line. 
Profitability, meanwhile, has improved during the 
period, with trading profit up 6.4% (12.6% on 
an underlying basis) and return on sales margin 
improving from 9.1% to 10.4%, demonstrating 
that self-help initiatives to improve flexibility, 
including stemming the losses from the Solar 
Crucibles business, have increased the division’s 
resilience to end-market cycles.
Revenues in all three regions were lower than 
in 2012, owing to the challenging end-market 
conditions seen globally across the foundry 
casting industry. 
In the Americas, despite growth in the Brazilian 
truck industry, revenue was down 8.2% 
reflecting a 3% reduction in truck production in 
NAFTA and the lower volumes experienced by 
the US railroad and mining industries.
Revenue in EMEA was 3.5% lower than in 2012, 
reflecting a 3% reduction in German light vehicle 
production and European truck production 
volumes being lower by 4% year-on-year.
In Asia-Pacific, 11% growth in Chinese light 
vehicle output was offset by a 4% and 14% 
reduction in Japanese and Indian car production, 
respectively. Additionally, the foundry sector in 
Australia was affected by the reduced investment 
in the mining industry.
We continue to mitigate the effects of these 
challenging end-market conditions through 
manufacturing efficiency programmes and 
by maintaining the strength of the division’s 
differentiated offering.

Construction of a new manufacturing plant 
for foundry products in ChangShu, China 
commenced during the year, with completion of 
Phase One expected in mid-2014.
In the Fused Silica product line, our glass roller 
business made good progress, benefiting from 
investments related to vehicle manufacturing in 
China and the USA. 
Self-Help Initiatives
Within an uncertain environment, we have 
retained our focus on self-help actions to 
improve our performance. We have initiated 
a focus on quality in all business segments 
across the Group. Significant improvement was 
recorded in our Chinese steel operations and 
new business was successfully initiated in Korea. 
As a result of our significant restructuring work 
the Fused Silica product line recovered from the 
substantial challenges experienced in 2012 in 
the Solar Crucibles product line.
Across the Group, specific effort was also 
dedicated to inventory reduction. Significant 
improvements were experienced across the 
business, most notably in Foundry. We look 
forward to continuing this progress in 2014. 
Together, these actions generate savings in the 
cost of handling, warehousing and rejects, and 
improve our overall productivity. 
This emphasis on self-help has been rewarded 
by productivity gains in both divisions, with 
margins progressing markedly despite the weak 
market conditions and significant headwinds 
from foreign exchange rate fluctuation towards 
the end of the year. Overall margins progressed 
from 8.5% in 2012 to 9.3% in 2013; underlying 
margins increased by 1.0%.
Our successful efforts in inventory reduction 
together with good control of receivables 
allowed us to generate a substantial level of 
cash flow, with a cash conversion rate of 107%.
Details of our programme of excellence, 
encapsulating our Lean Programme, and focus 
on quality and safety are set out later in this 
Strategic Report.
Portfolio Management and  
Capital Allocation
Our strategy, and the focus of our management 
team, is to grow those activities where we can 
develop and exploit synergies from existing 
technological and market expertise. We are also 
committed to maintaining a robust balance 
sheet, and to delivering long-term dividend 
growth for our shareholders. 
Following the demerger, we resolved to refocus 
Vesuvius on the businesses where we can offer 
a unique value proposition and differentiation 
from the competition. In May, we completed 
the disposal of the Precious Metals Processing 
division which had no fit with our core business 
of molten metal flow engineering, and which 
carried significant metal financing requirements. 
The majority of the proceeds of the transaction 
were returned to shareholders through a £30 
million share buy-back as a sign that we are 
committed to delivering attractive returns to our 
shareholders.
We sold our German brick production business, 
VGT-Dyko, in February 2013 and our Canadian 
construction business in July 2013, thereby 
increasing the focus of our Advanced Refractories 
product line on higher margin segments. 
Capital expenditure of £48 million represented 
3.2% of revenue, with the focus being on 
expanding our capacity in emerging economies 
and extending our research centres.
Health and Safety
The Board places great emphasis on the 
importance of health and safety in the workplace 
and in the communities in which we operate. We 
measure the Lost Time Incidents Frequency Rate 
as a key indicator of our performance. Safety 
is of paramount importance as our employees 
often operate in harsh environments. Whilst we 
are constantly evolving and improving our safety 
programmes, we did not achieve our targets 
in the reduction of accidents in 2013. Very 
regrettably, one of our colleagues lost his life 
in April 2013, in a work-related incident at our 
Chicago Heights, Illinois, facility. It is important 
that, at the most senior level, we formally 
acknowledge and reaffirm our objective of zero 
accidents in the workplace. Further details of our 
safety programme are set out on pages 32 and 
33 of this Strategic Report.
A Renewed Senior Management Team
The overall progress made in our first year owes 
much to the good understanding that has been 
developed between our new, focused Board of 
Directors and our widely renewed management 
team. Of the ten-strong Group Executive 
Committee, three are in their first year of tenure 
and three others have served less than three 
years in their present roles. 
This executive team is engaged in re-examining 
all our past practices and in ensuring quality, 
consistency and technology are embedded at the 
heart of everything we do. This will be central 
to our success in reinforcing and growing our 
share of our targeted market segments. In June 
2013, we launched our Group-wide plan to 
deliver a step change in our Quality performance. 
Significant progress has already been made, 
most notably in our Advanced Refractories 
product line, and within our operations in China. 
The Group’s overall strategy, reconfirmed by the 
Board in June, places particular emphasis on 
technology. A new worldwide research centre for 
Foundry is being established in Enschede, in the 
Netherlands, to be commissioned in mid-2014 
and, in October, George Coulston (PhD, MBA) 
joined the Group as Chief Technology Officer to 
drive forward this increased focus on technology 
development. We continue to focus on annual 
R&D spend as a KPI. 
Outlook 
We expect the underlying trading environment 
during 2014 to be broadly similar to that 
experienced in 2013. 
We are progressing with our plan to improve 
operational efficiency across the Group. These 
actions should continue to drive improvement 
in our trading margins and working capital 
performance in 2014.  If the recent strength of 
sterling continues it will have a negative impact 
on our reported growth in 2014.
Our primary objectives for the medium term are 
to improve margins further,  increase investment 
in research and development, sustain our global 
leadership in core businesses, grow further 
our presence in China, retain a strong balance 
sheet in order to give us financial flexibility, 
and progress our overall strategy of providing 
superior technical products and services for the 
steel and foundry industries.

Financial r eview
We have delivered improved profitability, strong cash flow, a 
robust balance sheet and a more focused Group
Chris O’Shea 
Chief Financial Office
Since the demerger we have been busy on a 
number of fronts: streamlining and focusing the 
asset portfolio; improving operating margins; 
increasing cash flow; and strengthening the 
balance sheet. We have made significant 
progress in each of these key areas during the 
year, all of which underpin our ability to provide 
superior returns to our shareholders. 
In line with our strategy of focusing the portfolio, 
in 2013 we completed the disposal of the 
Precious Metals Processing division and other 
lower margin businesses.
In 2013 we improved our performance with 
underlying operating margins improving by 
1 percentage point from 8.3% in 2012 to 
9.3% in 2013 despite the reduced activity 
levels experienced in the second half of 2012 
continuing throughout 2013. We remain 
confident in our ability to deliver further 
margin improvement in the coming years by 
continuing to focus on improving our financial 
and operational flexibility. As indicated in our 
principal risks section (see pages 18 and 19), 
we consider end-market cyclicality to be a 
significant concern. This financial and operational 
flexibility will ensure that we are able to react 
appropriately, and quickly, to changes in end-
market conditions.
As set out in our KPIs on page 17, we consider 
cash flow as a primary measure of success. Our 
continued efforts to focus the business in this 
area are bearing fruit, with a cash conversion 
ratio of 107% in 2013, meaning that for each 
£100 of trading profit, we generated operating 
cash flow after capital expenditure of £107. This 
contributed to a 13% reduction in our net debt 
to £256 million.
This reduction in net debt, together with a 
further improvement in the funding position 
of our defined benefit pension plans, has 
contributed to a strengthening of our balance 
sheet. This enabled us to raise new long-term 
debt on attractive terms in the second half of the 
year, increasing the maturity profile of our debt 
and thus, in line with mitigations noted in our 
principal risks section (see pages 18 and 19), 
reducing refinancing risks in future years.
During the year we returned £70 million to 
shareholders through dividends and a share 
repurchase programme, thereby returning the 
majority of the net proceeds of the disposal 
of the Precious Metals Processing division to 
shareholders.
With net debt of £256 million and committed 
debt facilities of £637 million with maturities out 
to 2028, we have a strong balance sheet. At the 
end of the year net debt represented 1.4 times 
2013 EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, 
Depreciation and Amortisation), well within our 
debt covenants. Our business is strongly cash 
generative with relatively low capital intensity. In 
short, we are well positioned to invest in organic 
projects, fund attractive acquisition opportunities 
as they arise, and provide superior returns to 
shareholders.
The following review considers our financial KPIs, 
our financial risks, and sets out other relevant 
financial information.
Basis of preparation
Please see Note 2.6 of the Financial Statements 
on page 97. All references in this review are to 
Headline Performance unless otherwise noted. 
All comparatives have been restated as noted in 
Note 2.7 of the Financial Statements on  
page 97.
Dividend
In line with the dividend policy outlined by 
the Chairman on page 6, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 10.25 pence 
per share. Together with the interim dividend 
paid during 2013, this will bring the full year 
dividend to 15 pence per share, an increase of 
5.3% on Vesuvius’ share of the 2012 Cookson 
Group plc dividend.

Financial KPIs
Underlying revenue growth 
We look at underlying (or organic) movements 
in our results to establish meaningful period-on-
period comparisons. Underlying movements are 
calculated by:
•	 restating the previous period’s results at the 
same foreign exchange rates used in the 
current period
•	 removing the results of disposed businesses 
in both the current and prior years
•	 removing the results of businesses acquired 
in the current year
•	 assuming acquisitions made in the prior year 
were made on the first day of that period.
Group revenue of £1,511 million was 2.4% 
lower than 2012 (£1,548 million); underlying 
revenues fell by 0.8% reflecting the fact that the 
strong market conditions experienced in the first 
half of 2012 were not repeated in 2013, with 
reductions in the Foundry division more than 
offsetting underlying growth in the Steel division. 
trading profit and return on sales
The underlying trading performance of the 
Group is measured by both the trading profit 
in absolute terms, and as a percentage of sales 
(return on sales). Trading profit of £140 million 
was 6.6% ahead of 2012 (£131 million); on 
an underlying basis, trading profit increased by 
10.9%. 
In the Steel division, trading profit increased 
from £83 million in 2012 to £89 million in 2013; 
on an underlying basis, trading profit increased 
by 9.9% with return on sales increasing from 
8.1% to 8.7%. These results reflect a substantial 
improvement in underlying profits in the 
Advanced Refractories product line and the 
impact of a lower bad debt charge. 
In the Foundry division, trading profit increased 
from £48 million in 2012 to £51 million in 2013; 
on an underlying basis, trading profit increased 
by 12.6% with return on sales increasing 
from 8.7% to 10.4%.  These results reflect the 
elimination of the losses in the Solar Crucibles 
product line, which was partially offset by an 
underlying reduction in other Foundry activity 
which fed through into profitability.

Headline pBt and epS
Headline profit before tax (“PBT”) and earnings 
per share (“EPS”) are used to assess the 
underlying financial performance and earnings 
capacity of the Group.  The principal difference 
between trading profit and PBT is net finance 
costs.  
Net finance costs of £17 million comprised £16 
million of net interest payable on borrowings 
(2012: £22 million), £2 million on retirement 
benefit plans (2012: nil), and £1 million relating 
to the unwinding of discounts on provisions 
(2012: £2 million); this was partially offset by 
£2 million (2012: £2 million) of finance income 
which principally comprised interest income.
The net interest payable on borrowings in 2012 
includes substantially all interest costs relating 
to the former Cookson Group as all such costs 
were incurred by companies which remained with 
Vesuvius following the demerger. We estimate 
that net interest payable on borrowings in 2012 
would have been £16 million had Vesuvius been 
a stand-alone entity throughout 2012.
Headline PBT, including our share of the profits of 
joint ventures of £2.5 million (2012: £0.1million) 
has increased by 14% to £125 million (2012: 
£110 million).
Headline EPS has grown from 27.0 pence per 
share to 31.9 pence per share, reflecting the 
increased profitability of the Group, the lower 
effective tax rate (26.5%; 2012: 27%) and the 
impact of the share repurchase programme which 
reduced the number of shares.
Free cash flow and working capital
Free cash flow is used to assess the underlying 
cash generation of the Group, which is impacted 
by the working capital employed in the business. 
In order to drive sustained performance in 
working capital management we measure 
performance on a 12 month moving average 
basis at constant exchange rates. 
On this basis, trade working capital as a 
percentage of sales was 24.7% in 2013, a 
reduction of 1.9 percentage points on 2012 
(26.6%). Inventory days reduced from 85 days 
of cost of sales at the end of 2012 to 77 days at 
the end of 2013, with debtor days reducing from 
74 days of sales at the end of 2012 to 73 days at 
the end of 2013.
Operating cash flow was £150 million in 2013 
(2012: £133 million), which represents a 
cash conversion rate of 107% (2012: 101%) 
in relation to trading profit from continuing 
operations. Our focus on working capital has 
led to a net cash inflow from trade and other 
working capital of £16 million in the year relating 
to continuing operations, repeating the strong 
performance in 2012, where the net inflow was 
£13 million. Free cash flow from continuing 
operations, before restructuring and demerger 
costs, of £108 million was generated in the year 
(2012: £78 million).
r eturn on net assets
Return on net assets (“RONA”) is used to assess 
the underlying financial performance of the 
Group.  RONA is affected both by the assets 
employed by the business, and the returns 
earned by the business.  In 2013, a combination 
of the reduction in working capital and the 
improvement in profitability led to an increase in 
Group pre-tax RONA to 24.4% (2012: 19.5%). 
n et debt and interest cover
The Group’s debt facilities have financial 
covenants with specific limits on the ratios of 
Net Debt to EBITDA (maximum 3 times limit) 
and EBITDA to Interest (minimum 4 times limit).  
These ratios are monitored regularly to ensure 
the Group has sufficient financing available to 
run the business and fund future growth.  At the 
end of 2013, the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio was 
1.4, with EBITDA covering net interest paid 13.0 
times; accordingly, the Group was well within its 
covenants.

At the end of the year we had £637 million 
of gross committed debt facilities (2012:£579 
million), of which £329 million was unutilised 
(2012: £158 million). Our net debt stood at 
256 million at the end of 2013, a reduction of 
£39 million in the year. As part of a process to 
increase the efficiency of the utilisation of our 
facilities, we have reduced the cash and short-
term deposits held to £68 million at the end of 
2013 (2012: £130 million).
We keep our capital structure under regular 
review, and we took advantage of favourable 
market conditions and strong demand for our 
credit to raise new long-term fixed rate debt on 
the US Private Placement market on attractive 
terms as follows:
•	 €15 million at 3.46% maturing in December 
2021
•	 US$30 million at 4.61% maturing in 
December 2023
•	 €15 million at 3.93% maturing in  
December 2025
•	 US$30 million at 4.96% maturing in 
December 2028.
As a result, at the end of 2013 one-third of our 
committed debt facilities comprised long-term 
fixed rate facilities, with the remainder being 
the £425 million multi-currency revolving credit 
facility which runs until April 2016. 
Gross borrowings at the end of 2013 amounted 
to £327 million. Of this, approximately two-thirds 
is long-term fixed rate debt, with the remainder 
floating rate. The currency split of the borrowings 
is approximately one-third in each of euros, US 
dollars, and sterling.
Financial risk factors
There are two main financial risk factors. End-
market cyclicality is discussed in the introduction 
to this section on page 13. In addition, the 
Group faces risks relating to foreign exchange, 
capital market, interest rate and inflation 
uncertainties. Despite the mitigations described 
on page 19, we operate in many countries and, 
as such, our reported results vary with foreign 
exchange rates. When sterling strengthens 
against a currency, our revenues and profits as 
reported in sterling are reduced; however, the 
underlying revenues and profits in the local 
currency are unaffected.
The second half of 2013 saw a strengthening 
of sterling against a number of our important 
trading currencies, most notably the Indian rupee 
and the Brazilian real. This, coupled with the 
weakness experienced throughout the year in 
the Japanese yen and the South African rand, 
more than offset the effects of a stronger US 
dollar, euro, and renminbi. The combined effects 
of these foreign exchange movements served 
to constrain our growth in profits. We continue 
to monitor this closely, and where possible seek 
to balance our cost and revenue base in similar 
currencies to minimise exposure. As with all 
international companies, and particularly ones 
like ours focused on growth in emerging markets, 
this continues to be an area of attention.
o ther relevant financial information
trading r esults – Discontinued o perations
The results of the Precious Metals Processing 
division up to the date of disposal (31 May 
2013) are reported as discontinued operations  
in 2013. In 2012 the consolidated results of  
the Alent plc group of businesses up to  
18 December 2012, plus the results of the 
Precious Metals Processing division were 
reported as discontinued operations.
Revenue in the Precious Metals Processing 
division for 2013 was £65 million, down from 
£190 million in 2012, reflecting the disposals 
of the European business on 31 May 2013 and 
the US business on 1 May 2012. Trading profit 
for the year of £14 million (2012: £17 million) 
reflected weaker end-market conditions in 
2013 together with the effect of the business 
disposals. Included within trading profit is  
£10 million relating to the release of a provision 
following the successful conclusion of a UK VAT 
dispute.
Total revenue of Alent plc for the period up to 
the 18 December 2012 was £698 million, with 
trading profit of £100 million.
r estructuring
The restructuring charge in 2013 of £4 million 
principally comprises costs relating to the 
relocation of a Steel division production facility 
in Australia, the closure and relocation costs 
relating to two Foundry production sites in 
China, and some trailing costs relating to prior 
restructuring programmes. Around one-third of 
this charge is non-cash.
The restructuring charge in 2012 of £57 million 
principally related to the restructuring of the 
Solar Crucibles business, with around 80% 
representing non-cash asset write-offs.
taxation
The headline effective income tax rate for the 
year reduced to 26.5% (2012: 27.0%). 
The income tax credit on separately reported 
items principally consists of non-cash deferred 
tax movements relating to the amortisation of a 
deferred liability arising from the acquisition of 
Foseco plc in 2008 (£7 million; 2012: £7 million), 
and the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
due to the forecast utilisation of US tax losses 
incurred in prior years (£29 million). Due to the 
uncertain nature of future profitability we have 
recognised an asset equivalent to the estimated 
profitability in the three coming years. 
During the year the major part of a dispute 
with the UK tax authorities over VAT on metal 
purchases relating to the Precious Metals 
Processing division was resolved in our favour, 
resulting in the release of a provision of £10 
million held in relation to this matter. This has 
been included in the results from discontinued 
operations. Further details are set out in Notes 
25 and 37 to the Financial Statements.
c apital expenditure
Capital expenditure in 2013 of £48 million (2012: 
£57 million) comprised £29 million (2012: £38 
million) in the Steel division and £19 million 
(2012: £19 million) in the Foundry division. This 
represented 3.2% of revenue (2012: 3.7%).

pensions
The net pension deficit in our post-retirement 
employee benefits plans reduced during the 
year from £69 million to £48 million, with 
the reduction coming primarily from employer 
contributions (£15 million) and gains on plan 
assets (£9 million), partially offset by service 
charges, administration costs and finance costs.
The triennial valuation of the UK plan as at  
31 December 2012 was agreed during 2013. 
This showed the plan had a funding surplus of 
£11 million. As a result of this valuation, we 
ceased obligatory contributions to the plan in 
July 2013 and agreed with the Trustee, on a non-
binding basis, to make payments of £2 million 
per annum from 1 January 2014 to build further 
the strength of the plan.
The funding surplus of £11 million is equivalent 
to the accounting surplus of £23.3 million at the 
end of 2012. The difference reflects the use of 
more conservative assumptions for the funding 
basis than is allowed for the accounting basis.
Our activities to reduce Vesuvius’ exposure to 
defined benefit pension risks continue and in 
early 2014 we are transferring the liabilities for 
members who have retired since July 2012 to 
Pension Insurance Corporation (“PIC”), under 
the terms of an extension to the original buy-in 
agreement signed with PIC in 2012. 
This extension provides that UK plan members 
who retire up to the end of 2015 will have 
their pensions insured on agreed terms.  This 
agreement covers up to £30 million of liabilities, 
with the future premium payments to be met 
from the existing assets of the UK plan. As 
a result, we expect around 65% of the total 
UK plan liabilities will be covered by these 
agreements with PIC. 
c orporate activity
On 31 May 2013 we completed the disposal 
of the Precious Metals Processing division for a 
cash consideration of €56.8 million. The results 
of this business prior to disposal have been 
reported as discontinued operations.
Our non-core German brick manufacturing 
business, VGT-Dyko, was disposed of in February 
2013. In August 2013 we announced the 
disposal of our construction and installation 
business in Canada which follows the disposal of 
a similar business in Australia in 2012.
During 2013, no businesses were acquired as 
we focused on putting in motion the actions 
required to improve the profitability of the base 
business. Metallurgica was acquired in 2012 
for £28 million. It is one of the world’s leading 
suppliers of fluxes - a range of powders used 
together with refractory products in the enclosed 
continuous casting process. Profit margins in 
Metallurgica improved in 2013 following the 
integration of the business into Vesuvius. With 
improvements in margins also achieved in 2012, 
this highlights the synergies achievable from 
acquiring such complementary businesses. 
Share buy-back
During the year we committed to returning 
the majority of the net disposal proceeds of 
the Precious Metals Processing division to 
shareholders by way of an on-market repurchase 
of shares. The net proceeds from the disposal 
amounted to £37 million, comprising the cash-
free debt-free gross proceeds of £47 million less 
the cash consumed by the business operations 
in the period prior to disposal, which amounted 
to £10 million. Of this, £30 million was used 
to repurchase 7,271,174 shares currently 
held in treasury at an average price, including 
transaction costs, of 412.59 pence per share 
between 5 June 2013 and 17 September 2013.
Additionally, during the year the Employee Share 
Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) purchased 851,736 
shares at an average price, including transaction 
costs, of 479.77 pence per share. These shares 
were purchased by the ESOT partially to cover 
the anticipated vesting of current share-based 
incentive awards. Subsequent to the year-end, 
the EBT purchased a further 82,152 shares at 
an average price, including transaction costs, of 
503.52 pence per share.

The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and assessment of the measures 
used in managing risk across the Group. Vesuvius 
operates a continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks and 
regular reports are made to the Board on the 
process of how these are being managed. Thus, 
the Board receives regular reports on major 
issues that have arisen during the year, can make 
an assessment of how the risks have changed 
over any given period, and can assess whether 
they are being effectively managed. Where 
practical, risks are managed in order to mitigate 
exposure and, where cost effective, the risk is 
transferred to insurers. 
The risks identified below are those seen by the 
Board as being the most relevant to the Group in 
relation to their possible impact on achieving its 
strategic objectives. 
All of the risks set out below could materially 
affect the Group, its businesses, future 
operations and financial condition and could 
cause actual results to differ materially from 
expected or historical results. The risks below are 
not the only ones that the Group will face. Some 
risks are not yet known and some that are not 
currently deemed material could later become so.

Strategy
Vesuvius is a community of experts in high 
temperature and molten metal flow containment. 
As a company, we have developed this expertise 
over more than fifty years of leadership in areas 
where our technology has proven to bring 
outstanding value to our customers.
Our strategy is to build on this unique asset and 
develop additional business segments where we 
have synergies from existing technological and 
market expertise. 
This strategy is designed to enable us to grow our 
revenue ahead of underlying growth in our end-
markets; to provide higher margins and return on 
capital as we aim to grow in less capital intensive 
sectors; and to deliver strong cash flow and 
superior returns to our shareholders.
Our strategy is developed along the following five 
objectives:
Reinforce our technology leadership
Given the breadth of our experience and 
global reach, we have an ability to undertake 
technological development unparalleled in our 
industry. Our aim is to concentrate our research 
efforts in a small number of centres of excellence 
where we activate a critical mass of knowledge 
and, in parallel, operate development centres in all 
major markets to interact with our customers and 
address their immediate requirements.
We ring-fence a substantial sum for longer-term 
fundamental research, the acquisition of enabling 
technologies and ensuring cross-business 
fertilisation. All of these things help generate 
innovation from “out of the box” thinking.
Technology is the basis of our ability to create 
value in our customers’ processes. This underpins 
our growth by continuously enriching our value 
proposition. 
In addition to our capital investment in research 
facilities, we will spend approximately 2% of our 
annual revenue in R&D over the long term as 
detailed in our KPIs on page 17. 
See the Innovation section on page 
34 for more information on our R&D 
capabilities
Increase the penetration of existing 
and new value creating solutions
Our solutions bring value to our customers’ 
processes through quality improvement, 
productivity enhancement and increased 
efficiency. Process development is more easily 
adopted by the top end of our markets where 
higher levels of quality are demanded and labour 
is more expensive. In addition, we serve an 
industry which operates in hostile environments 
where innovation is continually challenged by the 
need to ensure process safety.
The foundation for momentum in growth for our 
business is our ability to market the innovations 
we develop to the wider audience of customers 
we believe can benefit from them. We will 
continue to invest in industrial marketing and 
value capture analysis to enable us to deliver this 
message and outperform the underlying market 
evolution with our revenue growth.
See our Safety section on page 32. Also 
see the Sustainability section on page 
44 for the effect of our products on 
customer efficiency
Our five strategic objectives will enable us to deliver superior 
returns to shareholders

Capture growth in the developing 
markets
Our markets in Steel and Foundry divisions are 
driven by the industrial manufacturing base of 
the countries in which we operate. The emerging 
markets are large consumers of steel goods and 
foundry castings and consequently the demand 
for our products and value solutions is growing 
rapidly in these areas. Today, more than 65% of 
the world steel production is in Asia.
Our business model is to produce at close 
proximity to our customers’ sites, and for several 
decades Vesuvius has set up production facilities 
in the emerging markets to answer the growing 
industrial needs of these countries. 
For more information on our global 
coverage see the Group at a Glance 
section on pages 02 and 03
Improve our cost leadership and 
margins
No leadership position can be sustained without 
maintaining clear control of costs as we need to 
remain competitive for the levels of quality we 
deliver to our customers.
We continue to leverage our manufacturing 
volume and use our significant process experience 
to enhance productivity and upgrade our 
quality levels. We remain focused on developing 
efficiencies in supply and logistics costs and 
investing in process technology. 
See the Lean Manufacturing section on 
page 36 for further details on our drive for 
efficiency and excellence
Develop a new business of  
technical services 
Our close relationships with customers and our 
permanent presence at their production sites puts 
us in a privileged position for providing them with 
engineered services around the core operations of 
steel manufacturing and foundry casting. 
We already offer much more than purely 
consumables, by providing customers with 
systems and design assistance complementary to 
the use of our products. 
We will enrich our present offering over the 
medium term by providing services around data 
capture and interpretation that deliver decision-
critical, process enhancing information to our 
most advanced customers in the metal casting 
field.

Global Presence
Vesuvius is present in six continents, with manufacturing capability within all the main steel and foundry 
markets. We sell consumables that are critical to the processes of our customers, and commit to supply into our 
major end-markets from trucking distance. For the last forty years, Vesuvius has supported the development of 
global steel and foundry manufacturing processes with new technologies. Everywhere in the world, new steel 
and foundry plants have been commissioned with Vesuvius and Foseco products to create the best conditions 
for a successful start. To facilitate this, Vesuvius has established manufacturing plants in emerging countries 
from the very beginning of their industrialisation. The breadth and depth of the experience and expertise we 
have developed over these years with our customers is peerless. 
Our knowledge of end-market processes, specifications and techniques around the world gives our experts a 
unique ability to support our customers no matter what their required configurations. This has contributed to the 
trust built with our customers in the reliability of our service and assistance. Local manufacturing, local expertise, 
and leveraging a global knowledge of our customers’ processes gives Vesuvius a special relationship with its 
customers, to help them optimise their process and their product performance. 
To support our global presence, we hire and train local engineers in most developing countries, who are 
then progressively integrated within the Vesuvius network of experts and offered international careers. These 
technical experts become partners of their local customers and help them meet their aims for continuous 
improvement, whilst maintaining the utmost level of reliability. Through this close technical relationship, we can 
identify together new development opportunities to create value in a customer’s process.
Advanced Technology Knowledge
The ability to support our customers’ development and to anticipate their future needs results from the capacity 
of our Research & Development centres to leverage their knowledge in the most advanced ceramic and 
metallurgical techniques. Our laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and utilise the most 
advanced technologies of simulation and finite element analysis to simulate the behaviour of molten metal in a 
customer’s specific equipment configuration. Our three central laboratories explore the fundamental aspects of the 
casting process with the most sophisticated equipment, whilst our eight local development centres feed on these 
fundamental findings and elaborate custom-designed, customer-specific solutions that will create value for our 
customers and help them differentiate from competition. These innovations can then be tested at the customer’s 
facility with the highest level of confidence in their suitability, based on Vesuvius experience and on past success.
Optimised Manufacturing Footprint
When successfully tested, our products can be manufactured at a short distance from our customers’ plants, 
guaranteeing just-in-time delivery and a competitive cost. To enable us to supply most customers from trucking 
distance, we optimise our cost competitiveness by investing in the lowest cost production site in a given area 
and, together with the large volume of pieces we produce, this provides our customers with the best balance 
between value and cost for our high technology solutions.
Service & Consistency
Being global, we can ensure a local service to our customers, including the management of an optimal level of 
inventories at their location, high quality technical support and a unique capacity to be reactive in modifying our 
production and supply of product and service to reflect any unexpected change in customers’ requirements. This 
high level of service relies on our technicians’ permanent presence on the customers’ shop floor, leveraging their 
worldwide expertise accumulated in Vesuvius over many years.

Steel Industry Overview in 2013
According to the World Steel Association (“WSA ”) 
global steel production (see above chart) grew 
3.5% in 2013 vs 2012 to 1,607.2 megatonnes 
(“Mt”), with China experiencing growth of 9.9% 
to 779Mt; global production, excluding China, 
was flat at 828.2Mt. The growth came mainly 
from Asia, the Middle East and India whilst crude 
steel production in the European Union, South 
America and NAFTA decreased compared with 
2012. 
Growth compared to the prior year was stronger, 
in the second half of 2013 than the first half, 
partially due to the fact the first half of 2012 was 
very strong with the second half experiencing a 
substantial reduction in production.
Asia’s share of world steel production, driven 
predominantly by China, increased slightly  
from 65.4% to 67.3% in 2013. Growth in China 
was substantial albeit that month-on-month 
declines from Q3 2013 resulted in a reduction  
in Chinese growth in late 2013 which is 
expected to continue into 2014.
Market View 2014 and Beyond
Despite continued volatility and limited market 
visibility the perspectives for steel production 
in 2014 are generally positive. The WSA has 
predicted a 3.3% increase in steel demand in 
2014. Our expectations are that steel production 
increases will be broadly in line with this increase 
in demand, with modest growth in China and a 
return to growth across the developed world.
The Steel Process and Vesuvius
Vesuvius in the Steel industry
The two product lines that comprise the Steel 
division are Steel Flow Control and Advanced 
Refractories. 
Flow control products are used in the 
continuous casting process which enables steel 
manufactured in a blast furnace or electric arc 
furnace to be cast directly into blooms or slabs 
without interruption (i.e. be continuously cast) 
and to remain protected from the atmosphere 
between tundish and mould (i.e. be enclosed), 
thus significantly reducing the levels of 
contamination.

Vesuvius products have a short service life (often 
a matter of a few hours) due to the significant 
wear caused by the high temperature, high 
thermal cycling and the erosive and corrosive 
environment in which they operate. 
They represent a relatively small proportion of 
the input costs of our customers (e.g. less than 
1% for a steel producer) but their performance 
is critical to their production processes. 
Therefore, customers demand high quality and 
consistent products for these most demanding of 
applications to ensure maximum safety, quality 
and productivity. Vesuvius is a global leader 
in the ‘metal flow’ market. We achieve this by 
working closely with our customers to develop 
customised refractory systems, services and 
technologies that enable them to improve their 
performance.
Vesuvius also supplies the steel industry and 
other process industries with advanced refractory 
materials used for lining vessels such as blast 
furnaces, ladles and tundishes to enable them 
to withstand high temperatures and/or corrosive 
attack.
As both flow control and advanced refractory 
products are consumables, steel production 
volumes (and, in particular, production of higher 
quality steels using the enclosed continuous 
casting process) are the critical driver of demand 
for the Vesuvius Steel division. 
Steel producers are continually striving to 
enhance the enclosed continuous casting process 
to improve production through less downtime, 
to reduce labour costs, to increase steel quality, 
reduce energy usage, and reduce reworking 
through thinner slab casting.
Vesuvius has developed close, collaborative 
relationships with industry-leading customers 
and Original Equipment Manufacturers 
(“OEMs”) and, due to the specialised nature of 
its products and the high volume in which they 
are consumed, has developed a global network 
closely aligned with its customers’ locations, 
with 65 major manufacturing facilities across 
the world. Through this network we develop 
customised refractory systems, services and 
technologies that enable our customers to 
enhance performance. 
Customers of the Steel division are principally 
steel producers themselves, but also include the 
manufacturers of steel production equipment. 
Around 10% to 15% of revenues in the Steel 
division arise from non steel-related process 
industries supplied by the Advanced Refractories 
product line.
the Vesuvius product and  
Service o ffering
Our products are highly specialised consumable 
ceramics, including shrouds, stoppers, nozzles, 
slide gates, lining refractories (monolithic and 
pre-cast) and fluxes for the steel production 
industry. In addition, we supply automation 
equipment and sensors used to control, 
monitor and regulate the flow of molten metal. 
This technical and application expertise is a 
significant part of our product offering giving us 
a distinct competitive advantage.
Steel Division performance
In 2013, the Steel division’s revenue of £1,018 
million comprised £556 million for Steel 
Flow Control and £462 million for Advanced 
Refractories
Steel Flow Control
Steel Flow Control products supplied by Vesuvius 
include: the Viso™, isostatically pressed alumina 
graphite and VAPEX® extruded clay graphite 
product ranges, used to channel and control 
the flow of steel from ladle to tundish and 
from tundish to mould; slide-gate refractories, 
including nozzles, plates and speciality shapes 
for furnace, ladle and tundish slide-gate systems; 
Accumetrix® temperature measurement and 
RADAR™ slag level detection; tundish and 
mould fluxes; purging systems and control 
devices to monitor and regulate steel flow into 
the mould. These products have been designed 
to resist extreme thermo-mechanical stresses 
and corrosive environments. They must withstand 
temperature changes from ambient to 1,600ºC 
in just a few minutes, while resisting liquid 
steel and slag corrosion for several hours. In 
addition, the ceramic parts in contact with the 
liquid steel must not in any way contaminate 
it. To bring all of these characteristics together 
in the same products, Vesuvius has designed 
composite parts combining a variety of special 
materials. The majority of these products are 
consumed during the process of making steel 
and some must be replaced frequently. Demand 
for Vesuvius’ products is thus primarily linked to 
steel production volumes.
In addition to a large range of products and 
equipment Vesuvius has developed ‘state-of-the- 
art’ global modelling and simulation capabilities 
which enable the development of custom 
refractory designs to optimise the flow of molten 
metal within the tundish and mould. More 
details on this are contained in the Innovation 
section on pages 34 and 35.
Global steel production represents almost 
100% of the end-market for Steel Flow Control 
products and services. There is therefore a strong 
correlation between steel production and Steel 
Flow Control revenues. Global steel production in 
the first half of the year was approximately 2% 
higher than the first half of 2012, mainly driven 
by China. However, from September onwards 
there was a strengthening in steel production 
compared with 2012, resulting in higher Steel 
Flow Control revenues.
Revenue of £556 million was 2.7% higher 
compared with 2012. On an underlying basis 
(being revenue at constant exchange rates and 
adjusted for the acquisition of Metallurgica in 
March 2012), revenue was up 0.7% on the  
prior year. 
Prices for raw materials, particularly for graphite 
and zirconia, remained relatively stable during 
2013. However, significant currency devaluation 
in both Brazil and India adversely impacted our 
input costs. Consequently, price increases were 
initiated at the end of 2013 to compensate for 
higher material costs but, due to timing, will not 
have a positive impact until 2014.
We maintain our technology leadership in 
flow control by continuing to leverage our 
understanding of customer processes to provide 
products and solutions that meet customers’ 
needs in terms of safety, quality, reliability, 
productivity and ergonomics.

Vesuvius flow control products can greatly 
influence the quality of our customers’ products 
and the efficiency of their processes. Recently 
introduced new products and solutions are 
developed with value creation for our customers 
in mind, as demonstrated by our innovative 
technical solutions around the continuous 
caster. The latest robot compatible tundish tube 
changer (SEM3085) and the first products of our 
new Robotic Casting Technology range continue 
to perform well with the first fully robotic 
installation now fully operational in Korea. 
A number of significant contracts for the 
SEM3085 have also been secured in Europe, 
China and Vietnam.
Maintaining a strong regional manufacturing 
capability combined with local development 
centres, including physical and computational 
fluid dynamic modelling, represents a key 
element in our strategy of capturing the growth 
in developing markets. Previously announced 
capacity expansion projects in Eastern Europe 
and South America were successfully completed 
in 2013. Equipment installation, commissioning 
and production ramp-up of the Isostatic capacity 
expansion in Trinec, Czech Republic, was 
completed successfully in the second half of 
2013. The new manufacturing facility in Brazil to 
improve the efficiency of raw material processing 
and sourcing was completed with commissioning 
and production ramp-up commencing in the last 
quarter of 2013. This will facilitate greater use of 
local raw materials, allowing shorter leadtimes, 
a reduction in working capital, improved 
production flexibility and allow us to maintain 
our cost leadership. 
Vesuvius’ presence at our customer sites and our 
intimate understanding of their processes places 
Vesuvius in a strong position to build a technical 
services offering. The integration of SERT, AVEMIS 
and Metallurgica combined with Vesuvius’ 
refractory and flow control systems knowledge 
and expertise is playing a key role in supporting 
this last strategic pillar.  In particular, the 
acquisition of Metallurgica, and the benefits that 
we have been able to deliver in this business 
within Vesuvius, shows the opportunities 
that can be captured from the acquisition of 
complementary businesses. 
We have developed new products and 
capabilities to monitor flow characteristics 
throughout various points in the steel casting 
process and data feedback systems and control 
schemes for real-time optimal flow control 
throughout the entire casting sequence.
Advanced Refractories
Under new management, Advanced Refractories 
has embarked on a process of culture change 
by introducing value selling, training, brand 
and product rationalisation and multi-branding. 
We have also exited low-margin and high risk 
business associated with labour-only construction 
projects. The focus has changed to providing 
best-in-class products and application equipment 
supported by highly experienced and trained 
technical support personnel. Quality initiatives 
have also improved performance which has 
assisted in the margin improvement we have seen 
within this business during the year.
A restructuring was undertaken in NAFTA and 
South America to align our organisation with 
customer requirements, as well as investment in 
growth areas in Central Europe, and the Middle 
East and North Africa (“MENA”).
Investment has also been made in a new 
production facility in Ras Al Khaima in the 
United Arab Emirates and also at Port Kembla 
in Australia, as well as capabilities for taphole 
clay production in India. These new facility 
investments are on schedule to achieve their 
projected returns, despite a considerable 
downturn in the Australian market. Furthermore, 
Vesuvius Advanced Refractories has recently 
acquired its production site in Sao Paulo and 
invested in new senior management to assist in 
our strategy of growth in developing markets.  
Finally, investment in a new laboratory in India 
has been approved and construction is expected 
to begin in early 2014.
Revenue of £462 million was 3.1% lower 
compared with 2012. On an underlying basis 
revenue was up 3.5% reflecting the restructuring 
undertaken to divest non-core activities and to 
realign our business.
As has been detailed elsewhere, the Group’s 
strategy is based upon five major objectives. 
The  following provides more information about 
Advanced Refractories’ progress with these 
objectives.
Advanced Refractories continues to focus on 
technology leadership with:
•	 The Gard™ brand that has established a 
best-in-class product offering in each market 
served
•	 Application operators who are trained and 
certified in correct application practice using 
state-of-the-art equipment specific to the 
required application
•	 Total Tundish Management, supported by 
advanced simulation techniques, which assists 
our customers in ensuring optimum tundish 
design and associated steel cleanliness
•	 Automated robotic application, used to 
ensure safe and consistent application of our 
advanced refractories in the tundish
•	 The Elby™, our Engineered Ladle Bottom 
Yield programme, which has rapidly gained 
acceptance at major forward-thinking steel 
plants. As a result Elby™ production capacity 
was doubled in the USA with investment 
in UK and German precast plants currently 
being planned.
Value creation for our customers is a 
fundamental focus. It is critical that our technical 
customer-facing colleagues understand the 
cost and quality drivers of our customers. 
This continued high level interaction with our 
customers is key to meeting their requirements. 
Customer needs are communicated through 
to the organisation in R&D as well as reflected 
in training sessions carried out with key 
customers. Demonstrating this value creation 
objective, Advanced Refractories enjoys many 
Total Material supply contracts under which the 
customer hands over their entire refractory needs 
to Vesuvius who takes full responsibility for cost 
and consistency.
Lithogard™ for the cement industry and 
Lavagard™ in iron production are two examples 
of recently launched solutions that drastically 
reduce overall monolithic refractory consumption 
and increase up-time associated with these 
industries. When Elby™ is employed, yield 
improvements of up to 4% have been identified 
in many customers.

Steel Division continued
In a very competitive environment, Vesuvius 
maintains its focus on cost leadership. The 
global purchasing organisation only deals with 
approved suppliers and is constantly looking 
at opportunities to ensure consistent high 
quality raw materials with long-term pricing 
stability. Whilst maintaining consistent quality, 
dual sourcing of materials is an active ongoing 
initiative. 
The technical services offering of Advanced 
Refractories is of paramount importance in 
differentiating us from low-tech commodity 
suppliers with limited technical support. Recent 
progress in laser measuring techniques coupled 
with intelligent camera systems and temperature 
measurement have enabled us to identify steel 
cleanliness numerically together with safety 
risks associated with ladle wear and inclusion 
reduction. Due to the exceptional quality of 
our magnesium carbon bricks, capacity was 
increased by 25% to support this objective and 
also to support the growing market demand.

China
A new management structure has been created 
and implemented in the Steel division in China 
to drive business growth in this developing 
market, together with a new overall organisation 
structure reflecting the new market environment 
as China moves from a fast capacity growth 
market to a position of overcapacity.
In 2013 a quality programme was started to 
improve performance in this area. This has 
required investment in a new quality team and the 
introduction of updated quality programmes in 
several manufacturing plants in China.
After a period of reducing revenue in 2013 
Vesuvius achieved a small revenue growth in 
China. In addition, the profitability improved in 
the year, by coupling a cost reduction programme 
and an adjustment of the manufacturing 
operation footprint with steps forward in quality 
to meet the current and projected market 
demand.
China Market Environment 
Whilst the overall steel market in China continued 
to grow from 2012 to 2013, the strong focus 
by the central government on environmental 
issues favours production at new mills over older 
production sites. More environmentally friendly 
products and processes are being stipulated, 
which are beneficial to Vesuvius although these 
developments are being countered by the need 
to maintain strong employment prospects in 
traditional manufacturing areas. 
Within the Chinese market production volume 
exceeded 750Mt in 2013, although in 2013 the 
second half volumes were stronger than the first 
half of the year. We believe that 2014 will see 
a modest growth in steel production although 
there is estimated to be significant overcapacity 
of crude steel production in the China market.
Due to this overcapacity the Chinese steel price 
is under severe downward pressure. As a result, 
some cash shortages have been experienced 
throughout the steel industry and have 
lengthened payment terms and put pressure on 
receivables.

Foundry Industry overview in 2013 
The light vehicle industry continued to face 
challenges in most parts of the world. German 
light vehicle production reduced 2.5% on 2012, 
with strong exports to China and the US not 
fully compensating for weak domestic demand. 
By contrast, NAFTA and Brazilian production 
grew 4% and 7% respectively as domestic 
demand continued to recover. In Asia, Japanese 
production reduced 3.5%, Korea remained flat 
as exports to China compensated for weaker 
domestic demand and India, continuing to suffer 
from an overall weak economy, rising fuel prices 
and interest rates saw 2013 car production fall 
14% vs 2012. China light vehicle output grew 
11%.
The global truck industry grew 4% on 2012, 
driven by a 50% growth in South America as 
Brazil recovered from a weak 2012 (which had 
been down 63% from 2011) due to the wider 
availability of fuel for the new Euro V engines. 
Aside from 10% growth in China, the rest of 
the world experienced reduced output – Europe 
down 4% and NAFTA down 3%.
During the second quarter it became clear that 
the general decline in commodity and precious 
metal prices was starting to impact the mining 
industry. New projects were delayed resulting in 
reduced activity for those foundries producing 
castings for the mining process and related 
equipment and vehicles. The railroad industry 
also suffered due to reduced mining activity. 
These effects were felt most severely by the 
North American and Australian foundry industries 
and in the former, the growth in shale gas as 
a source of energy further reduced railroad 
activity as coal movement reduced. A number of 
construction and mining equipment producers 
have announced rationalisation programmes.
Foundry Outlook in 2014
Global foundry activity is expected to continue in 
2014 at similar levels witnessed in 2013, though 
the situation varies by casting end-user market 
segment and geography. No short-term recovery 
is expected in the North American or Australian 
mining industries, though North American and 
German automotive production are expected 
to remain firm. Activity in China continues to 
strengthen.
Vesuvius in the Foundry Industry
The Foundry division of Vesuvius, trading under 
the Foseco brand, generates 33% of total Group 
revenue and is focused on the global foundry 
industry which produces castings used in a wide 
variety of engineered components. Some 40% 
of castings (and a similar percentage of the 
revenue for the Foundry division) are produced 
for the vehicle sector, of which approximately 
25% comprise light vehicle (passenger cars 
and light trucks) and 15% for heavy trucks. 
Other end-markets for foundry castings include 
machinery for the construction, agriculture and 
mining industries, power generation equipment, 
railroad and general engineering. Foseco is 
a world leader in the supply of consumable 
products and services to the foundry industry. 
These products typically represent less than 5% 
of a foundry’s production cost, but contribute 
significantly to improving both product quality 
and manufacturing efficiency whilst reducing the 
environmental impact of the casting process.
Customers of the Foundry division include the 
world’s major automotive OEMs, truck producers 
and manufacturers of construction, railroad and 
mining equipment. The foundry market is highly 
fragmented and Vesuvius’ 20 largest foundry 
customers represented only 11% of the division’s 
revenue in 2013.

Potential revenue per customer and per tonne 
of castings produced is strongly influenced by 
the technical sophistication of the casting and 
the process used in its production. These factors 
tend to correlate with the level of industrial 
development of the market. Therefore Vesuvius 
sees significant growth potential as industrial 
development continues to progress in developing 
markets, particularly certain parts of Eastern 
Europe and Asia.
Foundry Division performance
Revenue of £493 million represented a 7.0% 
reduction compared with 2012 (down 6.0% on 
an underlying basis). The impact of the mining 
and construction slowdown in the second half of 
the year contributed to the reduction in revenue. 
As mentioned, the impact was most severe in the 
Division’s US and Australian businesses. In both 
locations action was taken promptly to align the 
cost base with activity.
In last year’s report a key strength of Vesuvius 
was highlighted, that of having a cadre of 
geographically mobile senior executives whose 
skills are transferable across the Group, thereby 
facilitating the transfer of best practices and the 
Group’s value-based culture. This remains the 
case, and during the year, the leadership team 
for the Foundry division was strengthened by 
the transfer of the Group Lean Director to the 
position of Foundry Operations Vice President. 
During the year significant progress was made in 
implementing the Foundry division strategic plan. 
Key actions included:
•	 The near-completion of Phase One of the 
China manufacturing expansion in ChangShu, 
due for commissioning in the first quarter of 
2014. This first phase will be a state-of-the-
art Feeding Systems plant
•	 The Board approved the Phase Two 
investment in ChangShu, a Coatings plant 
with a total investment of £8 million
•	 The purchase of a building in Enschede, 
the Netherlands, for conversion to the 
new Foundry central R&D facility to be 
commissioned in the third quarter of 2014
•	 The development of growth plans for the 
Chinese, Mexican and Central European 
markets followed by initial implementation 
actions. 
The Foundry Strategy
The Foundry strategy, Performance Partnership, 
is focused on creating greatest value for the 
customer, by delivering higher casting quality 
and foundry process improvements. This is 
achieved through a partnership relationship in 
which the customer’s highest priority growth 
and process improvement priorities are shared 
by Foseco. Foseco can then develop solutions 
customised to the specific customer’s needs and 
opportunities.
Foseco’s capability to develop solutions relies 
upon a Toolkit with four components:
•	 Product Technology – a wide range of 
best-in-class products, renewed through 
continual innovation 
•	 Applications Expertise – the applications 
skills required to ensure that the products 
deliver maximum performance when used by 
foundries 
•	 Foundry Process Knowledge – intimate 
knowledge of foundry technology, the 
customer and its casting processes
•	 Process Control Capability – a range of 
hardware and software to optimise product 
performance and consistency in use.
Ensuring that Foseco’s Toolkit is always up to the 
job requires that we excel at product innovation 
based upon a deep understanding of the foundry 
industry needs, the development of teams of 
expert application engineers across the world 
and that we maintain a deep knowledge of the 
foundry industry and our customers.
In respect of product technology, Foseco is a world 
leader in the breadth of its product range with 
consumable products for all parts of the casting 
process. To ensure that the customer gains the 
full benefit from the use of Foseco’s products, a 
high degree of applications expertise is required. 
Foseco has a comprehensive network of technical 
sales staff and application engineers across the 
world, thereby ensuring that customers have 
access to high levels of locally available technical 
support. This network is being expanded in 
developing markets.
As a partner to its customers, Foseco must 
bring deep foundry process knowledge to 
the relationship to ensure that the proposed 
solutions align with each customer’s unique 
needs. Finally, to maximise the performance of 
the product or process, process control capability 
is necessary. Foseco achieves this through a 
range of engineering equipment and software, 
all of which are designed to control and provide 
feedback on the performance of the product. 
China
As set out above, Phase One of our ChangShu 
investment is nearing completion. Phase Two 
investment has already started, expected 
for completion in the first half of 2015. In 
conjunction with this the Foundry business 
unit manufacturing capability in China will 
be at the leading edge, with a technical team 
that continues to be strengthened through the 
secondment of group experts into the region.

As set out in our KPIs on page 17, we place the 
highest priority on the safety of our employees 
and use the Lost Time Injury Frequency rate as a 
key indicator of our performance.
We adopt an integrated and comprehensive 
approach to managing workplace risks, covering 
people and property, in our approach to 
effective health and safety management. Our 
aim is to identify, eliminate, reduce or control all 
workplace risks.
Safety Leadership
Safety is the first item on the agenda at all our 
executive and management meetings. 
The Group is committed to continual safety 
improvement with a Group Health and Safety 
Policy stating an objective of:
•	 Zero accidents
•	 No repeat injuries
•	 No harm to people
These objectives are pursued through a range 
of policies, standards and procedures. Our first 
major change programme, ‘Safety Breakthrough’ 
was launched in 2008. This global initiative was 
designed to reduce the number of accidents 
in the business to the lowest level within the 
industry sector, with the ultimate goal to reach 
zero accidents throughout Vesuvius.
The current phase of the Safety Breakthrough 
initiative - Turbo S - builds on the foundation of 
Safety Breakthrough and includes a broad range 
of actions based on recording, analysis and the 
subsequent development of new or improved 
safety procedures. 
As part of this initiative:
•	 Senior executives regularly lead safety tours 
at all locations
•	 Employees participate in routine safety audits
•	 We invest significantly in safety training, 
recently covering Ergonomics and a complete 
review of Lock, Tag and Try implementation
•	 All employees are expected to routinely raise 
safety improvement opportunities 
•	 Safety standards are continually updated, 
translated and deployed globally throughout

Our current strategies show good progress over 
the past six years in reducing the number of lost 
time injuries and Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(“LTIFR”), as shown below. This chart highlights 
the improvement achieved to date – although 
we recognise the need for continued focus on 
this area. In 2013 we set ourselves a Group 
LTIFR target of 1.3. We did not achieve this 
during the year, recording the same LTIFR of 
1.8 attained in 2012. For 2014 we will focus 
on continual improvement to meet the Group’s 
target of 1.2.
Very regrettably, and despite our efforts, in 2013 
Vesuvius suffered a work-related loss of life. A 
full investigation with senior HSE Management 
followed the accident and a Group-wide 
review of relevant procedures was undertaken. 
These standards were updated, operators were 
retrained and we communicated globally on the 
lessons learned from this tragic event.

Accident and Incident Reporting  
and Analysis
A significant investment in time and resources 
has been made over recent years to develop 
robust, comprehensive and timely reporting of 
accident and incident information. Our standard 
provides the foundation for targeted safety 
interventions and activities to reduce the number, 
severity and frequency of lost time injuries and 
incidents. As part of management reporting, the 
Vesuvius Board receives a monthly update on all 
lost time injuries and severe accidents.
Vesuvius has developed a reporting process 
that uses more stringent definitions for LTI 
and ‘severe accidents’ than OSHA (USA). This 
ensures that we capture and investigate all fires, 
explosions and any major spill or other chemical 
release and means we report on all potential fire 
and explosion scenarios, no matter how small 
the actual outcome. 2010 was used as the base 
year for global reporting in order to establish key 
improvement initiatives and meaningful relative 
targets. This process has been successful with 
much more effective reporting levels.
Accident information is openly available and 
summarised in the HSE database, including the 
mandatory completion of a full investigation 
report for more significant incidents to identify 
the true root cause – in line with the ‘No 
Repeats’ objective. The quality of accident 
investigation has improved thanks to the 
common establishment of a ‘Vesuvius 8D’ 
process for practical problem-solving.
Fire incident reporting is an important part of 
the accident and incident reporting process. 
Efforts to improve the reporting of all fires, and, 
in particular, minor and contained process fires, 
have been successful.
Taking Safety Breakthrough to the 
Next Level – Turbo S
Vesuvius launched Safety Breakthrough with 
the aim of reducing the number of accidents 
(including fires), lost time injuries and increasing 
safety awareness through greater employee 
engagement. This major initiative aimed to raise 
health and safety performance to best-in-class 
levels throughout the Vesuvius business. Turbo 
S integrates good management practices in the 
workplace with a strong emphasis on the need 
to standardise tasks so that everybody works to 
the same high standards in safety performance.
Turbo S has been designed to deploy best 
practice and increasing management and 
employee involvement. This is supported by 
dedicated training for all employees including 
senior managers. The initiative continues to work 
towards the ultimate objective of zero workplace 
incidents. 
Turbo S features:
•	 The implementation and sharing of best 
practices through Vesuvius standards and 
other tools
•	 A commitment to become a true Learning 
Organisation, avoiding repeat accidents and 
sharing lessons learned
•	 Total employee involvement, with the need 
for safety improvement being driven at the 
most senior levels of our business.
Safety Audits
A key part of the Turbo S programme is to ensure 
that safety audits become an established and 
sustainable part of the Group’s ongoing safety 
efforts.
The audit programme involves employees at 
all levels – from Group executives and safety 
specialists through to local site management, 
employees and contractors. A database is 
maintained of all Executive, Corporate and Fire 
Safety audits to enable all auditors to have a full 
site history available prior to undertaking the 
next, upcoming audit. The successful programme 
to include employees in safety audits as auditors 
started in 2012 has continued with nearly 
50% of employees and contractors involved 
in conducting audits. The target employee 
participation for 2013 was 50% with 55% 
participation achieved. A target of 75% has been 
set for 2014.
Safety Improvements and  
Lessons Learned
A feature of Turbo S is to become a true learning 
organisation, avoiding repeat accidents and 
we share lessons learned using the ‘Red Stripe’ 
distribution process to avoid repeat accidents by 
highlighting and sharing a serious issue.
Promoting employee engagement in improving 
safety conditions is an important objective. 
This objective is also pursued using the Safety 
Improvement Opportunity with Permanent 
corrective Action (“SIOPA ”) initiative. This 
requires site employees to identify safety 
problems / improvement opportunities, which 
then require a formal response including the 
implementation of improvement action. The 
Group has annual targets for employee SIOPAs 
which are continually reviewed.

Innovation is at the core of all Vesuvius activities. 
Maintaining technology leadership is a central 
objective of our strategy and, as we identify on 
page 19 a failure to develop and protect market-
leading technologies could place our business at 
financial risk.
We regularly examine the structure of the R&D 
organisation and its processes for developing 
new technologies and applications to support 
Group strategy. This process will be enhanced 
following the appointment of our new Chief 
Technology Officer, George Coulston PhD, in 
October.
The innovation process starts with an intimate 
knowledge of our customers’ processes and 
needs. We have more than 200 field applications 
engineers supported by local development 
teams on all continents. These local technical 
teams are constantly updated with the practical 
information on the latest technologies developed 
in our six global research centres. 
These centres have connections with universities 
all over the world and our internal research and 
our cooperation with universities and technical 
centres is directed by a group of dedicated 
scientists and engineers whose mission is to 
ensure that both the short-term and long-
term technology needs of our businesses are 
being met. We aim to strike a balance between 
maintaining a local presence and capturing the 
synergies and other advantages that come from 
organisations based in well-equipped global 
research centres. With this objective in mind, 
a new global Foundry research centre is under 
construction in Enschede, the Netherlands and 
will open during 2014.
Our customer-focused approach to research and 
development (“R&D”) is critical to supporting 
the achievement of the objectives required by 
the Group’s strategy.
We will maintain our technology leadership by:
•	 Continuously investing in the skills and 
knowledge of our employees through in-
house training programmes, as well as by 
hiring engineers from diverse industries, and 
leading universities 
•	 Continuously investing in the latest analytical 
instruments, modelling facilities, and 
customer process simulation equipment 
so that prototypes of new offerings can be 
developed quickly
•	 Leveraging our understanding of customer 
processes to provide products and solutions 
that meet a customer’s existing, as well as 
unarticulated, needs. 
We have expanded our R&D budget by over 
20% in the last three years, and have already 
begun to see benefits. As detailed elsewhere 
in this report, R&D expenditure is a key 
performance indicator for our overall business. 
We have filed 27 new invention and 150 new 
patent applications, in 2013, and also had 182 
patents granted worldwide during the year. 
Vesuvius solutions and products can greatly 
influence the quality of our customers’ products 
and the efficiency of their processes. All our new 
products and solutions are developed with value 
creation for our customers in mind. We regularly 
conduct customer seminars and training sessions, 
which are given to a wide range of managerial, 
technical and operational staff. This seeks to 
ensure that the full range of Vesuvius products 
and solutions are known and properly used, so 
that the maximum benefits are derived.
The following two major innovations, one for 
the foundry industry and the other for steel 
production, clearly illustrate how Vesuvius can 
reduce its customers’ costs:
•	 Foseco’s unique, patented collapsible metal 
core technology continues to capture market 
share throughout all regions (sales have 
grown 50% in the last four years), delivering 
optimum feed performance, casting yield 
improvement and cleaning cost reduction. 
When foundry customers pour molten metal 
into a mould they need to account for 
shrinkage, which will occur as the molten 
metal cools. This shrinkage can lead to a 
variety of defects and result in scrap. Known 
in the trade as “feeders”, our products are a 
critical part of the solution to counteract that 
shrinkage and avoid scrapping the parts
•	 Improved iron-making productivity and 
blast furnace operations with Lavagard™ 
Monolithic Refractory Solutions.
A fully engineered customer-designed 
solution to improve blast furnace up-time and 
productivity has significantly improved iron 
making operations at one of the highest output 
production facilities in the world. Working with 
blast furnace engineers using novel installation 
and application technology, Vesuvius engineers 
were able to recommend changes to the existing 
casthouse design and refractory system. 
By incorporating products from the Lavagard™ 
suite of monolithic refractories, which included 
Lavagard™ FCX precast monolithics and 
Lavagard™ SZ pneumatically installed hot 
veneering repair materials, the blast furnace 
team was able to extend their scheduled rebuild 
and maintenance practices. This has resulted in a 
reduction of 20% repair materials and doubling 
of the tilter life.

Vesuvius local development centres are a key 
element in our strategy of capturing growth 
in developing markets. They are present in 
all regions, and include facilities for both 
physical and computational fluid dynamics. The 
centres ensure an immediate and local focus 
is applied to specific regional issues, ensure 
new opportunities are identified for our current 
product range, and bring newly developed 
products quickly to market in these fast-growing 
economies. 
The R&D organisation has the direct 
responsibility to support the cost leadership 
element of our strategic objectives. A dedicated 
group of engineers specialises in raw materials, 
with the objective of deeply understanding 
raw material quality and its effect on Vesuvius 
products. 
Vesuvius R&D is playing a key role in supporting 
the strategic pillar to build a technical services 
offering, by developing new products and 
capabilities such as:
•	 New instrumentation to monitor flow 
characteristics throughout various points in 
the steel casting process
•	 Data feedback systems and control schemes 
for real-time optimal flow control throughout 
the full casting sequence 
•	 Integrated foundry systems and controls to 
help ferrous melt shop to produce quality 
products. 
Modelling Capabilities
The Vesuvius R&D team makes extensive 
use of sophisticated modelling tools to 
accelerate the rate of innovation. The use 
of Computational Fluid Dynamic (“CFD”) 
modelling, thermodynamic modelling, and 
physical simulation tools, such as advanced 
water modelling, are now deployed throughout 
the solution development process.
For example, these modelling tools allow 
experienced scientists and engineers to analyse 
the complex fluid interactions between refractory 
materials and molten metals which would exist 
in our customers’ operations, and to predict the 
formation of undesirable impurities. 
Consequently, potential problems with a product 
design can often be discovered and rectified 
before the design leaves the computer.
Advanced simulations are also used to 
understand how geometric changes to a 
refractory design impacts the flow of molten 
metal in our customers’ facilities, which in turn 
impacts the quality of the product they produce. 
For example, gas injection into liquid metal, a 
technique employed by our customers to ensure 
homogeneity of temperature and composition in 
a melt, is extremely difficult to visualise in situ. 
Our CFD tools allow such mixing to be simulated 
and are extremely useful for determining the 
influence of the gas on the overall behaviour 
of the system. By combining this information 
with detailed understanding of the chemical 
interactions between refractories and molten 
metal, Vesuvius scientists are able to optimise 
designs and material selection.
The graphics to the right show how CFD 
modelling can be used (1) to visualise the flow of 
argon gas injection in a sub-entry nozzle used in 
a steel plant, and (2) to review the flow of gas in 
a steel ladle. 
Vesuvius engineers are also able to create 
physical models of critical portions of our 
customers’ operations to gain further insights 
into how certain products will perform. Our 
customers often participate with us in this 
modelling process, and they use the results to 
make their own design decisions. By working 
together with us, they are able to explore the 
pros and cons of various design choices, which 
would otherwise potentially have been cost 
prohibitive.

l ean manufacturing
The focus on cost leadership and margin 
improvement is one of our five strategic 
objectives. Additionally, in a business where we 
need to manage the challenges presented by 
cyclicality in our end-markets, a focus on process 
efficiency  and quality is fundamental. 
Focusing on the need to excel in our key 
operational processes, we commenced our Lean 
Programme in 2008. The goal is to generate 
short-term operational gains whilst also building 
an organisation that delivers sustainable and 
continuous improvement. Some of our core 
requirements are that:
•	 Standardisation of tasks and processes is the 
cornerstone of safety, quality, productivity, 
and continuous improvement
•	 Employee motivation and customer 
satisfaction are critical foundations for the 
long-term success of the Group
•	 Improving information flow is instrumental to 
guarantee fast and effective cross-functional 
processes.
The initial focus of the Lean Programme was 
on improving Safety management on the shop 
floor. We then launched an initiative to improve 
Quality in production, which will be followed by 
productivity improvement projects. 
We focus on ensuring the long-term success of 
these initiatives by:
•	 Implementing a robust shop floor 
organisation centred around strong first  
level managers
•	 Growing our problem-solving capabilities 
through training, coaching and workshops to 
“learn by doing”
•	 Designing information systems that will 
support the improved processes. 
In 2013, we maintained our focus as follows:
•	 Several lean and practical problem solving 
training sessions were carried out 
•	 A training programme for shop floor 
managers was designed and piloted
•	 Delivering successful workshops that 
provided significant results in terms of 
productivity increase and lead time reduction
•	 Production control & logistics training was 
organised in all regions to accelerate material 
and information flows across functions, 
giving a framework for substantial inventory 
reduction
•	 A bespoke Manufacturing Execution System, 
to collect all relevant quality control data 
and ensure end-to-end traceability of our 
products was designed
•	 We started the roll-out of a Sales & 
Operations Planning application, to collect 
and distribute forecasts, allowing production 
levelling and inventory reduction without 
jeopardising service to our customers.
In 2014, we will continue the deployment of lean 
practices, with a special emphasis on:
•	 5S to reinforce work environment 
appropriation by workers and continue to 
increase safety. This will be also the first step 
on the way to improve the maintenance of 
key equipment
•	 Equipment flexibility improvement and 
a batch reduction plan in key processes to 
support inventory reduction
•	 Specific project maintenance targets to 
enhance equipment efficiency and reliability
•	 Labour efficiency by the reinforcement of 
the standardisation of work and “Kaizen” 
processes.
We aim to incorporate our Lean Programme in a 
global Excellence model to embed a consistent 
Group-wide approach to operational efficiency. 
Monterrey

5S
5S is an operational methodology developed 
in Japan to improve employees’ workspace 
efficiency. It is based on five Japanese 
words: Seiri (Sort); Seiton (Set in order); 
Seiso (Shine); Seiketsu (Standardise); and 
Shitsuke (Sustain). The method is based 
around a shop floor team, and includes the 
use of standardised colours to identify and 
store items used, and specific obligations to 
maintain work areas to perpetuate the 5S 
approach. An example is shadow boards for 
tools - where missing tools are immediately 
visible against their outline.
Our Lean Programme focuses us on building an organisation 
that delivers sustainable and continuous improvement

Vesuvius Quality Policy
Focusing on Quality is the another important 
step in the implementation of our wider Lean 
programme. We see this as a fundamental part 
of our progress towards operational excellence. 
Already, the renewed focus on Quality has 
improved customer relationships and added to 
operating efficiency.
Our Quality Policy clearly defines the 
commitments and responsibilities which apply to 
all aspects of the business, with implementation 
driven throughout the organisation by senior 
management.

Our Quality Plan features: 
•	 The application of the Vesuvius 8D 
methodology to resolve customer, supplier 
and internal issues. This methodology is built 
upon the 8 Disciplines to follow in order to 
eliminate problems permanently. It is focused 
on determining the root cause, implementing 
effective corrective actions and preventing 
repeat issues
•	 A commitment to become a true Learning 
Organisation. Every problem is welcomed 
as an opportunity for improvement where 
lessons learned are created and shared in 
order to leverage the benefits across the 
Group
•	 The application of Lean Principles to 
improve shop floor quality, responsiveness, 
and flexibility. Lean manufacturing methods, 
such as those successfully utilised in the 
automotive industry, have been adopted 
throughout the Group. These principles drive 
implementation of:
 — strong control plans to detect any defects 
as close as possible to their point of 
occurrence in order to facilitate immediate 
problem solving
 — accelerated product flow to allow quicker 
detection of issues and impact rejects /
rework
 — standardised production methods to 
ensure excellent quality. 
Quality Strategy
Quality Strategy defines a holistic approach to 
the execution and implementation of our Quality 
Policy throughout the organisation. We have 
aligned our Quality Strategy to the corporate 
strategy. The Quality Strategy seeks to support 
the five aspects of corporate strategy:
•	 Maintain technology leadership by 
allowing Marketing & Technology, and 
R&D to keep their focus on technology 
and improving the industrialisation of new 
products than quality fire-fighting
•	 Increase penetration of value-  
creating solutions by satisfying customers 
through improved consistency, leading to 
improved cross-selling and reduced  
business loss
•	 Capture growth in developing markets 
by differentiating ourselves from our 
competition on the basis of our quality and 
our service offering
•	 Support the goal of cost leadership by 
improving the reliability of our products, by 
improving the total cost of ownership for our 
customers, and by reducing costs associated 
with defects, reworks and customer rejects
•	 Built technical service offering to align 
the business with customer needs through 
information received from customer surveys 
and through increased executive visits to 
customers.
Quality
We will operate all work and business activities to ensure the 
quality of the products and services we deliver to our customers

Quality continued
The key features of our Quality Strategy are:
•	 Roll out the Quality Breakthrough Initiative 
throughout the organisation
•	 Build infrastructure to support embedding 
of Quality Breakthrough Initiatives in the 
organisation
•	 Leverage global roll-out of the improvement 
process to drive behaviour to improve 
product and service quality and deliver 
customer loyalty
•	 Use senior executive visits to customer sites 
and lost business analysis as drivers for 
reducing customer attrition.
Reliability 
Reliability is vital to our customers as they use 
Vesuvius’ products in critical areas of their 
own processes. The level of risk attached to a 
catastrophic failure is often such that, for people 
and equipment, no compromise can be accepted. 
Reliability therefore is a primary commitment of 
Vesuvius.
We strive to deliver reliability and consistency 
through best-in-class quality management in 
our 69 production sites and 107 major customer 
locations. 
Reliability also flows from our close cooperation 
with customers’ operations, the permanent 
presence of our engineers and technicians at our 
customers’ locations and the level of service and 
expertise we provide. 
Reliability is maintained within our global 
process of innovation and continuous 
improvement through strict testing procedures 
and transparency with our customers on the 
protocols we follow to validate any change in 
our products. 
Service is part of the Vesuvius culture
The quality of our service delivery derives from 
our deep understanding of our customers’ 
processes and expectations, our intimate 
knowledge of their needs and our efforts to 
increase their performance at all levels of their 
value chain. 
Vesuvius’ plants are close to the customers they 
serve and can deliver goods and technical service 
at very short notice.
Our experts are in permanent contact with our 
customers’ operations to provide support with 
creative solutions and new technologies, based 
on their access to the unrivalled experience 
acquired across the world and throughout the 
industry. 
Reliability 
In 2013, Voestalpine was looking for the 
refractory materials, service and support for 
their jobbing foundry that uses one of the 
largest coreless induction furnaces in the 
world. Because this furnace is used up to 15 
times a month, it needs to be relined five 
times per year, which requires ten tonnes 
of refractory material each time. Due to the 
fact that the steel is heated up to 1,780°C, 
the lining application is demanding and the 
refractory materials must perform well.
Vesuvius service personnel worked closely 
with the customer to find the best option. 
After some preliminary trials the furnace was 
completely lined with Vesuvius products in 
June 2013 to meet customer expectations. 
Maintaining our high level of service is part 
of our commitment to our customers.
Case Study        
   
Reliability 
Foseco specialists played a significant 
role in the supply of safety critical steel 
construction rings used for building a new 
roof at the 76,000 seat Olympic Stadium in 
Berlin. Foseco-patented KALPUR direct pour 
technology was used by Friedrich-Wilhelms-
Hütte (FWH) steel foundry for the production 
of steel construction rings. Reliability of 
these safety-critical steel construction rings 
was crucial, and the foundry chose a Foseco 
patented technology for making these 
castings.
Case Study
Reliability 
Vesuvius is the pioneer in designing, 
supplying and operating “no-lift” refractory 
tube exchange mechanisms for slab casters. 
There is more steel cast through Vesuvius 
tube exchange devices than through any 
other option available on the market. A large 
number of such installations are successfully 
operating worldwide on more than 310 
slab strands. The use of mechanisms and 
refractories from a single technological 
source guarantee utmost operational safety 
and highest performance level. Launched 
first in Europe, our most recent Tube 
Changer SEM3085, is now beginning to 
be used worldwide. By the end of 2014, 
16 strands in the Americas, Asia or Europe 
will operate with this breakthrough model. 
Besides productivity, safety and quality 
impact on final steel, the SEM3085 brings 
new reliability standards.
Its strong design includes a new clamping 
concept for refractory parts as well as an 
iron cast metallic enclosure to support and 
fix the refractory part in a more protected 
way. Thus, it limits stress on refractory 
materials and ensures minimum risk of 
breakage. A complete integration of pipes 
into the mechanical parts minimises risk of 
malfunction of the inert gas or air cooling 
circuit.
Through better sealing between plates, it also 
offers better reliability on steel quality to the 
customer, while taking advantage of the tube 
change function for highest productivity and 
reduced operation cost. Last but not least, 
SEM3085 has been designed robot-ready: the 
tube change operation can be in option under 
full control of a robot that will change tube 
after tube in a reliable protocol.

c orporate r esponsibility
Meeting our responsibilities will enhance our performance
We recognise that our operations impact a wide 
community of stakeholders, including investors, 
employees, customers, business associates 
and local communities, and that appropriate 
attention to the fulfilment of our corporate 
responsibilities will enhance overall performance.
Information on our Code of Conduct, which 
requires the highest standards of legal and 
ethical behaviour, is set out below. Health, Safety 
and the Environment remain of paramount 
importance to the business. A number of 
Vesuvius work activities are undertaken in 
higher-risk locations such as steel mills or 
other customer-controlled facilities. These 
environments can prove dangerous for all 
personnel engaged in working there. Information 
on how we address safety is set out on pages 
32 to 33. For information on sustainability see 
pages 44 to 47. Our disclosures concerning 
Greenhouse Gas emissions are shown on 
page 45 and the new Human Rights policy is 
highlighted below.
Code of Conduct 
Vesuvius has a Code of Conduct, which has 
been distributed throughout the Group and by 
which all our businesses are required to operate. 
The Code of Conduct emphasises the Group’s 
commitment to compliance with the highest 
standards of legal and ethical behaviour. The 
Code of Conduct is reproduced in full on the 
Company’s website (www.vesuvius.com).
The Code of Conduct sets out clear and simple 
principles covering: Customers, Products 
and Services; Employees; Investors; Society 
and Local Communities; Health, Safety and 
the Environment; Conflicts of Interest; and 
Competitors. Maintaining a reputation for 
integrity in all business and other dealings both 
with customers and suppliers remains critical 
to Vesuvius. The Code of Conduct recognises 
that the pursuit of the highest possible ethical 
standards must be as much part of our culture 
as any other facet of our operations. It sets 
out our required standards of legal and ethical 
behaviour and emphasises our commitment to 
the performance of our business in accordance 
with these standards. 
During the year we continued to expand our 
training programme on the Code of Conduct 
and associated anti-bribery and corruption 
policies. This comprised face-to-face training 
and use of an e-learning module, together with 
the publication of an updated Code of Conduct 
and related policies on the Group’s intranet site. 
To date more than 2,000 employees have been 
trained on anti-bribery and corruption issues, 
focusing particularly on those who work with 
customers, suppliers and public officials. We 
continue to develop this process to help our staff 
and counterparties to understand that bribery 
and corruption will not be tolerated in the 
performance of our business. 
Human Rights Policy
The Group has developed a new Human Rights 
Policy, which supplements the Code of Conduct 
and has been approved by the Board. It reflects 
principles contained within the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Labour Organisation’s Fundamental 
Conventions on Labour Standards and the 
United Nations Global Compact.
The Policy is applicable to all employees of 
Vesuvius plc and its subsidiaries. It sets out 
the principles for our actions and behaviour in 
conducting our business affairs and provides 
guidance to those working for us on how we 
approach human rights issues. 
Vesuvius seeks to be a good corporate citizen 
wherever it does business and respects local 
concerns, customs and traditions. Embracing 
Diversity is a cornerstone of Vesuvius’ values. 
The Policy sets out the Group’s commitment not 
to discriminate in any of our employee practices 
and to offer equal opportunities to all.  The 
Group respects the principles of freedom of 
association and the effective recognition of the 
right to collective bargaining and opposes the 
use of, and will not use, forced, compulsory or 
child labour.
Where the Policy commitments are more 
stringent than local laws, we will adhere to 
the standards set out in the Policy. If local 
law is more stringent than our principles, we 
will comply accordingly, using the Policy as a 
guideline.

Our five corporate values, aimed at directing our 
everyday behaviour at work, are as follows: 
Creativity 
Our commitment to technology and quality is the 
basis for our competitive advantage. Creativity 
allows us to develop innovative solutions 
that generate value through performance 
enhancements and continuous improvements. 
Cooperation 
Encouraging internal and external cooperation 
is an effective tool which enables us to create 
unique solutions with our partners. Each 
Vesuvius employee is committed to the success 
of their community of colleagues and customers.
Reliability 
Our solutions involve us in critical aspects of 
our customers manufacturing processes. Our 
commitment to consistently deliver quality 
products and services gives them the level of 
confidence they require. 
Integrity 
At the heart of our promise lies the 
trustworthiness of all Vesuvius employees in 
their acts and words. Integrity, honesty and 
transparency are essential in all our exchanges. 
Embracing Diversity 
Vesuvius is a global company built upon a 
true respect for local customs and experience. 
We recognise and embrace the potential for 
creativity that comes from the coexistence of so 
many different cultures.
The best examples of how our employees 
demonstrate our values are celebrated once a 
year during the Living The Values (“LTV”) Awards 
ceremony. 
During the year, every employee can 
nominate another employee or team to 
recognise exemplary working behaviour 
in line with our values. In 2013, over 107 
nominations were received. These were 
reviewed by a selection committee and the 
best selected for recognition at our LTV 
Awards ceremony. Seventeen awards were 
made in 2013, bringing together employees 
from all geographies of our business to 
celebrate the Vesuvius values.

In 2013, the HR organisation has realigned 
itself and its initiatives to support the strategic 
objectives of the business. Dedicated roles have 
been created in the areas of Talent Management 
and Reward Management, together with a 
further role created to focus on the deployment 
of our Standard Operations Model. 
We have established this Operations HR 
Business Partner role to ensure that in our drive 
to excellence, operations receive the Human 
Resources support they need. The role gives 
active support on training and development, 
compensation and other technical HR issues to 
our manufacturing facilities and personnel in 
order to support the deployment of the Vesuvius 
Standard Operations Model. 
In delivering this global consistency, we rely on 
a strategic framework that ensures alignment of 
HR programmes across divisions. This framework 
is named HTR, and focuses on: 
•	 Hiring and Resourcing
•	 Training and Developing
•	 Retaining and Motivating. 
Vesuvius is a community of experts. We gain a 
significant part of our competitive advantage 
from the skills and expertise of our technical 
staff. Many of our employees, particularly 
those in technical roles, have been with the 
Company for much of their careers, and as such 
have obtained and retained hugely valuable 
knowledge within their fields of expertise. As 
noted in our Principal Risks (see page 19), we 
consider the ability to attract and retain the right 
level of talent as a key risk to be addressed by 
the business. 
We have met this challenge in a number of ways. 
In particular we have focused on knowledge 
transfer through the operation of a number of 
Group-wide training programmes. These are 
deigned to be relevant to all individuals within 
Vesuvius, depending on the stage in their career 
path with the Company and their functional 
responsibilities.  
We have taken particular effort to ensure 
that appropriately targeted technical training 
is available to all members of the Vesuvius 
community.  Under the HeaTt banner - the 
Vesuvius Technical University - we support the 
development of our technical service offering.
Through our Wings programme we aim to 
continuously develop the capabilities of our 
middle managers by exposing them to a wide 
range of management disciplines and coaching.
Line managers are expected to release staff 
for training, and when involved in courses, 
the precedence of the course over day-to-day 
responsibilities is strictly enforced. 
Critically, our HR programmes support the 
deployment of our Group strategy. In order 
to maintain its technological leadership, the 
Foundry division has chosen the city of Enschede 
in the Netherlands to install its worldwide R&D 
centre. The city is located near the borders 
with Germany, centre of the foundry industry 
in Europe, and has a renowned university. The 
location is easily accessible for researchers on 
short and long-term assignments and will also 
operate as a centre for training employees on 
our products and processes.

The smooth deployment of our strategy is 
also supported by the positive relationship 
developed with the employee representatives in 
the European region. Agreement on the terms 
of the working of the European Works Council 
was reached on 7 June 2012. On 24 May 2013, 
the first session of the European Works Council 
took place in Belgium with management and 
personnel delegates from Belgium, Germany, 
France, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden 
and Romania.

To contribute to building the foundation of our 
value-added solutions, Vesuvius has designed a 
series of marketing courses, as a continuation to 
foundations laid down by senior management 
(Boost!) and middle management (Wings, Pulse) 
development programmes. These are delivered 
as training modules available in the corporate 
training programme. Over the course of 2013, 
46 employees have attended one of the two 
corporate courses “EVC Forward Together” 
or “Advanced Marketing”. Another 50 were 
exposed to key industrial marketing principles 
during our one week middle management 
training, Wings. 
In order to meet our business objectives, we 
have to have the right structure to allow for the 
best people to be at the right place at the right 
time. 
The optimal development and deployment of 
our people is at the core of our People Review 
programme. Annually, global, regional and 
country organisations establish their succession 
plans, identify their high potentials and agree 
on individual development plans, supported by a 
global performance management system.
Vesuvius has around 40 expatriates from 13 
different nationalities across 11 countries. Most 
of the expatriate population is located in Asia 
focusing on developing our local operations. 
Our Columbus Project - now in its third year - 
aims to ensure the continuous inflow of new 
talent into our internationally mobile workforce. 
In 2013, five young graduates, two from India 
and three from Brazil, have swapped countries 
for a year as part of pursuing a career at 
Vesuvius.
“The Columbus Project is definitely a really 
challenging and life changing experience. It is 
not easy being away from family and friends 
for nine months in a country that has such 
a different culture and tradition. All of these 
experiences helped me learning to see things 
from different perspectives and made me 
more adaptable to new situations. The feeling 
now, when we are less than one month from 
coming back to Brazil, is that we are not the 
same.”
After three months in her home country, 
Brazil, Aline Baros, Chemical Engineer from 
the Federal University of Minas Gerais, spent 
nine months at Vesuvius in Pune and Calcutta, 
India.

In addition, the management of our Human 
Resources is underpinned by the worldwide 
Towers Watson grading system and a structured 
and consistent compensation & benefits 
management framework, that intends to attract, 
retain and motivate our employees.
We want to equip our people with the right 
skills, both technical and behavioural, and 
preserve our talents from waning over time. 
In addition to local training initiatives, the 
Vesuvius Corporate Training programme offers 
a wide range of disciplines and is adjusted 
every year to ensure that it still reflects the 
needs of the business.
HeaTt Training 
 
HeaTt, the Vesuvius Technical University, supports 
the development of our technical service 
offering, the fifth pillar of our strategy. HeaTt 
stands for ‘Hub for Employee Advanced Technical 
Training’ and is structured along five levels, from 
‘entry’ to ‘expert’. The modules are designed and 
delivered by our internal trainers. While the first 
introductory level gives an overall view of the 
Vesuvius business, its end-markets, products and 
their applications, the more advanced modules 
are specialised by Business Unit. 
In 2013, more than 300 employees took 
part in more than 20 heaTt training events 
across the globe. This platform, together with 
the continuous reinforcement of marketing 
principles amongst our sales and technical 
people and a constant focus on innovation, 
ensures that Vesuvius is well positioned to 
keep on developing its offering of technical 
services to complement its products offering.
HeaTt Training 
 
Finally, Vesuvius and its employees support 
several small scale projects in local communities. 
As an example, winners of an LTV award have 
each elected a charity to which Vesuvius made a 
donation. In the Czech Republic, together with 
other local companies, Vesuvius has financed the 
purchase of several cars by a local charity in 
order to transport disabled children and adults in 
the area. More examples of our contribution to 
such projects are provided on our website  
(www.vesuvius.com).

Background 
Vesuvius remains committed to reducing its 
environmental impact by reducing, reusing 
and recycling waste and improving energy 
efficiency wherever economically viable. The 
Board recognises that good environmental 
management is aligned with the focus on cost 
optimisation and operational excellence.
The Group has 69 manufacturing sites, 18 
warehouses and 91 sales offices located in 34 
countries throughout the world’s major economic 
regions. As part of our business model we 
locate facilities close to our customers to allow 
us to operate in just-in-time supply chains. This 
benefits the customer with short lead times from 
order to delivery and reduces the environmental 
impact of our logistics.
Vesuvius and its processes
Our manufacturing processes are not energy 
intensive (total energy costs are less than 3% 
of revenue, with only 1.9% of the total energy 
requirements across the Group consumed in 
the UK) and do not produce large quantities of 
hazardous or other wastes and emissions. 
Our customers and their processes
As our products are used with molten metal at 
extreme temperatures, our primary commitment 
to our customers is the provision of reliable 
solutions to help protect their employees. 
However, under the Vesuvius and Foseco 
brands, our business delivers a large range of 
solutions that help our customers improve not 
only the safety, but also the productivity of their 
operations, the quality of their products and the 
environmental footprint of their processes.
Thermal optimisation, slag and reject reduction 
are key factors in the processes for which 
we supply solutions. Vesuvius contributes to 
the reduction of its customers’ energy usage 
and subsequent carbon dioxide (“CO
2
“) 
emissions through insulating materials, laminar 
flow management, facilitating extended 
manufacturing sequences and reduced 
downtime. A number of case studies, showing 
the effect and importance of the Group’s 
products on customers’s greenhouse gas 
(“GHG”) and CO
2
 savings, are shown later in 
this section.
Environmental Monitoring
All our factory emissions are proactively 
managed in accordance with local regulations. 
Regular analysis of our operations enables us to 
take appropriate actions to reduce our emissions 
and operate more efficiently. As you will see 
from its inclusion as a key performance indicator 
for the Group (page 17),we consider our levels 
of energy use as a fundamental indicator in 
the day-to-day performance of our business. 
Consequently, the Group monitors its energy 
consumption, worldwide CO
2
 emissions and 
usage of water. 
Regulatory Commitments
The Group also meets all of its obligations in 
relation to the Carbon Reduction Commitment 
Energy Efficiency Scheme (“CRC”) and the 
Producer Responsibility Packaging Waste 
regulations.
The CRC is a mandatory scheme designed 
to encourage large public and private sector 
organisations to reduce their carbon dioxide 
emissions through energy efficiency. The 
Group also has a Climate Change Agreement 
(“CCA”) in place through the British Ceramic 
Confederation. This CCA commits us to 
achieving a specific level of energy consumption, 
which reduces the CCA levy payable if we are 
successful. 
The Packaging Waste regulations require us 
to report the total volume of waste packaging 
we handle each year and to pay a contribution 
towards the collection and recycling costs of 
this material by purchasing Packaging Waste 
Recovery Notes (“PRN”). 
Energy Conservation Plan
The Vesuvius Energy Conservation Plan 
was launched in 2011 with the objective of 
reducing our normalised energy consumption 
by 10% over the following three years. Whilst 
we have made progress, we are still working 
towards achieving this target. Managing our 
energy intensity is part of enhancing our cost 
competitiveness. It also contributes to improving 
the total environmental impact of our customers. 
It is part of our commitment to the communities 
in which we operate. 
Greenhouse Gas Reporting
In reporting GHG emissions, we have used 
the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised edition) 
methodology to identify our greenhouse gas 
inventory of Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 
(indirect) CO
2
. We report in CO
2
 equivalent 
(“CO
2
e”).
Sustainability
We will operate all work and business activities in a manner which 
ensures appropriate care and protection of the environment

Scope 1 covers emissions from fuels used in 
our factories and offices. Scope 2 relates to the 
indirect emissions resulting from the generation 
of electricity, heat, steam and hot water we 
purchase to supply our offices and factories. 
We have used data gathered to fulfil our 
requirements under the CRC Energy Efficiency 
scheme and emission factors from UK 
Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for 
Company Reporting 2014 in the calculation of 
our GHG.
So what is Vesuvius?
a r esponsible Supplier
1.8 tonnes of CO
2
 are emitted for every  
tonne of steel produced. In 2010 the iron and 
steel industry accounted for approximately 
6.7% of total world CO
2
 emissions. Additionally, 
approximately 10 kg of refractory material is 
required per tonne of steel produced. 
Vesuvius’ products, which include refractories, 
reduce the energy consumption of our customers 
and, as their usage also increases the quality of 
customers’ products and reduces waste, they are 
increasingly beneficial when energy costs rise. 
Benefits are realised through:
•	 Working closely with customers to 
improve processes through the supply of 
technologically advanced consumables to 
reduce energy intensity and CO
2
e Intensity 
Ratio in our customers’ processes
•	 Reductions in refractory usage per tonne of 
steel produced by customers, from higher 
quality longer service life
•	 An increase in the level of good castings 
produced per tonne of metal melted through 
improved mould design and the application 
of molten metal  filtration and feeding 
systems
•	 Further downstream benefits of enabling 
lighter, thinner and stronger components 
leading to lighter vehicles and less energy 
consumption. 
A Responsible Manufacturer
Vesuvius’ products are manufactured using 
energy intensive processes. Energy management 
and the CO
2
e Intensity Ratio reduction are 
actively recognised as an area of increasing 
importance. 
Through our membership of the European 
Refractories Producers Federation, currently 
chaired by François Wanecq, Vesuvius’ 
Chief Executive, we work closely with other 
manufacturers to reduce the industry carbon 
footprint. Most recently, a European footprinting 
exercise has been completed for refractories as 
part of the 2050 roadmap, with the ultimate 
ambition of an 80% reduction in the carbon 
footprint of the European ceramic industry.
Detailed analysis of energy usage and GHG 
emissions are undertaken to focus on significant 
processes, with a view to reducing the energy 
consumption and CO
2
e Intensity Ratio.
A Responsible Purchaser
Fuel selection is made carefully to account for 
current and future cost trends, availability and 
environmental impact.
Vesuvius’ purchasing professionals work closely 
with suppliers to ensure availability of raw 
materials and their sustainable supply.
Sourcing of new plant and equipment takes into 
account lifetime energy consumption in order 
to deliver a lower energy intensity, lower CO
2
e 
intensity ratio and hence lower lifetime running 
cost.

Sustainability continued
Energy Efficiency and our Customers 
Vesuvius’ specialised expertise in molten metal 
handling and casting provides assistance 
to customers both by reducing the energy 
intensity of their existing and new breakthrough 
processes, and through the manufacture of new 
products that improve the energy efficiency of 
metal-using products in society. 
We launched our Energy Efficiency and CO
2
 
Impact project to foster the deployment of 
energy efficiency and sustainable solutions 
engineered by our technology departments. A 
CO
2
 Impact stamp, launched in 2011, highlights 
the most energy efficient solutions in our 
portfolio of products and services.
The following examples show a sample of the 
significant potential reduction in CO
2
:
Steel Flow Control 
•	 To support a major Mexican customer’s 
need to reduce energy consumption 
and improve quality, Vesuvius designed, 
developed and implemented a 
significant process change. This resulted 
in not only all of the customer’s 
requirements being met but also the 
following additional benefits:
| | Reduced preheating and associated 
energy consumption
| | Reduced refractory consumption
| | An 8,173 tons per annum steel yield 
improvement
| | A reduction in annual CO
2
 emissions 
of 15,500,000 kg
•	 Vesuvius was able to apply its expertise 
in a European Steel customer to 
deliver improved mould flow, increased 
productivity and extended tundish 
lifetime, resulting in:
| | Reduced refractory consumption
| | Reduced preheat energy 
consumption
| | A 2,500 MT steel per annum yield 
improvement  
| | This is equivalent to a reduction  
of 4,750,000 kg CO
2
 emissions  
per annum.
Advanced Refractories 
•	 In South Africa, Vesuvius is the leading 
supplier of calcined dolomite for use in 
the local primary steel industry. 
•	 The manufacturing process emits 
significant quantities of CO
2
 and has 
been the focus of a detailed study 
aimed at reducing the CO
2
 intensity 
ratio and the energy intensity. 
•	 In 2014 the process will be upgraded 
with an expected reduction in the 
energy intensity of 5%, resulting in:
| | A reduced combustion of coal of 
2,400 MT per annum.
| | An equivalent reduction in 
emissions of 5,600,000 kg CO
2
  
per annum.

Foundry 
•	 The Furnace Deck and Metal 
Transfer area accounts for over half 
of a foundry’s energy consumption. 
Vesuvius’ Foundry division offers 
solutions for these key areas that:
| | Improved yield through the use of 
SEDEX
®
 STELEX
®
 and STELEX PrO
®
 
molten metal filtration products 
and KALMIN
®
  KALMINEX
®
 and 
KALPUR
®
 feeding systems.
 — An Italian ductile iron foundry 
achieved a reduction of 
6,000,000 kg CO
2
 annually for 
57,000 tons castings shipped
 — There was an additional 
€180,000 saving in emission 
certificates
| | Reduced energy consumption, 
for example, through the use of 
KALTEK
®
 refractory insulating linings 
for ladles.  
 — One Dallas foundry achieved  
savings in CO
2
 emissions of 
almost 1,200,000 kg CO
2
| | Resulted in right first time castings 
through computer simulation.
Foundry 
•	 Foseco foundry ENERTEK crucibles are a 
new family of energy efficient crucibles. 
Specially designed to maximise 
thermal conductivity, they typically 
offer foundries a 3%–8% reduction in 
energy consumption with an equivalent 
reduction in CO
2
 emissions.
•	 In just one aluminium sand foundry, 
this gave a reduction in CO
2
 emissions 
of 33,000 kg per annum.

corporate governance 22904-04  10-02-2014  Proof 3
Dear Shareholder,
2013 was the first full year in which the Board, 
supported by our management team, embraced 
the governance responsibilities that come 
with being an independent public company. 
It was a year in which narrative reporting was 
significantly updated, with new disclosure 
requirements on strategic issues, remuneration 
and audit matters. For the first time we cover our 
approach to human rights (see the Corporate 
Responsibility section from page 39), and the 
identification our own greenhouse gas emissions 
including case studies showing the major 
impact we have in reducing our customers’ 
CO
2
 emissions (see the Sustainability section 
on page 44). We welcome the opportunity that 
these changes give us to continue to explain 
the Vesuvius story and how we approach the 
management of our business.
Board 
Following the changes at the demerger, in 
2013 we continued to shape our Board for the 
future. John Sussens and Jan Oostervelt retired 
at the 2013 AGM, and we thank them for their 
considerable contribution to the successful start-
up of Vesuvius plc. Nelda Connors joined the 
Board in March 2013, Jane Hinkley took over the 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee following 
the AGM and Jeff Hewitt became our Senior 
Independent Director, continuing as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. I chair the Nomination 
Committee (other than when the committee is 
considering my successor). We each report on 
the activities of our respective committees in 
this governance report. I believe that the Board’s 
composition addresses our current requirements 
for expertise, diversity and experience and, as 
such, is well equipped to face the challenge of 
setting and managing the strategic direction of 
the business. 
Evaluation
We undertook an externally moderated 
evaluation of the Board, its committees and 
individual Directors towards the end of 2013.  
I am delighted to report that the overall outcome 
from the evaluation was that the Board and its 
individual Directors are performing effectively, 
that the Board is well supported and presents 
an open forum for debate. Arising out of the 
evaluation, the primary areas for future focus 
were succession planning and ensuring that we 
spend adequate time on strategy, particularly 
in the light of the increasing and evolving 
governance and compliance obligations placed 
on all listed companies.
Succession
The Board is content with its current composition 
but will continue to keep succession under 
review. In 2014 the primary focus will be on 
Executive Director and senior management 
succession and, as part of the Board’s overall 
review of strategy, this will be a key area for 
further development. 
Training
As part of its training and development remit, 
the Board visited operations in China, and during 
the year had discussions with our advisers on 
the capital structure of the Group, returns to 
shareholders, strategy, and anti-bribery and 
corruption issues. I also continued to develop 
my wider understanding of the business with 
visits to operations in Germany, Poland, Belgium, 
South Africa and the USA, plus a second visit 
to China. Board development relating to the 
Vesuvius business and the wider corporate 
environment is an ongoing process. The Board 
engages directly with senior management, both 
through set-piece presentations at the Board 
and through Board and individual Director 
visits to operations. We will continue to do this 
throughout 2014.
Risk
Alongside every successful strategy has to be 
the management of the risks that come with 
its execution. During the year we re-examined 
how we identify and analyse risk, so that major 
issues are identified across the Group’s business. 
The methods by which we manage our risks and 
assess their impact will be reviewed again in 
2014. 
Looking Ahead
In 2014 we will take the messages that came 
out of the external evaluation to build on 
existing Board practices, and develop our 
stewardship of the Company and its overall 
governance. We will continue to develop both as 
a Board and as individual Directors, and we look 
forward to contributing towards and overseeing 
the development of Vesuvius over the next year 
and beyond.
Yours sincerely
John McDonough CBE 
Chairman

Governance Report
The Board of Vesuvius plc (the “Company”) is 
responsible for the Group’s system of corporate 
governance and is committed to maintaining 
high standards and to evolving governance 
arrangements to comply with emerging best 
practice. This report describes the Company’s 
corporate governance structure and explains 
how Vesuvius has applied the main principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”) 
during the year ended 31 December 2013.   
Throughout the year and up until the date of this 
report Vesuvius was in full compliance with the 
requirements of the Code. 
Roles and Responsibilities of  
the Board
Ultimate responsibility for the management of 
the Group rests with the Board of Directors. 
The Board focuses primarily upon strategic and

oversees the allocation of resources and monitors 
the performance of the Group in pursuit of this, 
all within a framework of prudent and effective 
control which enables risk to be assessed and 
managed.
The Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it and delegates certain matters to its 
committees. It is anticipated that the Board will 
convene on seven scheduled occasions during 
2014 as well as holding ad hoc committee 
meetings to consider non-routine business when 
required.

To the extent that Directors are unable to attend 
scheduled meetings, or additional meetings 
called on short notice, they will receive the 
papers in advance and relay their comments to 
the Chairman for communication at the meeting. 
The Chairman will follow up after the meeting in 
relation to the decisions taken.
EFFECTIvEnESS
Board Composition
The Board comprises seven Directors – the 
Non-executive Chairman, John McDonough CBE; 
the Chief Executive, François Wanecq; the Chief 
Financial Officer, Chris O’Shea; and four Non-
executive Directors, three of whom are deemed 
to be independent for the purposes of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Jeff Hewitt is the 
Senior Independent Non-executive Director. 
Richard Malthouse served as Company Secretary 
until 1 September 2013 when Henry Knowles 
was appointed to the role. 
The Board seeks to ensure that both it, and 
its committees, have the appropriate range of 
diversity, skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company to enable them 
to discharge their duties and responsibilities 
effectively. The Board’s overall skills and 
experience, as well as Non-executive Director 
independence, were reviewed during the year 
as part of the annual corporate governance 
review, and Board composition formed part 
of the Board’s evaluation process. The Board 
considers its diversity, size and composition 
to be appropriate for the requirements of the 
business. The Non-executive Directors are drawn 
from different nationalities and have significant 
experience of managing complex global 
businesses. 
Committee composition is set out in the relevant 
committee reports. No one other than Committee 
Chairs and members of the Committees are 
entitled to participate in meetings of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees, but 
others may attend by invitation.
The Board considers that a majority of the Board, 
(excluding the Non-executive Chairman) namely 
Nelda Connors, Jeff Hewitt, and Jane Hinkley, are 
independent of management and free from any 
business or other relationship which could affect 
the exercise of their independent judgement. 
Christer Gardell is Managing Partner of Cevian 
Capital which holds 21.02% of Vesuvius’ 
issued ordinary share capital and is not 
considered to be independent. He brings a 
wealth of commercial acumen to the Board. The 
Chairman satisfied the independence criteria 
on his appointment to the Board. John Sussens 
served as Senior Independent Director until his 
retirement at the 2013 AGM, when Jeff Hewitt 
was appointed to the role. Biographical details of 
the Directors are set out on pages 50 and 51.
Appointments to the Board
Recommendations for appointments to the 
Board are made by the Nomination Committee. 
The Nomination Committee follows a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board. 
Board appointments are made on merit against 
objective criteria, selecting the best candidate 
for the post. Non-executive appointees are also 
required to demonstrate that they have sufficient 
time to devote to the role. The Nomination 
Committee is responsible for reviewing Board 
succession to ensure that plans are in place for 
the appropriate refreshing and orderly succession 
of Board directorships. Further information is 
set out in the Nomination Committee report on 
page 65.
Time Commitment of the Chairman 
and the non-executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors each 
have a letter of appointment which sets out the 
terms and conditions of their directorship. An 
indication of the anticipated time commitment 
is provided in any recruitment role specification, 
and each Director’s letter of appointment 
provides details of the meetings that they are 
expected to attend, along with the need to 
accommodate travelling time (particularly for 
overseas trips). Non-executive Directors are 
required to set aside sufficient time to prepare 
for meetings, and regularly to refresh and update 
their skills and knowledge. In signing their letters 
of appointment, all Non-executive Directors 
have consequently agreed to commit sufficient 
time for the proper performance of their 
responsibilities, acknowledging that this will 
vary from year to year depending on the Group’s 
activities. Directors are expected to attend all 
scheduled Board and Committee meetings 
and any additional meetings as required. Each 
Director’s other significant commitments are 
disclosed to the Board at the time of their 
appointment and they are required to notify 
the Board of any subsequent changes. The 
Company has reviewed the availability of the 
Non-executive Directors and considers that each 
of them is able to, and in practice does, devote 
the necessary amount of time to the Company’s 
business. 
Induction and Training
A comprehensive induction programme is 
in place for new Directors, and was used in 
2013 on the appointment of Nelda Connors. 
This includes visits to manufacturing facilities, 
meetings with key Group executives and 
introductions to the Company’s principal external 
advisers, as appropriate. Reference materials 
are provided, including information about 
the Board, its committees, Directors’ duties, 
procedures for dealing in the Company’s shares 
and other regulatory and governance matters, 
and Directors are advised of their legal and 
other duties and obligations as Directors of a 
listed company. The Company Secretary ensures 
that after a certain period of appointment, new 
Directors feel that they have received sufficient 
induction information, and supplies support for 
any subsequent requirements. 
The Chairman, through the Company Secretary, 
continues to ensure that there is an ongoing 
process to review training and development 
needs. Directors are provided with details of 
seminars and training courses relevant to their 
role. They are encouraged to attend these as 
they consider appropriate and are supported 
by the Company in doing so. Where a general 
training need is identified, in-house training 
can be provided to the entire Board. Regulatory 
updates are provided as a standing item at 
each Board meeting in a Secretary’s Report. In 
2013, given the proximity of the demerger, no 
formal externally moderated update on corporate 
matters was undertaken. However, technical 
updates were delivered by certain of the 
Company’s advisers and focused predominantly 
on changes to narrative reporting.

Governance Report continued
Information and Support
The Board ensures that it receives, in a 
timely manner, information of an appropriate 
quality to enable it to adequately discharge 
its responsibilities. Papers are provided to the 
Directors in advance of the relevant Board or 
Committee meeting to enable them to make 
further enquiries about any matters prior to the 
meeting should they so wish. This also allows 
Directors who are unable to attend to submit 
views in advance of the meeting. 
Outside of the Board documents the Chief 
Executive provides written updates on important 
Company business issues together with certain 
financial and management information to 
keep Directors updated. Regular updates on 
shareholder issues and discussions are also 
provided to the Board, who also receive copies 
of significant analyst’s notes issued on the 
Company. Directors have access to a secure 
online portal used for the distribution of all 
information. 
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary. There is also 
an agreed procedure in place for Directors, in the 
furtherance of their duties, to take independent 
legal advice at the Company’s expense.
Performance Evaluation
In accordance with the provisions of the 
Code, the Chairman led a formal and rigorous 
evaluation of the Board’s performance and 
effectiveness during the year, together with an 
evaluation of the performance of the Audit and 
Remuneration committees and an individual 
performance review of each of the Board 
members. In addition, the Senior Independent 
Director led an evaluation of the performance 
of the Chairman. The evaluation was externally 
moderated by Lintstock, who collated responses 
from participants and presented an analysis of 
the results to the Chairman. Lintstock examined 
the balance of individual skills and experience, 
independence, and knowledge of the Company 
amongst the Directors, together with Board 
diversity (including gender) and Board interaction 
and effectiveness as part of the evaluation. 
Lintstock’s analysis was circulated to the Board 
and formed the basis of one-on-one discussions 
conducted by the Chairman with each member 
of the Board and the Company Secretary. These 
conversations also covered the output from the 
individual Director reviews. 
The overall outcome of the evaluation was 
that the Board and its individual Directors 
are performing effectively, that the Board is 
well-supported in terms of information flow 
and presents an open forum for debate. The 
primary areas identified for future focus were 
succession planning, Board composition, and 
ensuring that the Board maintained its focus on 
strategy, particularly in the light of the increasing 
and evolving governance and compliance 
obligations placed on plc boards. As a result of 
the evaluation, Board and senior management 
succession will be addressed specifically at the 
Group strategy review to be held in July and a 
series of set piece business unit and functional 
presentations will be made to the Board to 
ensure that Group-wide strategy is being 
understood and interpreted in the Business Units 
and that direct feedback on strategy can come 
to the Board.
Appointment and Replacement of 
Directors
The Board membership should not be fewer than 
five nor more than 15, save that the Company 
may, by ordinary resolution, from time to time 
vary this minimum and/or maximum number of 
Directors. Directors may be appointed by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. A Director appointed 
by the Board must retire from office at the first 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) after his/her 
appointment. A Director who retires in this way 
is then eligible for reappointment. The Board may 
appoint one or more Directors to any executive 
office, on such terms and for such period as it 
thinks fit and it can also terminate or vary such 
an appointment at any time. The Articles specify 
that at every AGM, any Director who has been 
appointed by the Vesuvius Board since the last 
AGM and any Director who held office at the 
time of the two preceding AGMs and who did 
not retire at either of them, shall retire from 
office. Any Director who retires at an AGM may 
offer himself for reappointment. In accordance 
with the requirements of the Code, all the 
Directors will offer themselves for re-election 
at this year’s AGM. The biographical details 
of each of the Directors, including details of 
their other directorships and relevant skills and 
experience, are set out on pages 50 to 51 and in 
the 2014 Notice of AGM. The Board believes that 
each of the Directors standing for re-election 
is effective and demonstrates commitment to 
his/her respective role. Accordingly, the Board 
recommends that shareholders approve the 
resolutions to be proposed at the 2014 AGM 
relating to the re-election of Directors.
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
The Board has established a formal system to 
authorise situations where a Director has an 
interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, 
with the interests of the Company (“Situational 
Conflicts”). Directors declare Situational Conflicts 
so that they can be considered for authorisation 
by the non-conflicted Directors. In considering a 
Situational Conflict these Directors act in the way 
they consider would be most likely to promote 
the success of the Company, and may impose 
limits or conditions when giving authorisation 
or subsequently if they think this is appropriate. 
The Company Secretary records the consideration 
of any conflict and records any authorisations 
granted. The Board believes that the systems it 
has in place for reporting Situational Conflicts 
continues to operate effectively. No Situational 
Conflicts were brought to the Board for 
authorisation during the year under review.

Risk Management and Internal 
Control
The Board has overall responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining a system of 
risk management and internal control, and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risks facing the Group and safeguard 
its assets. No system of internal control can 
provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Group’s system 
is designed to provide the Directors with 
reasonable assurance that problems are 
identified on a timely basis and are dealt with 
appropriately. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls, and risk 
management systems. The key features of the 
Group’s system of internal control are set out 
below.
Process Elements
Strategy and 
financial reporting
•	 comprehensive strategic planning and forecasting process 
•	 annual budget approved by the Board 
•	 monthly operating financial information reported against budget
•	 key trends and variances analysed and action taken as appropriate
Vesuvius GAAP •	 accounting policies and procedures formulated and disseminated to all Group operations
•	 cover the application of accounting standards, the maintenance of accounting records and key financial control procedures
Operational 
controls 
•	 operating companies and corporate offices maintain internal controls and procedures appropriate to their structure and 
business environment
•	 compliance with Group policies on items such as authorisation of capital expenditure, treasury transactions and the 
management of intellectual property
•	 common accounting policies and procedures and financial reporting software used in financial reporting and consolidation
•	 significant financing and investment decisions reserved to the Board, including guarantees and indemnities
•	 Board monitors policy and control mechanisms for managing treasury risk 
Risk assessment 
and management
•	 continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks
•	 risk management process designed to identify the key risks facing each business
•	 reports made to Board on how those risks are managed
•	 each major Group Business Unit produces a “risk map” to identify key risks, assess the likelihood of risks occurring, their 
impact and mitigating actions
•	 Board reviews insurance and other measures used in managing risks across the Group
•	 Board notified of major issues and makes an annual assessment of how risks have changed
Reviewing the Effectiveness of 
Internal Contol
The internal control system is monitored and 
supported by the Group’s internal audit function, 
which conducts reviews of Vesuvius’ businesses 
and reports objectively both on the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the system of internal control 
and those businesses’ compliance with Group 
policies and procedures. The Audit Committee 
receives reports from the Group Head of Internal 
Audit and reports to the Board on the results of 
its review. 
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control, 
iit delegates the following matters to the Audit 
Committee to be carried out during the year: 
•	 Review of external and internal audit work 
plans 
•	 Consideration of reports from management, 
internal audit and external audit on the 
system of internal control and any significant 
control weaknesses 
•	 Discussions with management on the actions 
taken on problem areas identified by Board 
members, in internal audit reports or in 
external audit management letters 
At the year-end, following the review by the Audit 
Committee of internal financial controls and of 
the processes covering other controls, the Board 
evaluated the results of the internal control and 
risk management procedures conducted by senior 
management. This included a self-certification 
exercise by which senior financial, operational and 
functional management throughout the Group 
certified the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control within the business area for which they 
were responsible, together with their compliance 
throughout the year with the Group’s policies and 
procedures. 
Consequently, in accordance with the provisions 
of the Code, the Directors confirm that they 
have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control and that the necessary 
actions have been taken to remedy any control 
weaknesses identified during the year. Since the 
date of this review there have been no significant 
changes in internal controls or other matters 
which could significantly affect them.

corporate governance 22904-04  10-02-2014  Proof 3
Executive Compensation and Risk
All of the independent Non-executive Directors 
serve on both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. They therefore bring their 
experience and knowledge of the activities of 
each committee to bear when considering the 
critical judgements of the other. This means 
that the Directors are in a position to consider 
carefully the impact of incentive arrangements 
on the Group’s risk profile and to ensure the 
Group’s remuneration policy and programme is 
structured so as to accord with the long-term 
objectives and risk appetite of the Company. 
Share Capital and voting
Disclosure of the information regarding share 
capital, the authorisation received by Directors at 
the AGM regarding the issue of shares and the 
authority to purchase own shares, is contained 
on pages 85 and 86 of the Directors’ Report. 
There are no restrictions on voting contained in 
the Company’s Articles of Association. Further 
details are set out in the Directors’ Report on 
page 87. 
Relations with Shareholders
The Board is committed to communicating with 
shareholders and stakeholders in a clear and 
open manner, and seeks to ensure effective 
engagement through the Company’s regular 
communications, the AGM and other investor 
relations activities. The Company undertakes an 
ongoing programme of meetings with investors, 
which is managed by the Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer. The majority of meetings 
with investors are led by them. However, the 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director and 
Committee Chairs remain open for discussion 
with shareholders on matters under their areas 
of responsibility, either through contacting 
the Company Secretary or directly at the 
AGM.  All Directors are expected to attend the 
Company’s AGM, providing shareholders with 
the opportunity to question them about issues 
relating to the Group, either during the meeting 
or informally afterwards.
The Company reports its financial results to 
shareholders twice a year, with the publication 
of its Annual and Half-Yearly Financial Reports. It 
also issues two further trading updates each year 
with the publication of its Interim Management 
Statements. In conjunction with these 
announcements, presentations or teleconference 
calls are held with institutional investors and 
analysts. Recordings of these will be made 
available on the Group’s website (www.vesuvius.
com) along with hard copies of any presentation 
materials issued.

The Audit Committee comprises all of the 
independent Non-executive Directors of the 
Company. The Members bring a wide range 
of financial and commercial expertise to the 
Committee’s deliberations. I continued to be 
the Committee Chairman. I am a qualified 
accountant and have the required recent and 
relevant financial experience. Jane Hinkley 
joined at the time of the demerger of Cookson 
Group and Nelda Connors joined the Committee 
in March 2013; both Nelda and Jane have 
brought a fresh perspective to the Committee’s 
activities. Member’s biographies are on page 
51. The Company Secretary is Secretary to the 
Committee.
Meetings
The Committee met four times during the year. 
We continue to operate in an inclusive manner. 
Hence, the Board Chairman, non-independent 
Non-executive Director, Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, 
Head of Internal Audit and KPMG were invited 
to each meeting. Other management executives 
were invited to attend as appropriate. This 
openness supported the quality and transparency 
of the Committee’s work and the communication 
of its deliberations with the Board, executives 
and auditors. The Committee also met privately 
with the external auditor KPMG and the Head 
of Internal Audit without any executives being 
present, and I met informally with KPMG and 
with the Head of Internal Audit between the 
scheduled meetings to discuss any emerging 
issues. This “avoidance of surprises” approach 
was reinforced by regular meetings with relevant 
executives. I reported on the outcome of our 
meetings to the Board and all members of the 
Board received the agenda, papers and minutes 
of the meetings.
Roles and Responsibilities
The primary roles and responsibilities of the 
Committee remained the same as in 2012, with 
the addition that in 2013 the Committee advised 
the Board on whether it believed the Annual 
Report and Accounts taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable.
The Committee operates under formal terms of 
reference which were reviewed and updated 
during the year and approved by the Board. The 
terms of reference are available on the Group’s 
website (www.vesuvius.com). Within these terms 
the Committee and its individual members are 
empowered to obtain outside legal or other 
independent professional advice (at the cost of 
the Company). Such powers were not required 
during the year. The Committee may also secure 
the attendance at its meetings of any employee 
or other parties with relevant experience and 
expertise should it be considered necessary.
Activities in 2013
In 2013 we particularly focused on the 
requirements arising from guidance and 
regulation relating to financial reporting, and 
in particular on changes to narrative reporting. 
I and the other members of the Committee 
believe that we received sufficient, relevant and 
reliable information from management and 
the external auditor, to enable us to discharge 
our responsibilities. Rather than reporting our 
meetings chronologically I will highlight the 
areas of our focus.
Financial Reporting
In relation to the year under review, we 
discharged our primary responsibility to review 
the integrity of the half year and annual financial 
statements with management and the external 
auditor. This included assessing:
•	 The quality, acceptability and consistency of 
the accounting policies and practices
•	 The clarity and consistency of the disclosures, 
including compliance with relevant financial 
reporting standards and other reporting 
requirements
•	 Significant issues where judgements have 
been made that are material to the reporting 
or where discussions have taken place 
with the external auditor in arriving at the 
judgement or estimate
•	 At the request of the Board, whether the 
Annual Report and Accounts taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
taking into consideration all the information 
available to the Committee.
During the year the Audit Committee continued to focus on 
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting and 
also advised the Board on the application of recently introduced 
reporting and governance requirements, including whether the 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable

Audit Committee continued
The Committee deliberated reports from the 
Chief Financial Officer and Group Financial 
Controller that were well prepared and analysed 
various alternatives as appropriate. KPMG also 
delivered memoranda for the half-year and 
year-end reporting their views on significant 
issues. KPMG provided a summary for each 
issue, including their assessment of the prudence 
of management’s judgements. The Committee 
considered the overall degree of prudence 
applied this year and also in comparison with the 
prior year. Importantly, the Committee agreed 
with KPMG that the judgements made were 
cautious, but not overly prudent, and consistent 
over time. Consistency remained a critical 
consideration, so that the trend in reported 
performance is not distorted by differing 
judgements on issues that span more than one 
reporting period. KPMG proposed no material 
audit adjustments arising from their audit 
work, which provided additional comfort to the 
Committee.
Significant Issues and Material 
Judgements
In discussing the significant issues and areas 
of material judgement, I have distinguished 
between issues that were specific to the year 
and ongoing topics that persist from year to 
year. Both were and are important areas for 
the Committee to consider, but the ongoing 
topics have been and are covered regularly in 
the accounts with disclosures and are generally 
common topics across many companies.
Significant topics specific to the year: 
•	 Recognition of US deferred tax asset. 
The recognition of £29.2m of deferred tax 
assets as explained in Note 12 was a major 
judgement taken during the second half of 
the year and was arrived at after extensive 
modelling, specifically of future profits in the 
United States. The Group has additional tax 
losses and other timing differences in the 
United States and elsewhere which have not 
been recognised, but recognition will be kept 
under review in future years as expectations 
of future profits, and hence the prospects for 
utilising these losses, evolve. This is a highly 
technical area where the Committee drew on 
the views of internal and external experts to 
agree the treatment.
•	 Disposal of Precious Metals. The disposal 
of the Precious Metals Processing division 
in the year was completed and a number of 
warranties were given, for which reasonable 
and prudent reserves have been established. 
The Committee agreed the accounting 
treatment and the outstanding matters 
on the disposal were completed within 
expectations.
•	 vAT Claim. As noted in the Contingent 
Liability Note 37, the Precious Metals 
Processing business in the UK was subject to 
a Missing Trader VAT fraud claim by HMRC. 
During the second half of the year this claim 
failed and the prior year provision that had 
been made was substantially reversed within 
Discontinued Operations. The Committee was 
regularly updated on progress and agreed 
the accounting treatment.
Significant ongoing topics considered were: 
•	 Income Tax provisions. Provisioning for 
income tax is an ongoing complex area 
where major judgements are made, for 
example, on provisions relating to taxes that 
might arise from transfer pricing policies. The 
Committee agreed the overall tax provision 
of £45.0m, as reflected in the Group balance 
sheet, after consideration with internal and 
external experts.
•	 Other provisions. The Committee 
considered the level of provisions established 
in the context of all available internal and 
external advice, together with any existing 
insurance cover. The level of provisions held 
in respect of open litigation matters is an 
area of significant ongoing management 
judgement. Provisioning for future potential 
costs associated with businesses disposed 
of or closed or restructured is a further 
area where ongoing long-term judgements 
are required. Expert advice is taken on the 
relevant areas, including litigation claims, 
environmental liabilities and warranty claims, 
together with provisions in respect of indirect 
taxation matters and the level of 
•	 provisions held was adjusted appropriately as 
reflected in Note 35 to the accounts. Given 
that the trading of the Group’s steel industry 
customers was difficult during the year, 
particular attention was paid again to  
the working capital reserves held against 
receivables and inventories to ensure that 
appropriate levels have been established.
•	 Impairment of intangible assets. 
The carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets, being some £555m and 
£162m at year-end, respectively, was tested 
against the current economic backdrop and 
the Committee agreed that no impairment 
charge was required (see Note 19). 
•	 Pensions. Given the complexities of 
the pension accounting treatment and 
assumptions described in Note 31 to the 
accounts, these were challenged as to their 
appropriateness for the Group’s major 
schemes. 
The judgements made on each of the significant 
issues were considered and found to be 
appropriate and acceptable by the Committee.
The Committee assessed all information 
available to it in considering the overall drafting 
of the Annual Report and the process by which 
the report was compiled and reviewed so as 
to be able to provide its advice to the Board 
that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Committee noted that the 
“understandable” test is challenging given the 
complexity of the accounting standards that 
have to be applied.
Internal Controls
The Committee considered the process by which 
management evaluated internal controls across 
the Group. The Head of Internal Audit provided 
the Committee with a review and analysis of 
the assurance provided by the controls and the 
testing of these controls. The Committee agreed 
that the review indicated a satisfactory control 
environment.

 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 22904-04  10-02-2014  Proof 3
The Group is made up of mainly small operating 
units in geographically diverse locations and so 
segregation of duties and remote management 
oversight can give rise to fraud opportunities. 
Over the years there have been limited 
instances of fraud, which had been detected 
and preventative actions taken. The amounts 
involved were small. The internal audit scope 
and coverage was reviewed again in light of 
such risks, and line management was further 
strengthened. This year the external auditor 
performed enhanced procedures around the 
Code of Conduct, the Code itself and the 
process for embedding it across the Group. 
The Committee found this further process 
useful. Each year the General Managers and 
Finance Managers of the businesses self-certify 
compliance with Group policies and regulations, 
which provides another safeguard. 
After considering these various processes, the 
Committee was able to provide its assurance to 
the Board on the effectiveness of internal control 
within the Group.
The Committee also continued its monitoring 
and oversight of the procedures for the 
receipt, retention and treatment of complaints 
by employees. This is an independent and 
confidential service worldwide where 
employees may register any concerns about any 
incorrect or irregular practices they perceive 
in their workplace. The very limited number 
of complaints were followed up appropriately 
and related to organisational grievances. 
The effectiveness of these procedures will be 
reviewed further during 2014. 
Internal Audit
The Group’s internal audit function operates 
on a global basis. The Head of Internal Audit is 
responsible for the team of five professionally 
qualified individuals located in the major 
regional areas of the Group’s activities. As in 
previous years, the team carried out assignments 
in accordance with an annual internal audit plan 
approved by the Committee. The plan is based 
on assessed risks and aims to cover all locations 
on a three-year cycle as the minimum. 
In 2013, 48 audit assignments were undertaken 
covering 30% of the business. The Head of 
Internal Audit reports directly to me and the 
Committee reviewed progress against the plan 
and discussed recent reports from the Head of 
Internal Audit at each of its meetings. Where 
control issues or other problems were flagged 
by the fieldwork the Committee ensured 
appropriate and timely action by the responsible 
management, involving senior management as 
necessary, with a follow-up review. An internal 
survey of the quality and effectiveness of internal 
audit was undertaken and again the team 
scored highly on their professional approach. 
The long-standing Head of Internal Audit retired 
at the end of the year and a successor has been 
recruited. She will review and, as necessary, 
further develop the effectiveness of the internal 
audit function.
Risk Management
Risk management is inherent in the business 
planning processes of the Group and risk 
registers were constructed and reviewed in 
each major business. The Head of Internal 
Audit coordinated the accumulation of these 
operational risks for consideration by the Group 
Executive Committee and then by the Board, 
who also input top-down strategic risks into the 
process. The Committee oversaw this process 
and its members fully participated in the Board 
examination of risks and mitigating actions. In 
particular, the Committee determined that the 
principal risks and uncertainties as set out on 
pages 18 and 19 of the Strategic Report properly 
reflect the outcome of this process. 
External Audit
The Committee and the Board is committed to 
the continued excellence of the external audit 
process and this expectation is well understood 
by management. The effectiveness of the 
external audit in the past year was tested by 
reviewing the quality of issues and challenges 
raised by KPMG to the Committee and to 
management across the Group, supported by a 
quality review carried out by the Group Financial 
Controller. The effectiveness of the external 
audit was deemed high by the Committee and 
management.
The audit report provided by KPMG on pages 
89 and 90 of the accounts provides a summary 
of the scope, coverage and materiality levels 
applied by KPMG in the audit. The Committee 
agreed as part of the audit planning based on 
the forecast results of the year and a detailed 
risk assessment, a materiality figure of £7.0m for 
Group financial reporting purposes. Importantly 
much lower levels of materiality are used in the 
audit fieldwork on the individual businesses 
in the Group and these lower figures drive the 
scope and depth of audit work. Small operations 
were subject to statutory audit but were also 
subject to internal audit reviews based on risk 
assessments. Any misstatements at or above 
£0.4m are reported to the Committee. There 
were no significant changes to the audit scope 
during the course of the audit. 
The KPMG audit fee was reviewed in light of the 
audit work required and thence agreed by the 
Committee for recommendation to the Board. 
The Board approved the fee estimate, which 
is flat with 2012 for the Group’s continuing 
operations. 
KPMG provided updates at the half year 
and running up to the year-end, including 
commentaries on significant issues and their 
assessment of prudence in the judgements made. 
Private sessions were held with KPMG without 
management being present covering reporting 
and control issues in the context of the demerged 
Group and the resourcing of the finance team. 
More specific matters discussed included 
the auditor’s assessment of management’s 
identification of business risks and of the action 
taken by management in relation to them. In 
these sessions KPMG confirmed that their work 
had not been constrained in any way and that 
they were able to exercise their appropriate 
professional scepticism and challenge through 
the audit process.

Audit Committee continued
External Auditor Independence
The Committee continued to operate safeguards 
to ensure that the independence and 
objectivity of the external audit was and is not 
compromised, including:
•	 Regular confirmation that the external 
auditor is independent of the Company in its 
own professional judgement
•	 Evaluating all the relationships between the 
external auditor and the Group, including 
those relating to the provision of non-
audit services to determine whether these 
impair, or appear to impair, the auditor’s 
independence.
In accordance with established Group policy, 
the external auditor was, and is, prohibited from 
performing services where it:
•	 May be required to audit its own work 
•	 Would participate in activities that would 
normally be undertaken by management
•	 Is remunerated through a “success fee” 
structure
•	 Acts in an advocacy role for the Group.
Other than these, the policy does not impose 
an automatic prohibition on the external 
auditor undertaking non-audit work that is 
not, or is not perceived to be, in conflict with 
auditor independence, provided it has the 
skill, competence and integrity to carry out the 
work in the best interests of the Group. In the 
coming year, the Committee will consider the 
implications of the draft EU legislation on further 
limiting non-audit work by the external auditor. 
The Group’s existing policies will probably 
have to become more restrictive as a result of 
the changes, but the Committee’s overriding 
principle will continue to be that the quality of 
the external audit should not be compromised in 
any way by any other activity. 
An annual budget for non-audit related fees 
which management is proposing to pay to the 
external auditor, is presented for pre-approval 
to the Committee. Where the non-audit fee is 
likely to be in excess of £50,000, it must be 
pre-approved by the Committee and where 
appropriate, services are tendered prior to the 
awarding of work.
During 2013, the non-audit fees amounted 
to £0.2m, or 12% of the audit fee, primarily 
relating to assurance services related to the 
review of the Company’s interim financial 
statements and taxation advice (see Note 6 
on page 102 of the Financial Statements). This 
showed a large reduction from 2012 where 
KPMG undertook significant work relating to the 
demerger. The Committee also monitored fees 
paid to other accounting firms as part of the 
review so as to determine where there might be 
any current or future conflicts of interest.
External Auditor Reappointment
The Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of the 
external auditor. In relation to the reappointment 
of the external auditor for 2014, the Committee 
considered various factors, but most importantly 
the demonstrated quality of the teams delivering 
the audit, both locally and centrally, and in 
particular the presence and capabilities of the 
lead partner. We also consider the overall quality 
of the firm’s work as reflected in the reports of 
the Audit Quality Review Team of the Financial 
Reporting Council.
The Committee is well aware that KPMG or its 
predecessor firms have had a long-standing 
tenure as the auditor of Vesuvius and its 
predecessors. The services of KPMG were 
retained during the demerger in 2012 as it 
represented the most efficient and cost-effective 
accounting firm to undertake the work and at 
that time the lead audit partner was changed in 
accordance with lead partner rotation regulatory 
requirements. 
Given the tenure, the Committee goes to 
considerable lengths to determine that the audit 
by KPMG is of maintained high quality, with 
excellent staffing, tested by internal reviews by 
management. The Committee is conscious of 
the proposals for audit firm rotation from the 
FRC, the Competition Commission and the EU 
Commission. Our advice is that the proposed EU 
legislation (though not yet finally formulated) 
will prevail, be mandatory and will come into 
force in the coming year. This will require audit 
firm rotation after a maximum of ten years with 
a possibility of an extension of a further ten 
years if a competitive tender has taken place 
at the ten year point, though these periods 
could be shorter if determined by enabling 
national legislation. Importantly there are 
proposed transitional arrangements which, as 
currently formulated, would require the Group to 
undertake a competitive tender within six years 
of the proposed EU legislation coming into force. 
The Committee and the Board believe the 
Group is receiving a very good quality of audit 
service from KPMG. Consequently, the Board 
intends that the Group will have a competitive 
tender process at the time of the next partner 
rotation in 2016. Meanwhile, demanding audit 
performance requirements will continue to be 
applied to KPMG. By 2016 the requirements 
arising out of what is currently still proposed 
legislation will be much clearer. As such, the 
Committee has recommended, and the Board 
has agreed, that, subject to shareholder 
approval, KPMG will be reappointed at the 2014 
AGM. Should any shareholder wish to discuss 
this approach and timing with me then I should 
be happy to do so.
Committee Evaluation
The Committee’s activities formed part of the 
evaluation of Board effectiveness performed in 
the year. Details of this approach are given on  
page 58.

The nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is made up of any 
three of the Non-executive Directors. During the 
year I continued as Chairman of the Committee, 
though I would not act as Chairman when the 
Committee is considering the appointment of 
my successor. In this case, the Chairman would 
be an appropriate Non-executive Director.  In 
addition to the Directors named above, Jan 
Oosterveld and John Sussens were also members 
of the Committee until their retirement from the 
Board at the AGM in June 2013. The Company 
Secretary is Secretary to the Committee. 
Members’ biographies are set out on pages 50 
and 51. 
Meetings
The Committee meets as and when required, 
which it did twice during 2013. Both meetings 
were convened with all Non-executive Directors 
present together with the Chief Executive, who 
was invited to attend both meetings. I reported 
the outcome of our meetings to the Board. 
Formal meetings are held to consider standing 
items of business. However, particularly when a 
recruitment exercise is taking place, there is also 
a significant level of ad hoc discussion between 
members of the Committee. 
The Committee operates under formal terms of 
reference which were reviewed and updated 
during the year and approved by the Board. The 
terms of reference are available on the Group’s 
website (www.vesuvius.com). 
The Committee and its members are also 
empowered to obtain outside legal or other 
independent professional advice (at the cost 
of the Company) in relation to its deliberations 
(which rights were not exercised during the year) 
and to secure the attendance at its meetings 
of any employee or other parties it considers 
necessary. 
Role and Responsibilities 
The Nomination Committee’s foremost priorities 
are to ensure that the Company has the best 
possible leadership and maintains a clear plan 
for both Executive and Non-executive Director 
succession. Its prime focus is therefore on the 
strength of the Board, for which appointments 
are made on merit, against objective criteria, 
selecting the best candidate for the post. The 
Nomination Committee advises the Board on the 
appointments, retirements and resignations from 
the Board and its Committees. 
Activity in 2013
During the year, the Committee considered 
the appointment of a new Senior Independent 
Director to replace John Sussens who retired 
from the Board at the 2013 AGM. The 
Committee recommended to the Board that 
an external candidate was not required to fill 
this position as Jeff Hewitt was an outstanding 
candidate for the role, given his wide experience 
of Vesuvius and corporate governance. 
During the year, as part of the annual corporate 
governance review, the Committee also reviewed 
the independence of the Board and the potential 
lengths of tenure of each of the independent 
Non-executive Directors.  
The majority of the Board was appointed only 
recently. However, the Committee continues 
regularly to re-examine succession and the 
Board’s balance of skills, experience and 
diversity. Succession planning, led by the 
Nomination Committee, forms an integral part of 
the Board’s annual strategy review.
Board Composition
All Directors have served at a very senior level 
in global organisations, have international 
experience across a variety of industries, and 
most have spent a considerable amount of 
time resident outside the UK. At present, two of 
the seven Directors are women, and three are 
non-British citizens. The Nomination Committee 
continues to believe that this diversity underpins 
the successful operation of an effective Board. 
It should be noted that in Lord Davies’ original 
recommendation on Women on Boards, he stated 
that listed companies in the FTSE 100 should aim 
for a minimum of 25% female board member 
representation by 2015. He also recommended 
that FTSE 350 companies should be setting their 
own, challenging targets and expected that, in 
time, many would achieve a much higher figure 
than this minimum. We are pleased to report that 
the Vesuvius Board has achieved this target.
During the year the Committee appointed a new Senior Independent 
Director and, in line with its primary responsibility, focused on Board 
succession planning — ensuring that the Board is made up of individuals 
with the necessary skills, diversity and experience to lead the Company

Nomination Committee continued
Process for Board Appointments
When considering Board appointments, the 
Nomination Committee draws up a specification 
for the Director, taking into consideration the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience of 
its existing members, the diversity of the Board, 
the independence of continuing Board members 
and the ongoing requirements and anticipated 
strategic developments of the Group. The search 
process is then able to focus on appointing a 
candidate with a balance of skills that enhance 
the Board’s diversity. For example, whilst 
most of the work for the appointment of Jane 
Hinkley and Nelda Connors was undertaken in 
2012, their appointments required global Chief 
Executive/CFO experience, an understanding 
of executive compensation and knowledge of, 
and experience in, project management, lean 
manufacturing and growing a business in Asia. 
When considering Board appointments, the 
Committee utilises the services of search firms 
to identify appropriate candidates, ensuring 
that the search firm appointed does not have 
any other connection with the Company. In 
addition, the Committee will only use those 
firms that have adopted the Voluntary Code of 
Conduct addressing gender diversity and best 
practice in search assignments. A ‘long list’ 
of potential appointees will then be reviewed 
followed by the shortlisting of candidates for 
interview based upon the objective criteria 
identified at inception. Care is taken to ensure 
that all proposed appointees have sufficient 
time available to devote to the role and do not 
have any conflicts of interest. The Committee 
then recommends a preferred candidate and 
the Directors not on the Committee meet the 
candidate. Following this the Committee would 
make a formal recommendation to the Board on 
the appointment. The preferred candidate would 
also be supported in undertaking their own due 
diligence on the Company and with its advisers. 
Senior Management Succession
During the year, each of the Vesuvius Business 
Units and head office functions submitted 
their succession plans in respect of senior 
executives to the Board for review. The Board 
also actively seeks to meet with key executives 
throughout the Group in order to gain a greater 
understanding of the breadth and depth of 
management talent. During 2014 this process 
will be augmented to include a series of 
presentations to the board by Business Unit and 
functional Presidents and the senior managers 
that work in their teams. In this way members 
of the Board and the Committee will be able to 
adopt a more informed approach to executive 
succession planning across the Group.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to update you on the Remuneration Committee’s activities in Vesuvius’ first full year as an independent public company.
I took over as Chair of the Committee from John Sussens, and I am grateful to him and Jan Oosterveld (who both left the Committee at the 2013 AGM), for 
their expertise and judgement. Nelda Connors joined the Committee on 1 March 2013.  The Committee has a broad, diverse and balanced set of skills to 
meet its ongoing requirements. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides further detail about the work of the Committee in 2013. During the year we laid the groundwork for Vesuvius’ 
remuneration arrangements as a stand-alone company, whilst maintaining overall continuity with the previous executive remuneration policy. As a result, 
the remuneration policy (detailed later) is substantially similar to that adopted by the Committee at the demerger, with the exception of the elements 
highlighted below.
During the year, the key elements that the Committee debated were:
•	 Changing the measurement of the Vesuvius Share Plan EPS growth to compare to nominal global Gross Domestic Product growth, rather than an 
absolute target, thus reflecting the Company’s strategy and growth ambition (see page 70 of the Policy and page 71 for further detail);
•	 Agreeing that our Group Executive Committee, who are central to delivering the ongoing success of the Company, are included in the Vesuvius Share 
Plan; 
•	 The payment of incentive awards in shares rather than cash to senior managers in the Medium Term Plan (“MTP”);
•	 The agreement of financial targets for the 2014 annual incentive (though we will not disclose targets set until after the relevant performance period 
because of commercial sensitivities); and
•	 The adoption of a longer-term horizon (of 2-3 years) for base salary increases for senior executives and Executive Directors to evaluate and reward 
performance over the medium term.
Clearly, it must be recognised that, when base salary rises are awarded under the new salary approach, they may be substantially higher than if made on an 
annual basis. In line with this new approach, the Executive Directors requested that no increase in salary be awarded to them for 2014.
As described elsewhere in the Strategic Report, and in the financial highlights on page 05, the Company has enjoyed a successful year. The annual incentive 
awards based upon Group Headline Earnings per share of 125% and 100% of base salary for the Chief Executive and CFO, respectively, reflect this solid 
trading performance. In 2012 no performance-related annual incentives were paid. The long term incentive awards made in 2011 under the Cookson LTIP 
matured at the end of 2013. Under this plan, performance is measured equally in TSR relative to the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts) and headline 
EPS over a three year period. Relative TSR performance was between median and upper Quintile, resulting in a performance share award of 28.4% (out of 
a maximum 50%) and matching share awards of 1:0.621. However, the EPS target for the three year period was not met and therefore none of the element 
of the award related to EPS performance vested.  In confirming the vesting of the relative TSR performance portion of the award, noted above, we reviewed 
the underlying performance of the Company to satisfy ourselves that the numerical outcome was justified. 
The previous Committee Chairman and I talked with major shareholders to address any questions they had arising from the change of leadership, and as 
noted above, the proposed change of the Vesuvius Share Plan EPS growth measure. I remain keen to hear shareholder views on remuneration matters and 
look forward to a continued dialogue. 
The remuneration policy we propose is not materially different to the remuneration approach applied to Executive Directors in 2013.
Finally, I am delighted to present our first Remuneration Policy to our shareholders for a binding vote,  and our Annual Report on Remuneration, as before, 
for an advisory shareholder vote. The Committee recommends both elements to you for approval. We look forward to another year of support from our investors.
Yours sincerely

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
As reported on last year, the overarching philosophy for remuneration within Vesuvius is to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the calibre necessary 
to successfully implement our business strategy. In particular, we ensure that incentives are appropriate to encourage enhanced performance and to avoid 
underperformance being rewarded. In reviewing and setting Vesuvius’ remuneration policy, the Committee seeks to balance the interests of our employees 
and those of our long-term shareholders, to support Company strategy and foster a high performance culture, where a meaningful portion of remuneration 
is performance linked and subject to clawback.
In setting our policy for Executive Directors and senior managers the Committee seeks to emphasise pay for performance and to account for the broad 
international scale and nature of the Company’s operations. We also consider the approach taken to the pay and employment conditions of other Company 
employees, together with UK governance requirements and developments in governance practice issued by leading shareholders and shareholder advisory 
bodies.
The Committee reviews information on the remuneration of comparable roles at similar companies to provide a point of reference for determining 
remuneration levels. Given that there is not a clear comparator group of companies for Vesuvius, this is judged in the context of other FTSE 250 companies 
and other relevant international sector-specific companies to reach a rounded judgement and deliver remuneration that is competitive.
Although Vesuvius is in its early stages as an independent company, the Committee is satisfied that the flexibility within the policy, and the ability to 
exercise discretion and judgement, will allow the Committee to ensure that an appropriate balance between the interests of employees and shareholders is 
maintained. 
A separate resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM to approve the Remuneration Policy which, if approved, will take effect from the date of the 
AGM on 15 May 2014.
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors
Alignment/Purpose Operation Opportunity Performance
Base salary
Helps to recruit and retain 
key employees.
Reflects the individual’s 
experience, role and 
contribution within the 
Company.
The individual’s performance is reviewed 
annually,  with changes to base salary 
appraised over a two to three year 
period. Any change will be effective from 
1 January in the year of the increase.
Base salary is positioned to be market 
competitive when considered against 
relevant international and FTSE 250 
companies (excluding Investment Trusts).
Paid in cash, subject to local tax and 
social security regulations.
In considering any increase in base 
salary, the Committee will consider  
(1) the role and value of the individual, 
(2) changes in job scope or responsibility, 
(3) progression in the role (e.g. for a new 
appointee), (4) a significant increase in 
the scale of role and/or size, value or 
complexity of the Group, (5) the need to 
maintain market competitiveness, and 
(6) increases paid to the wider global 
employee population in the Company’s 
most significant locations. 
In line with the 2-3 year period for base 
salary appraisal, individual increases 
when paid are likely to be in excess 
of those for the wider population of 
employees for that year.
Any increase will take into account the 
individual’s performance, contribution 
and increasing experience.

Other benefits
Provides normal market 
practice benefits.
A range of standard benefits including, 
but not limited to: car allowance, private 
medical care (including spouse and 
dependent children), life assurance, 
disability, health insurance together with 
relocation allowance and expatriate 
benefits.
The Committee retains the discretion to 
adjust the value of benefits where:
 (1) there is a significant change in the 
individual’s circumstances, (2) there is 
an increase in existing cost beyond the 
Company’s control, (3) there is a change 
in benefit provider(s), or (4) there is a 
change in an individual’s location; and to 
amend the type of benefits to reflect the 
above  and market practice.
Standard benefits remain a small 
percentage of total remuneration.
None.
Pension
Helps to recruit and retain 
key employees.
Ensures income in  
retirement.
An allowance is given as a percentage 
of base salary. This may be used 
to participate in Vesuvius’ pension 
arrangements, invested in own pension 
arrangements or taken as a cash 
supplement (or any combination of the 
above options).
30% of base salary. None.
Annual Incentive
Incentivises Executive 
Directors to achieve key 
short term financial, and 
strategic, targets of the 
Group.
Entire bonus amount payable in cash 
with no deferral.
The Committee has the discretion to 
determine that actual incentive  
payments should be lower than levels 
calculated by reference to achievement 
against targets if it considers this to be 
appropriate.
Subject to clawback.
Below threshold: 0%.
On-Target: 62.5% of base salary for the 
Chief Executive and 50% of base salary 
for other Executive Directors.
Maximum: 125% of base salary for the 
Chief Executive and 100% of base salary 
for other Executive Directors.
Payments made between threshold and 
on-target and between on-target and 
maximum are prorated. 
Annual Incentive is measured on targets 
set at the beginning of each year. 
Currently, it is based on Group Headline 
Earnings Per Share which accounts for 
100% of the performance measure, with 
an adjustment based on the Group’s 
working capital performance. The effect 
of this is to reduce payments by 10% if 
specified working capital targets are not 
met. The adjuster also increases payout 
by 10% if targets are exceeded, but not 
above the plan maximum. Going forward 
the plan may include other financial 
or non-financial measures comprising 
KPIs, corporate objectives and personal 
performance.
The Committee establishes threshold 
and maximum performance targets for 
each financial year, set by reference to 
the Group budget and other objectives 
for that year.
Actual performance targets will be 
disclosed after the performance period 
has ended. They are not disclosed in this 
policy due to their commercial sensitivity.

performance period.
Awards may be granted as:
•	 Performance share awards;
•	 Deferred share bonus awards;
•	 Restricted share awards, and

recruitment policy.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive 
an annual award with a face value of up 
to 200% of base salary in performance 
share awards.
Vesting of 50% of performance share 
awards is subject to the Company’s

performance;
•	 12.5% of the total award vesting at 
median performance;

Committee decides on the appropriate 
EPS growth targets each year, taking into 
account the Group’s prospects and the 
broader global economic environment.
The Company reserves the right only to 
disclose EPS performance targets after 
the performance period has ended due 
to their commercial sensitivity.
Prior to any vesting, the Remuneration 
Committee also reviews the underlying 
financial performance of the Company 
over the performance period to justify 
the vesting.

Selection of Performance measures 
Measures for the Annual Incentive are selected to reflect key strategic aims and the need for a rigorous focus on working capital management. Each year 
the Committee will agree challenging targets to ensure that underperformance is not rewarded.
For the Vesuvius Share Plan, at the demerger, Vesuvius stated that the performance measures would be similar to those for the Cookson LTIP , to focus 
Executive Directors on the execution of long-term strategy and also align their rewards with value created for shareholders. On this basis, the performance 
conditions for the Vesuvius performance share awards are based half on TSR performance and half on EPS performance. The comparator for the TSR 
performance condition will be reviewed annually to ensure its continuing relevance for the Group. In 2014 the Committee agreed the continuation of 
comparison to the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts). In respect of the EPS measure, the Committee wished to align the target with the Company’s 
ambitions to grow ahead of end markets. As an international company, a global metric was deemed important by the Committee, and in 2013 an EPS 
target, based upon outperforming global Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) growth was adopted. This has been carried through to 2014. Within the policy 
period, the Committee will continually review the performance conditions used, including EPS and other financial measures, used to ensure that awards are 
made on the basis of challenging targets that clearly support the achievement of the Group’s strategic aims.  
Illustration of the Application of the Remuneration Policy for 2014
The charts below show the total remuneration for Executive Directors for minimum, on-target and maximum performance. The fixed elements of 
remuneration comprise base salary, pension and other benefits, using 2014 salary data. The assumptions on which they are calculated are as follows: 
Minimum: Fixed remuneration only
On-Target: Fixed remuneration plus on-target Annual Incentive and threshold vesting (i.e. median performance for TSR and threshold for EPS) for 
performance share awards (made at 200% of base salary) under the Vesuvius Share Plan
Maximum: Fixed remuneration plus maximum Annual Incentive and 100% vesting for performance share awards (made at 200% of base salary) under the

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Recruitment Policy
On appointment or promotion of a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically use the above policy to determine ongoing remuneration. However, 
the Committee retains the discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet specific circumstances.
Base salary levels will generally be set in accordance with the policy taking into account the experience and calibre of the appointee. If it is appropriate 
to appoint an individual on a base salary initially below what is adjudged to be market positioning, contingent on individual performance, the Committee 
retains the discretion to realign base salary over the one to three years following appointment, which may result in a higher rate of annualised increase than 
might otherwise be awarded under the policy. If the Committee intends to rely on this discretion, it will be noted in the first Directors’ Remuneration Report 
following an individual’s appointment. Other than in exceptional circumstances, other elements of annual remuneration will, typically, be set in line with this 
Policy. The Committee retains the discretion to make the following exceptions:
•	 In the event that an internal appointment is made, the Committee may continue with existing remuneration provisions where appropriate;
•	 If necessary and appropriate to secure an appointment from an international pool of candidates, the Committee may make additional payments linked 
to relocation, above those outlined in the Policy Table and would authorise the payment of a relocation allowance and repatriation, as well as other 
associated international mobility terms. Such benefits would be set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate for the role and the individual’s 
circumstances; and
•	 In order to provide an immediate interest in the Company’s performance, the Committee may grant, on recruitment, an award of Performance Shares 
(with a market value of up to 200% of salary) under the Vesuvius Share Plan and/or an individual award agreement (under Listing Rule 9.4.2(2)) on 
similar terms. Performance conditions for any such award will be set in line with the policy and the Committee will determine the vesting period that will 
apply to such awards at the time of award, taking into account the strategy and business circumstances of Vesuvius.
Service contracts will be entered into on terms similar to those for the existing Executive Directors, summarised in the service contract section below.
In addition to the annual remuneration elements noted above, the Committee may consider buying out incentive awards that an individual forfeits in 
accepting an appointment with Vesuvius. The Committee will have the authority to rely on Listing Rule 9.4.2 (2) or to apply the existing limits within the 
Vesuvius Share Plan to make Restricted Share awards on recruitment. In making any such awards, the Committee will review the terms of any forfeited 
awards, including, but not limited to, vesting periods,  the expected value of such awards on vesting and the likelihood of the performance targets 
applicable to such awards being met, while retaining the discretion to make any buy out award the Committee determines is necessary and appropriate. The 
Committee may also require the appointee to purchase shares in Vesuvius to a pre-agreed level prior to vesting of any such awards. The value of any buy 
out award will be capped, to ensure its maximum value is no higher than the value of the awards that the individual forfeited on joining Vesuvius. Any such 
awards will be subject to clawback.
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-executive Director, appointment terms will be consistent with those currently adopted. Variable 
pay will not be considered. With respect to Non-executive Directors, fees will be consistent with the policy at the time of appointment. 
Exit Payment Policy
Vesuvius has the option to make a payment in lieu of part or all of the required notice period for Executive Directors. Any such payment in lieu will consist of 
the base salary, pension contributions and value of benefits to which the Director would have been entitled for the duration of the remaining notice period, 
net of statutory deductions in each case. Half of any payments in lieu of notice would be made in a lump sum, the remainder in equal monthly instalments 
commencing in the month in which the midpoint of their forgone notice period falls (and are reduced or extinguished by salary from any role undertaken 
by the departing executive in this time). Executive Directors are subject to certain non-compete covenants for a period of nine months, and non-solicitation 
covenants for a period of 12 months, following the termination of their employment. Their service agreements are governed by English law.
Neither of the Executive Director’s contracts contains any change of control provisions and they both contain a duty to mitigate should the Director find an 
alternative paid occupation in any period during which the Company must otherwise pay compensation on early termination. 
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and Vesuvius Share Plan are typically treated in different leaver scenarios and on a 
change of control. Whilst the Committee retains overall discretion on determining ‘good leaver’ status, it typically defines a ‘good leaver’ in circumstances 
such as retirement with agreement of the Company, ill health, disability, death, redundancy, or part of the business in which the individual is employed or 
engaged ceasing to be part of the Group. Final treatment is subject to the Committee’s discretion.

NOTE
1. In certain circumstances, the Committee may determine that unvested awards under the Vesuvius Share Plan will not vest on a change of control but will instead be replaced by an equivalent grant 
of a new award, as determined by the Committee, in the new company. 
If employment is terminated by the Company, the Committee retains discretion to settle amounts reasonably due to the Executive Director, for example 
to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a 
settlement agreement (as provided for below) and where the individual must seek independent legal advice.  The Company would pay any amounts to 
which the departing Director was legally entitled. In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing 
Executive Directors including (but not limited to) settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements.  This would only be used 
where the Committee believed it was in the best interests of the Company to do so.
Service contracts
The Committee will periodically review the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure these reflect best practice. Service contracts currrently 
operate on a rolling basis and are limited to a 12 month notice period.
François Wanecq is employed as Chief Executive of Vesuvius pursuant to the terms of a service agreement made with Cookson Group plc dated 17 October 
2012. Chris O’Shea is employed as Chief Financial Officer pursuant to the terms of a service agreement with Cookson Group plc dated 10 September 2012. 
Both service agreements were assigned to Vesuvius upon completion of the Demerger on 19 December 2012. Each Executive Director’s appointment is 
terminable by Vesuvius on not less than 12 months’ written notice, and by each Executive Director on not less than six months’ written notice.
Considerations of conditions elsewhere in the group in developing policy
The Company does not consult directly with employees on Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements. However, the Remuneration Committee will 
take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, particularly when 
determining base salary increases. The Remuneration Committee will also obtain information on the remuneration paid for comparable roles at other 
relevant companies to provide a point of reference for determining remuneration policy.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy set out at the beginning of this report – which also 
underpins remuneration for the wider Group. Remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors draw on the same elements as those for other employees 
– base salary, fixed benefits, and retirement benefits – with performance-related pay extending down into the management cadres and beyond. However, 
given that remuneration structures for other employees need to reflect both seniority and local market practice, they differ from the policy for Executive 
Directors. In particular, Executive Directors receive a higher proportion of their remuneration in performance-related pay and share-based payments and 
individual percentages of fixed versus variable remuneration and participation in share-based structures decline with seniority. 
The process for delivering salary increases on a 2-3 year cycle for Executive Directors is also applied to members of the Group Executive Committee and their 
direct managerial reports. While all employees receive an annual performance appraisal, other employees continue to receive salary reviews on an annual 
basis.
As with Executive Directors, middle and senior managers participate in the Annual Incentive Plan. For operational employees, any potential award is based 
upon achieving three measures relating to Group performance, business unit performance, and individual achievement of personal objectives. For functional 
employees, the award is predominantly based on Group performance, with the remainder awarded against achievement of personal objectives. The awards 
for middle and senior managers are also adjusted to reflect the level of performance by the business with regard to its working capital management.
For certain senior and middle managers awards are made under the Vesuvius Medium Term Plan (“MTP”). Awards under the MTP are based on the same 
measures and targets as the Annual Incentive Plan for those managers. Middle managers participate in the MTP at varying percentage levels, with awards 
being made in cash. Senior managers have their MTP awards made over Vesuvius shares. In each case, awards are granted following the end of the relevant 
financial year. The MTP share awards vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continuing employment. From 2014 onwards members 
of the Group Executive Committee (who in 2013 were included in the above MTP in shares) will instead participate in the Vesuvius Share Plan and receive 
awards of Performance Shares, which will vest in accordance with the same measures and targets as those for Executive Directors. Levels of awards will 
differ from those of Executive Directors.
Consideration of shareholder views
Vesuvius is committed to open and transparent dialogue with its shareholders on remuneration as well as other governance matters. As Chair of the 
Committee, Jane Hinkley welcomes shareholder engagement and is available for any discussions investors wish to have on remuneration matters. During 
2013, Jane Hinkley undertook several meetings with investors for the discussion of remuneration matters, including changes to the EPS measure for the 
Vesuvius Share Plan and on the change of Remuneration Committee Chair. The feedback was useful and was considered by the Committee. In setting our 
remuneration policy, we have made no material changes to the way in which the policy has functioned for Executive Directors in 2013 and hence we have 
not undertaken specific shareholder consultation on the policy contained in this document.
Shareholding Policy (Audited)
The Remuneration Committee encourages Executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to at least one times 
base salary. To this end, Executive Directors will normally be expected to retain at least 50% (measured as the value after tax) of any Performance Share 
Awards vesting under the Vesuvius Share Plan, until this criterion has been met. New Executive Directors will be allowed four years in which to acquire this 
shareholding.
As at 31 December 2013, using the Company’s share price at 31 December 2013 of 510p, the Executive Directors’ shareholdings against this guideline 
were as follows:
Director
Actual share ownership as a percentage
of salary at 31 December 2013
Policy share ownership as a
percentage of salary Policy met?
François Wanecq 1,122% 100% Yes
Chris O’Shea 88% 100% Yes (in the build-up period)
Clawback Arrangements
The Executive Directors are subject to clawback arrangements. In the event that a misstatement is identified in the Company’s consolidated financial 
statements which requires the restatement of a prior year’s accounts in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards or any applicable law, then such portion as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate of any variable executive remuneration – 
being all Annual Incentive and Performance Share awards made under the Vesuvius Share Plan – resulting from a measure of financial performance affected 
by the misstatement will be subject to clawback provisions.  The misstatement must be identified and notified to the individual in writing within three years 
after the end of the relevant performance period.

External Appointments
Whilst neither of the Executive Directors serves as a Non-executive Director of any other quoted company, subject always to consent being granted by 
the Company for them to take up such an appointment, were they to so serve, the Company would allow them to retain any fees they received for the 
performance of their duties.
Policy for non-executive Directors
The Company seeks to appoint Non-executive Directors who have relevant professional knowledge, and have gained experience in a relevant industry and 
geographical sectors, to support diversity of expertise at the Board and match the wide geographic spread of the Company’s activities.
Non-executive Directors attend Board, Committee and other meetings, held mainly in the UK, together with an annual strategy review to debate the 
Company’s strategic direction. All Non-executive Directors are expected to familiarise themselves with the scale and scope of the Company’s business and to 
maintain their specific technical skills and knowledge.
The Board sets the level of fees paid to the Non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director and the practice of other 
companies of a similar size and international complexity. The Non-executive Directors do not participate in Board discussions on their own remuneration. No 
variable remuneration is available to Non-executive Directors. Non-executive Directors receive reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in attending 
the Board, Committee and other ad hoc meetings.

Terms of Service
The terms of service of the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are contained in letters of appointment. Each Non-executive Director is appointed 
subject to their election at the Company’s first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and re-election at subsequent Annual General 
Meetings. None of the Non-executive Directors is entitled to receive compensation for loss of office at any time. During the first year of his appointment the 
Chairman is entitled to 12 months’ notice from the Company; thereafter, he is entitled to six months’ notice from the Company. All Non-executive Directors 
are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. The current policy is for Non-executive 
Directors to serve on the Board for a maximum of nine years, with review at the end of the three and six years, subject always to mutual agreement and 
annual performance evaluation. The Board retains discretion to extend the tenure of Non-executive Directors beyond this time, subject to the requirements 
of Board balance and independence being satisfied.

The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) comprises all independent Non-executive Directors of the Company, and as such complies with the 
obligations of the UK Corporate Governance Code for composition of Remuneration Committees. Each of the members brings a broad experience of 
international businesses and an understanding of their challenges to the work of the Committee. I was appointed to the Committee on 3 December 2012 
and became its Chair following the AGM held in June 2013. Nelda Connors joined the Committee on her appointment on 1 March 2013. Jeff Hewitt 
brings his significant experience of Vesuvius to the Committee, and both Nelda and I add extensive international business experience to the Committee’s 
deliberations. John Sussens and Jan Oostervelt retired from the Committee on their retirement as Directors of the Company at the AGM held on 4 June 
2013. The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee. Members’ biographies are on page 51.
Meetings
The Committee met seven times during the year with full attendance, other than in respect of one meeting where Nelda Connors was prevented from 
attending due to adverse weather conditions in the US disrupting her travel. The Group Chairman, Chief Executive, CFO and Group VP HR were invited to 
each meeting, together with Christer Gardell, our non-independent Non-executive Director, though none of them participated in discussions regarding their 
own remuneration. This attendance supported the work of the Committee, giving critical insight into the operational demands of the business and their 
application to the overall strategy of remuneration within the Group. I reported the outcome of our meetings to the Board.
The Committee operates under formal terms of reference which were reviewed and updated during the year and approved by the Board. The terms of 
reference are available on the Group website (www.vesuvius.com). The Committee and its members are also empowered to obtain outside legal or other 
independent professional advice (at the cost of the Company) in relation to its deliberations (powers which were not exercised during the year) and to 
secure the attendance at its meetings of any employee or other parties should it be considered necessary.
Role and Responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for:
•	 Setting the appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary; 
•	 Recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of management below Board level 
and their direct reports; and
•	 Overseeing the operation of any Executive share incentive plan.
A copy of the Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference is available on the Group’s website (www.vesuvius.com).
Key activities in 2013
During the year, the overall objectives for the Committee were to set the tone for remuneration in Vesuvius’ first year as an independent public company. 
In addition to the usual routine Committee matters, the Committee discussed and agreed changes in the following material key matters:
•	 Receiving the proposed vesting schedules and reviewing the appropriateness of the out-turn of share-based awards against overall financial 
performance to ensure that awards made under the 2010 LTIP and Deferred Share Bonus Plan were in line with financial performance; 
•	 Reviewing, debating and approving financial performance criteria for Annual Incentive (cash bonus) awards and changes to the performance metrics for 
EPS under the Vesuvius Share Plan to compare with nominal global Gross Domestic Product growth rather than an absolute target;
•	 Aligning share-based incentive awards for members of the Group Executive Committee to those for Executive Directors, by including them in the 
Vesuvius Share Plan;
•	 Approving the payment of incentive awards in shares rather than cash to senior managers in the MTP; and
•	 Adopting longer-term horizons (of 2-3 years) for base salary increases for Executive Directors and senior managers.

Regulatory Compliance
The Remuneration Policy set out on pages 68 to 75 of this report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and The Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. It also meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authorities 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out how the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code are applied by the Company in relation to matters of remuneration. We are happy to confirm that the Company has complied with these governance 
rules in the year under review. 
Share Usage
Under the rules of the Vesuvius Share Plan, as approved by shareholders on 26 November 2012, the Company has the discretion to satisfy awards either by the 
transfer of existing shares or by the allotment of newly issued shares, Treasury shares or other shares. Awards made to senior managers by the Company over 
shares pursuant to the Medium Term Plan must be satisfied out of shares held for this purpose by the Company’s employee share ownership trust (“ESOT”). The 
decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Board, which considers the most prudent and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the Company. 
At 31 December 2013 the Company held 7,271,174 ordinary shares in Treasury. As at 31 December 2013, 1,025,484 Vesuvius shares were held in the 
ESOT. The Trustee of the ESOT purchases shares in the open market or can subscribe for newly issued shares as required, to meet obligations for the 
provision of shares to satisfy options and awards that vest.
The Vesuvius Share Plan complies with the current ABI guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% 
over a ten year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten year period on discretionary schemes.

NOTES
1. Base salary (or fees, as appropriate) earned during the financial year ended 31 December 2013.
2. Benefits comprise car allowance, private medical care, life assurance, disability and health insurance (including a one-off relocation allowance for François Wanecq of £361,871).
3. Executive Directors receive a pension allowance of 30% of base salary. 
4. The sum of basic salary, benefits and pension. 
5. The Annual Incentive cash bonus payments to be made to the Executive Directors for their performance in the year under review, pay out at the maximum amount, being 125% of base salary for 
the Chief Executive and 100% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer. This reflected the performance of the Company in the year under review against the target set for the Annual Incentive. 
In 2013 the maximum financial performance target was Group Headline Earnings per share of 30.0p.  Group Headline Earnings per share for the financial year ended 31 December 2013 was 
31.9p, thus justifying the maximum incentive payment.
6. The Cookson Group 2011 LTIP nil-cost awards consisted of both a Performance Share award and a Matching Share Award. The vesting of the award is based upon 50% relative TSR performance 
and 50% on Headline EPS performance. The TSR performance was based upon Cookson’s TSR from 1 January 2011 to 18 December 2012 to which was added to the Vesuvius TSR from 19 
December 2012 to 31 December 2013 for a combined figure, being 84.3% (between Median and Upper Quintile), which allows vesting of 28.4% of the Performance Share Award and 1:0.621 
for the Matching Share Award. Following the demerger, the 2013 EPS targets, as previously reported, were set at 48.6p at threshold. Headline EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 
31.9p. Hence there is no vesting of either the Performance Share Award or the Matching Share Award for EPS performance (and all awards lapse). The Cookson Group LTIP 2011 award (whose 
performance period ended 31 December 2013) for François Wanecq will vest on 1 April 2014. Following the above performance, 42,105 Performance shares and 91,752 Matching Shares will vest, 
(and 106,155  Performance Shares and 240,685 Matching Shares will lapse) which, at an average Vesuvius share price (from 1 October 2013 to 31 December 2013) of 478p, provides a total gain 
of £639,836. Overall, of the total shares awarded, 27.8% will vest (being 133,857 shares) with the balance lapsing (being 346,840 shares). In addition, a further award of shares (15,402 shares, 
with a market value (at an average market price of 478p) of £73,621) will be made to cover dividends accrued between the date of grant and the date of vesting in accordance with the rules of the 
Plan. Consequently, in total François Wanecq will receive 149,259 shares under entitlements from the 2011 LTIP to the value of £713,457.
7. The Cookson Group 2010 LTIP nil cost award for François Wanecq vested on 8 April 2013 and 104,272 Vesuvius shares vested at a share price of 330p, a gain of £344,097. The performance period 
was 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 and overall, 67.2% of the shares vested with the balance lapsing. In addition, the Remuneration Committee also awarded a further 6,392 shares to 
the value of the dividends paid on the shares between grant date and the date of vesting, with a further market value of £21,094.  As part of the same Cookson Group 2010 LTIP award and, in 
accordance with the demerger agreement, 110,101 shares in Alent plc also vested on 8 April 2013 with a gain of £363,333 at a market price of 362p.
8. See notes 1 and 2 of the Restricted Share Award on page 80 for more details.
9. The sum of annual bonus and the value of long-term incentives. 
10. The sum of basic salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus and long-term incentives where the performance period ended during the financial year.

Pension Arrangements – Audited
In accordance with their service agreements, Messrs Wanecq and O’Shea are entitled to a pension allowance of 30% of base salary, which they can use

Outstanding Longer-term Pay — Audited
Awards were made to the Executive Directors under the Vesuvius Share Plan on 22 April 2013. The proportion of shares that will vest is based on the 
Company’s performance against specified performance conditions. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded is based upon the Company’s three-year TSR 
performance relative to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts), and 50% on Headline EPS growth, as compared 
with the compound annual growth in Nominal Global Gross Domestic Product over a three-year period. The two measures operate independently. The

NOTES
1. The Cookson Group 2011 LTIP nil-cost awards consisted of both a Performance Share award and a Matching Share Award. See note 6 on page 78 of this report for full details.
2. In 2012 François Wanecq received a potential maximum allocation of Performance Shares worth one times his base salary, being 79,619  Cookson Group plc shares (which at the demerger were 
rolled over into Vesuvius shares at a rate of 1 to 1.88492, giving a Performance Share Award over 150,075 Vesuvius shares). Under the Matching Share award element of the LTIP he used his 
entire 2011 Annual Incentive payment to purchase 7,856 Cookson Group plc shares, and received a maximum allocation of 32,475 Matching Shares based on this amount  which had a maximum 
potential value on the date of award of c.40% of his base salary. The allocations were made to François Wanecq on 5 April 2012 and were calculated based upon the closing mid-market price 
of Cookson Group plc’s shares on the day before the awards were made. Cookson Group plc’s mid-market closing price on 4 April 2012 was 689.5p. At the demerger, the awards over 32,475  
Cookson Group plc shares made to François Wanecq, were rolled over into Vesuvius plc shares at a rate of 1 to 1.88492, giving a Matching Share Award over 61,212 Vesuvius shares.
Restricted Share Award

NOTES
1. On his appointment, Chris O’Shea was granted a restricted share award with a face value of 100% of base salary. Half of the award vested on the first anniversary of his date of joining and the 
remainder will vest on the second anniversary, subject to him remaining employed by the Company and not under notice of termination. No other performance conditions apply to this award.
2. Of the 54,402 shares that vested, 25,621 were sold for tax and social security payments, 28,781 were retained, as required under the Shareholding Policy (see above). In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee also awarded a further 1,685 shares to the value of the dividends paid on the shares between his date of joining and the date of vesting (of which 891 were retained 
after tax and social security payments). The second and final tranche of Restricted Shares (54,403 ordinary shares, excluding dividends) will vest on 11 October 2014, (assuming continued 
employment and not being under notice of termination).
Payments to Past Directors – Audited
There were no payments made to a past Director during the year ended 31 December 2013.
Loss of Office Payments – Audited 
During the year to 31 December 2013, no payments were made to any Director for loss of office.

Annual Changes in Chief Executive pay vs. Employee Pay
The table below shows the percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive - comprising salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus - and 
comparable data of UK salaried employees. The UK salaried employee workforce was chosen as a fair representation of a suitable comparator group as 
François Wanecq, the Chief Executive, is based in the UK (albeit with a global role and responsibilities) and levels of pay vary widely across the Group 
depending on geography and local market conditions.

NOTES
1. The figure used for comparison excludes the sum of £361,871 relating to one-off relocation expenses (2012: £13,631) paid during 2013 for François Wanecq.
2.  In 2012, based on Group performance, no bonus was paid to François Wanecq.  In the year ended 31 December 2013, a full bonus was paid.  Thus the percentage change in bonus does not 
present a meaningful comparison.

Chief Executive Pay and TSR Performance graph 
The chart below shows Vesuvius’ TSR performance since the demerger which was effective on 19 December 2012. Consequently, the illustrative chart below 
shows the relevant period from 19 December 2012 to 31 December 2013.
Performance Graph and table
The following graph compares Vesuvius TSR performance to that of the same investment in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts).  This Index has 
been chosen as the comparator index to reflect the size, international scope and diversity of the Company. TSR is the measure of the returns that a company 
has provided for its shareholders, reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.  A spot rate has been used for this chart.

Operation of Policy in Following Year – 2014
It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention that the operation of the policy should remain broadly similar to the current year. No increase has been made 
to the Executive Director’s base salary, cash bonus potential has remained the same (with challenging targets set for maximum pay-out, based on Group 
Headline Earnings per share) and awards under the Vesuvius Share Plan will be made at 200% of base salary, on the basis of measures for 50% relative TSR 
and 50% EPS, as with 2013. We will report on these matters in our Annual Report on Remuneration in the 2014 Annual Report. 
Prior to seeking shareholder approval to any changes in this Policy, the Remuneration Committee will discuss any proposed material changes by consulting 
with shareholders. 
Directors’ service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors, who both put themselves up for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 15 May 2014, are employed under 
ongoing service contracts with the Company. These contracts do not have a fixed term of appointment. A copy of each Executive Director’s service contract is

Advice Provided to the Remuneration Committee
In March 2013, the Committee appointed the external advisers Towers Watson (“Towers”) to assist with its work. The appointment was made following a 
competitive tender process conducted by the Committee Chairman and Company Secretary. The full Committee approved the selection of Towers. The Committee 
is also advised by the Chief Executive, the Vice President Human Resources, the Company Secretary, and by the law firm Clifford Chance LLP (“Clifford Chance”). 
Towers was appointed directly by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on executive remuneration matters, including remuneration structure and 
policy, updates on market practices and trends, and guidance on the implementation and operation of long-term incentive plans. Clifford Chance was appointed 
by the Company Secretary to advise on the share-based incentives. Towers has also provided the Remuneration Committee with remuneration benchmarking 
data for certain Executive Directors and has provided ongoing calculations of Total Shareholder Return to enable the Committee to be updated on performance 
of long-term share incentive plans. Clifford Chance provides advice on the operation of executive share plans and the drafting of relevant documentation for 
incentive plans to the wider Group. Towers is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to Executive Remuneration 
Consulting in the UK. 
In addition to work undertaken for the Committee, Towers provides other remuneration and benchmarking advice to the Company, and Clifford Chance 
provides legal advice to the Company. The Remuneration Committee does not believe that the provision of any of these services to the Company 
compromises the independence or integrity of the advice that it receives from Towers and Clifford Chance LLP . During the year Towers’ fees, charged on 
a time spent basis, amounted to £111,876. Their work was split between advice relating to the demerger (£8,333), general advice to the Remuneration 
Committee (£30,563), with the remainder (£72,980) relating to advice on the content and preparation of the Directors Remuneration Report and fees for 
quarterly monitoring of TSR for awards outstanding under Long Term Incentive Plans. The Committee has considered and concluded that it is satisfied that 
the advice provided on executive remuneration matters is objective and independent and that no conflict of interest arises as a result of other services 
provided to the Company.
Statement on Shareholder voting
Vesuvius was listed on the London Stock Exchange on 19 December 2012 and its first AGM was held on 4 June 2013. In respect of the resolution put to 
shareholders at the last AGM to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report, Vesuvius received 97% of votes for and 3% of votes against. 16,116 votes were  
withheld. At the AGM on 15 May 2014, shareholders will be invited to vote on the Remeuneration Policy set out on pages 68 to 75 in this Report, and, also, 
to give an advisory vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration.

The Directors submit their Annual Report 
together with the audited accounts of the Group 
and of the Company, Vesuvius plc, registered in 
England and Wales No. 8217766, for the year 
ended 31 December 2013. 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company 
to provide a Directors’ Report for Vesuvius 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The information that fulfils this requirement 
and which is incorporated by reference into, 
and forms part of this report is included in the 
following sections of the Annual Report: 
•	 the Corporate Governance Report
•	 Financial Instruments: the information on 
financial risk management objectives and 
policies contained in Notes 22 and 30 to the 
consolidated financial statements
•	 details on Greenhouse Gas emissions, set on 
pages 44 and 45. 
This Directors’ Report and the Strategic Report 
contained in pages 10 to 47 together represent 
the management report for the purpose of 
compliance with DTR 4.1.8R of the UK Listing 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules. 
The Company does not have any overseas 
branches within the meaning of the Companies 
Act 2006.
going concern
Information on the business environment in 
which the Group operates, including the factors 
that are likely to impact the future prospects of 
the Group, is included in the Chief Executive’s 
review and the Strategic Report. The principal 
risks and uncertainties that the Group faces 
throughout its global operations are shown on 
pages 18 to 19. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
debt facilities are also described in the Strategic 
Report. In addition, Notes 22 and 30 to the 
consolidated Financial Statements set out the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; financial risks; financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposures to credit, market (both currency and 
interest rate-related) and liquidity risk. Further 
details of the Group’s cash balances and 
borrowings are included in Notes 15, 16 and 30 
to the consolidated Financial Statements.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts 
for the Group for a period in excess of 12 
months from the date of approval of the 2013 
Financial Statements. These forecasts reflect an 
assessment of current and future end-market 
conditions and their impact on the Group’s 
future trading performance. The forecasts show 
that the Group will be able to operate within 
the current committed debt facilities and show 
continued compliance with the Company’s 
financial covenants. On the basis of the exercise 
described above and the Group’s available 
committed debt facilities, the Directors consider 
that the Group and Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt a going concern basis in preparing 
the Financial Statements of the Group and the 
Company.
Research and Development
The Group’s investment in research and 
development (“R&D”) during the year under 
review amounted to £26.7 million (representing 
1.8% of Group revenue (2012:1.6%). Further 
details of the Group’s R&D activities can be 
found in the Innovation section on page 34 and 
35 of the Strategic Report. 
Dividends
An interim dividend of 4.75 pence (2012: 
7.5 pence, which was the interim dividend 
of Cookson Group plc) per Vesuvius ordinary 
share was paid on 7 October 2013 to Vesuvius 
shareholders. The Board is recommending a final 
dividend in respect of 2013 of 10.25 pence per 
ordinary share which, if approved, will be paid 
on 23 May 2014 to shareholders on the register 
at 25 April 2014.
Accountability and audit
A responsibility statement of the Directors and 
a statement by the Auditor about its reporting 
responsibilities can be found on pages 88 
and 89 respectively. The Directors fulfil the 
responsibilities set out in their statement within 
the context of an overall control environment 
of central strategic direction and delegated 
operating responsibility. As at the date of this 
report, so far as each Director of the Company 
is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware 
and each Director hereby confirms that they 
have taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of 
that information.
Auditor Reappointment
KPMG LLP has expressed its willingness to 
continue in office as Auditor of the Company, 
and consequently, resolutions for the 
reappointment of KPMG as Auditor of the 
Company and to authorise the Directors to

Annual general Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company 
will be held at The Lincoln Centre, 18 Lincoln’s 
Inn Fields, London WC2A 3ED on Thursday 15 
May 2014 at 11.00 am. 
Employment Policies
A fundamental concept embodied in the 
Company’s Code of Conduct is that Vesuvius’ 
goals can only be met through the efforts of 
its employees. Vesuvius recognises that job 
satisfaction requires working environments 
that motivate employees to be productive 
and innovative and provide opportunities 
for employee training and development to 
maximise personal potential and develop careers 
within the Group. Vesuvius is managed on a 
decentralised basis and it is the responsibility of 
the Vice President Human Resources, together 
with the relevant operational managers, to adopt 
employment policies and practices that best 
suit the size, style and geographical location 
of their operations. This management structure 
allows the Group’s operations to respond 
competitively to changes in the marketplace and 
to develop and retain a strong sense of identity, 
whilst benefiting from being a part of a major 
international group. 
Vesuvius values the involvement of its employees 
and keeps them informed on matters affecting 
them as employees and factors relevant to Group 
performance. Decisions on recruitment, career 
development, training, promotion and other 
employment related issues are made solely on 
the grounds of individual ability, achievement, 
expertise and conduct. These principles are 
operated on a non-discriminatory basis, without 
regard to race, colour, nationality, culture, ethnic 
origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, 
disability or any other reason not related to 
job performance or prohibited by applicable 
law. Vesuvius gives full and fair consideration 
to applications for employment from disabled 
persons. Should an employee become disabled 
during their employment with Vesuvius, every 
effort is made to enable them to continue their 
service with the Group.
greenhouse gas Emissions
Information on our reporting of greenhouse gas 
emissions, and the methodology used to record 
these, is set out on pages 44 and 45 of the 
Sustainability section of the Strategic Report.
Donations
In accordance with Company policy, no political 
donations were made in 2013. 
Change of Control Provisions
The terms of the Group’s committed bank 
facility and US Private Placement Loan Notes 
contain provisions entitling the counterparties 
to exercise termination or other rights in the 
event of a change of control on takeover of 
the Company. A number of the arrangements 
to which the Company and its subsidiaries are 
party, such as other debt arrangements and 
share incentive plans, may alter or terminate on 
a change of control in the event of a takeover. 
In the context of the Group as a whole, these 
other arrangements are not considered to be 
significant. 
Share Capital
As at the date of this report, the Company had 
an issued share capital of 278,485,071 ordinary 
shares of 10p each, being the total number 
of Vesuvius plc shares with voting rights. The 
Company cancelled its one Deferred Share of 
£1 and also redeemed its full holding of 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares on 11 December 
2013.
Further information relating to the Company’s 
issued share capital can be found in Note 7 to 
the Company Financial Statements.
The Company’s Articles specify that, subject to 
the authorisation of an appropriate resolution 
passed by a general meeting of the Company, 
Directors can allot relevant securities under 
Section 551 of the Companies Act, up to the 
aggregate nominal amount specified by that Act. 
In addition, the Articles state the Directors can 
seek the authority of shareholders in general 
meeting to allot equity securities for cash 
without first being required to offer such shares 
to existing ordinary shareholders in proportion 
to their existing holdings in connection with a 
rights issue and in other circumstances up to 
an aggregate nominal amount as specified in 
Section 561 of the Companies Act.
At the Annual General Meeting on 4 June 2013, 
the Directors were authorised to issue relevant 
securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£9,282,835, and to be empowered to allot equity 
securities for cash on a non pre-emptive basis up 
to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,392,425, 
at any time up to the earlier of the date of the 
2014 Annual General Meeting or 30 June 2014. 
The Directors propose to renew these authorities 
at the 2014 Annual General Meeting for a further 
year. In the year ahead, other than in respect 
of Vesuvius’s ability to satisfy rights granted to 
employees under its various share-based incentive 
arrangements, the Directors have no present 
intention of issuing any share capital of Vesuvius.
Pensions
In each country in which the Group operates, the 
pension arrangements in place are considered 
to be consistent with good employment practice 
in that particular area. Independent advisers 
are used to ensure that the plans are operated 
in accordance with local legislation and the 
rules of each plan. Group policy prohibits 
direct investment of pension fund assets in 
the Company’s shares. Outside the UK, the US, 
Germany and Belgium, the majority of pension 
plans in the Group are of a defined contribution 
nature.
The Group’s UK defined benefits plan (the “UK 
Plan”) and the main US defined benefits plan 
are closed to new entrants and have ceased 
providing future benefits accrual, with all eligible 
employees instead being provided with benefits 
through defined contribution arrangements.

Cookson Group plc was the principal employer 
of the UK Plan. Following the demerger, the UK 
Plan remained with Vesuvius and all pension 
liabilities of the Alent plc (“Alent”) employers 
who participated in the UK Plan immediately 
prior to the demerger were discharged in full. 
Cookson had agreed, with the Trustee of the UK 
Plan, a mitigation package in light of the loss of 
support from the Alent participating employers. 
That mitigation package comprised a £38m 
payment to the UK Plan. See Note 31 to the 
consolidated financial statements for further 
information. 
For the Group’s closed UK Plan a Trustee Board 
exists comprising employees, former employees 
and an independent trustee. The Board currently 
comprises seven trustee directors, of whom 
three are member-nominated. The administration 
of the plan is outsourced. The Company is 
mindful of its obligations under the Pensions 
Act 2004 and of the need to comply with the 
guidance issued by the Pensions Regulator. 
Regular dialogue is maintained between the 
Company and the Trustee Board of the UK 
Plan to ensure that both Company and Trustee 
are apprised of the same financial and other 
information about the Group and the UK Plan. 
This is pertinent to each being able to contribute 
to the effective functioning of the UK Plan. The 
latest full valuation of the UK Plan showed a 
funding surplus, as a result of which Company 
contributions ceased in July 2013. However, 
the Company has agreed to make voluntary 
contributions of £2.0m per annum at least 
until the next valuation date in recognition 
of the potential funding strain resulting from 
the ongoing derisking initiatives likely to be 
undertaken in the short term.
The Group’s worldwide net pension deficit 
at 31 December 2013 was £48 million (31 
December 2012: £69m). The decrease arose 
largely as a result of asset returns and Company 
contributions. 
On 19 July 2012, the Trustee of the UK Plan 
and Pension Insurance Corporation (“PIC”) 
announced that they had signed a pension 
insurance buy-in agreement covering all of 
the pensioner members of the UK Plan.  An 
extension to this agreement was signed in 
December 2012 which is expected to result 
in the transfer to PIC of up to £30 million of 
additional pensioner liabilities over the period 
to December 2015. This eliminates inflation, 
interest rate, investment and longevity risk in 
respect of around 65% of Vesuvius’ total UK 
pension liabilities. 
Current active employees in the UK are offered 
membership of a defined contribution plan, 
which is operated on a contract basis, with 
oversight by a governance committee.
All US retirement plan assets are held in trust 
for the exclusive benefit of plan participants 
and their beneficiaries. An independent financial 
institution acts as the Trustee. The trust assets 
are protected by law and by Federal Government 
Regulation and are subject to annual audit by an 
independent accountant, the Internal Revenue 
Service and the Department of Labour. Further 
details of pension arrangements are given in 
Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Share Plans
Vesuvius operates a number of share-based 
incentive plans which have been carried over 
from Cookson Group plc. For the majority of 
these plans the Group can satisfy entitlements 
either by the acquisition of existing shares or by 
the issue of new shares. Existing shares are held 
in an employee share ownership trust (“ESOT”). 
The trustee of the ESOT purchases shares in the 
open market as required, to enable the Group to 
meet liabilities for the issue of shares to satisfy 
awards that vest. The trustee does not register 
votes in respect of these shares and has waived 
the right to receive any dividends.
In 2013 the trustee of the ESOT purchased 
851,736 ordinary shares of 10p each in Vesuvius 
plc with a nominal value of £0.9 million at an 
average price, including transaction costs of 
479.77 pence per share, a cash cost of £4.1 
million to satisfy the actual and potential vesting 
of awards under the Group’s share-based 
payment plans. Subsequent to the year-end, 
the ESOT purchased a further 82,152 shares at 
an average price, including transaction costs, 
of 503.52 pence per share. See Note 26 to the 
consolidated Financial Statements for further 
information.
Adjustments were made to outstanding share-
based incentives as appropriate following the 
demerger of Cookson Group plc including to the 
number of shares granted under options and 
awards and any relevant performance conditions. 
Such adjustments were made in accordance with 
the rules of the relevant plans. Participants in the 
Cookson Group Executive Share Option Scheme 
were notified in February 2013 that, under 
the rules of this scheme, they had one month 
in which to exercise their outstanding options 
following the demerger. The Cookson shares that 
they acquired were compulsorily exchanged for 
Vesuvius shares pursuant to a new article which 
was incorporated into the articles of association 
of Cookson Group plc as part of the demerger. 
The number of Vesuvius shares which they 
acquired was increased to reflect the fact that 
they were not able to acquire any Alent shares.   
Consequently, during the year, 45,613 Vesuvius 
shares were issued to participants in the 
Cookson Group plc share option plans (pursuant 
to the provisions of those plans and the terms 
of the Demerger Agreement), which plans have 
now terminated for new awards. 
Authority for Purchase of Own Shares
Subject to the provisions of Company law and 
any other applicable regulations, the Company 
may purchase its own shares. At the General 
Meeting of the Company held on 4 June 
2013 Vesuvius shareholders gave authority to 
the Company to make market purchases of 
up to 27,848,507 Vesuvius ordinary shares, 
representing 10% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital as at the latest practicable 
day prior to the publication of the Notice of 
AGM. This authority expires on 30 June 2014 
or the date of the AGM to be held in 2014, 
whichever is the earlier. The Directors will seek 
renewal of this authority at the forthcoming 
AGM. 
During the year under review, the Company 
acquired 7,271,174 ordinary shares, 
representing a nominal value of £727,117 
and 2.6% of the entire called up share capital 
of the Company prior to the purchase. These 
shares were purchased pursuant to the Board’s 
commitment to return the majority of the net 
proceeds of the disposal of the Precious Metals 
Processing division to shareholders. These 
shares are currently held as treasury shares, 
The Company has not subsequently disposed of 
any of the repurchased shares. During the year, 
the Company did not make any acquisitions 
by nominee, nor did it dispose of any shares 
previously acquired. The Company does not have 
a lien over any of its shares.

person has any special rights with regard to the control of the Company’s share capital and all issues shares are fully paid. As set out above, the Company 
placed 7,271,174 ordinary shares in treasury during the year under review. This is a summary only and the relevant provisions of the Articles should be 
consulted if further information is required.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements
The Directors of Vesuvius plc are responsible 
for preparing the Annual Report and the Group 
and parent company (the “Company”) financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
Group and Company financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law they 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law (“UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice”).
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 for the Group financial statements, state 
whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
•	 for the Company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
Company financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group and the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
Directors are also responsible for preparing a 
Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Report that comply with that law and those 
regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate and 
financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement of the 
Directors in respect of the Annual 
Financial Report
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are set out on pages 50 to 51,  
confirms that to the best of their knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	 the Directors’ Report and Strategic Report 
include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face.
In addition, the Directors consider that the 
Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members 
of Vesuvius plc Only
Opinions and conclusions arising from 
our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of 
Vesuvius plc for the year ended 31 December 
2013 which comprise the Group income 
statement, the Group statement of comprehensive 
income, the Group statement of cash flows, the 
Group and Company balance sheets, the Group 
statement of changes in equity, and the related 
notes.  In our opinion:  
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;  
•	 the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union;  
•	 the parent company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance 
with UK Accounting Standards; and 
•	 the financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.  
2 Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on 
the financial statements the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit were as follows:
Recognition of a US deferred tax asset 
(£29.2 million): 
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 98 (accounting policy) and page 105 
(financial disclosures).
The risk: The Group has recognised a deferred 
tax asset in respect of unutilised losses and 
other temporary differences arising in the US. 
In addition the Group has losses and other 
temporary differences for which no deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in these financial 
statements. The recognition or otherwise of a 
deferred tax asset in respect of these losses 
and other temporary differences is based on 
judgement in respect of the timing and quantum 
of expected future profits and the ability of the 
Group to offset any of its accumulated losses 
against these expected profits.  This is one of 
the key judgemental areas on which our audit 
concentrated.
Our response: In this area, our audit 
procedures included, among others, using our 
own tax specialists to assist in assessing and 
challenging the assumptions and judgements 
made by the Directors.  In assessing the level 
of deferred tax asset balances recognised in 
the Group balance sheet we compared the 
assumptions used in respect of future taxable 
profit forecasts in respect of the relevant 
components to the Group’s long-term forecasts. 
We considered, amongst other things, historical 
levels of US tax profits, the historical accuracy 
of forecasts, and the growth forecasts used by 
the Group.  This included critically assessing 
the assumptions and judgements made by the 
Directors in those growth forecasts, by using 
our knowledge of the Group and the industry 
in which it operates and by comparing certain 
assumptions to externally derived data. We also 
assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
setting out the basis of the deferred tax balance 
and the level of estimation involved.
Current tax provisions (£45.0 million): 
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 98 (accounting policy) and page 105 
(financial disclosures).
The risk: Provisions for tax contingencies 
require the Directors to make judgements and 
estimates in relation to income tax issues and 
exposures. This is one of the key judgemental 
areas that our audit concentrated on due to the 
Group operating in a number of tax jurisdictions, 
the complexities of transfer pricing and other 
international tax legislation, and the time 
taken for tax matters to be agreed with the tax 
authorities.
Our response: In this area our audit procedures 
included, among others, the use of our own 
global tax specialists to assess the Group’s 
tax positions, and its correspondence with 
the relevant tax authorities to analyse and 
challenge the assumptions used to determine 
tax provisions based on our knowledge and 
experience of the application of international 
and local legislation by the relevant authorities 
and courts.  We also considered the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures in respect of tax and 
uncertain tax positions.
Provisions (£56.1 million):
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report), 
pages 98 and 136 (accounting policy) and page 
136 (financial disclosures).
The risk: Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the Group’s ultimate 
liability to settle an obligation arising from a past 
event. In providing for known or probable costs, 
resulting from indirect tax, legal, regulatory, 
or environmental requirements, the Directors 
use their judgement, experience, and where 
appropriate receive external advice, in order 
to make provisions in the financial statements 
for such matters. This is one of the key areas 
on which  our audit concentrated as a result of 
the impact that a material legal, regulatory, or 
environmental claim might have on the Group’s 
financial position and result for the year.  
Our response: In this area our audit 
procedures included, among others; obtaining 
an understanding from the Directors of the 
basis for their best estimates, challenging 
the basis used with reference to the latest 
available corroborative information and in light 
of our understanding of the business gained 
throughout the audit process, and obtaining 
third party confirmations. In addition we met 
with the Group’s in-house legal counsel to 
discuss the nature of ongoing claims, and 
obtained formal confirmations from the Group’s 
external legal advisers for all significant 
litigation. We also assessed whether the 
Group’s disclosures about provisions, contingent 
liabilities, and the movements in the year were 
appropriate. 
3 Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £7.0 million. 
This has been determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before taxation (of 
which it represents 6.7%), which we consider 
to be one of the principal considerations for 
members of the Company in assessing the 
financial performance of the Group.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report 
to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements 
we identified through our audit with a value 
in excess of £0.4 million, in addition to other 
89

corporate governance 22904-04  10-02-2014  Proof 3
audit misstatements below that threshold which 
we believe warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were 
performed by component auditors in the 
following countries: Germany, the UK, 
Switzerland, India, China, Mexico, Poland, 
Belgium, and Italy. In addition, specified audit 
procedures were performed for Group reporting 
purposes by component auditors in the US and 
Brazil. Combined, these audits and specified 
audit procedures covered 72% of the Group’s 
revenue, 74% of the Group’s profit before 
tax, and 83% of the Group’s total assets.  The 
segmental disclosure in Note 5 sets out the 
individual significance of specific geographical 
locations.
The audits and procedures undertaken for 
Group reporting purposes at the key reporting 
components of the Group were all performed 
to materiality levels set by, or agreed with, the 
Group audit team. These local materiality levels 
were set individually for each component and 
ranged from £0.1 million to £6.7 million.
Detailed instructions were sent to all the auditors 
in these locations. These instructions covered 
the significant areas that should be covered by 
the component audit teams (which included the 
relevant risks of material misstatement detailed 
above) and set out the information required 
to be reported back to the Group audit team. 
The Group audit team visited key reporting 
components in the following countries: Brazil, 
China, the UK, the US, Germany, and Mexico. 
Telephone meetings were also held with the 
auditors at these locations and all other key 
reporting component locations that were not 
visited.
For those components for which audits or 
specified audit procedures for Group reporting 
purposes are not performed, the Group audit 
team communicates with the component 
auditors regularly throughout the year 
particularly in relation to any control findings 
that may impact on the overall strategy for 
the Group audit. Local statutory audits are 
performed at the majority of these components 
but generally these are to be completed after the 
date of this report.
4 Our opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
is unmodified
In our opinion:  
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and  
•	 the information given in the Strategic Report 
and the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements.  
5 We have nothing to report in respect of 
the matters on which we are required 
to report by exception  
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if, based on the knowledge we 
acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is 
otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
•	 we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired during 
our audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
•	 the Audit Committee Report does not 
appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
adequate accounting records have not been kept 
by the parent company, or returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or  
•	 the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or  
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or  
•	 we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review:  
•	 the Directors’ statement, set out on page 84, 
in relation to going concern; and  
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement on page 54 to 60 relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.  
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on page 
88, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view.  A description of the scope of an audit 
of financial statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.
frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is 
made solely to the Company’s members as a 
body and is subject to important explanations 
and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, 
published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/
auditscopeukco2013a, which are incorporated 
into this report as if set out in full and should be 
read to provide an understanding of the purpose

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. General information
Vesuvius plc (“Vesuvius” or “the c ompany”) is a public limited company registered in england and Wales and listed on the London Stock exchange. 
the nature of the operations and principal activities of the c ompany and its subsidiary and joint venture companies (“the Group”) is set out in the 
Strategic r eport on pages 10 to 47 and its registered address is shown on page 144.
2.  Basis of preparation
2.1  Basis of accounting
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International f inancial r eporting Standards as adopted by the 
european Union (“Ifr S”) and, with the exception of defined benefit pension plans, certain provisions and derivative financial instruments, under the 
historical cost convention.
2.2  Impact of Cookson Group demerger on comparative financial information disclosure
the effect of adopting the principles of reverse acquisition to account for the Scheme of arrangement, by which the demerger of c ookson Group plc 
was implemented, results in a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of c ookson, now renamed Vesuvius. as a consequence of this, 
the comparative financial statements of Vesuvius include the full results of the alent group of companies up to the date of the demerger becoming 
effective on 19 december 2012. In preparing the disclosure of the results of Vesuvius for 2012, the following approach has been applied:
(i) the costs incurred by Vesuvius within its central headquarters for 2012 have been allocated in full between the underlying trading results of 
continuing and discontinued operations in arriving at the results for Vesuvius as a whole. 
(ii) as Vesuvius holdings Limited (formerly c ookson Group plc) remained with Vesuvius plc after the demerger, all of the borrowings and associated 
financial derivatives entered into by c ookson in the period up to the date of demerger have been treated as belonging to Vesuvius in the 
comparative financial statements, with the consequence that all of the finance costs relating to those c ookson borrowings have been reported 
as finance costs of Vesuvius. borrowings and borrowing costs relating to local debt arrangements established by individual c ookson Group 
companies other than c ookson Group plc have been reported according to whether they were part of the alent or Vesuvius group structure. this 
approach has also been applied to financial assets (net cash) and the related finance income.
(iii) tax charges in the comparative financial statements have been determined based on the tax charges recorded by Vesuvius companies in 
local statutory accounts, together with certain adjustments relating to those entities made for Group consolidation purposes. the tax charges 
recorded in the Group income statement for 2012 have been affected by the tax arrangements within the former c ookson Group and are not 
necessarily representative of the tax charges that would have been reported had Vesuvius been an independent group throughout 2012, nor of 
tax charges that may arise thereafter.
as a consequence of the above, the pre-demerger historical financial performance of Vesuvius in its comparative 2012 financial statements comprises 
the full consolidated financial performance of c ookson Group plc, albeit that in the income statements the total Group results have been analysed 
between continuing (Vesuvius companies only) and discontinued (alent and Precious metals Processing) operations. 
the demerger of alent was reflected in the Vesuvius financial statements as the sale, by Vesuvius, of the consolidated alent business on 19 december 
2012. hence the 2012 income statement of Vesuvius includes, within “discontinued operations”, the trading performance of alent up to 19 december 
2012, together with the profit on the ‘‘sale’’ of alent. Similarly, the trading results of the Precious metals Processing division (including the US 
operations, which were sold in 2012) have been included within discontinued operations in the comparative financial statements.
2.3  Basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the c ompany and entities controlled by the c ompany (its 
“subsidiaries”). c ontrol exists when the c ompany has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account. the results of 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed 
herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. all intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation.
n on-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s interest therein. n on-controlling 
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination together with the non-controlling interests’ share of 
profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income since the date of the combination. total comprehensive income is attributed to the 
non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

2.  Basis of preparation (continued)
2.4  Going concern
the directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of the 2013 financial 
statements. these forecasts reflect an assessment of current and future end-market conditions and their impact on the Group’s future trading 
performance. the forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance 
with the c ompany’s financial covenants. o n the basis of the exercise described above and the Group’s available committed debt facilities, the 
directors consider that the Group and c ompany have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. accordingly, 
they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the c ompany.
2.5 Functional and presentation currency
the financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the c ompany, and rounded to one decimal 
place. foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 30.1.
2.6  Disclosure of “Separately reported items”
IaS 1, Presentation of f inancial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which 
should be disclosed. It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of the income 
statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial performance. In accordance with IaS 1, the c ompany has adopted a 
columnar presentation for its Group income statement, to separately identify headline Performance results, as the directors consider that this gives 
a better view of the underlying results of the ongoing business. as part of this presentation format, the c ompany has adopted a policy of disclosing 
separately on the face of its Group income statement, within the column entitled “Separately reported items”, the effect of any components of 
financial performance for which the directors consider separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance 
achieved and in making projections of future results. In its adoption of this policy, the c ompany applies an even-handed approach to both gains and 
losses and aims to be both consistent and clear in its accounting and disclosure of such items. 
both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation. Such 
items may include, inter alia, the financial effect of exceptional items which occur infrequently, such as major restructuring activity, initial recognition 
and subsequent increase, decrease and amortisation of deferred tax assets, together with items always reported separately, such as amortisation 
charges relating to intangible assets, profits or losses arising on the disposal of continuing or discontinued operations and the taxation impact of the 
aforementioned exceptional items and items reported separately.
2.7  New and revised IFRS
during the year, the Group has adopted IaS 19 (revised), employee benefits (“IaS 19(r )”) which makes changes to the recognition, measurement and  
disclosure of defined benefit pension schemes. the impact can be summarised as follows which has required a restatement of the prior period’s 
consolidated results:
•	 the net finance cost relating to employee benefits plans has been previously presented gross within finance income and finance expense within 
the Group income statement. the amount is now considered to be a single finance cost on the net pension liability. Prior period comparatives have 
been restated.
•	 IaS 19(r ) requires the net pension interest charge to be calculated by applying a high quality corporate bond yield to the net defined benefit 
liability/asset. this has resulted in the net pension interest charge for 2012 of £0.6m, as previously reported, to become £0.1m with an equal and 
opposite effect on the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability in the Group statement of comprehensive income. the impact on the net 
pension interest charge for 2013 is broadly similar to that for 2012.
•	 o perating costs have been increased by £1.5m for 2013 (2012: £1.7m), as a result of the requirement to include pension scheme administration 
costs in operating costs. Such costs include the Pf I levy and actuarial, legal and trustee charges which, under the previous IaS 19, were allowed to 
be included within net finance costs. 
In addition, during the period, the Group adopted a number of other new standards and amendments which became effective, none of which had 
a material impact on the Group’s net cash flow, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share. a number of other new and 
amended Ifr S were issued during the year which do not become effective until after 1 January 2014 and which have not been early adopted. n one of 
these are likely to have a material impact on the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.

3.  Critical judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events. the major sources of 
estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below.
3.1  Goodwill and other intangible assets
the directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value that will benefit the 
performance of the Group over future periods. to assist in making this judgement, the directors undertake an assessment, at  least annually, of the 
carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets. In the assessment undertaken as at  31 december 2013, further details 
of which are given in note 19, value in use was derived from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 2.5% in the years 
beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates. the projection period is, in the opinion of the directors, an appropriate period over which to 
view the future results of the Group’s businesses for this purpose. c hanges to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter 
the directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
3.2  Employee benefits
the Group’s financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement benefits to 
current and former employees. It is the directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting 
such future obligations. these assumptions are set after consultation with the Group’s actuaries and include those used to determine regular service 
costs and the financing elements related to the plans’ assets and liabilities. Whilst the directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a 
change in the assumptions used could affect the Group’s profit and financial position.
3.3  Liability reserves
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and 
environmental matters. Several of the Group’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary 
course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax 
authorities. r eserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory 
requirements, or from third-party claims. as the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory 
process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty. the directors use their judgement and experience to make 
reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
3.4  Taxation
(a)  Current tax
tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group. In assessing the amount of the 
benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation and 
any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement. any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax 
charge. the Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions. as a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax 
audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude. Provisions are made for known issues based 
upon the directors’ interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.
(b)  Deferred tax
the Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Group’s businesses, 
further details of which are given in note 12.4. account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets 
are recognised. If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing 
differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
the Group also has losses and other timing differences, analysed in note 12.4, for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these 
financial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference is not probable or to where 
the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits. If trading or other 
appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a 
reduced tax charge.
4.  Non-GAAP financial measures
the c ompany uses a number of non-Generally accepted accounting Practice (“non-Gaa P”) financial measures in addition to those reported in 
accordance with Ifr S. the directors believe that these non-Gaa P measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and 
operating performance of the Group and its divisions.
4.1  Headline 
headline performance is from continuing operations and before items reported separately on the face of the income statement.

4.  Non-GAAP financial measures (continued)
4.2 Underlying 
Underlying performance is adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates, business acquisitions and disposals. 
4.3 Return on sales 
r eturn on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue. 
4.4 Trading profit
trading profit is defined as operating profit before separately reported items. the directors believe that trading profit is an important measure of the 
underlying trading performance of the Group.
4.5  Headline profit before tax
headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and total net 
finance costs associated with headline performance. 
4.6  Effective tax rate
the Group’s effective tax rate is calculated on the income tax costs associated with headline performance, divided by headline profit before tax and 
before the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint ventures.
4.7  Headline earnings per share
headline earnings per share is calculated as headline profit before tax and after income tax costs associated with headline performance and profit 
attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
4.8 Operating cash flow
operating cash flow is cash generated from continuing operations before restructuring, demerger payments and additional pension funding contributions but 
after deducting capital expenditure net of asset disposals.
4.9  Free cash flow
free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, 
dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans. 
4.10 Average working capital to sales ratio
the average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the total revenue for the year. 
average working capital (comprising inventories, trade receivables and trade payables) is calculated as the average of the 12 previous month-end 
balances. 
4.11 Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (“EBITDA”)
ebItda is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation charges. 
4.12 Net interest
n et interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by the directors to be 
exceptional and therefore separately reported.
4.13 Interest cover
Interest cover is the ratio of ebItda to net interest. 
4.14  Net debt
n et debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits. 
4.15 Net debt to EBITDA
n et debt to ebItda is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to ebItda for that year. 
4.16  Return on net assets (“RONA”)
rona is calculated as trading profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets (being the average over the previous 
12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and payables). 
4.17  Constant rates
f igures presented at constant rates represent december 2012 numbers retranslated to december 2013 exchange rates.

5.  Segment information
the segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-Gaa P financial measures, definitions for which can be found  
in note 4.
5.1 Accounting policy
(a)  Revenue recognition
r evenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting 
rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group. r evenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive 
evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the 
customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably. a provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates. Where a contractual arrangement consists of 
two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary 
materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
(b) Research and development costs
expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. expenditure on development 
activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete 
development. all other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. c apitalised 
development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
5.2 Business segments
Operating segments for continuing operations
for reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two main business segments: Steel and foundry and the senior executive management of each 
of these business segments reports to the c hief executive of the Group. It is the Vesuvius board which makes the key operating decisions in respect 
of these segments. the information used by the Vesuvius board to review performance and determine resource allocation between the business 
segments is presented with the Group’s activities segmented between the two business segments, Steel and foundry. taking into account the basis 
on which the Group’s activities are reported to the Vesuvius board, the directors believe that these two business segments are the appropriate way to 
analyse the Group’s results. the principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Strategic r eport on pages 24 to 31.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers (inter-segment revenue is not material). trading profit includes items directly 
attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Discontinued operations
discontinued operations in 2012 include the results of the alent group of companies for the period up to 19 december 2012, when they were 
demerged from Vesuvius, together with the results of the US Precious metals Processing business for the period up to 1 may 2012 when it was sold 
and the the results of the european Precious metals Processing business for the whole of the year. the european Precious metals business was held 
for sale as at 31 december 2012 and its results for the period up to 31 may, when it was sold, are reported as discontinued operations in 2013.

7.  Restructuring charges
the restructuring charge for the year from continuing operations was £3.9m (2012: £57.0m) and arose in connection with initiatives that included 
redundancy programmes, the downsizing or closure of facilities, the streamlining of manufacturing processes and the rationalisation of product lines. o f 
the total charge, £0.1m (2012: £46.3m) arose in connection with the actions taken to downsize the Solar c rucibles operations of the foundry division, the 
charge in 2013 comprising redundancy and other cash costs of £1.1m, net of the release of a reserve of £1.0m for lease costs no longer required. the net 
tax credit attributable to the total restructuring charges was £2.6m (2012: £4.6m).
c ash costs of £10.3m (2012: £11.4m) were incurred in the year in respect of the restructuring initiatives of continuing operations commenced both in 
2013 and in prior years, leaving provisions made but unspent of £12.9m (note 35) as at 31 december 2013 (2012: £17.1m), of which £4.9m relates 
to future costs in respect of leases expiring in one to ten years.
8.  Demerger costs
the cash costs associated with the preparation and execution of the demerger of the alent group of businesses from c ookson Group plc, to the extent 
that they were allocated to Vesuvius, have been separately reported in the income statement in 2012. c osts totalling £15.7m were charged in the 
year, primarily relating to professional adviser fees for financial, audit, accounting, legal and pensions advice. fees in connection with the negotiated 
changes to the former c ookson debt arrangements in order to provide Vesuvius with ongoing borrowing facilities were £2.0m and were, as required 
by Ifr S, capitalised against the associated borrowings and are being amortised over the expected life of those debt arrangements. tax-related costs 
of £11.4m were incurred in connection with the transactions necessary to reorganise the legal entity structure of the former c ookson group of 
companies so as to facilitate the demerger.

12.  Income tax
12.1  Accounting policy
tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. c urrent and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they 
relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax is also dealt with in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
the Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

tax charged in the Group statement of comprehensive income in the year amounted to £1.6m (2012: £14.8m credit), £1.4m (2012: £14.8m credit) of 
which related to net actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits plans. 
the Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. c hanges in any of these areas could, adversely or

at the end of 2013, a deferred tax asset in respect of US temporary differences was recognised. the asset of £29.2m represents the partial recognition 
of temporary differences arising prior to the demerger of alent in 2012 and was determined in the light of past and forecast future profit performance 
of the US businesses of Vesuvius, as required by IaS 12. In view of its material size and nature, the tax credit arising from the recognition of this 
asset is presented separately from the tax charge on headline performance, in accordance with the principles outlined in note 2.6 above. Subsequent 
increase, decrease and amortisation of the value of this asset would similarly be expected to be presented in this manner, as the directors consider 
that the separate identification of deferred tax for temporary differences arising prior to the demerger would assist both in a better understanding of 
the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results of the Group.
tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences of £7.5m (2012: £7.0m) were recognised by subsidiaries reporting a loss in 2012 or 2013. 
o n the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries, the directors consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary 
differences can be offset against future taxable profits.
the total deferred tax assets not recognised as at 31 december 2013 were £280.0m (2012: £336.6m), as analysed below. In accordance with the 
accounting policy in note 12.1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic benefit is not 
probable. In total, there was a decrease of £56.6m (2012: £147.1m) in net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year.

there are no temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not

from 1 april 2013, the UK corporation tax rate reduced to 23% from 24%. f urther UK corporation tax rate reductions to 21% from 1 april 2014 and 
20% from 1 april 2015 were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. accordingly, the Group’s closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using 
a tax rate of 20%. the impact of using this lower tax rate was to increase the exceptional tax credit relating to the amortisation of intangible assets 
from £4.5m to £7.0m (2012: £4.7m to £6.7m).

17. Property, plant and equipment
17.1 Accounting policy 
freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. o ther items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. c osts are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits 
flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably. all other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Group income 
statement in the period in which it is incurred.
freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is 
available for use and is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over 
its estimated useful life as follows:
asset category estimated useful life
freehold property between 10 and 50 years
Leasehold property the term of the lease
Plant and equipment — motor vehicles and information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years
 — other between 5 and 15 years
the depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each year-end. as 
described in note 19.1, an asset’s carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are 
recognised in the Group income statement.

18.  Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
18.1 Accounting policy
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date 
fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired. o n disposal of a 
business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(b) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other legal rights, 
and their value can be measured reliably. they are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition-date fair value, and subsequently measured at 
cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses. other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an 
indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s c GUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. for 
the purposes of impairment testing, the directors consider that the Group has two c GUs: the Steel and foundry divisions. these c GUs represent the 
lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.

19.  Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
19.1  Accounting policy
at each balance sheet date, the directors review the carrying value of the Group’s tangible and other intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the directors 
estimate the recoverable amount of the c GU to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s c GUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and 
the directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of each c GU, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of 
the associated goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets.
for the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or c GU is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value in 
use. If the recoverable amount of a c GU is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the c GU and then to the other assets of the c GU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the c GU. 
an impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. an impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than 
goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was 
recognised. the value in use calculations of the Group’s c GUs are based on detailed business plans covering a three year period from the balance sheet 
date, higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and perpetuity calculations beyond this five year projection period. the cash flows in the 
calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.
19.2  Key assumptions
the key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, growth rates and discount rates. r eturn on sales assumptions are based 
on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the 
balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions; external forecasts and historical trends for the Group’s key end-markets 
of steel production and foundry castings; and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business unit operates. a 
perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% (2012: 2.5%) has been applied based on the long-term growth rates experienced in the Group’s end-markets and 
external forecasts. the Group’s projections are based on historical trends and external forecasts. discount rates are calculated for each c GU, reflecting 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each c GU. the pre-tax discount rate used for the Steel c GU was 11.7% 
(2012: 12.2%) and for the foundry c GU was 13.7% (2012: 15.4%). Under a sensitivity analysis undertaken on the 2013 impairment testing, a 1.0% 
increase in each of the c GU discount rates, combined with a 2.0% perpetuity growth rate, still left each c GU with significant headroom of recoverable 
amount over its carrying value.
19.3  Goodwill impairment
In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 december 2013, the directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of 
the Group’s c GUs as at 31 december 2013. those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of each of 
the Group’s c GUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.

all of the Group’s operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers with whom they do 
business. Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered. evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being 
in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings. Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer 
basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience. historical experience 
has shown that the Group’s trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being 
excessive.

purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition 
and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels. n et realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. the amount of any write-down of inventories to 
net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

22.  Derivative financial instruments
22.1 Accounting policy
the Group uses derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage 
the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk. the way in which derivatives are used to manage the Group’s financial risk is 
detailed in note 30.
derivatives are measured at fair value. the fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date. 
the fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, 
taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty.
the method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument 
for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge 
accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in 
achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. the change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated 
as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised immediately in the Group income statement. n o derivatives are held for 
speculative purposes. 
Cash flow hedges
the effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and 
presented in the hedging reserve in equity. the ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit, or within finance 
costs in the case of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or 
loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period.
Fair value hedges
the change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement. the 
carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised 
within trading profit in the Group income statement.
Net investment hedges
the effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity, and is subsequently recognised in the Group income statement as part of 
the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit in the 
Group income statement.

share capital of £1,777.9m over the total share capital and share premium of c ookson Group plc as at 14 december 2012 of £278.9m.
the translation reserve in the table above comprises all foreign exchange differences attributable to the owners of the parent. these exchange 
differences arise from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and from the translation of financial instruments that hedge 
the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. In addition to foreign exchange differences attributable to the owners of the parent, the Group 
statement of comprehensive income includes foreign exchange differences attributable to non-controlling interests.
o n 11 december 2013, Vesuvius plc redeemed the 50,000 outstanding redeemable preference shares with a nominal value of £1 each for £50,000. 
the consideration was satisfied by the cancellation of the undertaking to pay given by the holder of the preference shares at the time of issue.
29.  Dividends
a final dividend for the year ended 31 december 2012 of £26.4m (2011: £40.3m), equivalent to 9.5 pence (2011: 14.5 pence) per ordinary share, 
was paid in June 2013 (June 2012) and an interim dividend for the year ended 31 december 2013 of £13.0m (2012: £20.9m), equivalent to 4.75 
pence (2012: 7.5 pence) per ordinary share, was paid in o ctober 2013 (o ctober 2012).
a proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 december 2013 of £27.7m, equivalent to 10.25 pence per ordinary share, is subject to approval 
by shareholders at the c ompany’s annual General meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. If approved by 
shareholders, the dividend will be paid on 23 may 2014 to ordinary shareholders on the register at 25 april 2014.

30.  Financial risk management
30.1 Accounting policy
(a) Non-derivative financial instruments 
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. after initial recognition they are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
(b) Foreign currencies
the individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which that entity operates. for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity 
are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of the transactions. at each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i) foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. exchange differences arising on the 
settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement; and
(ii) n on-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pounds sterling), its results and financial position 
are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii)  Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not 
approximate the exchange rate at the date of a specific transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used; and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are 
reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Net investment in foreign operations
exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation are initially recognised in 
other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
30.2  Financial risk factors
the Group’s treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the board, is principally responsible for managing the financial risks 
faced by the Group. the Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
(a)  Market risk
market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments may fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. the Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange rates (“currency risk”) and interest rates (“interest rate risk”).
Currency risk
the Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets (being cash and short-term deposits) that are denominated in currencies 
other than pounds sterling. the Group’s general policy is proportionally to match the currency profile of its core borrowings with the currency profile of 
its earnings and net assets. this is achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts (“f X swaps”). the currency profile of 
the Group’s borrowings and financial assets, reflecting the effect of the f X swaps, is shown in the table below.

30.2  Financial risk factors (continued)
Interest rate risk
the Group’s interest rate risk principally arises in relation to its borrowings. Where borrowings are held at floating rates of interest, fluctuations in 
interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash flows associated with its interest payments and where borrowings are held at fixed rates of 
interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the fair value of its borrowings. the Group’s policy is to maintain a mix of fixed 
and floating rate borrowings, within certain parameters agreed from time to time by the board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility 
in reported earnings.
as at 31 december 2013, the Group had $310m and €30m (£212.1m in total) of US Private Placement Loan n otes outstanding, which carry a fixed rate 
of interest, representing two-thirds of the Group’s total borrowings outstanding at that date. the interest rate profile of the Group’s borrowings and net 
debt is detailed in the tables below.

the floating rate financial liabilities shown in the tables above bear interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, plus a margin. 
the fixed rate financial liabilities of £210.6m (2012: £152.6m) have a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% (2012: 4.7%) and a weighted average 
period for which the rate is fixed of 7.3 years (2012: 6.6 years). the financial assets attract floating rate interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the 
appropriate currency, less a margin.

30.2  Financial risk factors (continued)
based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates 
would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 
£0.5m (2012: £1.4m) and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement 
and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by £0.5m (2012: £1.4m). Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would 
result in a decrease of £12.6m (2012: £9.2m) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt and a 1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an 
increase of £13.6m (2012: £9.8m) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt.
(b)  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations. the Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains 
sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow requirements and any 
maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial covenants. the level of operational headroom provided by the Group’s committed 
borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Group’s three-year planning process. Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, 
this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
as at 31 december 2013, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of £637.1m (2012: £578.8m), of which £328.6m (2012: £157.7m) were 
undrawn. these undrawn facilities are due to expire in april 2016. the Group’s borrowing requirements are met by US Private Placement Loan n otes 
(“USPP”) and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of £425.0m (2012: £425.0m). the USPP facility was fully drawn as at 31 december 
2013 and amounted to £212.1m ($310m and €30m), of which $110m is repayable in 2017, $140m in 2020, €15m in 2021, $30m in 2023,  
€15m in 2025 and $30m in 2028. the syndicated bank facility is repayable in april 2016.

30.3  Capital management
the c ompany considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt. It monitors its capital using a number of key performance 
indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to ebItda ratios and rona (note 4). the Group’s objectives when 
managing its capital are:
 ❯ to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial 
covenants contained within its debt facilities;
 ❯ to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Group’s equity and net debt;
 ❯ to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns to  
investors; and
 ❯ to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
the Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has substantial liquidity headroom within its 
committed debt facilities. details of the Group’s covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Strategic r eport on page 14. 
31.  Employee benefits
31.1  Accounting policy
the net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets. the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have 
terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is 
limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
the expense for the Group’s defined benefit plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in note 31.7. actuarial gains and losses 
arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of comprehensive income; and gains and losses arising 
on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or 
curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of operating profit.
31.2  Group post-retirement plans
the Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefit and defined contribution type, and accounts for them in 
accordance with IaS 19(r ).
the Group’s principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and the US, the benefits of which are based upon the final pensionable salaries of 
plan members. the assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds. the trustees are required to act in the best 
interests of the plans’ beneficiaries. the principal risks faced by these plans comprise: (i) the risk that the value of the plan assets is not sufficient to 
meet all plan liabilities as they fall due; (ii) the risk that plan beneficiaries live longer than envisaged, causing liabilities to exceed the available plan 
assets; and (iii) the risk that the market-based factors used to value plan liabilities changes materially adversely to increase plan liabilities over the 
value of available plan assets. the Group also has defined benefit pension plans in other territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these 
are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
(a)  Defined benefit pension plans – UK
the Group’s main defined benefit pension plan in the UK (“the UK Plan”) is closed to new members and to future benefit accrual.
following the demerger of c ookson Group plc, the UK Plan remains with Vesuvius. the alent employers who participated in the UK Plan ceased to 
participate with effect from the demerger and their pension liabilities in the UK Plan were discharged in full by apportioning the pension liabilities of 
the alent participating employers to Vesuvius, combined with a mitigation payment into the UK Plan to compensate for the loss of support from the 
alent participating employers, which reduced the financial covenant of the employers supporting the UK Plan. the mitigation payment agreed with the 
UK Plan trustee was equal to approximately 25% of the UK Plan’s Section 75 deficit calculated as at completion of the demerger and amounted to 
£38.0m, of which £34.0m was paid in december 2012 and £4.0m in January 2013.

31.  Employee benefits (continued)
31.2  Group post-retirement plans (continued)
a full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan trustee and the last full valuation 
was carried out as at 31 december 2012. at that date, the market value of plan assets was £501.9m and this represented a funding level of 102% 
of the accrued plan benefits at the time of £490.4m. c alculated on a “buy-out” basis (using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan 
benefits with an insurance company), the liabilities at that date were £610.1m, representing a funding level of 82%. Under the rules of the UK 
Plan, the trustee has the power to set the funding contributions, having consulted with the c ompany. Under a schedule of contributions agreed by 
the c ompany and trustee, the c ompany made “top-up” payments of £7.0m per annum up to July 2013, after which they ceased as a result of the 
funding surplus evidenced by the 2012 funding valuation. the level of “top-up” payments will be reviewed based on the UK Plan’s next triennial 
valuation as at 31 december 2015, which should be available in mid-2016. n otwithstanding the latest funding valuation surplus, the c ompany 
has agreed to make voluntary contributions of £2.0m per annum at least until the next valuation date in recognition of the potential funding strain 
resulting from the ongoing de-risking initiatives likely to be undertaken in the short term.
o n 19 July 2012, the UK Plan trustee announced that it had entered into a pension insurance buy-in agreement with Pension Insurance c orporation 
(“PIc ”) to insure approximately 60% of the UK Plan’s total liabilities. Under this arrangement, the UK Plan trustee paid an insurance premium of 
£318.8m to PIc , wholly from the assets of the UK Plan, which will secure a stream of income exactly matching future ongoing pension payments. 
this arrangement eliminated the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of these liabilities. Post buy-in, the UK 
Plan now carries an asset in the form of the insurance contract, which is valued (in both the funding and IaS 19(r ) valuations) at an amount which 
matches exactly that of the liabilities which it covers, thereby removing any funding or balance sheet volatility relating to this part of the UK Plan’s 
liabilities. therefore, the only risks remaining in the UK Plan relate to deferred members and the small number of pensioner members not covered by 
the insurance policy. the Group continues to fund the UK Plan on the basis of the funding valuation.
for plan funding purposes, the UK Plan’s pensioner liabilities are valued using more prudent assumptions than those required under IaS 19(r ) for 
accounting purposes. o n a funding basis – sometimes called the ‘‘economic’’ or ‘‘ongoing’’ basis – the insurance premium paid to PIc represented 
some £10m less than the amount reserved in the UK Plan against these liabilities. this means that the funding level of the UK Plan – the measure 
which determines the level of additional contributions required to be made by Vesuvius – improved by some £10m as a result of the buy-in. o n an 
accounting basis, the pensioner liabilities are valued using a higher discount rate (as required by IaS 19(r )), which provides a much lower valuation 
of those liabilities. as a consequence, the accounting valuation of the insurance contract compared with the actual premium paid to PIc resulted in a 
reduction in the asset portfolio valuation of some £50m. IaS 19(r ) requires this loss to be reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income, 
not the income statement. 
In december 2012, an extension to the PIc buy-in agreement was signed, under which the UK Plan trustee agrees to transfer to PIc all new pensioner 
liabilities arising from July 2012 to december 2015 for a premium payment by the UK Plan which is calculated to be consistent with the pricing 
terms of the original buy-in agreement, but reflecting changes in market conditions and differences in the duration of the liabilities transferred. the 
agreement covers up to £30m of liabilities, with the future premium payments to be met from the existing assets of the UK Plan. for 2013, the impact 
of this agreement extension has been an estimated increase of £1m to the UK Plan liabilities in respect of the pensioner benefits to be transferred to 
PIc in early 2014. the estimate of loss which this represents has been reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income for 2013.
(b)  Defined benefit pension plans – US
the Group has a number of defined benefit pension plans in the US, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit. the Group’s 
principal US defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members and also to future benefit accrual for existing members. actuarial valuations of the 
US defined benefit pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 december 2012. at that date the market 
value of the plan assets was £69.4m, representing a funding level of 66% of funded accrued plan benefits at that date (using the projected unit method 
of valuation) of £104.6m. f unding levels for the Group’s US defined benefit pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by 
independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government regulations. 
(c)  Defined benefit pension plans – Germany
the Group has a number of defined benefit pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country. the net 
liability of the German plans at 31 december 2013 was £32.6m.
(d)  Defined contribution pension plans
the total expense for the Group’s defined contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to £10.9m (2012 as restated: £11.5m 
continuing operations) and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.

31.3  Post-retirement liability valuation
the main assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans, as detailed below, are set by the 
directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. 
(a)  Mortality assumptions
the mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s UK, US and German defined benefit pension liabilities are summarised in the table 
below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans. 
for the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-administered Pension Schemes (“SaPS”) all table, with future longevity 
improvements in line with the “core” mortality improvement tables published in 2013 by the c ontinuous mortality Investigation (“cm I”), with a 
long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. for the Group’s US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard r P-2000 fully 
generational tables with projection scale bb, a change from 2012 when the tables used were the r P2000ch mortality tables, projected 64 years for 
non-pensioners and 33 years for pensioners using projection scale aa . the change is aimed at allowing more explicitly for differences in mortality 
levels and future trends in mortality for people born in different years. the Group’s major plans in Germany have been valued using the heubeck-
r ichttafein 2005G mortality tables.

the discount rate used to determine the liabilities of the UK Plan for IaS 19(r ) accounting purposes is required to be determined by reference to market 
yields on high quality corporate bonds. the UK discount rate in the above table is based on the aon hewitt aa -rated corporate bond yield in conjunction 
with the most recent projected cash flow data relating to the UK Plan liabilities; the US discount rate is based on the c itigroup pension discount curve; 
and the German discount rate is based on the yield on the iboxx over 10 year euro corporates aa index. 
the assumptions for price inflation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-
linked bonds, except for c PI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 1.0 point lower than r PI-based inflation.
(c) Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in significant IAS 19(R) actuarial assumptions
the following table analyses, for the Group’s main UK, US and German pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting 
from changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions used for IaS 19(r ) valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
following the agreement of buy-in agreements for the UK plan pensioner liabilities in 2012, as noted above, and the fact that US pensions are not 
inflation linked, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries and of pensions in payment are not significant to the valuation of the Group’s overall 
pensions liabilities.

as stated above, during 2012 the UK Plan entered into pension insurance buy-in agreements which eliminate the inflation, interest rate, 
investment and longevity risk in respect of the pensioner liabilities covered by the agreements. therefore, for the liabilities so covered, 
which represent some 65% of the total liabilities of the UK Plan, any changes in the valuation assumptions which impact the value of those 
liabilities, also impacts on the associated annuity assets in an equal and opposite way, thereby fully mitigating the valuation risk. this is also 
reflected in the following table.

31.4  Defined benefit obligation
the liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans for IaS 19(r) accounting purposes are measured by 
discounting the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method, in which the calculation 
of plan liabilities makes allowance, where appropriate, for projected increases in benefit-related earnings.
the average duration of the obligations to which the liabilities of the Group’s principal pension plans relate is 18 years for the UK, 16 years 
for Germany and 10 years for the US.

31.  Employee benefits (continued)
31.6  Balance sheet recognition (continued)
(a)  UK Plan asset allocation
as at 31 december 2013, of the UK Plan’s total assets, excluding risk-mitigation derivatives, 53% were represented by the bulk annuity 
insurance contracts covering the UK Plan’s pension liabilities; 6% were allocated to equities; 10% to infrastructure and property investments; 
26% to cash; and 5% to other assets. In addition, the UK Plan holds a liability driven investment portfolio of financial derivative contracts 
which reduces the risk that the UK Plan’s assets would fall materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities. 
(b)  Defined benefit contributions in 2014
In 2014, the Group is expected to make aggregate contributions into its defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefits plans of 
around £8m; of this, £6m is voluntary.
31.7  Income statement recognition
the expense recognised in the Group income statement in respect of the Group’s defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement 
benefit plans is shown below.

the total net charge of £7.8m (2012: £0.6m) recognised in the Group income statement in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
plans and other post-retirement benefits plans is recognised in the following lines:
2013

In arriving at trading profit — within other manufacturing costs (1.9) (1.8)

In arriving at profit before tax — within net finance costs (1.8) (0.1)
Continuing operations — charge (7.8) (5.1)
Discontinued operations — 4.5
Total net charge (7.8) (0.6)
In accordance with IaS 19(r), which took effect from 1 January 2013, pension administration costs of £1.7m for 2012 have been reclassified 
to trading profit, whereas previously these were charged within net finance costs. as further required by IaS 19(r), the net finance cost 
relating to employee benefit plans must be calculated by applying a high quality corporate bond yield to the net defined benefit obligation, 
whereas previously it was usual for the expected return on pension plan assets to be a higher rate than the discount rate applied to the plan 
liabilities. this has resulted in the net pension interest charge for 2012 of £0.6m, as previously reported, to become £0.1m, with an equal 
and opposite effect on the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability in the Group statement of comprehensive income. the financial 
impact of implementing IaS 19(r) on the results for 2013 has been broadly similar to that in 2012.

34. Leases
34.1  Accounting policy
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. all 
other leases are classified as operating leases. r entals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
34.2  Operating lease commitments
the future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows:
2013
£m
2012

n ot later than one year 8.4 9.5
Later than one year and not later than five years 17.6 18.8
Later than five years 6.4 10.1
Total operating lease commitments 32.4 38.4
the Group’s property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts. Where the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the 
corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation. Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to 
the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group 
balance sheet. the net book value of the Group’s property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 december 2013 and 
31 december 2012 was not material.
the cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within trading profit, amounted 
to £14.4m (2012: £24.2m).

35. Provisions
35.1  Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet 
date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current 
market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

As at 31 December 2013 30.4 12.9 12.8 56.1
o f the total provision balance as at 31 december 2013 of £56.1m (2012: £61.3m), £35.3m (2012: £31.8m) is recognised in the Group balance sheet 
within non-current liabilities and £20.8m (2012: £29.5m) within current liabilities.
the provision for disposal and closure costs includes the directors’ current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the fulfilment of 
obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, together with those related to the 
demolition and clean-up of closed sites. the provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or 
other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability. as the settlement of many of the obligations for 
which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but 
the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next ten years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated 
to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. 
the provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Group’s initiatives to rationalise its operating activities. the balance of £12.9m 
as at 31 december 2013 comprises £4.9m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between one and ten years, and 
£8.0m in relation to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives which is expected to be paid out over the next two years.
o ther provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from 
third-party claims. as the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing 
of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years 
and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. 
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance sheet only when its 
realisation is virtually certain. as at 31 december 2013, £10.4m (2012: £10.2m) was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance 
reimbursements, of which £8.1m (2012: £7.9m) is non-current. the amounts reported in the table above as charged to the Group income statement 
represent only that part of the total income statement charge reported as a movement on provisions. o ther components of the charge, such as asset 
write-offs, are reported as a reduction in the carrying value of the relevant balance sheet item.

36.  Off-balance sheet arrangements
In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported 
in the Group balance sheet. o f such arrangements, those considered material by the directors include: future lease payments in relation to assets 
used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases (note 34); and trade receivable balances that have been subject to non-recourse factoring 
arrangements.
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for a cash 
payment from the factoring company, net of fees. all the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements are transferred to the 
factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Group balance sheet. Such arrangements are used from time to time by 
the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables. as at 31 december 2013, the Group balance sheet included £11.9m (2012: £18.6m) 
of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in place. factoring fees incurred during the year 
ended 31 december 2013, which are written off to the Group income statement within ordinary finance costs, amounted to £0.4m (2012: £0.5m).
37.  Contingent liabilities
Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to £2.7m (2012: £3.4m). details of guarantees given by 
the c ompany, on behalf of the Group, are given in note 10 to the c ompany financial statements.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and 
environmental matters. Several of Vesuvius’ subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary 
course of the operations of the company involved, and the directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute 
with tax authorities. r eserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other 
regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims. as the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other 
regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty (see note 35 for further information).
c ertain of Vesuvius’ subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small number of products containing asbestos 
manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by Vesuvius. these suits usually also name many other product manufacturers. to date, 
Vesuvius is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries. a number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed 
or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on Vesuvius’ financial position or 
results of operations.
c ookson Precious metals Ltd, a subsidiary of Vesuvius, was engaged in transactions involving the purchase of scrap platinum between august 2007 
and o ctober 2009. Vesuvius had been informed by hmrc that, in hmrc ’s view, certain external third parties within the supply chain for those 
transactions deliberately failed to account to hmrc for Vat . Such fraud is commonly known as missing trader Intra-c ommunity fraud. hmrc have 
undertaken an investigation to assess whether, as a consequence of any fraudulent actions of those third parties, they could argue that the ability of 
Vesuvius to retain Vat recovered on the relevant transactions should be limited. hmrc ’s investigation has been concluded in respect of most of the 
Vat loss under investigation, with no associated liability for Vat or interest or penalties arising.
c ertain subsidiary companies of Vesuvius plc and alent plc are defendants in two actions, brought by macdermid (incorporated in the United States), 
which are pending in the c onnecticut Superior c ourt and arising out of corporate activity involving the parties in the autumn of 2006. the first action 
was commenced in 2009 and the second action was commenced in august 2012. macdermid claims damages of approximately $62m, plus punitive 
or exemplary damages, costs and interest which are currently unquantifiable. both Vesuvius and alent believe these claims have no merit and are 
vigorously defending these actions. each of Vesuvius and alent anticipates filing motions for summary judgment in both cases by mid-2014 and, if 
any claims remain pending decisions on those motions, a trial in the first action is anticipated in the first half of 2015. any liability relating to the 
macdermid claim arising following the demerger of c ookson Group will be split equally between alent plc and Vesuvius plc.
38.  Principal subsidiaries and joint ventures
details of the principal subsidiaries and joint ventures of Vesuvius plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are given in note 5 to the 
c ompany financial statements, together with detail of subsidiaries exempt from audit of individual financial statements by virtue of s479a c ompanies 
act 2006.
39.  Related parties
all transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business terms. transactions between 
related parties that are Group subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.

7.  Issued share capital
7.1 Accounting policy
equity instruments issued by the c ompany are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
7.2  Analysis of issued share capital
during 2013 the c ompany issued 36,319 ordinary shares of £0.10 each for a total consideration of £0.1m.
o n 11 december 2013, the c ompany redeemed the 50,000 outstanding redeemable preference shares with a nominal value of £1 each for £50,000. 
the consideration was satisfied by the cancellation of the undertaking to pay given by the holder of the preference shares at the time of issue. also 
during the year, the c ompany redeemed the deferred share for no consideration and cancelled it.
o n incorporation on 17 September 2012, the c ompany’s share capital consisted of one ordinary share with a par value of £1 (“the subscriber share”). 
o n 18 September 2012, the c ompany issued 50,000 redeemable non-voting preference shares of £1 each. the preference shares were allotted for 
cash and remain unpaid by virtue of the holder giving an undertaking to pay up each share pursuant to section 583(2) and 583(3) of the c ompanies 
act 2006.
o n 14 december 2012, the c ompany issued 278,448,752 ordinary shares of 638.5 pence each (£1,777.9m) to the public shareholders of c ookson 
Group plc in exchange for the entire share capital of c ookson Group plc as part of the Scheme of arrangement. o n the same date, the subscriber 
share was converted into and redesignated as a deferred share of £1.
o n 19 december 2012, the c ompany demerged the alent business (formerly the Performance materials division of c ookson Group plc), whereby 
the share capital of the c ompany which amounted to £1,777.9m, was reduced by: (a) cancelling and extinguishing paid-up capital on each of the 
Vesuvius plc shares in issue immediately prior to the confirmation by the c ourt of the Vesuvius plc capital reduction, to the extent that the amount 
paid up on each such Vesuvius plc share shall be 10 pence; and (b) reducing the nominal value of each of the Vesuvius plc shares to 10 pence each. 
In respect of the paid-up capital cancelled pursuant to (a) above: £862.4m was repaid, with such repayment being satisfied by the transfer by the 
c ompany to alent plc of the entire share capital of alent Investments Limited, in consideration of the allotment and issue by alent plc of one alent plc 
share for each Vesuvius plc share held by the Vesuvius plc shareholders at the date of the demerger; and the balance of £887.7m was retained and 
transferred to the reserves of the c ompany to be available for future distributions, leaving issued share capital of £27.8m. the total market value of 
the alent plc shares issued was £862.4m, being the market value of the alent business as at 19 december 2012.

7.2  Analysis of issued share capital (continued)
following the completion of the sale of the Precious metals Processing division on 31 may 2013, the c ompany commenced an on-market share 
repurchase programme to return cash to shareholders. during the period from 4 June to 31 december 2013, the c ompany had repurchased 
7,271,174 of its own shares for £30.0m. a further 851,736 ordinary shares were purchased during 2013 for £4.1m via c ookson Investments (Jersey) 
Limited as trustee of the c ookson Group eSo P .
8.  Shareholders’ funds
8.1 Accounting policy
Taxation
both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
c urrent tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more 
likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Provision is made 
for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends 
have been accrued as receivable.

9.  Share-based payments
9.1  Accounting policy
the c ompany operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees. equity-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value at the date of grant. the fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the total 
Shareholder r eturn target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with 
a corresponding increase in equity. the cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the 
effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at 
the date of grant. for grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model. for 
all other grants, fair value is measured using the black–Scholes model.
9.2  Profit and loss account recognition 
the c ompany operates a number of different share-based payment schemes, the main features of which are detailed between pages 68 to 83 of the 
directors’ r emuneration r eport. £0.9m was charged to the profit and loss account in the year with regard to share-based payments (2012: nil).
9.3  Details of outstanding options 
the information in the tables below has been restated to take into account the demerger of the alent business from the c ookson Group. the number 
of share options, and other related disclosures, were adjusted with reference to the Vesuvius share price at the date of demerger.
the demerger was effective on 19 december 2012, at which point certain employees previously employed by other Group companies were transferred 
to Vesuvius plc. the share options attached to these employees, being the options outstanding at the date of transfer, is shown in the 2012 table 
below.

10. Contingent liabilities
Where the c ompany enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the c ompany 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the c ompany treats the guarantee contract as a 
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the c ompany will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. Guarantees 
provided by the c ompany as at 31 december 2013 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to £467.7m (2012: £565.5m), 
which includes guarantees of $310m and €30m (2012: $250.0m) in respect of US Private Placement Loan n otes and £96.4m (2012: £267.3m) in 
respect of drawings under the syndicated bank facility; together with £108.2m (2012: £108.2m) in relation to a guarantee provided to the c ompany’s 
UK subsidiary which acts as trustee for the Group’s UK pension plan. the guarantee is over all present and future pension liabilities of the plan and 
the contingent liability amount represents the net deficit on a solvency valuation basis as shown in the most recent triennial valuation.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and 
environmental matters. Several of the c ompany’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the 
ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with 
tax authorities. While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and 
the insurance arrangements of the c ompany and its subsidiaries, the directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the 
aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the c ompany’s financial condition or results of operations.
11.  Related parties
all transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business terms. transactions between 
related parties that are wholly owned Group subsidiaries are not disclosed in this note.

Boiler room scams
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders 
have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. these are typically from overseas based “brokers” who 
target UK shareholders, offering to buy their shares or sell them what often 
turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. these 
operations are commonly known as “boiler rooms”. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to 
buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you receive any 
unsolicited investment advice:
 ❯ make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
 ❯ c heck that they are properly authorised by the f Sa before getting 
involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/fsaregister/ 
 ❯ r eport the matter to the f Sa by calling 0845 606 1234  
(or +44 20 7066 1000 from outside the UK).
 ❯ If the calls persist, hang up.

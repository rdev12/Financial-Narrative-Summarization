MARKET OVERVIEW
While coal prices remain well supported by 
positive long term demand fundamentals, the 
near term outlook continues to be challenging. 
2013 thermal coal market
The Newcastle benchmark fell 11% between 
2012 and 2013, as growth levels eased in the 
face of robust competition to sell product on the 
seaborne market.
Overall seaborne supply growth was relatively 
modest at 3%, with Indonesian growth of 20mt 
at roughly one-third of 2012 levels. Australian 
volumes bucked the trend, with production up 6% 
as producers focused on increasing asset intensity. 
Local currency weakness was also a major factor in 
increased Australian production.
As a response to the weaker pricing environment, 
capital expenditures were reduced across the 
mining industry.
Near term outlook
While 2014 may see a modest uplift to demand 
fundamentals, the market continues to expect a 
further increase in supply. Global production growth 
is set to remain relatively steady at 4% over 2013.
Incremental demand appears to be more reliant 
on India with new coal fired power projects having 
boosted 2013 import levels. There is the potential, 
however, for this demand growth to be dampened 
by Rupee weakness.
THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY
OUTLOOK 
 – Weak producer currencies and take or pay 
contracts have created short term over supply
 – Thermal coal continues to be cost 
competitive against other fuel sources
 – New generating capacity in Asia will drive 
future demand
 – The long term outlook for prices remains 
well under-pinned
Sales value by destination is shown below:

Chinese coal demand is also expected to continue to 
grow, as hydro-electric production normalises after 
a recent period of heavy investment.
Industry capital expenditure is expected to increase 
in 2014, driven largely by Chinese domestic 
production, development of assets in Mozambique, 
and a rebound in Australia. Having increased 
by 6% in 2013, global port capacity remains 
accommodative of volume growth.
Longer term outlook 
The longer term outlook for thermal coal continues 
to be well under-pinned by solid fundamentals 
as it continues to remain a vital source of cost-
competitive energy globally for the foreseeable 
future. In 2013, coal made up 42% of total electricity 
generation. This is expected to remain stable for the 
foreseeable future.
China and India will continue to dominate global 
thermal coal demand growth as Asia remains 
dependent mainly on coal for power generation 
requirements, and new generation capacity is 
added. China currently generates 76% of its 
electricity through coal, this is forecast to be 67% in 
2025. Indian electricity generation is currently 68% 
coal, this is forecast to remain stable at 67% in 2025. 16 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
It is with pleasure that I write to you as your 
new Chairman to report on a year of significant 
progress for the Company.
The Board’s agenda in 2013 was shaped by: (i) the 
transaction (the “Separation Transaction”) to 
separate the Company from the Bakrie Group
1
 and 
dispose of its shareholding in PT Bumi Resources 
Tbk, and (ii) the internal reviews which culminated 
in an extensive review of the financial position 
at PT Berau and the enhancement of our 
internal controls.
This review of PT Berau resulted in the publication 
of 2012 audited financial statements being delayed 
and on 22 April 2013 the Board requested a 
temporary suspension of the Company’s shares 
from trading. The Board was unanimous in its view 
that this was necessary to ensure a reliable set of 
accounts as a basis for restoring investor confidence 
in the Group.
On 31 May 2013, the Company published its 2012 
audited financial statements. In addition, the 
Company announced the review had uncovered 
evidence of payments made in 2011 and 2012 to 
the value of approximately US$201 million that could 
not be substantiated as having a clear business 
purpose as well as a further US$6 million in relation 
to payments made in January and February 2013, 
before new PT Berau management was appointed. 
In response to these findings, the Company 
announced that it would pursue all means available 
for the recovery of all relevant expenditure and, 
following enhancements to its internal controls, 
applied for the resumption of trading in its shares 
which took place on 22 July 2013.
In addition to devoting a considerable amount of 
time to these matters, management also focused 
on the core business which has demonstrated 
resilience notwithstanding the pressures of weak 
thermal coal prices.
We have increased production by 11.7% to 
23.5 million tonnes whilst maintaining costs level, 
despite higher local inflation. A number of other 
initiatives were launched to improve our operational 
cost profile.
As announced on 25 March 2014, we have now 
completed the Separation Transaction which marks 
a major milestone for the Company. This will allow 
the Company to focus on PT Berau, the fifth-largest 
thermal coal producer in Indonesia. The Board 
also intends to return at least $400 million 
to shareholders.
In 2013, the Company established a committee 
comprising the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors (“INEDs”) to evaluate the Separation 
Transaction. This committee was advised by 
N.M. Rothschild & Sons Limited together with 
the Company’s legal advisors. This committee, 
chaired by the then Deputy Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director (“SID”) Sir Julian Horn-Smith, 
met extensively throughout 2013 in the discharge of 
its duties and, on behalf of the Company, I would like 
to thank all the INEDs who have been unstinting in 
the time they have been prepared to commit, often 
at short notice, to fulfil the duties of this committee 
regarding the Separation Transaction. 
We are committed to effective corporate governance 
and the Governance Report which starts on page 45 
is intended to give shareholders an understanding 
of our corporate governance arrangements and how 
the Company complied with the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code in 2013. 
As you will see from the Governance Report, the 
Board has been focused on addressing the 
challenges it has faced as result of non-compliance 
with certain of its policies and lack of disclosure by 
former PT Berau management. The Board made a 
priority of enhancing the control environment to 
better safeguard the Company’s assets and has 
taken actions throughout the year to address 
these starting with the appointment of Nick von 
Schirnding, the first unaffiliated CEO of the 
Company, on 31 December 2012. It followed with 
the removal of certain directors of PT Berau, and 
then the initiation of internal reviews which led to 
its extensive review of the financial position at 
PT Berau and the associated enhancement of 
our internal controls.
On 22 January 2013, the Company announced that 
the independent investigation commissioned by the 
INEDs and conducted by Macfarlanes LLP (and 
reported in our 2012 Annual Report) had been 
completed and established a litigation committee, 
whose remit of reviewing all potential claims arising 
out of such investigation was extended during the 
year to include the review of potential claims and 
1  Being PT Bakrie & Brothers Tbk and Long Haul Holdings Ltd together.
Chris Walton
Chairman 17 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
As your outgoing Chairman, I welcome the 
appointment of Chris Walton as the Company’s 
new Chairman.
As described in Chris’s statement, 2013 was 
a year of transformation for the Company 
and I would like to thank all my colleagues 
on the Board and all our employees for their 
commitment to the Company throughout 2013.
Samin Tan
Non-Executive Director
(and Chairman of the Company
from 26 March 2012 to 27 March 2014)
dealings with regulators arising out of the extensive 
review of PT Berau.
The Board, through this committee, continues to 
take all appropriate action open to it to pursue 
remedies, recover value where available and liaise 
with the relevant regulators in the United Kingdom 
(UK) and Indonesia. This includes the enforcement 
(through arbitration proceedings in Singapore) of 
the Company’s rights under an agreement entered 
into with Rosan Roeslani on 26 June 2013 for the 
Company to recover $173 million in respect of 
payments made by PT Berau largely during 2011 
and 2012 that had no clear business purpose.
On 23 May 2013, the Company (through N.M. 
Rothschild & Sons Limited) reported to the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) certain related party 
transactions which had been identified during the 
course of the above-mentioned reviews which were 
subsequently set out in the 2012 Annual Report. 
As announced on 4 November 2013, the FCA is 
investigating these transactions and the litigation 
committee is overseeing the Company’s full 
cooperation with this investigation.
The Board also regards the Group’s performance 
in health, safety, the environment and community 
affairs as a key element of its operational 
performance and a report on this key area can be 
found on page 28. Our focus remains on prioritising 
the health and safety of our employees, minimising 
the Group’s environmental impact and engaging 
constructively with communities to create lasting 
economic and social value. 
As your new Chairman I would like to thank, on 
behalf of the Board, our outgoing Chairman Samin 
Tan who stepped down from his role as Chairman 
on 27 March 2014 but will remain on the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director and the Company’s business 
partner in Indonesia. I look forward to his continued 
contribution as a Non-Executive Director.
I would also like to thank the other Directors who 
have left the Board this year for their contribution, 
and in particular Sir Julian Horn-Smith, Lord Robin 
Renwick and Sir Graham Hearne all of whom have 
made significant contributions to the Company. 
We wish them well with their future endeavours.
The notice (“AGM Notice”) for the 2014 annual 
general meeting (“AGM”) of the Company will 
be issued shortly as a separate document. 
As previously announced, Steven Shapiro, an INED, 
has informed the Board that he will not be standing 
for re-election at the above-mentioned AGM.
During the period under review the Nomination 
Committee has been working on the restructuring of 
the Board. This led to the appointment of Nick Salmon 
and me as INEDs on 1 January 2014 and Mr Salmon’s 
appointment as SID on 1 February 2014. This process 
is ongoing and further appointments will continue to 
be considered and, where appropriate, announced 
including in connection with the nomination rights 
under the relationship agreements described in the 
section of the Directors’ Report entitled “Appointment 
and replacement of Directors” on page 77. 
In the meantime on 27 March 2014: Nick Salmon joined 
the Audit, HSEC and Remuneration Committees; 
all INEDs became members of the Nomination 
Committee and I succeeded Sir Julian Horn-Smith 
as chairman of the Nomination Committee. Also, in 
accordance with the terms of the Borneo Relationship 
Agreement (as defined and described in the Directors’ 
Report), Samin Tan has become a member of the 
Nomination Committee.
Finally, I would like to thank all our employees for 
their hard work throughout a challenging year 
where the extensive changes, management 
initiatives and repeated publicity have placed 
unprecedented demands on all staff. I would also 
like to thank my colleagues on the Board for their 
ongoing commitment to the Company and, as your 
new Chairman, I look forward to the challenges 
and opportunities that lie ahead.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Highlights for 2013:
 – Full year production of 23.5mt, ahead of target
 – A strengthened management team
 – Asset optimisation on track to deliver savings 
in 2014
 – A fresh start under the new name of Asia 
Resource Minerals plc
The Separation Transaction
At our General Meeting on 17 December 2013, 
our shareholders voted overwhelmingly for the 
Separation Transaction as well as a change of 
name to Asia Resource Minerals plc.
On 25 March 2014 we announced the completion 
of the Separation Transaction which involved the 
disposal of our 29.2% stake in PT Bumi and the 
sale of the Bakrie Group’s entire 23.8% indirect 
interest in the Company to Ravenwood Acquisition 
Company Limited (“RACL ”), a company owned by 
Samin Tan. Companies controlled by Samin Tan 
now own 47.6% of the total shares in the Company.
While the timing of completion was delayed, the 
price of $501 million paid by the Bakries for the 
PT Bumi stake was completed according to the 
original terms and at more than three times the 
market value of PT Bumi in Indonesia prior 
to completion.
Following the successful conclusion of the 
transaction, our intention is to return at least 
$400 million of cash to shareholders.
The year in review
2013 was a very challenging but transformational 
year for the Group. Against a backdrop of shareholder 
turmoil and continued weak thermal coal prices, 
the underlying business performed well in terms 
of production growth, cost control and further 
enhancement to our systems of governance and 
financial controls.
Whilst sales volumes increased 11% in the year to 
23.3mt, this was offset by a 16% reduction in the 
average selling price. Production at PT Berau grew 
by 11.7% in 2013 to 23.5mt from 21.0mt in 2012. 
Underlying EBITDA was $176 million, as detailed 
in the Financial Review.
In October, we significantly strengthened our 
management team with the appointments of Paul 
Fenby as Chief Financial Officer, and Keith Downham 
as Chief Mining Officer, both based in Jakarta. 
Paul’s initial focus is on optimising the Group’s 
capital structure and strengthening our financial 
controls, while Keith is responsible for our new 
Life of Mine plan and ongoing asset optimisation 
programme. A number of other management 
appointments have also been made. 
It is my focus to build on our strong operating 
performance with a near term focus on creating 
value through the development and optimisation 
of our coal mining activities at PT Berau.
Our vision and strategy
The three pillars of the Group’s near term 
strategy are:
Optimisation – we are optimising our asset base by 
improving efficiency and cutting costs aggressively 
across the Group 
Organic Growth – we are focused on delivering 
profitable production growth at PT Berau
Capital Structure – we are optimising our capital 
structure and currently exploring a range of 
refinancing options to reduce our interest costs
Optimisation
Good progress continues to be made in respect of the 
Company’s asset optimisation programme, to reduce 
costs and improve efficiencies.
An optimised Life of Mine plan has been completed, 
which will aim to maximise value and further enhance 
the efficiency of current mining methods. Discussions 
are also at a very advanced stage with a number of 
mining contractors to effect rate reductions starting in 
2014. In addition the number of contractors has been 
rationalised by the removal of some of the smaller 
higher cost contractors. Projects are underway to 
ensure that the Company realises the lowest costs 
for tyres and explosives.
Conceptual level studies have been completed 
into the use of conveyors to transport both waste 
material and coal, and initial outcomes from 
these studies suggest there is potential to further 
Nick von Schirnding
Chief Executive Officer 19 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
reduce costs. The current focus is to advance the 
studies and engineering on these projects for 
potential implementation.
Fuel consumption for both mine fleet and shipping 
has been reduced by 6.8 million litres through the use 
of additives which improve combustion and instituting 
controls that reduce wastage. Further fuel initiatives 
are currently being worked on, including the 
implementation of fuel management systems and 
improved fuel pricing. Fuel is one of the Company’s 
largest costs, in 2013 it spent $227 million on fuel.
Annualised exploration costs have been reduced by 
12% to $11.5 million (2012: $13.0 million) through 
maximising the utilisation of drilling equipment. 
The number of rigs has been reduced, as has the 
overall number of geologists.
In terms of barging productivity, sea trials have been 
completed on 330ft barges with a load capacity of 
11,000 tonnes, against current 270ft barges with a 
7,000 tonne load capacity. Two larger barges have 
been brought into service with plans to replace the 
entire fleet operating from the Suaran port as existing 
contracts end during 2014. A dredging programme at 
the Lati port has allowed the load on each barge to be 
increased from 5,500 to over 7,000 tonnes.
Marketing commissions on the sale of coal have 
been reduced by 0.5% from 3.5% to 3.0% from 
January 2014 and discussions on further reductions 
are underway.
Organic growth
I am pleased to report that we grew production at 
PT Berau by 11.7% in 2013 to 23.5mt from 21.0mt 
in 2012. We currently expect 2014 to be another 
solid year of growth with the incremental production 
increase forecast to come largely from Binungan. 
The Company’s mine plan envisages growth in 
production for 2014 of around 10% although that 
remains dependent upon the successful outcome 
of our discussions with the Indonesian authorities 
about increasing the current quota beyond 23mt. 
Organic growth remains our immediate priority and 
we remain engaged with the Indonesian government 
regarding extending the CCoW. While any attractive 
acquisition opportunity would naturally be assessed, 
the near term priority remains delivering on the 
significant available organic growth options.
Capital structure
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had net debt of 
$523 million (2012: $535 million (restated)). We are 
currently exploring a range of refinancing options to 
reduce our interest costs.
Governance
Good corporate governance practices are essential 
to our management of the affairs of the Group, and 
our accountability to shareholders. Since being 
appointed the first unaffiliated CEO of the Group on 
31 December 2012, I have initiated a number of major 
changes to enhance our governance framework.
In 2013, we appointed a new President Director and 
installed a new management team at PT Berau, as 
well as moving to a new head office in Jakarta. 
We also conducted an extensive review of PT Berau’s 
financial position. This led to an ongoing programme 
of enhancements across a range of internal controls 
and resulted in increased alignment of PT Berau with 
the Company’s governance framework, practices 
which had previously not been followed by former 
PT Berau management.
Health, Safety, Environment and Communities
We run our business in a socially and environmentally 
responsible way. Employee safety, environmental 
protection and the wellbeing of local communities 
are essential to our corporate identity and values. 
In terms of safety, I am pleased to report that for 
the second year running, we had no fatalities. It is 
also pleasing to note that Berau won a Silver Award 
in 2013 for its performance in both Safety and 
Environmental Management practices.
Outlook
Whilst the coal price may well remain muted in the 
near term due to supply issues, we believe that the 
longer term outlook for thermal coal continues to 
be well underpinned by growth in demand from 
Asian countries. We believe it will remain a vital 
source of cost-competitive energy globally for the 
foreseeable future.
Conclusion
Now that the long and painful process of the 
Separation Transaction is complete, and with the 
ongoing process of enhancing controls in place, I am 
confident that we are in a better position to deliver 
value to our shareholders.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank 
our employees across the Group for their hard work 
during often difficult circumstances in 2013 and I look 
forward to delivering on our commitments over the 
year ahead.

underpinned in the long term by 
increasing Asian electricity demand.
 – Our location gives us a freight 
distance advantage to our key 
markets over competitors situated in 
Australia, Colombia and South Africa.
 – The near term outlook for coal prices 
remains challenging due to continued 
over-supply.
ORGANIC GROWTH
We are focused on delivering 
profitable production growth 
at PT Berau.
Commentary
 – We are currently exploring a range 
of refinancing options to reduce our 
interest costs.

Key Facts 
– Lease area 118,400Ha 
– 1st Generation CCoW 
– CCoW expires 26 April 2025 (although with further 
extensions envisaged) 
In 2013 PT Berau grew production by 11.7% to 23.5 million 
tonnes, despite operations being suspended at the end of 
the year because the government imposed production 
limit had been reached. 
The additional coal production was from lower strip ratio,  
higher margin pits, most notably Binungan 7. This resulted in  
an overall reduction of the strip ratio by 8% to 8.8 bcm/tonne.  
All mines at PT Berau performed well throughout the year with 
weather delays in line with the plan during the first quarter.  
At the end of the year operations at the small, high cost 
Sambarata B East pit were suspended resulting in a 500,000 
tonne reduction. PT Berau also moved to consolidate its mining 
contractors from seven to five. 
Coal processing and shipping also delivered strong 
performances for the year, with record shipments at 23.3mt  
for the year, 10.6 % above the 2012 performance and the  
vessel loading rate topped 28.1kt/day, 3% above 2012. PT Berau 
successfully trialled 330 foot barges between the Suaran port 
and the Muara Pantai transhipment point, which will result in  
a more efficient barging operation in the future. In addition 
dredging of the Segah River near the Lati port has allowed 
barges to be loaded to in excess of 7,000 tonnes, whereas 
previously cargos were capped at 5,500 tonnes. 
PT Berau’s average selling price (on a free on board basis) 
(“ASP”) was $59.6 per tonne for 2013 (2012:$70.9 per tonne), 
reflecting ongoing weakness in thermal coal markets.  
The ASP was stronger in the first half because older sales 
contracts had not expired. Production costs for the year were 
$38.6/tonne and in line with 2012. Whilst the strip ratio and 
waste hauling distances were lower, these savings were offset 
by increased coal hauling distance and the impact of the one 
week shutdown at the end of the year. In light of the ongoing 
weak market conditions PT Berau reduced its need for capital 
expenditure, by rescheduling projects and identifying more  
cost efficient solutions, which resulted in capital expenditure  
of $46 million (2012: $101 million (restated)). 
In terms of sales by destination, 85% were exports (mainland 
China: 36%, Taiwan: 19%, India: 12%, South Korea: 10%,  
Rest of Asia: 8%), with the remaining 15% sold domestically  
into Indonesia.  
Prices are determined annually, quarterly, index or on a  
spot basis. 
The majority of sales, in terms of our brands of coal, related  
to Sungkai (64%), and Agathis (30%), with the remaining 6% 
relating to Mahoni and Eboni.

FINANCE REVIEW
Despite the continued weakness  
in coal prices, underlying EBITDA  
of $176 million was achieved. 
The Group’s financial performance for the year was impacted 
by the continued weakness in thermal coal prices, despite  
higher production volumes. Our focus remains on ongoing  
cost reduction, optimising the capital structure and continued 
enhancement of financial controls and governance processes.

FINANCE REVIEW CONTINUED
Movements in underlying earnings and net earnings 
Revenues 
Revenues were $1,425 million (2012: $1,531 million), down  
$106 million or 7%. The adverse impact of lower thermal  
coal prices was partially offset by increased sales volumes.  
PT Berau’s average selling price fell 16% due to a combination 
of a fall in the Newcastle Index, the reference by which  
PT Berau sets prices, by 11% and an increased proportion of 
lower calorific value coal from Binungan. This was partially 
offset by an 11% increase in sales volumes to 23.3 mt  
(2012: 21.1 mt).  
Cost of sales 
PT Berau’s cost of sales per tonne was slightly lower than 2012. 
Whilst cost reductions were achieved in overburden removal, 
coal mining and fuel, there were increases in cost per tonne  
due to the early stoppage of production as a result of reaching 
production quota and ceasing production, as well as increases 
in transhipment, coal processing and coal hauling costs. In 
addition, a foreign exchange loss of $30 million arose on the 
VAT receivable balance. 
The amortisation of mining properties is included within cost of 
sales. These were fair valued on the acquisition of PT Berau and 
the charge for the year was $149 million (2012: $116 million). 
The increase in the charge reflects the increased production  
in the year and projected volumes over the CCoW. 
Operating costs  
General and administrative costs reduced by $31 million to  
$102 million through closer cost control in the business.  
This was despite significant costs being incurred in relation to 
the Macfarlanes enquiry, the proposed settlement with Rosan 
Roeslani, and the review of the financial position of PT Berau.  
Distribution and marketing costs were $11 million lower due 
primarily to a reduction in revenue.  
Other exceptional costs 
As referred to in Note 6 to the financial statements, the new  
PT Berau management team, appointed in March 2013, 
identified certain expenditure which had no clear business 
purpose and this expenditure was presented as other 
exceptional costs in the 2012 ARM plc financial statements. 
Expenditure of a similar nature totalling $6 million (2012:  
$152 million) was incurred by previous management in  
January and February 2013 and, accordingly, this also has  
been presented as other exceptional costs.  
Finance costs 
Finance costs were $9 million higher than in 2012, due  
primarily to a foreign exchange loss on time deposits held  
in Indonesian Rupiah. 
Tax 
Tax was $41 million lower than 2012 due to lower profits, 
caused by a significant decrease in thermal coal prices, offset  
by adjustments in respect of prior periods. 
Non-controlling interests 
This is the loss attributable to non-controlling interests in  
the year. 
A reconciliation of underlying EBITDA is shown below: 
2012 Underlying EBITDA 321
Average selling price (269)
Sales volume  56 
Operating costs  26
General and administration expenses 31 
Distribution and marketing expenses  11 
2013 Underlying EBITDA  176
Corporate transaction costs 
In 2013, $18 million of corporate transaction costs were 
incurred on the separation of PT Bumi from Asia Resource 
Minerals plc.  
Movement on financial instruments at fair value 
This relates to an embedded derivative in relation to PT Berau’s 
senior secured notes, which PT Berau has the option to repay 
early. Small movements in interest rates affect the valuation  
of the option resulting in an income or expense in the profit  
and loss account. Details are shown in Note 23 to the  
Financial Statements. 
Impairment of goodwill 
During 2012, the significant and prolonged decrease in 
benchmark thermal coal prices indicated that PT Berau  
could be impaired, and an assessment of impairment was 
undertaken resulting in an impairment of $815 million.  
A further assessment of impairment of goodwill was 
undertaken at the end of 2013 and concluded that no further 
impairment should be recorded in 2013. Details of key 
assumptions used and a sensitivity analysis are included  
in Note 13 to the financial statements. 
Share of net loss of associate 
As PT Bumi is no longer treated as an associate, no result  
is recorded for 2013 in the income statement. For 2012, the 
$167 million net loss relates to the Group’s share of PT Bumi’s 
results up to 30 September 2012, the point at which it was 
determined there was a loss of significant influence. In addition, 
on reclassification of PT Bumi from associate to investment on 
30 September 2012, a loss of $1,394 million was recorded as  
a one off charge. These items were excluded from underlying 
earnings as PT Bumi is no longer an associate and no longer 
represents part of the ongoing business of the Group. 
   25 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
Balance sheet 
The net book value of property, plant and equipment reduced 
$130 million to $2,821 million mainly due to depreciation of 
$175 million offset by additions of $46 million. 
Trade and other receivables reduced by $64 million to  
$528 million mainly due to a decrease in the VAT recoverable  
on expenses incurred, caused by a deterioration in the 
Indonesian Rupiah to US dollar exchange rate as explained  
in more detail in Note 3.5 to the financial statements, and a 
better collection from trade debtors.  
The available for sale asset reflects the value of PT Bumi, which 
has been marked to market as at the year end. The reduction  
in value reflects the deterioration in the share price of PT Bumi 
and the devaluation of the Indonesian Rupiah against the US 
dollar since the start of the year. 
Trade and other payables decreased by $60 million to  
$773 million due to a decrease in accruals. 
In 2012, the extensive review of the financial position of  
PT Berau identified certain time deposits in cash and cash 
equivalents that were pledged outside the Group. These 
amounts were reclassified to restricted cash as the funds  
are not immediately available. During 2013, all pledges were 
removed and now there are no restricted cash balances. 
The Group’s net debt was $523 million (2012: $535 million 
(restated)). Net debt to total capital was 25.9% (2012: 21.7% 
(restated)). 
Cash flow 
Cash inflows from operations in 2013 were $199 million  
(2012: $368 million (restated)), a decrease primarily caused  
by lower coal prices. Interest paid was $118 million (2012:  
$99 million) reflecting additional withholding tax paid on the 
senior secured notes in the year. Tax paid was $149 million 
(2012: $214 million), and has reduced in the year due to  
reduced profits. 
In total, net cash used in operating activities was $74 million 
compared to cash used of $80 million in 2012. 
As noted above, restricted cash of $124 million was released 
from pledges during the year and became available as cash.  
We have also reclassified certain short term deposits as 
restricted cash due to the expected length of time before  
these funds can be accessed. These deposits are held to  
secure performance bonds required by customers and are  
in the ordinary course of business. 
Capital expenditure 
The Group’s capital expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment of $46 million (2012: $101 million (restated))  
related principally to PT Berau. At Lati there was expenditure  
on upgrading the crusher and port facilities, at Binungan  
on upgrading hauling facilities and at Sambarata on  
increasing coal crushing and stock piling capacities.  
There was also expenditure in relation to exploration and  
development activities. 
Planned capital projects 
Capital expenditure for the Group in 2014 is expected to  
be approximately $43 million. This includes $10 million  
for exploration and development and $7 million for  
land acquisitions.  
Key expenditures at Lati include a new barge loading conveyor 
at the Lati port to replace the existing conveyor, which is nearing 
the end of its life, and an alternative road from Tanjung Redeb 
directly to the northern area of Lati to reduce congestion.  
At Binungan key expenditures to enable an increase in 
production include a hauling bridge at Inaran, connecting coal 
from Binungan 7 to the Binungan coal processing plant (CPP),  
a new crusher at the Binungan CPP and diversion of a logging  
road at Binungan 7. PT Berau may enter into agreements  
with contractors, who may carry out the construction of some  
of these projects, and subsequently charge a rental fee to  
the business units for the use of the assets. Therefore, not  
all of these costs would be incurred by PT Berau as its own 
capital expenditure. 
Dividends 
No dividends were paid in the year.  26 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
RESERVES AND RESOURCES
Reserves and resources are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 Edition (the “JORC Code”), which represents current best practice for reporting reserves and 
resources. The JORC Code requires the use of reasonable assumptions, including the use of projected long term commodity prices, 
in calculating reserve estimates. 
Reserves and resources information in the tables below has been prepared by the Group, based on the JORC report compiled  
by Competent Persons (as defined by JORC). Each Competent Person has had relevant estimation experience and is a member  
of a recognised professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics. The reserves and resources at  
31 December 2013 have been calculated by the Group, based on the JORC report dated 31 December 2012 (the latest JORC report 
available as at that date), with actual production for the year deducted to arrive at the balances at 31 December 2013.  
Reserves and resources have increased significantly in the Binungan area as a result of additional drilling in this area. Lati has  
seen a reduction in reserves and resources due to changes in the mine plan as a result of more conservative pricing assumptions 
going forwards. 
Reserves 
The reserve figures in the following table represent the Life of Mine reserves on a 100% basis, which extend beyond existing licence 
periods (including CCoWs for coal operations). Metric units are used throughout. The figures used in the calculations are often 
more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated 
directly using the figures in these tables.

Resources 
The following table contains details of mineralisation that the Board believes has a reasonable prospect of being economically 
extracted in the future, some of which has not yet been classified as Proven or Probable Reserves. This material is defined as 
Mineral Resources under the JORC Code. Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information, with only 
preliminary consideration of the modifying factors (mining, economic, etc.). While in the judgement of the Competent Person there 
are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proven or Probable Reserves, there is  
no guarantee that this will occur, as the result depends on further technical and economic studies, and economic conditions in  
the future.  
As in the case of reserves, estimates are completed using or testing against ARM plc’s long term pricing and market forecasts. 
Resources include the coal reserves disclosed previously, i.e. resources are not additional to the coal reserves.

and understanding that is necessary for local decisions  
and practices to deliver international standards on a 
consistent basis. 
– Work in collaboration and partnership with government, 
contractors and communities to achieve common governance 
that reflects their common responsibilities and dependency on 
each other. 
– Exercise a “stewardship-based” decision model recognising 
that our activity at any asset is temporary and that the social 
and natural environments have to be sustained after mining 
has stopped. 
– Apply global governance that has, at its centre, adoption of 
local solutions that understand local needs and priorities.  
The following pages provide further detail on our progress  
and achievements during 2013. Following a summary of the 
governance structure and areas of focus, we have presented 
these under the headings of Safety, Community, Environment 
and Employees (including health). These are the key elements of 
our HSEC programme based on discussions with our internal 
and external stakeholders. 
 
 
 
HSEC GOVERNANCE  
STRUCTURE 
 
 
The intention is that the Company sets the overall 
direction and policy framework for HSEC matters, 
with implementation and day-to-day management of 
HSEC activities being the responsibility of the main 
operating company, PT Berau. 
 
The Board supervises the HSEC programme through the HSEC 
Committee, which met three times during 2013. The CEO has 
executive responsibility for HSEC together with the Company’s 
Chief Mining Officer and the President Director of PT Berau.  
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary is secretary 
to the HSEC Committee and assists the Committee in the 
discharge of its duties. 
The Committee believes that it has an appropriate level of 
technical knowledge and expertise to exercise effective 
governance over HSEC matters. Tony Redman, an experienced 
mining professional, was the Company’s technical advisor until 
31 December 2013 (“HSEC Advisor”) and attended HSEC 
Committee meetings throughout 2013. In addition, the members 
of the Committee have experience of working in Indonesia and 
managing relationships with local community stakeholders over 
a number of years. The appointment of Keith Downham as Chief 
Mining Officer in October 2013 also brings further experience of 
managing HSEC in international mining companies. 
Stakeholder engagement 
We recognise that stakeholder engagement is an essential  
part of responsible business conduct, and are committed to 
managing our business in a way that considers the perceptions 
of all stakeholders and seeks to build consensus between them. 
We engage with stakeholders through a number of means 
including, but not limited to: 
– The community development team responsible for 
maintaining scheduled engagement with 38 local villages, 
tribes and representatives of the local government. 
   29 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
– Regular dialogue with the workers union, of which 
approximately 69% of PT Berau employees are members. 
– Meeting with contractors to cover both operational and HSE 
matters, including monthly Safety Committee meetings. 
– The environmental and community impacts of the Annual 
Work Plan (“RKTTL”) and the Budget and Work Cost Plan 
(“RKAB”) with the Directorate General of Mineral and Coal, 
district and provincial governments. 
– Publication and distribution of the information on plans for 
increased production at Binungan, involving NGOs, local 
government, communities representatives, local universities 
and other relevant stakeholders.  
We will continue this engagement programme in 2014. This 
approach demonstrates our commitment to transparency and 
engaging with key people and organisations who are important 
to the Group. 
Priorities for 2013 
During 2013, the HSEC Committee determined the following 
priority areas which were considered as essential, in addition to 
ongoing HSEC management processes: 
– The delivery of basic safety training to all supervisors and 
section heads. A safety review performed in 2012 identified  
this population as most at risk. 
– The development and implementation of a commissioning 
policy to address risks of unsafe tools and equipment being 
used in operations. 
– The commencement of an external energy audit, and 
collection of data to meet new UK legislation with respect to 
greenhouse gas emissions reporting. 
– Continuing the work started in 2012 to move HSEC  
data reporting definitions and processes towards  
international standards. 
– Developing further the model for the Company’s oversight  
and monitoring of local operating company HSEC activities. 
In addition, we have continued to focus on community 
development including monitoring of resettlement activities, 
reviewing the governance structure of the Berau Foundations 
and the allocation of community development funds to projects. 
The Committee has received and reviewed reports on HSEC 
progress and performance from PT Berau management, and 
challenged these as appropriate. 
2014 Focus 
We will continue to embed the HSEC governance model at both a 
Group and operating company level during 2014, whilst ensuring 
progress in the core HSEC areas, including: 
– Maintaining the focus on safety through a safety audit 
conducted by an independent third party; 
– Continuing stakeholder engagement activities; and  
– Implementing recommendations from an energy audit which 
reported in February 2014.

SAFETY 
 
 
Headlines 
– No fatal events. 
– PT Berau received a “Silver Performance”  
award from the Indonesian Ministry of Energy  
and Mineral Resources, in recognition of safety 
management practices. The assessment criteria 
reflect both Indonesian regulations and the 
international safety standard OHSAS 18001. 
– Delivery of safety training under a new curriculum, 
and development of a “safety passport” system. 
– Creation of a commissioning policy to govern  
tools and equipment procedures, and inventories 
performed at all PT Berau operated workshops. 
 
Progress during 2013 
We recognise that good safety management is critical to the 
continuation and efficiency of our operations, in addition to the 
wellbeing of our employees. We are therefore pleased to report 
that there were no fatalities at our operations during 2013. 
During 2013 a revised safety training curriculum was finalised 
and approved. This includes a core basic safety training 
curriculum for all contractors, and additional modules for 
supervisors and section heads and those working in more 
technical or specialist roles. 
Training has been delivered at PT Berau’s own Samburakat 
training campus, and through parallel classes delivered  
by main mining contractors. The main focus has been on 
developing skills at the supervisor and section head level, with 
performance shown in the table below. We have also delivered 
basic safety training (“KMPD”) which is relevant to all staff and 
contractors, and will continue to deliver this during 2014.

In response to previous issues with unsafe tools and equipment, 
a commissioning policy has been approved during 2013 which 
sets a minimum standard for tools and equipment for both  
PT Berau and contractors. This has been applied to  
PT Berau operations, with inventories and remedial actions 
taken in all owned workshops, and is planned to be rolled out  
to contractors during 2014. 
Safety reporting has been aligned to international standards  
with the creation of a new set of reporting definitions which  
the PT Berau HSE team has shared with contractors. Further 
training and socialisation is planned with respect to these 
definitions during 2014. We continue to focus on improving the 
controls and processes used to gather safety data to ensure 
completeness of incident reporting. 
Contractor engagement with respect to safety management has 
continued, including monthly Safety Committee meetings which 
are attended by representatives of contractor and sub-contractor 
organisations and PT Berau HSE management. All reported 
incidents and near misses are investigated and reported on  
to ensure continuous improvement in operational safety 
management is achieved and that any corrective actions are 
taken as necessary. 
During 2014 safety training will continue to be a key focus for  
PT Berau, including the delivery of the curriculum modules  
for specialist roles, and the continuing implementation of a 
“safety passport” system to ensure that individuals have the 
appropriate training for a given role or task. The tools and 
equipment commissioning procedure will be rolled out to 
contractors, and a team of inspectors has been trained to  
inspect the inventories and actions taken by contractors. 
   31 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Safety performance data 
We recognise the challenge of collecting complete safety 
performance data from a contractor operated business,  
and continue to work with our contractors to implement  
the processes and controls needed to ensure accurate and 
consistent information from across our operations. This is  
an ongoing journey for the Group and work has continued 
throughout the year, but it will take time for underlying 
contractor practices to adjust to meet these additional 
requirements. Any changes made that have a significant  
effect on the reporting of current year data will be fully  
explained to enable the comparability of safety data. 
As noted in previous reports, there are differences between  
the definitions used by the Indonesian government for safety 
reporting and those that are commonly used by international 
mining companies. For example, Indonesian reporting only 
considers a fatality which occurs within 24 hours of the original 
incident and only requires reporting from operational mining 
areas, which excludes any shipping operations. 
During 2013, PT Berau has focused on ensuring that the data 
gathered from contractors and its own operations can be used  
to meet both local Indonesian government requirements and 
international reporting standards. As a result: 
– A new set of definitions have been issued and presented to 
contractors, and internal reporting templates have been 
amended to reflect this change. 
– Additional controls have been designed to ensure the capture 
of lost time incident reporting, including communication with 
local medical providers and hospitals. 
– Working hours information is now collected from all 
contractors across the business under consistent definitions. 
– The PT Berau HSEC directorate has been reorganised to 
include a role that is dedicated to reviewing data and reporting. 
During 2013, PT Berau recorded no fatalities (2012: none) and 
one lost time incident (2012: six), which resulted in a lost time 
incident frequency rate of 0.02 (2012: 0.15). The all injury 
frequency rate was 1.57 (2012: 2.34). This data includes PT Berau 
employees and contractors. Our frequency rates are expressed 
per 1,000,000 working hours. This information is largely provided 
by our contractors. 
In total, the number of near miss incidents (including property 
damage and fire cases) decreased by 17 incidents from 652 
(2012) to 635 (2013). This in the context of over 13,000 staff  
and contractors working across the mining operation.  
Analysis shows that the three main locations of accidents and 
near misses are workshop (20%), access road accidents (19%) 
and exploration (16%). The results of the investigation of road 
incidents show that the main causes are fatigue, speeding and 
taking short-cuts. 
During 2014, our focus will be to improve safety performance  
by studying the effectiveness of existing safety programmes, 
including inspections, patrols, PT Berau manager-led safety 
talks, observation programmes and the section head capability 
programme that are currently running.  
 
 
COMMUNITY

– Provision of equipment and delivery of a  
workshop to support local farmers in improving 
cocoa production. 
– Providing financial support and equipment to  
over 900 local households so that they can  
access electricity. 
– Supporting and promoting a local community 
cooperative with over 500 members, including 
skills training and support in finding employment.
– Construction of housing at resettlement  
areas completed. 
– Berau Training Centre inaugurated by the 
Governor of East Kalimantan on 15 September 
2013, and commencement of training sessions. 
– Improvement in governance of the foundation 
which manages PT Berau community funds 
through a change in management. 
 
The Group is committed to contributing to local and regional 
development to benefit the communities affected by its 
operations. PT Berau continues its contribution through 
employment, provision of infrastructure and assets for  
public use as well as community development projects.  
The implementation of the Group Practice Guide is underway 
through creation of local standard operating procedures.  
Community development 
Consistent with prior years, the community development 
investment remains focused in the areas of education, health 
and nutrition, environment and culture, and socio-economic 
contribution. Due to a change in regulation regarding corporate 
social responsibility funds, the 2013 investment was planned 
based on a year’s plan rather than a five-year plan that PT Berau 
has previously performed voluntarily.  32 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT & COMMUNITIES REPORT 
CONTINUED
The majority of PT Berau’s community contribution has been 
delivered through the Yayasan Dharma Bhakti Berau Coal 
Foundation (“YDBBC”) managed by employees of PT Berau.  
The YDBBC receives small levels of contribution from other 
parties but approximately 98% ($1.6m) was contributed by  
PT Berau in 2013 (98% in 2012).  
As reported in 2012, PT Berau was undergoing discussions to 
consider measurement of inputs and outputs. In 2013, data was 
gathered for a socio-economic outcome based measurement 
model in order to track its contribution footprint to the local 
community in a holistic manner. The model used is illustrated  
as follows: 
What we invest What we do Who/what/how much 
changes as a result of 
our activities 
Who we  
reach 
 How can that be 
monetised (including 
company benefits) 
 
This model is adopted by international mining companies and is 
regarded as industry best practice. Similar to other companies 
adopting this model, PT Berau has been able to gather data on 
inputs and outputs. Outcome measurement remains as the next 
step for further development. We believe that not only can this 
model demonstrate our contribution to local stakeholders, it can 
also help us make better decisions through understanding our 
impacts better and how to deal with dilemmas that exist between 
competing activities. 
This model has been piloted across three major community 
development projects. The 2013 progress on the three pilot 
projects are as follows: 
 
COCOA AGRIBUSINESS 
This project was set up in 2009 to revitalise cocoa cultivation around five villages within the mining area. This initiative is 
intended to assist existing farmers to improve cocoa production in the region. In 2013, this project had 145 members and  
covers an area of 171 hectares. 
 2013 Input 2013 Output
 
– Engaged consultants from Indonesia Cocoa and Coffee 
Research Centre to share expertise. 
– Provided four PT Berau Local Community Organizers and 
two officers across the five villages. 
– Provided 14 fermentation boxes for each of the five villages.
– Created demonstration garden for sharing of  
grafting techniques. 
– Consultants conducted one workshop to coach members 
on graft techniques and share good practices. 
– Cultivation schedules maintained and data collection 
commenced for cocoa production volumes and grafting 
technique completion at demo plots. 
– 40 farmers used the fermentation boxes to ferment cocoa 
beans. By fermenting cocoa beans, the farmers benefitted 
from better sale prices. 
– Knowledge sharing sessions were performed at  
six demonstration garden locations in five villages.  
145 farmers attended these sessions. 
 
The outcomes of the cocoa agribusiness project are: 
– Successful performance of grafting techniques by participating communities to improve quality of harvest. 
– Annual cocoa production increase from 400kg per hectare to national average production of 1,200kg per hectare.

VILLAGE ELECTRIFICATION 
At the start of PT Berau’s operating activities, most of the villages within the mining area did not have access to electricity.  
In 1999, PT Berau established an electrification project to bring electricity access to villages within the mining area. Surveys 
were conducted at villages within the mining area to determine population and number of households in order to plan for 
electrification needs. This survey data is updated on a regular basis. 
Initially, PT Berau’s village electrification project involved provision of generators and fuel assistance. From 2009, PT Berau 
contributed to the installation charges for connection to the national grid and, until the end of 2013, 1,203 households had been 
connected to generators and 660 households had been connected to the national grid. 
 2013 Input 2013 Output
 
– Provision of generators and fuel assistance to  
620 households across three villages. 
– Provided installation charges of US$151k for  
351 households across one village. 
– 620 households received electricity from 8.00pm to  
8.00am daily.  
– 351 households successfully connected to the national  
grid with 24 hours’ electricity supply (connection made,  
but awaiting final permit from energy supplier to operate). 
 
The outcomes of the village electrification project are as follows: 
– Enables religious classes and community activities at mosques and churches to be conducted. 
– Rise in local cottage industries. 
– Improved facilities at local community health centres as electrical appliances can be installed. 
– Water treatment plants made available to provide clean water to households. 
 
 
LOCAL COMMUNITY COOPERATIVE 
In 2010, PT Berau assisted local community members at Tasuk Village to establish Koperasi Bintang Harapan (“Koperasi”),  
a local cooperative which specialises in rental of transportation vehicles and providing non-skilled labour supply to sub-
contracted services at the mining area, such as waste management, mining activities and infrastructure projects. At the end of 
2013, Koperasi had 553 members. Outlined below are some of the key outputs that certain members have achieved in the year.
 2013 Input 2013 Output
 
– Promoted Koperasi to major mining contractors and 
infrastructure projects. 
– Promoted the Koperasi's transportation rental business. 
– Provided financial assistance to Koperasi management to 
enhance management skills. 
– 75 Koperasi members employed as non-skilled labour 
supply for mining activities for PT Berau and four mining 
contractors. Five to 10 members have stable employment 
on infrastructure projects, whilst a number of others are 
farmers or shop owners. 
– Income generated from transportation rental business is  
in line with previous year. 
– Three people have received a weeks’ worth of training  
each at the Samburakat Campus PT Berau Coal. This 
covered HSE, basic safety training and contractor safety 
management system compliance. 
 
The outcomes of the cooperative project are as follows: 
– Stable income for Koperasi members and lower unemployment rate. 
– Koperasi generates profits for distribution to its members. 
– Increased quality of Koperasi management to administer its business activities.

2. This includes only those donations made through the External Relations team  
for community purposes and excludes donations where the primary objective  
is commercial or self-promoting. It includes donations made on an entirely 
voluntary basis, and some which are expected to be paid by PT Berau to the 
government where PT Berau can determine the amounts. The majority of 
donations made are voluntary payments. 
Community development spending continues to support  
PT Berau’s “Four Pillars” programmes: Education ($0.6m), 
Health and Nutrition ($0.2m), Environment and Culture ($0.1m) 
and Socio Economic Contribution ($0.7m). 
Despite a long history of strong relations and ongoing 
engagement and investment there are continuing and increasing 
pressures for higher levels of contribution. It is not possible  
for PT Berau to meet all demands, and in particular those  
which are in addition to the agreed community development 
project commitments. 
In August 2013, PT Berau and the Berau local government 
committed to a Memorandum of Understanding. This will  
impact the way that funds are administered to community 
organisations and the level of funding that is mandatory under 
local legislation. PT Berau has taken proactive steps to discuss 
the nature and level of funding with the local government, and 
how it will be disbursed across community development projects 
and donations. 
Resettlement 
There are occasions where our planned mining activities mean 
that communities need to be relocated. During 2013, we 
continued to work with three specific resettlement areas. We 
know that resettlement has a significant impact on communities, 
and we communicate with all stakeholders throughout the 
resettlement process to ensure that their needs and 
expectations are heard, understood and met, where possible.  
The construction of houses was completed in July 2013 and 
other ancillary infrastructure is expected to be completed  
in July 2014. Following the completion of the houses, the 
resettlement of the local villagers is 100% complete at the 
Sambakungan neighbourhood and 95% complete at the two 
neighbourhoods in Meraang. Full resettlement is expected  
in 2014. 
Engagement and consultation continued in 2013 to update the 
households on progress and to manage concerns that have been 
raised. The local village heads and village police are generally 
present at these sessions.  
The resettlement has also brought the villagers closer to schools 
and community health centres (Puskesmas). PT Berau has also 
considered and will implement post-resettlement support  
in the four areas of existing community development projects. 
  
 
 
ENVIRONMENT
 
 
Headlines 
– PT Berau received a “Silver Performance”  
award from the Indonesian Ministry of Energy  
and Mineral Resources, in recognition of 
environmental management practices. The 
assessment criteria reflect both Indonesian 
regulations and the international environmental 
standard ISO 14001. 
– In the Indonesian PROPER environmental 
management assessment, both Binungan and  
Lati mines were recognised as exceeding the 
requirements of Indonesian regulations. 
– Continued focus on energy management and 
efficiency, including the commission of an energy 
audit to identify potential fuel savings within  
PT Berau operations. 
– Collection and calculation of greenhouse gas 
emissions data for the first time. 
– One reportable spill event that has been fully 
investigated (2012: Two). 
 
As reflected in our Code of Conduct and HSEC Statement of 
Intent, environmental stewardship is an important objective for 
the Group. Mining has the potential to cause lasting damage to 
the local environment, and we recognise this sensitivity when 
planning and executing our mining operations. We are compliant 
with all relevant environmental legislation, and PT Berau has 
maintained ISO 14001 certification for all operations. 
Energy management 
During 2012, PT Berau created an Energy Management team 
that brings together representatives from all departments that 
influence energy use. During 2013, this team has focused on 
developing initiatives to realise fuel savings and there has been 
regular reporting to management on fuel consumed by both  
PT Berau and contractors. Fuel consumption is a key metric 
against which contractors are measured, and is discussed as 
part of regular performance assessments.  35 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Table of PT Berau and contractors’ fuel consumption 
Indicator Unit 2013 2012
Fuel use  Million litres 280.28 287.09
Fuel use intensity  Litres/tonne coal 11.94 13.66
In addition, during 2013 an independent provider was 
commissioned to perform a preliminary audit of energy 
consumption across mining operations. The findings have been 
presented in February 2014 and will be used as a basis for 
further energy efficiency programmes during the year. 
Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions 
One important element of our approach to environmental 
management is measuring and managing our GHG emissions. 
As a UK listed company, the Group is required to report its GHG 
emissions under the recent amendments to the Companies Act. 
For the first time during 2013, we have gathered data on the  
GHG emissions of PT Berau. These are shown in the table below. 
We have prepared these in line with the GHG Protocol developed 
by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and 
additional guidance issued by the UK Government Department 
for Energy, Food and Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”). 
We have applied an operational control approach in presenting 
our emissions data, and have reported on all material emission 
sources within scope 1 (combustion of fuel and operation of 
facilities), scope 2 (purchased electricity) and scope 3 (includes 
indirect emissions from transportation devices and LPG used by 
contractors but excluding business travel) for PT Berau Coal. We 
have not included any information in respect of emissions from 
other companies within the Group, including those from other 
operating subsidiaries of PT Berau Coal Energy TbK. We will 
collect this data during the year and include it in  
our 2014 Annual Report. During 2014 we will also collect data  
on business travel for PT Berau. 
For PT Berau, since contractors perform all coal mining and 
support activities, we have considered emissions from contractor 
fuel use to be a scope 1 emission source. We have not included 
emissions due to electricity use at Asia Resource Minerals’ 
London office since these are considered to be immaterial for 
the overall Group. 
The two largest emission sources are fuel use and mine gas 
release. As reported above, there is a focus at PT Berau on 
reducing fuel consumption and realising efficiencies and we 
expect this to improve our GHG intensity in future periods.  
The release of mine gas is an unavoidable aspect of our 
operations and, whilst currently difficult to reduce, we will 
remain open to options to manage or divert these emissions.

Total PT Berau GHG emissions  1,299,736 
GHG emissions intensity  
(tonnes CO2e/tonnes coal)  0.06
Land management and biodiversity 
Land disturbance and revegetation for mining operations is 
controlled through the environmental permit conditions, which 
require a fund to be set aside (the “Land Reclamation Bond”) that 
can be recovered when revegetation is approved as complete by 
the government. In 2013, actual land disturbed is lower than plan 
(57%), while the amount revegetated is above plan (156%). Land 
disturbed is behind due to production plan changes reflecting 
low coal prices, which have meant three planned disposal areas 
at the Lati mine were not required. In addition, some land that 
was previously planned to be used has been released and 
reclaimed by the local community. Revegetation has exceeded 
plan due to the early completion of some blocks at the 
Samabarata and Binungan mines which have been planted 
during the year.  
Under international definitions, land is considered to be 
“rehabilitated” at the point at which it is certified to meet 
“agreed end use”. We consider this to be the point at which land  
is returned to the Indonesian government. As at 31 December 
2013, and in line with the life of mine plan, no land is yet 
considered to be “rehabilitated”, but we will report this in the 
future when our operations reach this level of maturity.

Environmental incidents 
We focus on seeking to minimise our environmental impact. 
Regrettably the Group had one reportable spill event during 
2013. A leak within a diesel generator set at the Binungan mine 
caused approximately 2,800 litres of diesel oil to leak into local 
trenches and creeks. Corrective action was taken to ensure  
that oil did not leak into the main river, and 1,400 litres of the  
spill were recovered. The incident was reported to the local 
environment body and actions taken as necessary to ensure  
this does not happen again. These included revision of generator 
work instructions and additional guidance given to Plant 
Management and Maintenance teams. Laboratory testing and 
water monitoring has not shown any lasting impact to the local 
ecosystem and no sanctions have been imposed on PT Berau.

Employee relations 
The development and wellbeing of our people is important to 
ensure we develop the capacity we need to meet our business 
goals and play a key role in the local communities where we  
have operations. 
At the end of 2013, the Group had more than 1,300 employees 
and approximately 12,000 contractor and sub-contractor 
personnel. Contractor organisations work across coal hauling 
and processing, maintenance, shipping and logistics as well as 
catering and wider service support. Through 2013, PT Berau 
maintained its established employment policies recognising 
local legal requirements.  
The Company’s Code of Conduct continues to form the 
foundation for management of our workforce as well as setting 
the expectation of individual responsibility. PT Berau has adopted 
this through a local “Code of Ethics” and a whistleblowing 
helpline (the “Berau Ethics Alert Line”) and policy which have 
been rolled out to enable employees to anonymously raise  
any issues. 
Skill shortages and loss of staff to competitors in the mining 
industry is a key issue for all mining companies in Indonesia. 
Total participants of the first batch of GIP participants are 13,  
and at the end of the programme eight participants are to be 
hired as permanent employees. GIP batch two is still ongoing 
and will end in July 2014.  
The Group recognises the right of its employees to freely 
associate and join labour unions and maintains active 
relationships with these organisations. In PT Berau there  
is a single union of which 69% of employees are members.  
There have been no cases of labour strikes or employee 
disruption occurring in 2013 in the Group.  
Human rights 
The Group recognises the importance of human rights and is 
committed to respecting human rights throughout its operations. 
We do not currently have an overarching policy commitment in 
respect of human rights, however a number of existing policies 
and practices demonstrate our approach:  
– Communities – strong relations and ongoing engagement with 
local communities are at the core of PT Berau’s operating 
model. We continue to provide support, both financial and  
non-financial, to our local communities. Particular focus is 
given to ensuring that our resettlement practices are 
compliant with local legislative requirements. 
– Employees – the Company’s Code of Conduct is adopted 
through the PT Berau Code of Ethics and a local 
whistleblowing policy is in place. The whistleblowing line, 
known as the “Berau Coal Ethics Alert Line”, is run by an 
independent external provider in the US, and reports to the 
Audit Committee through Internal Audit. Employees are free to 
join the labour union. Safety at work is a key focus of the HSEC 
programme, as are developing our training programmes and 
occupational health management processes.  
– Contractors – since contractors are responsible for  
conducting all mining activities, we recognise that ensuring 
fair employment practices within our selected contractor  
and sub-contractor partners is essential.  
   37 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Employee diversity 
The mining sector faces an issue with respect to very low  
female participation at all levels of business, especially at  
senior management and board level within companies.  
We are fully aware of these issues and are committed to 
recruitment and selection processes that consider all candidates 
on the basis of merit and skills, without discrimination or bias. 
The Nomination Committee considers the diversity of the  
Board on behalf of the Directors. Further information on the 
activities of the Nomination Committee can be found on pages  
55 to 56. During 2013, diversity matters have also been discussed 
by the HSEC Committee. 
As at 31 December 2013 all eight Directors of the Company were 
male, and 15 members (94%) of senior management were male 
and one female (6%). Senior management has been defined  
as key management personnel of Asia Resource Minerals plc, 
the Directors of Vallar Investments UK Limited and the Board  
of Commissioners and Board of Directors of PT Berau Coal 
Energy TbK. Across the total employee workforce, excluding 
contractors, 1,259 (93%) were male and 93 (7%) were female. 
Health and wellbeing 
The Group recognises a responsibility for the health of its 
employees, and the health of the communities which are affected 
by our activities. 
During 2013, a number of procedures in relation to health were 
approved and adopted, including: 
– Occupational health performance reporting. 
– Health risk assessment. 
– Fit to work. 
– Medical check-up. 
– HIV/Aids. 
– Alcohol and drugs. 
– Occupational hygiene. 
The requirement is for all staff and contractors to receive a 
medical check-up at least annually, and for the clinics to provide 
the results of such assessments to PT Berau for monitoring.  
No occupational health cases have been identified during 2013. 
Further work is needed going forward to socialise the new 
policies with contractors, and to ensure consistent and useful 
reporting from all contractors and health clinics.  38 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Risk management 
The Board continues to identify, evaluate and manage the risks which the Group and the wider sector face. The risks to which the 
Group is exposed at any point in time in pursuing its strategic objectives cover a wide range of factors: competition, legislative, 
fiscal, political, financial, economic, social, reputational and operational. Each could impact EBITDA, operating profits, net assets 
and liquidity. 
The main risks currently facing the Group have been assessed against a backdrop of robust competition from local and foreign 
producers and a weakening in the Newcastle benchmark of 11% between 2012 and 2013. This has prompted a major cost 
optimisation programme to reduce operating costs wherever possible and management has looked at ways of reducing capital 
expenditure to minimise the impact on earnings and cash flows. Similar actions are being taken across the sector in Indonesia. 
Accordingly, the principal risks and uncertainties which are specific to the Company at this point in time, together with the actions 
that management is taking to mitigate each, are set out below. 
The Board continues to pay particular attention to the effectiveness of management’s mitigating actions and progress is monitored 
in each area. 
Risk  Context Impact Mitigation  
Coal Contract of Works (CCoW) 
Failure to secure essential 
extension to the Group’s 
CCoW which expires  
in 2025. 
The Group’s future after 2025  
is dependent on securing 
extensions to its CCoW in order 
to continue to operate. To date, 
no first generation CCoW has 
reached its initial expiry and 
therefore there is no precedent 
for extension although this is 
envisaged in the terms of the 
CCoW. Also recent legislation 
has indicated that CCoWs  
may be extended in the form  
of an IUP issued by the  
central government. 
Without extension of the 
CCoW by the Indonesian 
government mining 
operations would be 
forced to stop. 
Whilst the Group’s existing 
CCoW is not impacted by new 
regulation, local management 
remains engaged with the 
Indonesian government 
regarding extensions to the 
CCoW, for example with regard 
to the size of the mining areas. 
Limitation of production 
tonnage. 
The Group submits annual cost 
and production budgets to the 
Government of Indonesia for 
approval. The government has 
the discretion to accept or 
reject the Group's budget. 
Annual volumes could be 
impacted by government 
policy which may also 
limit the Group's growth 
aspirations. 
The Group continues to work 
with government agencies in 
Indonesia to ensure it is able  
to mine optimal tonnages. In 
the event that the Indonesian 
government caps production 
volumes, the Group will 
continue to mitigate the impact 
through its ongoing cost 
optimisation programme. 
   39 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Risk  Context Impact Mitigation  
Coal Price 
Sustained weakness in  
coal prices. 
The demand and price for  
coal in Indonesia is largely 
determined by global supply 
and demand and, in turn, by the 
strength of the global economic 
environment and its impact  
on Asia, particularly China.  
The thermal coal market 
remains oversupplied, which 
has continued to put downward 
pressure on global coal prices. 
The Group continues to be 
positive about long term 
demand for thermal coal. 
A sustained weakness in 
coal prices could result  
in material and adverse 
movement in the Group’s 
operating results, asset 
values, reserves and 
resources, revenues and 
cash flows. It may also 
compromise the ability  
of the Group to deliver 
growth in future years  
as expansion projects 
may not be viable at  
lower prices. 
The Group is continuing with its 
aggressive cost optimisation 
programme which it started in 
2013 to offset weakening coal 
prices. The Group's Life of  
Mine planning processes, which 
have been under the control of 
the Chief Mining Officer since 
his appointment in October 
2013, consider coal price 
forecasts, operating costs, 
market demand and  
production capacity and  
makes adjustments as far as 
possible to optimise returns. 
Coal Mining Operations 
Failure to reduce 
operational costs which  
is necessary to meet  
the Group’s objective  
of increasing  
shareholder value. 
A key element of the Group’s 
strategy is to optimise its 
operational costs of which  
fuel represents a significant 
percentage. This exposes the 
Group to increased fuel prices 
and policy changes which 
mandate the use of biofuels. 
The Group uses approximately 
270 million litres of diesel fuel 
per annum. 
The Group will continue  
to cut costs further to 
maintain shareholder 
value. Its efforts could  
be partially offset by  
any increase in diesel 
prices or change in 
Indonesian government 
policy relating to the 
composition of diesel fuel. 
As part of the programme it 
launched in 2013 to reduce 
costs the Group has sought 
improvements through: 
increased driver training, 
trialling use of fuel additives, 
tendering of new fuel contracts 
and raising awareness of the 
impact on fuel usage when 
planning mining operations.  
As a result, it has achieved 
important gains in certain 
areas, e.g. in 2013 the Group 
reduced its annual fuel usage 
by 6.8 million litres and is 
targeting a further reduction of 
12 million litres (4%) in 2014. 
Failure to obtain, or 
experiencing delays in 
obtaining, approval for 
permits because of the 
Group's failure to achieve 
necessary environmental 
standards could prevent 
access to land needed  
for mining. 
Environmental protection is an 
increasing area of focus for the 
Indonesian government and  
is subject to growing global 
scrutiny. The Group's planned 
mining areas cover a number  
of forest areas and before 
mining can take place a forest 
use permit (Pinjaam Pakai) 
must be obtained from the 
Minister of Forestry. 
Enforced changes to  
the Group's planned 
mining sequence with 
consequential financial 
and reputational 
consequences. 
The Group has a dedicated 
environmental team which 
monitors compliance and  
since 2012 has been following  
a programme to enhance 
environmental management. 
Applications for forest use are 
submitted well ahead of mining 
activities and the Group works 
with regulators to enable  
timely processing. 
   40 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
Risk  Context Impact Mitigation  
Coal Mining Operations continued 
Failure to reach  
agreement with the 
landowners on whose  
land the Group wishes  
to mine could interrupt  
its mining operation. 
Whilst the Group's CCOW 
grants coal extraction rights, 
mining operations can only be 
carried out with the permission 
of individual land owners. 
If the Group is not able to 
gain access to proposed 
mining areas the mine 
plan may need to be 
adjusted or changed. 
The Group has identified land 
for which it needs to acquire 
access to carry out mining 
operations. On-going 
negotiations are held with 
landowners in advance to gain 
access to these areas when 
required for mining. 
Errors or miscalculations  
in the Group's geological 
model resulting in the 
discovery of less coal  
than expected from 
individual pits. 
The Group uses detailed 
exploration drilling to define  
the extent and quality of its coal 
reserves. Exploration is carried 
out in advance of mining to the 
JORC Code. (The JORC Code is 
a professional code of practice 
that sets minimum standards 
for public reporting of minerals 
exploration results, mineral 
resources and ore reserves). 
Any deviation is likely to 
only occur in individual 
pits and limited in its 
impact given that there 
are between 10 and 12 
pits operating at any  
one time. 
On-going drilling, coal sampling 
and geological assessment is 
carried out on a regular basis  
to ensure the accuracy of the 
geological model. 
Financial 
Failure to meet debt  
service obligations from 
operating cash flows. 
The Group carries significant 
debt, the interest on which it 
services through operating cash 
flows. Additionally, the Group 
relies on operating cash flows 
to fund on-going capital and 
exploration programmes. 
Operating cash flow 
depends on meeting 
production, pricing and 
operating cost targets. 
Failure to meet such 
targets could affect the 
Group's ability to fund its 
on-going programmes 
and ultimately to not 
being able to meet debt-
service obligations. 
The Group has significant  
cash reserves to meet short 
and medium term liquidity 
requirements. Nevertheless,  
it performs regular cash flow 
forecasting based on the latest 
economic and operating 
assumptions. Such forecasts 
are reviewed regularly by 
senior management. 
A number of items are 
under discussion with the 
Indonesian tax authorities 
which could give rise to 
additional tax assessments, 
interest and penalties. 
Local management is in 
dialogue with the tax  
authorities regarding prior 
period tax returns going back  
to 2005. The tax authorities 
have enquired as to the 
appropriateness of certain 
deductions made to income  
in arriving at taxable profit. 
In the event that a 
number of these current 
discussions with the tax 
authorities result in a 
negative ruling this  
would result in  
significant cash out flow 
from the business. 
Local management has sought 
the assistance of professional 
tax advisors to support its 
position in ongoing discussions 
with the tax authorities. 
Management has considered 
the risk to the business  
and believes the financial 
statements adequately  
reflect the risk. 
   41 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Risk  Context Impact Mitigation  
Political Environment in Indonesia 
The Group’s operations  
may be affected by political 
and legal developments in 
Indonesia, particularly 
following elections in  
2014. Failure to maintain 
effective relationships  
with local government and 
community leaders under 
the Government’s strategy 
of regional autonomy  
could lead to disruption  
in mining operations. 
The Group has no control over 
political and legal changes  
but recognises that certain of 
its licences and permits are 
dependent on its relationships 
with local government. Its 
ability to mine freely to meet 
production targets can only be 
accomplished with the support 
of local government and 
through the Group’s community 
development programmes 
which include education, health 
and nutrition, environment and 
cultural preservation. 
Potential impacts include 
expropriation of assets, 
further imposition of 
royalties or taxation 
targeted at mining 
companies, licences  
not being renewed  
and requirements  
for local ownership  
or beneficiation.  
A breakdown in 
relationships can also 
result in civil unrest and 
the termination of mining 
permits and leases. 
The Group maintains a dialogue 
with local government, and 
responds to developments 
through annual mine planning 
activities. This dialogue is 
coordinated through local 
management. In addition,  
the Group maintains a full 
community development 
programme, working closely 
with local government to  
meet the needs of its 
communities and this 
programme provides action  
to mitigate the environmental 
impact on the local residents. 
Management 
Inability to recruit,  
develop or retain the  
senior management  
skills required to provide 
effective oversight of the 
Group’s operations. 
The Group has sought to 
upgrade its management 
during 2013 across a number  
of functions but faces difficulty 
because of certain skills 
shortages in Indonesia,  
for example, qualified 
professionals in the finance and 
legal areas. This shortage leads 
to increased competition for 
skilled management resources. 
Recruitment and retention can 
be made more challenging 
given the remote location of the 
Group’s mining operations and 
the damage to its reputation 
being perceived in some 
quarters in the light of past 
governance problems. 
Lack of management 
bandwidth can result  
in increased costs, 
interruptions to existing 
operations and delays  
in new projects. It also 
raises challenges to 
management’s oversight 
of its operations. 
Local management has 
arrangements in place to 
manage recruitment and 
retention and to appraise and 
reward performance, and  
these processes continue to 
operate effectively. Where gaps 
have arisen in certain areas, 
management has found ways to 
fill these through outsourcing, 
interim management hires and 
use of experienced consultants 
from reputable firms, e.g. “Big 
Four” accounting firms and 
international legal practices.

Samin Tan was the Chairman of the Board in 2013. He stood 
down as Chairman on 27 March 2014 when Chris Walton 
became Chairman of the Board. When Samin Tan was 
appointed as Chairman of the Board he was not independent 
within the criteria of the Code as he was nominated as a 
Director of the Company by the Bakrie Group under the Bakrie 
Relationship Agreement (as defined and described on page 80). 
A list of the Directors who were on the Board in 2013, their 
Committee memberships and attendances, and the changes  
in Board membership are set out on page 48. 
The Board and its Committees 
Certain aspects of the Board’s responsibilities have been 
delegated to the following permanent committees 
(“Committees”) and the terms of reference of such Committees 
are available at www.asiarmplc.com: the Audit Committee; the 
Remuneration Committee; the Nomination Committee; the 
Conflicts Committee; and the Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community (“HSEC”) Committee. During 2013, membership of 
all the Committees comprised only INEDs, and in the case of the 
HSEC Committee, an independent technical advisor. The terms 
of reference of these Committees were reviewed in 2013. 
The Board and its Committees have regular scheduled 
meetings and hold additional meetings as and when necessary. 
During 2013, the Board held five scheduled meetings and  
11 additional meetings. Directors are expected, where possible, 
to attend all Board meetings, relevant Committee meetings,  
the annual general meeting and any general meeting of the 
Company (“General Meeting”). The core activities of the Board 
and its Committees are planned on an annual basis, with an 
annual schedule of agenda items and the maintenance and 
follow-up of a list of matters arising from each meeting.  
The INEDs meet without the Executive Directors and the non-
independent Non-Executive Directors at the end of scheduled 
Board meetings and at other times when appropriate. 
Where appropriate, the Board delegates aspects of its 
responsibilities to other committees. As announced on  
17 October 2012, the Board delegated to the INEDs the 
responsibility for reviewing the offer received from the Bakrie 
Group and in 2013 the Board formally established a committee 
(the “Independent Committee”) comprising all the INEDs  
with the full powers of the Board to evaluate and determine  
all matters in connection with the Separation Transaction.  
In early 2013, the Board also established a litigation committee 
(the “Litigation Committee”), comprising Graham Holdaway 
(Chairman), Amir Sambodo, Nick von Schirnding and Sir 
Richard Gozney to review all potential claims relating to the 
matters arising out of the Macfarlanes Investigation (as 
described on page 46). The remit of the Litigation Committee 
was extended during 2013 to include the review of potential

claims and dealings with regulators arising out of the extensive 
review of the financial position at PT Berau. In December  
2013 Sir Richard Gozney became Chairman of the Litigation 
Committee replacing Graham Holdaway who remained on  
the Committee. 
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Board and to each of its Committees other  
than the Litigation Committee where Macfarlanes LLP acts  
as secretary. The appointment or removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole. 
Roles and responsibilities 
The roles of the Chairman, the SID and the CEO are  
separate and their responsibilities are set out in writing  
(the “Responsibilities Statement”), approved by the Board  
and available at www.asiarmplc.com.  
Chris Walton is the Chairman and is responsible for the 
leadership and effective running of the Board. 
Nick Salmon is the SID and his role and responsibilities as SID 
are also set out in the Responsibilities Statement. As well as 
making himself available to shareholders whose concerns  
have not been satisfied through the normal channels, he chairs 
the Nomination Committee when it considers succession  
to the role of Chairman of the Board and meets with the  
Non-Executive Directors at least once a year to appraise  
the Chairman’s performance. 
Nick von Schirnding is the CEO and is responsible for the 
running of the Group’s business within the authorities  
delegated by the Board and, to assist the CEO, an executive 
committee has been established with formal terms of reference 
(“Executive Committee”). The Executive Committee comprises 
the Company’s senior executives and such other executives as  
the CEO may appoint to serve as a member of the Executive 
Committee. It is chaired by Nick Von Schirnding and comprises 
the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Paul Fenby; the Chief Mining 
Officer (“CMO”), Keith Downham; the President Director of  
PT Berau, Eko Budianto; and the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, Paul Vickers. The Group Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk, Keith Lawler, is also invited to attend all 
meetings of the Executive Committee in order that matters of 
internal control and risk can be reviewed and acted upon on a 
timely basis. 
Focus in 2013 
During the year under review the Board has been focused  
on addressing the challenges it has faced as result of non-
compliance with certain of its policies and lack of disclosure  
by former PT Berau management, and made a priority of 
enhancing the control environment to better safeguard the 
Company’s assets. The Board has taken actions throughout  
the year to address these including the following:  
New executive leadership 
On 31 December 2012 Nick von Schirnding, who is not affiliated 
to any founders or major shareholders, became CEO and, on  
28 January 2013, the Board announced the removal of former 
directors of PT Berau which was confirmed at the shareholders 
meeting of PT Berau held on 7 March 2013. 
Conclusion of Macfarlanes Investigation  
On 22 January 2013, the Company announced that the 
independent investigation commissioned by the INEDs and 
conducted by Macfarlanes LLP (the “Macfarlanes investigation”,  
which was reported in the 2012 Annual Report) had been 
completed and, following the conclusion of this investigation, 
the Board established the Litigation Committee to review all 
potential claims relating to the matters arising out of the 
Macfarlanes Investigation. 
Extensive review of PT Berau and the enhancement of controls  
Whilst the Board had designed an appropriate governance 
framework and system of internal control and worked to have 
these adopted across the Group, as part of its ongoing review  
of internal control effectiveness it became evident that not all  
of the Group policies had been fully complied with. In particular, 
there were concerns about non-compliance with delegated 
authorities, matters reserved for the Board and failure to fully 
disclose related party transactions. The Board, through the 
Audit Committee, undertook a number of internal reviews  
early in 2013 which culminated in an extensive review of the 
financial position at PT Berau following the replacement of 
former management at PT Berau in March 2013.  
As a result of the ongoing extensive review of the financial 
position at PT Berau, on 22 April 2013 the Company announced 
that it would not be able to publish audited financial statements 
for the year ending 31 December 2012 before the end of April 
2013 (the latest time permissible under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules) and that it had requested a temporary 
suspension of trading in its voting ordinary shares until the 
publication of the Company’s results for 2012. The Board was 
unanimous in its view that this was the right approach to ensure 
a reliable set of accounts as a basis for restoring investor 
confidence in the Company. 
On 31 May 2013, the Company published its audited financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2012. In addition,  
it announced that it had completed the extensive review of the 
financial position at PT Berau which had uncovered evidence of 
payments made in 2011 and 2012 to the value of approximately 
US$201 million that could not be substantiated as having a clear 
business purpose. A further US$6 million was uncovered in 
relation to payments made in January and February 2013 which 
took place before new PT Berau management was appointed  
in March 2013. In response to these findings, the Company 
announced that: it would pursue all means available for the 
recovery of all relevant expenditure; following the completion  
of this extensive review the Company was continuing to  
enhance its internal controls; and the Board would apply for  
the resumption of trading in the shares once this process had 
been completed for the purpose of the lifting of the suspension 
of trading in the shares. Trading in the shares resumed on  
22 July 2013. 
This review led to an ongoing programme of enhancements 
being made by management to the design of a range of internal 
controls and resulted in increased alignment by PT Berau with 
the Company’s governance framework and system of internal 
control which had previously not been followed by former  
PT Berau management. 
Roeslani Agreement  
At the AGM on 26 June 2013 the Company announced that it  
and PT Berau had entered into an agreement (the “Roeslani 
Agreement”) with Rosan Roeslani, the former President 
Director of PT Berau, to recover assets and cash with a value 
equal to US$173 million subject to the receipt of which the 
Company and PT Berau would waive the potential claims they 
may have against Mr Roeslani in respect of payments totalling  47 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
US$201 million that were made by PT Berau during 2011  
and 2012 that had no clear business purpose and have been 
specified as such in the 2012 Annual Report. 
A more detailed description of this agreement can be found on 
pages 80 and 81. 
The Litigation Committee 
The Board, through the Litigation Committee continues to  
take all appropriate action open to it in respect of the findings  
of the Macfarlanes Investigation to pursue remedies where 
available and to liaise with all the relevant regulators in the  
UK and Indonesia.  
During 2013, the remit of the Litigation Committee was 
extended to include the review of all potential claims and 
dealings with regulators arising out of the extensive review  
of the financial position at PT Berau. 
Work is continuing and no releases from liability or 
responsibility have been given by the Company in connection 
with the Separation Transaction (other than the conditional 
waiver given under the Roeslani Agreement). 
Through the Litigation Committee, the Company has also 
continued to keep informed and assist all relevant regulators, 
both in the UK and Indonesia, including the FCA, the Takeover 
Panel, the Serious Fraud Office and Otoritas Jasa Keuangan 
(“OJK”) (the Indonesian capital markets regulator) and to 
cooperate fully with ongoing investigations and enquiries. 
In relation to PT Berau and its investment in the Chateau fund,  
a winding up order was granted by the Cayman Islands court on 
3 April 2014 in respect of Chateau Investment Management SC, 
the fund manager. Joint official liquidators were appointed by 
the court to investigate the affairs of the company in order to 
locate, protect and take into possession the assets and property 
of that entity. 
As regards the Roeslani Agreement, following Mr Roeslani 
contending that any outstanding liability to transfer any cash or 
assets under the Roeslani Agreement had been extinguished, 
the Company and PT Berau concluded that they would seek to 
compel Mr Roeslani to make full payment of US$173 million 
plus interest and enforce their rights through the arbitration in 
Singapore, and this is ongoing. The arbitration is confidential  
in accordance with the rules of the Singapore International 
Arbitration Centre and the Company will provide updates when 
it is able to do so. The Company will continue to consider and,  
as necessary, pursue other potential means of recovery in light 
of the progress of the arbitration in Singapore.  
The Committee is also overseeing the Company’s full 
cooperation with the investigation by the FCA under section 
97(2) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 into 
whether there may have been breaches of the Listing Rules  
and the Disclosure Rules in connection with certain related 
party transactions set out in the 2012 Annual Report which  
had been identified during the course of the above-mentioned 
reviews, set out in the 2012 Annual Report and reported to the 
FCA by the Company on 23 May 2013. The FCA investigation  
was announced by the Company on 4 November 2013. 
The Separation Transaction  
During the course of 2013, the INEDs have been responsible  
for evaluating the Separation Transaction. This is described in 
detail in the Directors’ Report on pages 74 to 82 but a summary 
is set out below.  
On 7 November 2013, the Company issued a circular (the 
“Circular”) to shareholders: (a) detailing the proposed 
Separation Transaction from the Bakrie Group and PT Bumi 
Resources TbK (“PT Bumi”), including a proposed relationship 
agreement with PT Borneo Lumbung Energi & Metal Tbk 
(“Borneo”) and Ravenwood Acquisition Company Limited 
(“RACL”, a company wholly-owned by Mr Tan) granting Borneo 
and RACL, together, the right to nominate two non-executive 
directors and half the INED’s for appointment to the Board,  
(b) proposing the Company change its name from Bumi plc to 
Asia Resource Minerals plc, and (c) convening a shareholders 
meeting to be held on 4 December 2013 (the “EGM”).  
As described in the Circular, the proposed Separation 
Transaction would be effected through the sale to the  
Bakrie Group of the Company’s 29.2% interest in PT Bumi for 
US$501 million and the acquisition of the Bakrie Group’s 
indirect 23.8% interest in the Company by Borneo and RACL. 
The acquisition by Borneo and RACL would be conditional  
upon, amongst other things, the approval by the Company’s 
independent shareholders of: (i) the sale to the Bakrie Group  
of the Company’s 29.2% interest in PT Bumi and (ii) the waiver  
of the requirement under rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers 
and Mergers for Borneo or any of its affiliates to make a  
general offer for the shares of the Company that they do not 
already own.  
As one of the conditions to the EGM was not satisfied as 
required by 20 November 2013, the Company agreed to adjourn 
the EGM and extend the period by which such condition needed 
to be satisfied to 29 November 2013. Upon satisfaction of such 
condition the Company issued a supplemental circular to 
shareholders on 3 December 2013 reconvening the EGM on  
17 December 2013. 
On 13 December 2013 the Company announced that  
Mr Nathaniel Rothschild had indicated a wish to support the 
Separation Transaction and enter into a relationship agreement 
with the Company following completion of the Separation 
Transaction which, subject to his shareholding remaining  
above 15% and the relationship agreement being approved by 
the shareholders of the Company, would grant Mr Rothschild 
the right to nominate an INED for appointment to the Board.  
The Company also announced that it understood that, subject  
to the completion of the proposed Separation Transaction,  
Mr Tan would take such action as he is able to, to procure  
that RACL and Borneo vote in favour of such a relationship 
agreement. In addition it was announced that Mr Rothschild  
and various connected parties have also agreed not to pursue 
claims made in an unfair prejudice petition.  
The relationship agreement with Borneo and RACL and the 
proposed relationship agreement with Mr Rothschild are 
further described in the Directors’ Report on pages 74 to 82. 
At the EGM held on 17 December 2013 all resolutions put to  
the meeting were approved, including the change of name of  
the Company. 
The Separation Transaction was completed on 25 March 2014 at 
which time the Bakrie Relationship Agreement (as defined and 
described on page 80) terminated and the Borneo Relationship 
Agreement (as defined and described on page 78 and 79) came 
into effect.

Name change  
On 19 December 2013 the Company started trading under  
Asia Resource Minerals plc and the Company ticker symbol  
was changed to ARMS. 
Effectiveness 
Board membership and attendance in 2013  
The Directors’ membership of, and attendance at, Board and 
permanent Committee meetings during 2013 is set out below. 
For Board and Committee meetings, attendance is expressed as 
the number of meetings that each Director attended out of the 
number of meetings that each Director was eligible to attend. 
The number of Committee meetings includes ad hoc meetings 
to deal with matters between scheduled meetings.  
There have been significant changes to the composition of the 
Board in the year under review with the resignations of Philip 
Yeo and Sony Harsono, the changes which took place at the 
general meeting of shareholders on 21 February 2013 with  
the departure of Jean-Marc Mizrahi and Nalin Rathod and the 
appointment of Sir Richard Gozney, and the retirement from the 
Board of Lord Renwick, Sir Graham Hearne and Scott Merrillees 
who did not seek re-election at the Company’s AGM held on  
26 June 2013.  
On 23 December 2013, the Board announced that Chris Walton 
and Nick Salmon would join the Board as INEDs on 1 January 
2014. Mr Salmon became the SID following Sir Julian Horn-
Smith stepping down as INED on 31 January 2014. Mr Walton 
became Chairman of the Board on 27 March 2014 following  
the completion of the Separation Transaction when Samin Tan 
stepped down as Chairman. Mr Tan remains a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company.  
As also announced on 23 December 2013, Steven Shapiro has 
informed the Board that he will not be seeking re-election at the 
Company’s AGM. 
Board balance and independence 
The Non-Executive Directors have a wide range of senior level, 
international skills and experience. As announced in 2013, the 
Board is in the process of being restructured and the recent 
appointments of Chris Walton and Nick Salmon form part of  
this process.  
There are eight Non-Executive Directors on the Board, five of 
whom are considered by the Board to be independent, and  
such independence is reviewed annually in accordance with  
the criteria set out within the Code. The Board also considers 
that no single Director can dominate or unduly influence 
decision making.  
Appointment to the Board and re-election 
The Company’s Articles of Association empower the Board  
to appoint new Directors. Directors appointed in this way will  
be subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after 
their appointment.  
The Nomination Committee is responsible for recruitment  
to the Board. A formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
using independent external search firms and consultants, as 
appropriate, is undertaken before candidates are recommended 
to the Board. Further details regarding the Nomination 
Committee and the appointment process can be found in  
the Nomination Committee report on pages 55 to 56.  
Under the terms of the relationship agreements described in 
the Directors’ Report which were in force in 2013, various major 
shareholders were entitled to nominate directors to the Board. 
These rights were not exercised during the year under review.

Directors stand for re-election annually by the shareholders, 
the next opportunity being at the Company’s AGM and the 
Nomination Committee will review the proposed re-election of 
each Director to be set out in the AGM Notice. The resolutions  
to be proposed regarding such re-elections will be set out in  
the AGM Notice which is being issued in a separate document 
and will provide shareholders with the required notice and 
information prior to the holding of the Company’s AGM. 
Terms of appointment to the Board 
The terms of appointment for all Directors are available for 
inspection in accordance with the Code and each member of  
the Board is satisfied that their other duties do not conflict  
with their time commitments as Directors of the Company.  
The Chairman’s other commitments are as indicated in his 
profile on page 43 and do not affect his ability to devote 
sufficient time to the Company. 
Conflicts of interest 
A procedure is in place to deal with Directors’ conflicts of 
interest. This procedure is in line with published guidance,  
the Company’s Articles of Association and the provisions in 
section 175 of the Companies Act 2006 on conflicts of interest. 
Schedules of a Director’s actual or potential conflicts have  
been compiled based on disclosures made by the Director. 
These are updated and reviewed on a regular basis in addition 
to conflicts or potential conflicts being considered at the 
beginning of Board meetings. 
Board performance evaluation 
During 2013, an external evaluation has not proved possible 
given the demands made on the Board and in particular the 
INEDs during what has been a challenging year for the 
Company. Accordingly this performance evaluation for 2013 has 
been conducted through Board and Committee questionnaires 
and discussions facilitated by the SID and the Chairmen of the 
Committees. The Nomination Committee has not formally 
evaluated the performance of the outgoing Chairman as  
Samin Tan had indicated he would be stepping down following 
completion of the Separation Transaction. The Board intends 
that an independently facilitated Board evaluation will take 
place at least once every three years in accordance with  
the Code. 
Information and support 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information.  
As mentioned above, the Company established the Independent 
Committee of the Board to evaluate the Separation Transaction. 
As Samin Tan, who was the Chairman of the Company during 
the year under review is not, and never has been, a member  
of this Committee, Sir Julian Horn-Smith as Chairman of  
this Committee assumed the responsibility for ensuring that  
the INEDs received accurate, timely and clear information 
regarding the Separation Transaction.  
Under the direction of the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman  
and the chairmen of each of the Committees, the Company 
Secretary’s role includes ensuring effective information flows 
between the Board and its Committees and between the 
Company’s senior management and Non-Executive Directors, 
as well as facilitating induction and assisting with professional 
development as required. All Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board, through 
the Chairman, on all governance matters.  
All Directors appointed to the Board receive an induction 
programme upon joining the Board which, depending upon their 
qualifications and experience, includes presentations and 
briefings, meetings with Board members, senior management 
and external advisers, and visits to key sites and offices. 
Regarding ongoing professional development programmes, the 
Board and its Committees have received briefings regarding 
litigation and arbitration in the UK, Indonesia and Singapore  
as well as changes to the UK governance framework and  
HSEC developments. Directors are also given the opportunity  
to highlight specific areas where they feel their skills or 
knowledge would benefit from development as part of the  
Board evaluation process. 
Directors may obtain independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense if they believe it may be required in the 
furtherance of their duties and this has been utilised in 2013. 
Remuneration  
Details of the level and makeup of the Directors’ remuneration 
and the work of the Remuneration Committee as required by 
the Code and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008) can be found 
in the Remuneration Report on pages 59 to 73. 
Accountability 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s governance 
framework and system of internal control which are designed  
to safeguard shareholders’ investments. In line with this 
responsibility the Board has established a system of internal 
control within the Group which includes financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management procedures.  
A review of their effectiveness is carried out at least annually.  
The Board has delegated its responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control and risk management to the 
Audit Committee. The results of the Audit Committee’s work 
were reported to and considered by the Board, which retains 
responsibility for the disclosure on internal control in the 
Annual Report. Whilst the Audit Committee is responsible for 
oversight of the effectiveness of the risk management systems, 
accountability for identifying and managing risk rests with  
the Board and the CEO supported by executive management.  
In reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control, the Audit Committee, acting for the Board, considers  
all aspects of risk and then assesses whether the key controls 
put in place by management to mitigate each risk are working 
effectively. In this regard the Audit Committee receives regular 
reports from Internal Audit regarding the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems. 
   50 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
The Audit Committee continually seeks to improve the Group’s 
system of risk management and in 2013 made substantial 
refinements to the risk management procedures which drive its 
risk reporting and the management of risks within the business. 
A report of the principal risks and uncertainties currently facing 
the Group is set out on pages 38 to 41. This report was driven by 
the business, and then moderated by the Executive Committee 
to provide a balanced bottom-up, top-down report which was 
then reviewed by the Audit Committee. Going forward the Audit 
Committee is seeking to further embed the process which 
drives risk reporting to make risk management more of an 
everyday activity for operational management. 
The Board remains committed to effective corporate 
governance. In reviewing the effectiveness of internal control, 
the Board considers that no system of internal control can 
provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. Instead the Group operates a system which is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risks to which it is exposed, 
and give the Board assurance that any problems are identified 
and dealt with appropriately. 
The Board’s review of internal control effectiveness during the 
period under review excluded PT Bumi, which was re-classified 
from an associate to an investment with effect from 30th 
September 2012, as the management of the Company no longer 
had the ability to exert any significant influence over PT Bumi.  
The reviews and enhancement to controls undertaken by the 
Board are described on pages 46 under “Extensive review of  
PT Berau and the enhancement of controls”. 
In particular, following the appointment of a new President 
Director of PT Berau on 7 March 2013 he: (a) was appointed  
to the Company’s Executive Committee, (b) installed a new 
management team at PT Berau and (c) moved PT Berau to  
new offices which had formerly been located in a building 
owned by Mr Roeslani, a former ARM and PT Berau director. 
Further strengthening of the governance framework took place 
on 29 June 2013 when Nick von Schirnding joined the board  
of PT Berau as Vice President Commissioner and again on  
1 October 2013 when the Executive Committee was further 
strengthened by the arrival of Paul Fenby as CFO and Keith 
Downham as CMO, based in PT Berau’s new offices in Jakarta. 
The improvements carried out at that time to enhance 
alignment with the Company’s governance framework and 
system of internal control included the following measures: 
– amending the articles of association of the Company’s listed 
subsidiary, PT Berau, to restrict the powers of the President 
Director, better establish the oversight role of the board of 
commissioners and board of directors, and align matters 
reserved for these boards with those reserved for the Board; 
– placing tighter controls over procurement and expenditure 
through the upgrading of the procurement function,  
including new senior hires and the reorganisation of the 
function previously responsible for capital projects, where 
transactions without a clear business purpose had previously 
been made; 
– requiring all new contractual commitments between  
US$2 million and US$20 million to be submitted to  
PT Berau’s board of directors before passing to the  
Executive Committee for approval and requiring those  
above US$20 million, or having a duration of longer  
than two years, to be reviewed by PT Berau’s Board of 
Commissioners before going to the Executive Committee  
for review and then the Board for approval;  
– requiring all expenditures and payments in excess of  
US$1 million be approved by the CEO of the Company;  
– appointing Ernst & Young Indonesia to work with the new 
management team at PT Berau to review financial reporting 
procedures. This work is resulting in updated operating 
procedures, importantly around procurement and tendering, 
which integrate with the recently installed SAP system at  
PT Berau; and 
– direct involvement in the substantive review and oversight of 
financial reporting from the Company, including the provision 
of certain individuals from the UK. 
Following on from these actions and in addition to reports  
from Internal Audit, in May 2013 the Board requested 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) to perform procedures to 
validate certain actions taken by management in respect of the 
design of the Group’s financial reporting procedures. Following 
completion of that work, the Board sought the lifting of the 
suspension and shares re-commenced trading on 22 July 2013. 
In addition to what was required for the purpose of the lifting of 
the suspension of trading in the shares, the Audit Committee, on 
behalf of the Board, has increased its oversight by establishing  
a programme to monitor ongoing enhancements to the 
effectiveness of internal controls across the Group. The Audit 
Committee has reviewed progress reports from Internal Audit 
at each of its meetings since setting up the programme to 
support its review of internal control effectiveness for the year 
under review. The areas which the Audit Committee is now 
focused on to improve operating effectiveness are: 
– embedding risk management further into the operations so 
that it becomes an integral part of the day-to-day running of 
the business;  
– embedding the Company’s new procurement procedures  
and in particular ensuring that effective use is made of the 
recently installed SAP system and the controls and disciplines 
that it affords users; and 
– ensuring that the PT Berau financial reporting team  
continues to be strengthened through an ongoing  
recruitment programme. 
Relations with shareholders 
Through this Annual Report and, as required, through other 
periodic financial statements, shareholder circulars and 
announcements issued during 2013, the Board is committed  
to providing shareholders with a clear assessment of the 
Company’s position and prospects. Statements regarding the 
status of the Company as a going concern and the Directors’ 
responsibilities for reporting the financial statements can be 
found on page 83. 
   51 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Board supports the objectives of the UK Stewardship  
Code and welcomes opportunities to engage constructively  
with shareholders. The Board also recognises the importance  
of maintaining an ongoing relationship with the Company’s 
shareholders based on frequent and purposeful dialogue. 
During 2013, a number of meetings with institutional 
shareholders were held both in the UK and internationally by 
the Chairman, SID and CEO to ensure that investors received a 
balanced and comprehensive view of the Group’s performance 
and the issues faced by it.  
Following the receipt of notice from Mr Rothschild in January 
2013 requisitioning a general meeting of the Company, there 
was extensive communication between the Company and its 
shareholders. Subsequently, 19 out of the 22 resolutions 
proposed by Mr Rothschild were defeated and the Board’s 
strategy to complete the proposed Separation Transaction  
was endorsed. 
Following the issue on 7 November 2013 and 3 December 2013 
of two circulars relating to the proposed Separation Transaction 
and the proposed change of the name of the Company to Asia 
Resource Minerals plc, there was also extensive communication 
between the Company and its shareholders as a result of which, 
on 17 December 2013, all proposed resolutions were approved, 
including the change of name. 
The Board monitors the views of shareholders by way of a 
report at every Board meeting, covering investor feedback  
as well as analysts’ and brokers’ reports and briefings,  
and a summary of the main movements in shareholdings.  
The Chairman and SID remain available to meet shareholders 
to discuss any issues or concerns. 
Shareholders are kept informed of the progress and 
performance of the Group through the Annual Report, half- 
year results, interim management statements, and the AGM. 
This information and other significant announcements of the 
Group are released to the London Stock Exchange and are 
available on www.asiarmplc.com. 
The Company’s AGM Notice will be issued shortly. This will 
provide shareholders with the opportunity to vote on the 
resolutions put to shareholders and, for those shareholders 
who attend, to ask questions of the Board of Directors, including 
the Chairmen of the Committees. The AGM Notice will be  
sent to shareholders in a separate document and the result  
of the AGM voting on all resolutions will be published on the 
Company’s website.

Audit Committee 
Meetings of this Audit Committee are normally attended by the 
CEO, the CFO and the Group Financial Controller, as well as the 
Group Head of Internal Audit and Risk and the external auditors 
(both of whom have direct access to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee). At the end of every meeting the Audit Committee 
has the opportunity to meet alone with the Group Head of 
Internal Audit and Risk and the external auditors. The secretary 
to the Audit Committee is the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary. Of the 11 meetings this year, five meetings 
were standard meetings, two of which were specifically called to 
review and approve draft announcements and results. The six 
additional meetings held this year were called to deal with 
specific circumstances around the delay in the publication of 
results for 2012 and other related matters. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports to subsequent 
meetings of the Board and the Board receives a copy of the 
minutes of each meeting once these have been approved by  
the Audit Committee. 
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee can be  
found on the Company’s website, www.asiarmplc.com,  
or can be obtained from the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary.

and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into account 
the planning of, and results from, its work; and 
– developing, implementing and monitoring compliance with a 
policy on the engagement of the external auditors to supply 
non-audit services. 
Activities during the year 
In addition to its regular scheduled matters, since the beginning 
of 2013, the Audit Committee also: 
– appointed Internal Audit to review the related party 
disclosures made by former PT Berau management for 2012 
and reviewed the findings from this work (“PT Berau Audit”); 
– reviewed the 2012 and the 2013 Annual Reports and financial 
statements which included voluntary disclosures on related 
party transactions and consideration of major accounting 
judgements. Similarly, it reviewed the 2013 half-year results;  
– reviewed the disclosures in relation to reserves  
and resources;  
– oversaw work performed by Internal Audit with regard to the 
Company’s financial reporting procedures (FRP); 
– required and oversaw further work by management to further 
improve existing processes to support its ongoing review of 
internal control effectiveness; 
– oversaw the Company’s response to queries raised by the 
Financial Reporting Review Panel of the Financial Reporting 
Council which are now closed; 
– monitored the Group’s exposure to litigation through reports 
at each Committee meeting; 
– oversaw the recruitment of the CFO, Paul Fenby, who joined 
on 1 October 2013; 
– considered application of the new accounting standards, 
IFRIC 20, on deferred stripping costs and the revision to  
IAS 19 on pension costs;  
– reviewed the process designed to ensure the external 
auditors are aware of all “relevant information” as required 
under sections 418 and 419 of the Companies Act 2006;  
– reviewed the management representation letters to the 
external auditors; 
– reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s ability to remain 
a going concern, taking into account cash flow forecasts 
prepared by management; 
– reviewed the content of the circulars and specifically the 
finance and audit matters they contained; 
– reviewed the Group’s non-audit fee policy; and 
– reviewed the performance of the Committee. 
During the period under review, the Audit Committee received 
regular reports, including Internal Audit reports, regarding the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems 
which allowed it to monitor key matters, performance against 
objectives and follow up on actions to be taken to remedy any 
significant failings or weaknesses identified from such reports.  
The Audit Committee pays particular attention to matters it 
considers to be important by virtue of their impact on the 
Group’s results or the level of complexity, judgement or 
estimation involved in their application to the consolidated 
financial statements. The main areas of focus during 2013  
are set out below: 
1. As described in the Governance Report, in response to 
concerns that not all the Group’s policies were being  
fully complied with despite assurances from directors  
of PT Berau to the contrary, the Audit Committee 
commissioned Internal Audit to undertake a review of 
contracts and payments to identify counterparties and the 
extent of any transactions with related parties. This work 
concluded that a number of related party transactions had not 
been disclosed by former PT Berau management and that a 
number of large payments could not be determined as having 
a clear business purpose. Despite a thorough review, it was 
not possible to conclude that all related party transactions 
entered into by former PT Berau management for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 had been identified. This led to an 
extensive review of the financial position of PT Berau with  
the assistance of external legal and accounting advisers 
which focused on payments described as being for hauling 
roads and other construction-in-progress and land related 
payments as well as unusual transactions where the  
business purpose was not clear. The review also included  
an assessment of contracts and a search for evidence of 
unrecorded liabilities, commitments and encumbrances  
on assets. 
 This extensive review of the financial position at PT Berau 
uncovered evidence of apparent financial irregularities and 
identified significant expenditure, predominantly in 2012,  
for which no clear business purpose could be established  
in relation to hauling roads and other construction activity 
where insufficient evidence could be found to support  
the capitalisation of these costs as previous PT Berau 
management had intended, and also in relation to certain 
land compensation payments which could not be validated. 
Furthermore, this review identified previously undisclosed 
encumbrances on cash balances and that some of the 
information provided to the Remuneration Committee  
had not been complete. 
 Following the completion of this review in May 2013 it was 
concluded that payments made in 2011 and 2012 to the  
value of approximately US$201 million could not be 
substantiated as having a clear business purpose, and  
a further US$6 million of payments in January and  
February 2013 which took place before the new PT Berau 
management was appointed in March 2013. This review led  
to enhancements being made by management to the design 
of a range of internal controls and resulted in increased 
alignment by PT Berau with the Company’s governance 
framework and system of internal control which had 
previously not been followed by former Berau management. 
2. To provide the Board with assurance that it was still meeting 
its continuing obligations under the Listing Rules, in addition 
to reports from Internal Audit the Board commissioned PwC 
to perform procedures to validate certain actions taken by 
management in respect of the design of the Group’s financial 
reporting procedures.    54 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
BOARD COMMITTEES CONTINUED
 Following completion of that work, the Board sought the 
lifting of the suspension of trading in the Company’s shares. 
The shares re-commenced trading on 22 July 2013. 
 In addition to what was required for the purpose of the lifting 
of the suspension of trading in the Company’s shares, the 
Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has increased its 
oversight by establishing a programme to monitor ongoing 
enhancements to the effectiveness of internal controls across 
the Group. The Audit Committee has reviewed progress 
reports from Internal Audit at each of its meetings since 
setting up the programme to support its review of internal 
control effectiveness for the year under review. The areas 
which the Audit Committee is now focused on to improve 
operating effectiveness are: 
– embedding risk management further into the operations 
so that it becomes an integral part of the day-to-day 
running of the business;  
– embedding the Company’s new procurement procedures 
and in particular ensuring that effective use is made of  
the recently installed SAP system and the controls and 
disciplines that it affords users; and 
– ensuring that the PT Berau financial reporting team 
continues to be strengthened through an ongoing 
recruitment programme. 
3. During the year, the Audit Committee considered the  
key assumptions and judgements made in assessing  
the carrying value of the Group’s cash generating unit  
(CGU), PT Berau. This included a review of the valuation 
methodology on a fair value less costs of disposal basis  
and inputs to key assumptions including ore reserves, 
production estimates, commodity prices, discount rates, 
future operating costs, including cost optimisation and capital 
expenditure. Also considered were the nature, prospect and 
valuation of the CCoW extensions. 
 The Audit Committee discussed key judgements with 
management and the external auditors, considered sensitivity 
analyses and satisfied itself that goodwill and property, plant 
and equipment in relation to PT Berau was not impaired. 
Further details are included in Note 13 to the financial 
statements. 
4. The Audit Committee considered the adequacy of accruals  
in relation to open areas under discussion with the tax 
authorities taking into account judgements made by 
management and the status of areas under discussion.  
In relation to the tax liability, the Committee was satisfied that 
the accruals were sufficient. In relation to the offset  
of VAT receivable with royalties payable to the Indonesian 
Government, the Committee considers the accounting 
treatment and disclosures appropriate. Further details are 
included in Notes 18 and 20 to the financial statements. 
5. The Audit Committee, through Internal Audit, supplemented 
management’s procedures to review and identify new related 
parties and ensured that appropriate disclosures were made. 
In some instances it is not able to positively substantiate 
whether a counterparty is a related party or not. In these 
circumstances, the Audit Committee has voluntarily disclosed 
transactions with these counterparties separately, which is in 
excess of to the requirements of IAS 24. In 2012, transactions 
with one counterparty, PT Prima Sahaja, were disclosed  
 voluntarily as the ultimate beneficiary could not be 
substantiated. During the 2013 review, this counterparty  
was positively confirmed as a related party and the 2012 
disclosure has been restated accordingly. See Note 32 for 
further details. Following management’s 2013 review the 
Audit Committee considers that the appropriate disclosures 
have been made for transactions with known related parties. 
6. As part of the circular submitted to shareholders in advance 
of the EGM held on 17 December 2013, the Audit Committee 
considered the adequacy of working capital, the financial 
information on PT Bumi and the unaudited pro forma 
statement of net assets of the retained Group. The Audit 
Committee considered disclosures in the circular to be 
appropriate and that working capital was sufficient. 
7. The Audit Committee has considered the accounting for the 
available for sale asset, PT Bumi. The judgement included the 
valuation of the asset taking into account the completion of 
the transaction on 25 March 2014, after the year end. The 
Audit Committee believes that the asset is appropriately 
reflected at its fair value as at 31 December 2013. 
8. The Audit Committee also considered the accounting 
treatment of the litigation with Rosan Roeslani to recover 
$173 million under the terms of the Roeslani Agreement. 
Taking into account the dispute by Mr Roeslani and the 
pending arbitration proceedings in Singapore, the Audit 
Committee considers the treatment as a contingent asset  
to be appropriate. 
9. The Audit Committee considered four areas of audit risk  
for 2013 concerning the accuracy of the Group’s financial 
statements covering the risk of management override of 
internal controls, risk of fraud in revenue recognition, the 
adequacy of the valuation of other non-current assets, and 
the effectiveness of the financial close process.  
 Following the review of financial position at PT Berau 
management implemented enhancements to governance  
and financial controls as described in the Governance report. 
The Audit Committee considered the adequacy of these 
procedures and was satisfied that sufficient controls to 
mitigate these risks had been implemented. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for managing the 
relationship with the Company’s external auditors, PwC, on 
behalf of the Board.  
The Audit Committee has adopted a formal framework in  
its review of the effectiveness of the external audit process  
and audit quality. The framework has been developed with 
reference to guidance provided by the “Big Four”accounting 
firms and from the Company’s own experiences with its auditor. 
It includes the following areas: 
– the audit partners with particular focus on the lead 
engagement partner; 
– the audit team; 
– planning and scoping of the audit and identification of  
audit risk; 
– the execution of audit work; and 
– independence and objectivity of the audit firm.  55 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The audit assessment process is completed each year by each 
member of the Audit Committee and the CFO. Feedback is  
also sought from members of Group Finance, the PT Berau 
President Director and members of the Company and PT Berau 
finance teams. The Head of Group Internal Audit compiles the 
assessment on behalf of the Audit Committee but does not 
provide feedback on the audit process itself. 
The assessment is comprehensive and includes 35 questions 
which are completed by way of a formal survey each year.  
On completion of the survey the Head of Group Internal Audit 
submits written feedback to the Audit Committee, management 
and the external auditors. Wherever appropriate, the Audit 
Committee formulates actions to improve the effectiveness of 
the external audit process in subsequent years. The chairman  
of the Audit Committee then discusses the proposed actions 
with an independent senior partner who is not part of the audit 
engagement team. 
Following their assessment in respect of 2013, the Audit 
Committee has concluded that the external auditors have 
demonstrated appropriate qualifications and expertise, has 
remained independent of the Group and that the audit process 
was effective. Accordingly, the Audit Committee recommended 
to the Board that PwC be reappointed as the Group’s auditor for 
a further year. The Board has accepted this recommendation 
and a resolution to shareholders proposing the reappointment 
of PwC will be set out in the AGM Notice which will be sent 
separately to shareholders. 
The Audit Committee also reviewed PwC’s engagement letter 
and determined its remuneration in accordance with the 
authority given to it by shareholders, such remuneration  
being considered appropriate by the Committee.  
PwC has been the auditor of the Company and the previous 
parent of the Group since 2010. The Directors will ensure that 
the Company complies with any new requirements which arise 
from recent proposals from the UK Competition Commission to 
introduce 10 year audit tenders on a mandatory basis for FTSE 
350 companies, and the European Union plans to introduce 
mandatory rotation of audit firms for all public interest entities. 
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed and updated the 
non-audit fee policy which provides clear guidance regarding 
non-audit work that may be undertaken by the external 
auditors. Whilst the Audit Committee believes that in certain 
circumstances it is appropriate for non-audit work to be 
undertaken by the external auditors, these are limited and, in  
a normal year, total non-audit fees paid to the external auditors 
would be expected to be lower than fees paid for the audit. 
At each meeting, the Audit Committee reviews the nature and 
amount of non-audit work performed by the auditors, as well  
as the fees charged, with a particular focus on ensuring that  
its engagement for such services does not undermine the 
auditor’s independence and objectivity. 
An analysis of fees paid in respect of audit and non-audit 
services provided by PwC for 2013 is set out in Note 7 to the 
Financial Statements. The majority of the non-audit services 
provided in 2013 relate to the Separation Transaction and in 
particular the content of the Circular. Having reviewed such 
non-audit services the Audit Committee is satisfied that they 
were provided efficiently by the external auditors and did not 
compromise their independence or objectivity.

In 2013 the Conflicts Committee met three times on scheduled 
meetings and one additional meeting took place when the 
Conflicts Committee participated in the Audit Committee’s 
review of related party transactions.  
In addition the Conflicts Committee: 
– reviewed and has continued to enhance the process for 
identifying and reviewing potential related party transactions 
following the extensive review of the financial position of  
PT Berau; 
– received reports from Internal Audit regarding its review  
and follow up of related party transactions identified as  
having been entered into during 2012 which had not been 
presented to the Conflicts Committee for review by former  
PT Berau management; 
– oversaw the outcome of these reviews including disclosures 
in the 2012 financial statements and to the UKLA; 
– met with the President Director of PT Berau to review all 
arrangements with related parties identified by Internal  
Audit in 2012 and, where appropriate, requested that these  
be terminated; 
– received updates from Internal Audit regarding its review  
of related party transactions to be included in the  
2013 accounts; 
– approved new related party transactions entered into  
during 2013 with Borneo and PT Prima Sahaja and agreed  
the accounting disclosure as set out in Note 31 to the 
Financial Statements;  
– with the Litigation Committee oversaw the Company’s full 
cooperation with the investigation by the FCA (announced  
by the Company on 4 November 2013) regarding certain 
related party transactions which had been identified during 
the course of the above-mentioned reviews and reported to 
the FCA by the Company; and 
– reviewed its terms of reference and the performance of the 
Conflicts Committee as a result of which the Committee has 
decided to meet more frequently in 2014. As disclosed in  
the Company’s 2012 annual report, this Committee had not 
operated as effectively as it should in 2012 as a result of non-
compliance with certain of the Company’s policies and lack of 
disclosure by former PT Berau management. As referred to 
earlier in this Annual Report the Board has taken actions to 
address this during 2013 including the removal of former  
PT Berau management and the initiation of internal reviews 
which culminated in an extensive review of the financial 
position of PT Berau and the enhancement of the Company’s 
internal controls, which is ongoing.  58 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013

REMUNERATION REPORT
For the year ended 31 December 2013
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
Dear Shareholder, 
The last 12 months have been an eventful period for Asia Resource Minerals plc. We were faced with several significant challenges 
in the year, including non-compliance with certain policies and lack of disclosure by former PT Berau management leading to 
internal reviews, which culminated in an extensive review of the financial position at PT Berau, the enhancement to the design of 
our internal controls and the temporary suspension and re-listing of our shares.  
In addition to devoting a considerable amount of time to these matters, management also focused on the core business and 
supported the INEDs in their efforts to bring the Separation Transaction (which involved the Company’s major shareholders and 
was approved at the EGM held on 17 December 2013) to a successful conclusion.  
Thanks to Asia Resource Mineral’s resilience, we are now emerging from this turbulent period with a renewed vision of becoming  
a leading UK listed Asian resources company, with a clear focus on maximising the coal mining opportunity at PT Berau.  
The major changes implemented in 2013 were key steps towards achieving this vision, including: 
– the appointment of the first unaffiliated CEO of the Company, Nick von Schirnding, who started on 1 January 2013; 
– the removal of former directors at PT Berau and installing a new management team at PT Berau, including the appointment of  
a new President Director; and 
– further strengthening of Asia Resource Minerals management team, through the appointment of Paul Fenby as Chief Financial 
Officer and Keith Downham as Chief Mining Officer, both based in Jakarta.  
These significant changes have been reflected in the key activities of the Remuneration Committee in the year, which included: 
– agreeing appropriate remuneration packages and service contracts for the Company’s new management appointments in  
the year; 
– establishing a stronger relationship with the remuneration committee of PT Berau, whilst respecting its status as a  
listed company in Indonesia, through the appointment of Nick von Schirnding, the Company’s CEO, to the PT Berau  
remuneration committee;  
– overseeing the grants of the long term incentive awards under the Asia Resource Minerals Incentive Plan, which were made in 
December 2013 once the Company was outside a close period; and 
– overseeing the adoption of the new directors’ remuneration reporting regulations, enacted during the year, including a review  
of our Executive Director remuneration policy to ensure it remains appropriate.  
The Committee determined that the current remuneration policy remains appropriate, and as such, there have been no major 
changes in the year. The CEO’s salary will remain frozen at its current level for 2014.  
You will see that the format of the report has changed from previous years. As required under the new disclosure regulations, 
details have been split between a Remuneration Policy Report, which will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM, and  
an Annual Remuneration Report, which will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote.  
The Committee remains committed to good corporate governance, and will continue to monitor our investors’ views, best practice 
developments and market trends on executive remuneration.  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues for their hard work and valuable input during the year.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT (UNAUDITED) 
This part of the report sets out Asia Resource Minerals’ Directors’ remuneration policy (the “Policy”). This Policy will be subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM and, subject to that approval, will become effective from that date.  
The Policy is intended to apply for three years. However, the Committee monitors remuneration policy on a regular basis and 
should the Committee resolve that the Policy should be revised, such revisions will be subject to a binding shareholder vote.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
Base salary To attract and 
retain the high 
calibre talent 
required to 
deliver the 
Group’s 
strategy.  
Base salaries are normally 
reviewed annually. 
When determining salary levels, 
the Committee considers a number 
of factors, including: 
− size and scope of the individual’s 
responsibility;  
− performance, skills and expertise; 
− market competitive positioning; 
and 
− pay and conditions elsewhere in 
the Company. 
There is no defined 
maximum opportunity. 
Typically salary 
increases will be in line 
with all-employee 
salary increases in the 
UK. Exceptions may  
be made in a range  
of circumstances, 
including:  
− increase in scope or

− development and

role; and 
− alignment to market

The Committee may add or

In the event of relocation (either  
to the UK or abroad) benefits  
may include additional expatriate 
benefits, such as travel allowances, 
school fees, housing allowance and

Targets and measures are 
considered annually and payout 
levels are determined by the 
Committee after year end based on 
performance against key financial, 
operational and strategic objectives 
in the year. 
A portion of annual bonus 
payments will generally be 
deferred into an award of Asia 
Resource Minerals plc shares.  
Awards will normally be granted  
in the form of nil-cost options  
or conditional share awards.  
These awards will normally  
vest, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, on the  
third anniversary of grant. 
Maximum annual 
opportunity of 150%  
of base salary. 
Performance is measured 
relative to key financial, 
operational, strategic and 
individual objectives in  
the year. 
The exact measures selected 
and their weighting may vary 
each year according to the 
strategic priorities of the 
Company. In normal 
circumstances, at least 70% 
will be based on Group and 
corporate measures.  
The remainder will be based 
on performance against 
individual objectives. 
The entry award level for 
Group and corporate measures 
is 25% of maximum, rising to 
100% of maximum.  
The Committee retains 
discretion to adjust bonus 
payments to reflect the overall 
financial performance of the 
Company, inadequate safety 
performance or a material 
corporate governance failure.  
Long term 
incentive  
plan 
To provide a 
performance 
related 
element, linked 
to the delivery 
of shareholder 
value over the 
long term.  
Awards are granted under the Asia 
Resource Minerals Incentive Plan, 
with the vesting of awards granted 
to Executive Directors subject to 
performance conditions measured 
over a period of, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, 
at least three years.  
Awards are normally made in the 
form of nil-cost options, with a  
10 year term. The Committee may, 
however, grant awards in other 
forms such as conditional share 
awards, forfeitable shares,  
market value options or stock 
appreciation rights.  
The maximum value of 
awards an individual 
may receive in respect 
of a financial year is 
200% of salary except 
in exceptional 
circumstances 
determined by the 
Committee when the 
Committee may make 
an award not exceeding 
400% of salary. 
Awards will normally 
be valued using the 
market value of shares 
at a point prior to grant. 
Awards of market value 
options will typically  
be valued using an 
accepted financial 
valuation methodology. 
Vesting of awards is dependent 
on financial, operational and/or 
share price measures, as set 
by the Committee, which are 
aligned with long term 
strategic objectives at the 
Company. No less than half  
of an award will be based  
on share price measures.  
The remainder will be based 
on either financial, operational 
or share price measures. 
In addition, vesting is subject  
to the Committee being 
satisfied that the vesting 
outcome suitably reflects  
the underlying financial 
performance of the Company.  
No more than 25% of the 
award will vest for threshold 
performance, rising to 100% 
for maximum performance.

Notes to the Policy Table 
Deferred bonus and LTIP awards are subject to a malus provision, whereby the Committee may determine that awards may be 
forfeited or reduced. This may apply where the Committee determines that: (a) there has been significant financial losses or 
misstatements of the accounts, or (b) a participant’s conduct has either contributed to material losses or serious reputational 
damage or has amounted to serious misconduct, fraud or misstatement. Other elements of remuneration are not subject to 
recovery provisions. 
The Asia Resource Minerals Incentive Plan and the Company’s deferred bonus arrangements will be operated in accordance with 
the relevant plan rules, as amended from time to time in accordance with those rules (the former of which was approved by 
shareholders in 2011). In particular: 
– the performance condition applicable to LTIP awards may be amended or substituted in accordance with its terms or if an event 
occurs or circumstances arise which cause the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, to determine that a substituted or 
amended performance condition would be appropriate (taking into account the interests of the shareholders of the Company) 
provided that the amended performance condition would continue to achieve its original purpose;  
– LTIP and deferred bonus awards may be settled in cash, at the discretion of the Committee;  
– the terms of the LTIP and deferred bonus awards may be adjusted in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital, 
any consolidation of profits or reserves, special dividend, delisting, demerger or other events justifying, in the Committee’s 
opinion, an adjustment; 
– in the event of a change of control or winding up of Asia Resource Minerals plc, LTIP awards will normally vest to the extent the 
performance conditions, in the Committee’s opinion, have been met and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, on a time 
pro-rated basis. Deferred bonus awards will normally vest in full. Awards will typically be exercisable for a period of four weeks 
after vesting. The Committee may, in the event of a demerger, special dividend or other event that may affect the value of awards, 
allow awards to vest early on the same basis; and 
– LTIP and deferred bonus awards may incorporate the right to receive (in cash or shares) the value of dividends which would have 
been paid in respect of dividend record dates between the grant and satisfaction of awards on the shares that vest. This value 
may be calculated assuming reinvestment of those dividends in the Company’s shares. 
   63 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any 
discretions available to it in connection with such payments) that are not line with the Policy where the terms of the payment  
were agreed: 
(i) before the Policy came into effect; or 
(ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was 
not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.  
For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration, and an award over shares is 
“agreed” at the time the award is granted. 
Minor changes 
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to 
take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.  
Performance measures and targets  
Annual bonus 
Annual bonus performance measures and targets are selected by the Committee on an annual basis to align the Executive 
Directors to the delivery of the Group business plan and strategy. When setting the performance targets, the Committee will 
consider a number of different factors including the Board’s strategic priorities, the Group’s business plan and outlook for the 
financial year. 
Long term incentive Plan 
Performance measures and targets are determined by the Committee to reflect the Group’s strategy and to align Executive 
Directors with long term value creation for shareholders. When setting performance targets, the Committee considers market 
practice within the relevant business sector and the desire to outperform appropriate comparators.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Remuneration arrangements across the Group 
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors follows the same broad principles in place for all employees: to provide competitive 
rewards to attract and retain employees of the appropriate calibre to deliver on the Group strategy.  
Differences in policy for Executive Directors, senior management and other employees in the Group generally reflect differences in 
market practice taking into account role, seniority and geographical location.  
The remuneration policies for Executive Directors and the senior management team are generally consistent in terms of structure 
and the performance measures used.  
Approach to recruitment remuneration 
The Committee would apply the following principles on appointment of a new Executive Director: 
– in determining the appropriate remuneration package, the Committee would take into account all relevant factors, including the 
size and complexity of the business at the time of recruitment, the complexity, importance and size of the role, the calibre and 
experience of the individual and the market from which they are recruited;  
– where the new appointment is replacing a previous Executive Director, salaries and total remuneration opportunity may be 
higher or lower than the previous incumbent;  
– so far as practical, the Committee would seek to align the remuneration package for any incoming Executive Director within the 
remuneration policy set out in the table above;  
– the Committee may determine that buyout awards are required to facilitate the recruitment of Directors of the calibre needed to 
deliver the Group’s strategic priorities. Any buyout would take into account the terms of the arrangements being forfeited (e.g. 
form of award, performance conditions, timeframe). The overriding principle is that any buyout should have a commercial value 
of no more than the estimated value of awards being forfeited. The form of any buyout award would be determined at the time; 
– the Committee retains the flexibility to determine that for the first year of appointment any annual bonus award will be subject to 
such conditions as it may determine; and 
– the maximum variable remuneration that may be granted at the time of recruitment (excluding buyouts) would be in line with  
the remuneration policy set out in the table above. Such variable pay could, in exceptional circumstances, be delivered via 
alternative structures to those outlined in the policy set out in the table above, with the intention that a significant portion  
would be share based. 
Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy 
arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions. Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed 
following an acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured.  
The Committee retains the discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside of the Policy to meet the individual 
circumstances of the recruitment in the circumstances of an interim appointment to fill an Executive Director role on a short term 
basis or a Non-Executive Director or the Chairman taking on an executive function on a short term basis. 
Recruitment of Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, their fees will typically be in line with the remuneration policy as 
set out in the table above. Any specific cash or share arrangements delivered to the Chairman or Non-Executive Directors will not 
include share options or any other performance related elements.  
   65 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Service contracts and letters of appointment 
Executive Director 
The current Executive Director has a rolling service contract that provides for a 12 months’ notice period from either side.  
The Company may terminate the Executive Director’s employment by making a payment in lieu of notice of the unexpired notice 
period equivalent to a value comprising of salary, pension and contractual benefits. The Executive Director’s service contract 
contains provisions relating to any payment in lieu of notice being made, at the discretion of the Committee, on a phased basis,  
and the reduction of any such payment if the Executive Director finds alternative employment within a year of ceasing employment 
with the Company.  
The following table sets out details of the service contract for the current Executive Director: 
Director Date of contract Notice period

Non-Executive Directors and Chairman 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed pursuant to a letter of appointment. The appointment of the Chairman and each of the  
Non-Executive Directors is for an initial period of three years, which is renewable. A Non-Executive Director’s appointment is 
terminable by the Non-Executive Director or the Company by giving written notice. Under Mr Tan’s letter of appointment the  
Non-Executive Director and the Company are required to give three months’ notice of termination. No contractual payments  
would be due on termination.

The service contracts and/or letters of appointment for all Asia Resource Minerals plc Directors are available for inspection by 
shareholders at the Company’s registered office.  
Loss of office payment policy 
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in 
accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the Executive Director, as well as the rules of any 
incentive plans.  
The Company considers a variety of factors when considering leaving arrangements for an Executive Director. It must satisfy any 
contractual obligations that have previously been agreed with the Executive Director that: (i) are not contrary to the Policy as set out 
in this report, or (ii) if so, not having been entered into on a date later than 27 June 2012, in accordance with relevant legislation.  
   66 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
In the event of termination, the following will apply:  
Payment in lieu of notice As set out above, the Company may terminate employment by making a payment in lieu 
of notice of the unexpired notice period equivalent to a value comprising of salary, 
pension and benefits. 
Annual bonus There is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus. The Committee retains the 
discretion to award bonuses for leavers, taking into account the circumstances of 
departure. Any bonus would normally be subject to performance and time pro-rating.  
Deferred bonus awards Deferred bonus awards will normally vest when the individual ceases to hold office or 
employment with the Group, unless one of two exceptions apply. The first of these is 
where the individual has resigned, in which case his unvested awards will vest on the 
normal vesting date (unless the Committee determines they should vest earlier). Unless 
the Committee determines otherwise, the extent to which an unvested award vests in 
these circumstances will be time pro-rated by reference to the period of time between 
the grant and cessation of office or employment as a proportion of the vesting period. 
The second exception to the general rule is where the individual’s office or employment 
is terminated for cause, in which case all awards will lapse unless the Committee 
determines otherwise.  
Vested awards are typically exercisable up to six months after the date of cessation, 
except where cessation is by reason of death, when awards would normally be 
exercisable for a period of 12 months thereafter. The Committee may, however, 
determine that alternative exercise windows are appropriate in individual circumstances.
Long term incentive plan awards Generally, any unvested awards will lapse when the individual ceases to hold office or 
employment with the Group, unless the Committee determines otherwise.  
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group by reason of death, unvested awards 
will usually vest on the date of death. If the executive ceases to be an officer or employee 
of the Group by reason of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, the individual’s 
employing company or business being sold out of the Group, or for any other reasons at 
the discretion of the Committee, unvested awards will normally continue to vest in line 
with the normal vesting period. The Committee, however, retains the flexibility to 
determine that awards can vest upon cessation of employment. In these circumstances 
(including cessation by reason of death), the Committee has the discretion to determine 
the proportion of an LTIP award that will vest, taking into account unless the Committee 
determines otherwise the extent to which the performance conditions have been met 
and the time elapsed since grant.  
Vested awards are typically exercisable up to six months after the date of cessation, 
except where cessation is by reason of death, when awards would normally be 
exercisable for a period of 12 months thereafter. The Committee may, however, 
determine that alternative exercise windows are appropriate in individual circumstances. 
No awards will vest or be exercisable if the Executive Director is summarily dismissed. 
In the event that a buyout award is made on recruitment, then the relevant leaver provisions would be determined at the time of  
the award. 
Consideration of wider employee pay elsewhere in the Group 
In making remuneration decisions for Directors, the Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Group. Given the diverse geographical markets in which employees operate, no direct comparison metrics are considered by the 
Committee. The Company does not consult with employees on Executive Director remuneration.  
Whilst a subsidiary of Asia Resource Minerals plc, PT Berau also retains a listing on the Indonesia stock exchange and therefore 
has its own remuneration committee. Their role is to establish and monitor executive remuneration arrangements for senior

Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee remains committed to good corporate governance, and monitors investors’ views, best practice developments and 
market trends on executive remuneration. Guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views are considered when determining 
the appropriate Director remuneration policy.  
The Committee welcomes shareholder feedback on Directors’ remuneration at Asia Mineral Resources plc.  
   67 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
ANNUAL REMUNERATION REPORT  
This section sets out details of how the Asia Resource Minerals Directors’ Policy has been applied in the year ended 31 December 
2013 and how the Committee intends to apply the Policy in the 2014 financial year going forward. Those sections of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration that have been audited have been identified below.  
The Committee 
The Committee determines the remuneration policy in respect of the Chairman, Executive Director and other senior executives of 
Asia Resource Minerals plc. The Committee also reviews and administers all Asia Resource Minerals plc share incentive plans.  
The Chairman and Executive Director determine the fees for the Non-Executive Directors.  
The Committee currently comprises three Independent Non-Executive Directors. Throughout the year the Committee consisted of 
Sir Julian Horn-Smith and Amir Sambodo. Steven Shapiro was appointed as Chairman of the Committee when Sir Graham Hearne 
did not seek re-election  at the Company’s AGM held on 26 June 2013. Nick Salmon was appointed to the Committee on 27 March 
2014. A summary of attendance at each meeting is set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 48.  
The members of the Committee are all INEDs and are free from any relationship that would affect their impartiality in carrying out 
their responsibilities. The secretary to the Committee is the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.  
The Chairman of the Committee reports to subsequent meetings of the Board and the Board receives a copy of the minutes of each 
meeting once these have been approved by the Committee. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website, www.asiarmplc.com, or can be obtained from the 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. 
Base salary (Unaudited) 
Base salaries are reviewed annually and are set taking into consideration salary levels at UK listed companies of a similar size and 
complexity, practice in the UK listed mining sector and other relevant commercial considerations, such as the capabilities and 
experience of the individual, and the size, scope and responsibility of the role. 
When considering Executive Director remuneration, the Committee considers pay and employment conditions in the Company as  
a whole. Nick von Schirnding’s current base salary was set upon his appointment to CEO on 31 December 2012. The Committee 
determined that his salary will remain unchanged for 2014. 
Name 2014 annual base salary (£) 2013 annual base salary (£) 
Nick von Schirnding  435,000 435,000 
Pension (Unaudited) 
The CEO receives a pension contribution of 15% of base salary. 
Annual bonus (Unaudited) 
The maximum award for the CEO in 2013 was 150% of base salary. This will remain unchanged for 2014. 
It is intended that annual bonus payments are based on the Committee’s assessment of Company performance against stretching 
annual targets. Performance measures include financial, operational and strategic measures which the Committee determines to 
be most appropriate to support the delivery of the Company strategy. A range of measures are used to ensure that the bonus is well 
balanced and rewards the Executive Director for the achievement of a number of different objectives in the year. 
The Committee retains the discretion to adjust bonus payments to reflect the overall financial performance and health of the 
Company and inadequate safety performance or material corporate governance failure.  
Out-turn for 2013 (Audited) 
2013 was a challenging year for the Company. Due to the continuously changing landscape and exceptional circumstances faced by 
the Company, the Committee determined that it was not possible to set meaningful, pre-determined bonus performance measures 
and targets at the start of the year. Instead, it was decided that bonus payments in respect of 2013 would be determined at the year 
end, based on the Committee’s assessment of overall Company performance and in the context of ongoing turbulence in corporate 
affairs and the achievement of key milestones considered pivotal to the Company’s future success.  
Upon careful consideration, the Committee determined that the appropriate bonus out-turn for the CEO in respect of 2013 should 
be 75% of maximum opportunity (112.5% of salary). The Committee considers this level is appropriate to reflect the CEO’s 
exceptional leadership in: 
– bringing the Separation Transaction to a successful conclusion, including obtaining shareholder approval at the EGM in 
December 2013; 
– leading the extensive review at PT Berau, and enhancing internal controls; and 
– the relisting of the Company’s shares, following their temporary suspension.  
   68 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The Committee is mindful that, whilst there have been a number of major achievements over the past 12 months, there is still 
significant progress to be made. However, in the context of the challenges faced by the Company this year, the CEO’s performance 
has been outstanding and instrumental to securing the Company’s future.  
Half of the annual bonus will be deferred into the Company’s shares, which will vest on the third anniversary of grant. The leaver 
provisions applicable to the deferred bonus award are in line with the Policy, as set out earlier in this report.  
2014 performance measures (Unaudited) 
For 2014, the annual bonus performance measures for the CEO will be based 70% on corporate metrics, split between EBITDA 
(30%), production targets (20%), health and safety (10%) and debt refinancing/restructuring (10%). The remaining 30% will be based 
on the Committee’s assessment of achievement of key strategic and personal objectives, including an emphasis on governance 
standards, people and brand and strategic objectives at the Berau level. For EBITDA, half will be measured based on reported 
EBITDA, and half will be adjusted to take into account uncontrollable external factors, such as commodity prices and foreign 
exchange rates. The overall bonus payout will be subject to a compliance and governance underpin, and production targets will  
be subject to a profitability underpin.  
The Board considers the prospective disclosure of these targets to be commercially sensitive, as disclosure would provide 
competitors with an insight of the Company’s strategic plan which may be detrimental to shareholders. Additional details on targets 
and measures will be given at the end of the financial year.  
In the event that exceptional circumstances mean that the pre-determined performance metrics, weightings and/or targets 
become, in the opinion of the Committee, inappropriate, the Committee retains the discretion to adjust and/or replace the 
performance measures and targets as appropriate.  
Long term incentives (Asia Resource Minerals Incentive Plan) (Audited) 
Annual awards of 150% are made to the Executive Director under the long term incentive plan. Awards are delivered in the form of 
Performance Shares under the Asia Resource Minerals Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2011.  
Performance Shares are subject to relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance over a three-year performance against two 
comparator groups, shown in the table below along with the associated targets. In addition, vesting is subject to the Committee 
being satisfied that the vesting outcome suitably reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company over the period.

of share price volatility. 
It is intended that awards for 2014 will be in line with the award policy and performance metrics set out above.  
The first awards under the Asia Resource Minerals Incentive Plan were made in 2012. Awards made to Executive Directors at that 
time have already lapsed in full upon cessation of employment of the relevant Directors (Nalin Rathod in 2012 and Scott Merrillees 
in 2013). There are no awards with performance periods ending in the year.

Awards granted in the year (Audited) 
The following table sets out awards made under the Asia Resource Minerals Incentive Plan during the year. Due to ongoing closed 
periods, the awards, which would normally have been made in the first quarter of 2013, could not be made until December 2013. 
Vesting of these awards will be subject to the relative TSR performance conditions set out above, measured over the three-year 
period from 30 December 2013 to 29 December 2016.

this role at the Company’s 2013 AGM on 26 June 2013. He received no termination payments and all of his awards under the

Notes to the table: 
1. The Committee’s policy is to provide a market competitive benefit package for the size, nature and location of the role. For 2013, the main benefits were private health 
insurance, critical illness and life assurance, and the payment of income tax due on these benefits. In addition, Scott Merrilees received expatriate benefits amounting to 
£70,073, consisting primarily of a housing allowance, a travel allowance and specialist tax advice. 
2. The UK regulations governing directors’ remuneration reporting have changed for 2013 and now require inclusion of benefits where these would be taxable in the UK  
on the assumption that the Directors are taxable in the UK. In line with normal practice, the Company reimburses the costs of Non-Executive Directors’ expenses in 
attending Board meetings. For Non-Executive Directors based overseas, attendance at Board meetings will typically be classed as international travel and hence not 
taxable in the UK. For consistency and to reflect that the expenses are fully incurred in the normal course of business, these business expenses have not been included 
as benefits for any of the Non-Executive Directors. 
3. The first awards under the Asia Resource Minerals Incentive Plan were made in 2012 and are subject to three-year TSR performance. As such there were no long term 
incentives with a performance period ending in 2012 or 2013.

increased as follows: 
– PT Borneo’s holding in Asia Resource Minerals plc increased to 57,235,656, resulting in an increase in Mr Tan’s 60.73% shareholding to 34,759,214 shares.

External advisors (Unaudited) 
The Committee retained Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”) to provide independent advice to the Committee on all aspects of executive 
reward. Following making a formal presentation to the Committee, Deloitte were formally appointed as advisers to the Committee 
in 2011. Advice provided in the year included guidance on the new reporting regulations, market data and other remuneration 
matters and total fees in relation to advice that materially assisted the committee were £44,658.  
In addition, Deloitte also provided the Company with assistance regarding immigration and employment tax services. 
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Code is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, 
competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte 
engagement partner and team do not have connections with Asia Resource Minerals plc that may impair their independence and 
that the advice they have received from Deloitte has been objective and independent. 
The Committee also received input during the year from the CEO, the General Counsel and Company Secretary and other 
Independent Non-Executive Directors (Sir Richard Gozney, Graham Holdaway and Lord Renwick). No individual plays a part in the 
determination of their own remuneration.  
Shareholder voting (Unaudited) 
The table below sets out the result of the advisory vote on the 2012 Directors’ Remuneration Report at the June 2013 AGM: 
For Against Abstentions 
67% 31% 2%  
The Directors understand that the large vote against the Remuneration Report related primarily to certain shareholder concerns 
about the challenges the Company faced as a result of non-compliance with its policies and lack of disclosure by former PT Berau 
management. The Directors’ response to these concerns has been addressed earlier in the Annual Report. 
The Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 11 April 2014 and signed on its behalf by:

(and controlled shall be construed accordingly); 
“Group” means the Company and its subsidiary undertakings 
and parent undertakings and any subsidiary undertakings of any

respects and no action shall be taken by the Company in 
relation to, or offer made by the Company to the holders of,  
the Voting Ordinary Shares unless the same action is taken in 
respect of, or the same offer is made to the holders of, the 
Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares. Subject to this, the rights 
and restrictions attaching to the Suspended Voting Ordinary 
Shares are set out below. 
1. On a distribution of profits (whether by cash dividend,

For the purposes of any resolution of a type referred to

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
6. Upon: 
a. a transfer of Voting Ordinary Shares by either Seller  
or an Affiliate to a person who is not an Affiliate or a 
Seller; or 
b. any issue of further shares by the Company as a result 
of which the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding is reduced 
below the Maximum Voting Percentage, such number  
of Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares as, immediately 
following conversion, will result in the Sellers’ Voting 
Shareholding being equal to the Maximum Voting 
Percentage, shall convert into Voting Ordinary Shares 
(on a one for one basis) automatically upon, and 
contemporaneously with, registration by the Company 
(or its registrar) of the transfer in the register of 
members of the Company following receipt of a duly 
executed transfer form and the share certificates in 
respect of such Voting Ordinary Shares or the issue of 
such further shares. In any such case, a proportionate 
number of each holder’s holding of Suspended Voting 
Ordinary Shares, also taking into account the conversion 
into Voting Ordinary Shares of any other suspended 
voting ordinary shares issued on terms substantially 
equivalent to the terms of the Suspended Voting 
Ordinary Shares, shall be so converted (in each case 
rounded up or down to the nearest whole number as 
determined by any Director in his absolute discretion). 
7. At any time, either Seller (or any Affiliate) shall be entitled 
(but shall not be bound) to require the Company to convert 
Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares into Voting Ordinary 
Shares, on a one for one basis, so long as such conversion 
does not result in the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding being 
more than the Maximum Voting Percentage. 
8. Within 21 days after the conversion of any Suspended Voting 
Ordinary Shares into Voting Ordinary Shares, the Company 
shall forward to the relevant Seller or Affiliate (as the case 
may be), at its own risk, free of charge, a definitive certificate 
for the appropriate number of fully paid up Voting Ordinary 
Shares and a new certificate for any unconverted Suspended 
Voting Ordinary Shares comprised in the certificate 
surrendered by it. Pending the despatch of definitive 
certificates, transfers shall be certified against the register 
of members of the Company. 
9. The Company shall use best endeavours to procure that  
the Voting Ordinary Shares arising on conversion of the 
Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares are admitted to the 
Official List and to trading on London Stock Exchange plc’s 
main market for listed securities. 
10. No admission to listing or admission to trading shall be 
sought for the Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares whilst 
they remain Suspended Voting Ordinary Shares. 
Voting rights 
Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on  
a show of hands every member who is present in person shall 
have one vote and on a poll every member present in person  
or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is  
the holder. 
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, 
either in person or by proxy, unless all moneys presently 
payable by him in respect of shares in the Company have  
been paid. 
If at any time the Board is satisfied that any member, or any 
other person appearing to be interested in shares held by such 
member, has been duly served with a notice under section 793 
of the Companies Act 2006 and is in default for the prescribed 
period in supplying to the Company the information thereby 
required, or, in purported compliance with such a notice, has 
made a statement which is false or inadequate in a material 
particular, then the Board may, in its absolute discretion at  
any time thereafter by notice to such member direct that in 
respect of the shares in relation to which the default occurred, 
the member shall not be entitled to attend or vote either 
personally or by proxy at a general meeting or at a separate 
meeting of the holders of that class of shares or on a poll. 
Restrictions on transfer of shares 
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares in 
the Company other than: 
(i) the right of the Board to refuse to register the transfer of  
a certificated share that is not fully paid, provided that the 
refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the Company 
from taking place on an open and proper basis. The Board 
may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer (a) is lodged, duly 
stamped (if applicable), at the office or at another place 
appointed by the Board accompanied by the certificate for 
the share to which it relates and such other evidence as  
the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer; (b) is in respect of only  
one class of shares; and (c) is in favour of not more than  
four transferees; 
(ii) pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code whereby the 
Directors of the Company require, and certain employees 
require, approval to deal in the Company’s shares; 
(iii) certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by 
laws and regulations; and 
(iv) where a person whose shares represent at least a 0.25% 
interest in the Company’s shares has been served with a 
disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares, except as 
provided in the Articles. 
   77 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
On 19 December 2012, the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers 
announced that the Bakrie Group and Bukit Mutiara should  
be regarded as concert parties. The Panel further ruled that  
the aggregate voting interests of the Bakrie Group and Bukit 
Mutiara, and any persons acting in concert with them (which,  
in relation to the Bakrie Group, included Borneo due to the  
joint venture structure through which Borneo and the Bakrie 
Group held their shares in Asia Resource Minerals plc), must be 
reduced to less than 30% of the voting rights in Asia Resource 
Minerals plc by way of disposal. Accordingly, until a disposal of 
its shares was effected by Bukit Mutiara on 18 February 2013, 
all of the shares held by Bukit Mutiara and some of the shares 
held by the Bakrie Group were disenfranchised and the voting 
rights attaching to such shares could not be exercised.  
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders 
of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. 
Appointment and replacement of Directors 
The rules for the replacement and appointment of Directors are 
set out in the Articles of Association.  
Under the terms of a relationship agreement entered into by  
the Company and the Bakrie Group on 16 June 2011 and a 
relationship agreement entered into by the Company and Bukit 
Mutiara on 16 June 2011, the Bakrie Group could nominate  
up to three directors, to hold the positions of Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively, and 
Bukit Mutiara could nominate one non-executive director, 
subject to each of the Bakrie Group and Bukit Mutiara retaining 
control of 15% of the votes able to be cast at general meetings 
of the Company. The relationship agreement with Bukit Mutiara 
terminated on 18 February 2013. The relationship agreement 
with the Bakrie Group terminated on 25 March 2014.  
Under the terms of a relationship agreement entered into 
between RACL, Borneo (together, the “Principal Shareholder”) 
and the Company (the “Borneo Relationship Agreement”),  
the Principal Shareholder can nominate (a) two non-executive 
directors to the Board (“Principal Shareholder Directors”)  
and (b) such number of independent non-executive directors 
(“Nominated Independent Directors”) so that the total number 
of Nominated Independent Directors would, if appointed, 
comprise up to half the total number of independent non-
executive directors on the Board following such appointment(s). 
The appointment of any Nominated Independent Director  
may be objected to by the Nomination Committee in certain 
circumstances. The Principal Shareholder has the right to have 
one Principal Shareholder Director on each of the Nomination 
and HSEC Committees and one Nominated Independent 
Director on each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
The Borneo Relationship Agreement terminates if, among other 
matters, the Principal Shareholder and their Associates cease 
together to hold at least 23.5% or more of the votes able to be 
cast on all or substantially all matters at general meetings  
of the Company. In respect of any approval of a Nominated 
Independent Director, any Principal Shareholder Director on  
the Nomination Committee will not be entitled to vote. Under 
the terms of the Borneo Relationship Agreement, following 
completion of the Separation Transaction, the Principal  
Shareholder Directors currently appointed to the Board are 
Samin Tan and Alexander Ramlie and the Principal Shareholder 
Director currently appointed to the Nomination Committee is 
Samin Tan. 
Under the terms of the proposed relationship agreement 
between Mr Rothschild, NR Holdings Limited (together, 
“Rothschild”) and the Company (the “Rothschild Relationship 
Agreement”), which is subject to approval by the Company’s 
shareholders, Rothschild may nominate for appointment  
to the Board one independent non-executive director. The 
appointment of such independent non-executive director is 
subject to approval by the Company’s Nomination Committee. 
Articles of Association 
The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution 
of the shareholders. 
Powers of the Directors 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company’s 
Articles of Association and to any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company shall be managed by 
the Board, which may exercise all the powers of the Company. 
Directors 
The Directors of the Company are listed on pages 42 and 43. 
There have been significant changes to the composition of the

Significant Agreements 
1. Separation Transaction 
On 12 February 2013, the Company announced that a heads  
of terms agreement had been entered into regarding the 
separation of the Company from the Bakrie Group and PT Bumi. 
The terms of the transaction allowed the Company to divest its 
entire stake in PT Bumi, remove the Bakrie Group from the 
Company and incorporated an obligation for the Bakrie Group  
to provide a US$50 million deposit. 
On 10 and 11 July 2013, the Company announced that an 
alternative arrangement had been proposed whereby the 
Separation Transaction would be effected through the sale to 
the Bakrie Group of the Company’s 29.2% interest in PT Bumi 
for over US$500 million and the acquisition of the Bakrie 
Group’s indirect 23.8% interest in the Company by Borneo 
(expected at the time to be acquired through its indirect 
subsidiary, Ravenwood Pte Limited (“Ravenwood”)). The 
acquisition by Borneo would be conditional upon, amongst  
other things, the approval by the Company’s independent 
shareholders of (i) the sale to the Bakrie Group of the 
Company’s 29.2% interest in PT Bumi and (ii) the waiver of the 
requirement under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and 
Mergers for Borneo or any of its affiliates to make a general 
offer for the shares of the Company that they do not already 
own. The Company also clarified that it was not a party to the 
discussions between its shareholders. 
On 18 July 2013, it was announced that (a) the Company and 
Vallar Investments UK Ltd (“VIUK”, a subsidiary of the Company) 
had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Long Haul 
Holdings Ltd. (“LHH”), a Bakrie-controlled entity, for the sale  
of the Company’s 29.2% interest in PT Bumi to the Bakrie  
Group for US$501million in cash (“PT Bumi Resource Sale 
Transaction”), (b) the Company also intended to complete  
the negotiation of a relationship agreement with Borneo  
and Ravenwood, (c) the resolutions required to effect the 
Separation Transaction would require the approval of a  
majority of independent shareholders, and (d) a circular  
would be sent to shareholders ahead of a General Meeting  
to approve the Separation Transaction.  
On 7 November 2013, the Company issued a circular to 
shareholders (a) detailing the proposed Separation Transaction 
from the Bakrie Group and PT Bumi, including the proposed 
relationship agreement with Borneo and RACL (a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Ravenwood), (b) proposing the Company change  
its name from Bumi plc to Asia Resource Minerals plc, and (c) 
convening a shareholders’ meeting to be held on 4 December 
2013 (the “EGM”). A condition of the Separation Transaction  
was that the INEDs were to be provided with copies of, and be 
satisfied with the terms of, any relevant financing agreement or 
arrangement entered into by RACL to finance its acquisition of 
the suspended voting ordinary shares in the Company by no 
later than 20 November 2013 (the "SPA Financing Condition"). 
The SPA Financing Condition was not satisfied by 20 November 
2013 and the Company agreed to adjourn the EGM and extend 
the period by which the SPA Financing Condition needed to be 
satisfied to 29 November 2013. The SPA Financing Condition 
was satisfied by this date and a supplemental circular to 
shareholders was issued on 3 December 2013 (“Supplemental 
Circular”) reconvening the EGM on 17 December 2013. 
On 13 December 2013, the Company announced that Mr 
Rothschild had indicated a wish to support the Separation 
Transaction and enter into a relationship agreement with  
the Company following the completion of the Separation 
Transaction which, subject to his shareholding remaining  
above 15% and the relationship agreement being approved by 
the shareholders of the Company, would grant Mr Rothschild 
the right to nominate an INED for appointment to the Board.  
The Company also announced that it understood that, subject  
to the completion of the proposed Separation Transaction,  
Mr Tan would take such action as he is able to, to procure that 
RACL and Borneo vote in favour of such relationship agreement. 
In addition it was announced that Mr Rothschild and various 
connected parties have also agreed not to pursue claims made 
in an unfair prejudice petition.  
At the EGM held on 17 December 2013, all resolutions put to the 
meeting were approved and the Separation Transaction was 
completed on 25 March 2014.  
2. Relationship Agreements 
Borneo Relationship Agreement  
The Company entered into the Borneo Relationship Agreement 
on 4 November 2013 and this agreement came into force on 
completion of the Separation Transaction. The purpose of the 
Borneo Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the Company 
is capable at all times of carrying on its business independently 
of the Principal Shareholder (and their respective associates) 
and that all transactions and relationships between the 
Company and the Principal Shareholder are at arm’s length  
and on a normal commercial basis.  
The Borneo Relationship Agreement will terminate if, among 
other things, the Company ceases to have any of its ordinary 
shares listed on the Official List and traded on London Stock 
Exchange’s main market for listed securities or the Principal 
Shareholder together with its associates ceases to be entitled to 
exercise or control the exercise of 23.5% of more of the votes 
available to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general 
meetings of the Company.  
   79 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Principal Shareholder will, and will procure so far as it  
is reasonably able to do so that its associates will, among  
other things: 
(a) exercise all of their voting rights so as to ensure that at  
all times either (i) independent non-executive directors 
comprise the majority of the board, or (ii) the chairman  
of the Company is an independent non-executive director 
and independent non-executive directors (including the 
chairman) make up at least half of the board; 
(b) not take any action which precludes or inhibits any member 
of the Group from carrying on its business independently of 
the Principal Shareholder and/or their associates; 
(c) exercise their rights and powers to ensure that the  
Company is managed in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, save as otherwise contemplated in  
the Borneo Relationship Agreement or to the extent 
unanimously agreed by the independent non-executive 
directors of the Company; 
(d) conduct all transactions and relationships with members  
of the Group on an arm’s length and on a normal 
commercial basis; 
(e) ensure that all arrangements and agreements between the 
Principal Shareholder or any of their associates and/or any 
of the non-executive directors of the Company nominated 
for appointment to the board by the Principal Shareholder 
(on the one hand) and the Company or any other member of 
the Group (on the other) are entered into on arms’ length 
and on a normal commercial basis; 
(f) if the Listing Rules are amended to require a relationship 
agreement that restricts the Principal Shareholder and their 
associates from holding shares in the Group (other than the 
Company), not hold or acquire a material shareholding in 
any of the Company’s significant subsidiaries except for 
acquisitions arising from a mandatory obligation imposed  
by law or regulation and the Principal Shareholder will act 
reasonably in amending the Borneo Relationship Agreement 
to comply with the final amended and published Listing 
Rules on this matter; 
(g) abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a related 
party transaction (as defined in the Listing Rules) involving 
the Principal Shareholder and/or any of their respective 
associates as the related party; 
(h) abstain from doing anything which would have the effect of 
preventing the Company from complying with its obligations 
under the Listing Rules; and 
(i) comply with all provisions of the Listing Rules, Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, the requirements of the London 
Stock Exchange and the FSMA that apply to it in connection 
with the Company. 
The Principal Shareholder has certain director nomination 
rights as set out above in the section of this Directors’ Report 
entitled “Appointment and replacement of Directors” and as 
described in further detail in the Circular. 
Proposed Rothschild Relationship Agreement 
The principal purpose of the proposed Rothschild Relationship 
Agreement, which is subject to such agreement being  
approved by the shareholders of the Company, is to regulate  
the relationship between the Company and Rothschild. The 
Rothschild Relationship Agreement will terminate if, among 
other things, the Company ceases to have any of its ordinary 
shares listed on the Official List and traded on London Stock 
Exchange’s main market for listed securities or Rothschild 
together with its associates ceases to be entitled to exercise  
or control the exercise of 15% of more of the votes available to 
be cast on all or substantially all matters at general meetings  
of the Company. 
Rothschild will, and will procure so far as it is reasonably able  
to do so that its associates will, amongst other things: 
(a) not take any action which precludes or inhibits any member 
of the Group from carrying on its business independently of 
Rothschild and/or its associates; 
(b) exercise its rights and powers to ensure that the Company is 
managed in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, save as otherwise contemplated in the Rothschild 
Relationship Agreement or to the extent unanimously 
agreed by the independent non-executive directors of  
the Company; 
(c) conduct all transactions and relationships with members  
of the Group on an arm’s length and on a normal 
commercial basis; 
(d) ensure that all arrangements and agreements between 
Rothschild and/or any of its associates and the Company or 
any other member of the Group (on the other) are entered 
into on arms’ length and on a normal commercial basis; 
(e) abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a related 
party transaction (as defined in the Listing Rules) involving 
Rothschild and/or any of its respective associates as the 
related party; 
(f) abstain from doing anything which would have the effect of 
preventing the Company from complying with its obligations 
under the Listing Rules; and 
(g) comply with all provisions of the Listing Rules, Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, the requirements of the London 
Stock Exchange and the FSMA that apply to it in connection 
with the Company. 
It is proposed that Rothschild will have certain director 
nomination rights as set out above in the section of this 
Directors’ Report entitled “Appointment and replacement  
of Directors”.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Bakrie Relationship Agreement and Mutiara  
Relationship Agreement 
The Company was a party to a relationship agreement with (i) 
members of the Bakrie Group dated 16 June 2011 (the “Bakrie 
Relationship Agreement”) and (ii) Bukit Mutiara dated 16 June 
2011 (the “Mutiara Relationship Agreement”). The Mutiara 
Relationship Agreement terminated on 18 February 2013 and 
the Bakrie Relationship Agreement terminated on 25 March 
2014 on the completion of the Separation Transaction. The 
Bakrie Relationship Agreement and the Mutiara Relationship 
Agreement are together referred to herein as the “Terminated 
Relationship Agreements”. 
The principal purpose of the Terminated Relationship 
Agreements was to ensure that the Company was capable at all 
times of carrying on its business independently of the Bakrie 
Group and of Bukit Mutiara (and their respective associates) and 
that all transactions and relationships between the Company 
and either members of the Bakrie Group or Bukit Mutiara were 
at arm’s length and on a normal commercial basis. The Bakrie 
Relationship Agreement provided that it would terminate on the 
earlier of (a) the Company ceasing to have any of its ordinary 
shares listed on the Official List and traded on the London Stock 
Exchange’s main market for listed securities and (b) the Bakrie 
Group together with its associates ceasing to be entitled to 
exercise or control the exercise of 10% of more of the votes 
available to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general 
meetings of the Company. The Mutiara Relationship Agreement 
contained equivalent termination provisions, in relation to Bukit 
Mutiara rather than the Bakrie Group.  
Pursuant to the terms of the Terminated Relationship 
Agreements, it was agreed, among other things, that:  
(a)  the Bakrie Group and Bukit Mutiara (in respect of the 
applicable Terminated Relationship Agreement, the 
“Relationship Party”) would, and would procure so far as it 
is reasonably able to do so that each of its associates would; 
(i) conduct all transactions and relationships with any  
member of the Group, and ensure that all arrangements 
and agreements between the Relationship Party or any of  
its associates and the Company or any other member of the 
Group were entered into, on arm’s length terms and on a 
normal commercial basis; 
(ii) not take any action which precluded or inhibited any 
member of the Group from carrying on its business 
independently of the Relationship Party and its associates; 
(iii) not exercise any of its voting rights or other rights and 
powers to procure any amendment to the Articles of 
Association of the Company which would be inconsistent 
with or breach any provision of the applicable Terminated 
Relationship Agreement or the ability of any member of  
the Group to carry on its business independently of the 
Relationship Party and its associates; 
(iv) when paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the Listing Rules applied to 
the Company, abstain from voting on any resolution required 
by paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the Listing Rules to approve a 
“related party transaction” (as defined in paragraph 11.1.5R 
of the Listing Rules) involving the Relationship Party or any 
of its associates as the related party; 
(v) comply with all provisions of the Listing Rules, the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the requirements of the 
London Stock Exchange and the FSMA, that applied to it in 
connection with the Company;  
(vi) not do anything within their power to cause or authorise  
to be done anything which would prejudice either the 
Company’s status as a listed company or its suitability for 
listing, or listing on the premium listing segment of the 
Official List; and 
(b) provided that the Relationship Party and its associates were 
entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 15% or more of 
the votes able to be cast on all or substantially all matters at 
general meetings of the Company, the Relationship Party 
was entitled to nominate for appointment to the board of 
directors of the Company: in the case of Bukit Mutiara, one 
director (to hold the position of non-executive director) and, 
in the case of the Bakrie Group, three directors (one to hold 
the position of Chairman, one to hold the position of Chief 
Executive Office and one to holder the position of Chief 
Financial Officer), in each case by giving notice to the 
Company; and 
(c) pursuant to the Bakrie Relationship Agreement, provided 
that the Bakrie Group and its associates were entitled to 
exercise or control the exercise of 15% or more of the votes 
able to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general 
meetings of the Company, the Bakrie Group was entitled  
to nominate for appointment the President Commissioner 
and the President Director and a majority of the Board  
of Commissioners and directors of PT Bumi and the 
Company would take all such steps as were available to  
it under Indonesian law to seek to appoint the President 
Commissioner and/or President Director of PT Bumi, as  
the case may be, in accordance with the nomination of the 
Bakrie Group; and 
(d) the Relationship Party was restricted from voting on 
transactions where there was a conflict of interest between 
it and the Group. 
3. The Roeslani Agreement 
On 26 June 2013, the Company announced that it and PT Berau  
had entered into an agreement (the “Roeslani Agreement”) with 
Rosan Roeslani, the former President Director of PT Berau, 
pursuant to which:  
– Mr Roeslani undertook to transfer, or procure the transfer,  
to PT Berau (or to such other entity or entities as PT Berau 
and the Company may direct) of assets and cash with a 
value equal to US$173 million; and 
   81 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
– subject to and conditional upon Mr Roeslani transferring  
the assets and cash to PT Berau (or to such other entity  
or entities as PT Berau and the Company may direct), the 
Company and PT Berau agreed to waive the potential claims 
they may have against Mr Roeslani in respect of payments 
totaling US$201 million that were made by PT Berau during 
2011 and 2012 that had no clear business purpose and have 
been specified as such in the Annual Report 2012 (“Potential 
Claims”) (the “Waiver”). The Waiver is on a dollar for dollar 
basis until the value of the assets and cash transferred is 
equal to US$173 million, whereupon Mr Roeslani's liability  
in respect of the Potential Claims will be extinguished.  
Any shortfall in the value of the assets transferred below 
US$173 million (including if any such assets are not 
transferred) is required to be satisfied in cash. 
The Roeslani Agreement provides that an initial transfer of 
US$30 million in cash was to be made by Mr Roeslani before  
26 September 2013. Mr Roeslani failed to make this interim 
payment by the required date and is disputing the required 
timing for payment of this amount under the Roeslani 
Agreement. The Company does not agree with Mr Roeslani's 
interpretation of the Roeslani Agreement in relation to the 
required timing for this payment and commenced arbitration 
proceedings in Singapore in accordance with the terms of the 
Roeslani Agreement against Mr Roeslani in relation to payment 
of this amount. 
On 5 December 2013, the Company announced that Mr Roeslani 
was now contending that any outstanding liability to transfer  
any cash or assets under the Roeslani Agreement had been 
extinguished. Mr Roeslani therefore did not make any payment 
or meet any of his obligations under the Roeslani Agreement by 
the further deadline in the Roeslani Agreement of 26 December 
2013. Having considered all the alternatives, the Company  
and PT Berau concluded that they would seek to compel Mr 
Roeslani to make full payment of US$173 million plus interest 
and enforce their rights through the arbitration in Singapore. 
The arbitration has therefore been extended to include a  
claim for the full amount of US$173 million plus interest and  
is ongoing. The arbitration is confidential in accordance with  
the Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre  
and the Company will provide updates when it is able to do so. 
Other Significant Agreements 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to disclose  
the following significant agreements that contain provisions 
entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other 
rights in the event of a change of control of the Company: 
7.25% Guaranteed Senior Secured Notes 
On 13 March 2012, PT Berau issued $500 million aggregate 
principal amount of 7.25% guaranteed senior secured notes  
(the “7.25% Guaranteed Senior Secured Notes”). PT Berau’s 
obligations under the 7.25% Guaranteed Senior Secured  
Notes are guaranteed by certain other members of the  
PT Berau Group. The maturity date of the notes is 13 March 
2017. The notes bear interest from 13 March 2012 at the rate  
of 7.25% per annum, payable semi-annually every 13 March  
and 13 September commencing on 13 September 2012. 
PT Berau must make an offer to repurchase all of the 7.25% 
Guaranteed Senior Secured Notes outstanding at a purchase 
price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued  
and unpaid interest, no later than 30 days after a “change  
of control”. For these purposes, a change of control is the 
occurrence of any of the following events: 
(i) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of PT Berau 
with or into another entity or the merger or amalgamation  
of another entity with or into PT Berau, or the sale of all or 
substantially all the assets of PT Berau to another entity, 
other than Asia Resource Minerals plc and its affiliates; 
(ii) Asia Resource Minerals plc and its associates are the 
beneficial owners of less than 50.1% of the total voting 
power of the voting stock of PT Berau; 
(iii) individuals who on 13 March 2012 constituted the Board of 
Directors of PT Berau, together with any new Directors 
whose election was approved by a vote of at least a majority 
of the Directors then still in office who were either Directors 
or whose election was previously so approved, cease for any 
reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors 
then in office; or 
(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or 
dissolution of PT Berau. 
12.5% Guaranteed Senior Secured Notes 
On 8 July 2010, Berau Capital Resources Pte. Ltd. (“Berau 
Capital”), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of PT Berau,  
issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 12.5% 
guaranteed senior secured notes. Berau Capital also issued an 
additional $100 million aggregate principal amount of 12.5% 
guaranteed senior secured notes on 29 July 2010 (together  
with the $350 million aggregate principal amount of 12.5% 
guaranteed senior secured notes, the “12.5% Guaranteed 
Senior Secured Notes”). PT Berau Capital’s obligations under 
the 12.5% Guaranteed Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed  
by PT Berau and certain of its subsidiaries and subsidiary 
undertakings (collectively known as the “PT Berau Group”).  
The maturity date of the notes is 8 July 2015. The notes bear 
interest from 8 July 2010 at the rate of 12.5% per annum, 
payable semi-annually every 8 January and 8 July commencing 
on 8 January 2011. 
Berau Capital must make an offer to repurchase all of the 
12.5% Guaranteed Senior Secured Notes outstanding at a 
purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus 
accrued and unpaid interest, no later than 30 days after a 
“change of control”. For these purposes, a change of control  
is the occurrence of any of the following events: 
(i) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of PT Berau 
with or into another entity or the merger or amalgamation  
of another entity with or into PT Berau, or the sale of all or 
substantially all the assets of PT Berau to another entity, 
other than Asia Resource Minerals plc and its affiliates; 
(ii) PT Recapital Advisors and its affiliates are the beneficial 
owners of less than 50.1% of the total voting power of the 
voting stock of PT Berau;

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
(iii) individuals who on 8 July 2010 constituted the Board of 
Directors of PT Berau, together with any new Directors 
whose election was approved by a vote of at least a majority 
of the Directors then still in office who were either Directors 
or whose election was previously so approved, cease for  
any reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors 
then in office; or 
(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or 
dissolution of PT Berau. 
The acquisition by the Group of its interest in PT Berau (the 
“Berau Transaction”) constituted a change of control under the 
indentures governing the 12.5% Guaranteed Senior Secured 
Notes. Berau Capital made a change of control offer for all of 
such notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued  
and unpaid interest within the requisite 30 day period. At the  
end of the acceptance period for that offer, no note holder had 
accepted the offer. 
Political donations 
The Group made no political donations during the year.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual  
Report, the Directors' Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements, comprising the consolidated financial statements 
and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
– make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
– state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the  
European Union have been followed, subject to any  
material departures disclosed and explained in the  
financial statements; and 
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006  
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.  
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess  
a Company's performance, business model and strategy.  
In assessing the Group’s going concern status, the Directors 
have taken into account the factors set out in the Operating 
Review, Financial Review and Principal Risks and Uncertainties, 
the Group’s cash balances, borrowings, cash flow projections, 
current commodity prices and the market’s future price 
expectations. The Directors have also considered the  
Group’s operating cost profile, its capital expenditure and 
financing plans. 
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. They therefore continue to adopt  
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing their 
financial statements. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed  
in the Remuneration Report confirm that, to the best of  
their knowledge: 
– the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
loss of the Group; and 
– the Strategic Report and Directors' Reports contained in  
the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties that it faces.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS PLC
Report on financial statements 
Our opinion 
In our opinion: 
– The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s loss and cash flows  
for the year then ended; 
– The Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
– The Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
– The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. 
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the 
remainder of this report. 
What we have audited 
The Group financial statements and Parent Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared by 
Asia Resource Minerals plc, comprise: 
– the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheet as at  
31 December 2013; 
– the Consolidated Income Statement and Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year then ended; 
– the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of  
Changes in Equity and Statements of Cash Flows for the  
year then ended; and 
– the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006. 
In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors  
have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such 
estimates, they have made assumptions and considered  
future events. 
Certain disclosures, including Directors’ Remuneration, 
required by the financial reporting framework have been 
presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts 
(“Annual Report”), rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are identified as audited. 
What an audit of financial statements involves  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)).  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
– whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the  
Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
– the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and  
– the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Overview of our audit approach 
Materiality 
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to 
determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
and to evaluate the effect of misstatements both individually and 
on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be 
USD 5.25 million which represents 3% of Underlying EBITDA, 
which we have determined to be the relevant measure of 
underlying performance.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report  
to them misstatements identified during our audit above  
USD 0.5 million as well as misstatements below that amount 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Overview of the scope of our audit 
The Group comprises UK and Jersey based holding and  
service companies and the Indonesian based operations held  
by PT Berau Coal Energy Tbk and its subsidiaries (‘PT Berau’). 
The Group continues to hold its investment in PT Bumi 
Resources Tbk as an available for sale financial asset. 
In establishing the overall scope and approach to the group 
audit, we determined the type of work that we required to be 
performed at each company in the group by us, as the group 
engagement team, or PwC Indonesia operating under our 
instruction. Where the work was performed by PwC Indonesia, 
we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in 
their audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for  
our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.   86 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS PLC CONTINUED
Accordingly, a full scope audit was performed on PT Berau’s 
financial information as it represents the principal business  
in the Group. Specific audit procedures on certain balances  
and transactions were performed at the UK and Jersey based 
intermediate holding and service companies and in respect of 
the group consolidation 
In the course of our audit, we tested and examined information, 
using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent  
we considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us  
to draw conclusions. In view of the maturity of the systems  
of control over financial reporting at PT Berau during 2013  
we considered it appropriate for our audit to be performed  
using substantive testing procedures, rather than testing  
the effectiveness of management’s controls. 
Areas of particular audit focus 
We identified the following areas as those requiring particular 
audit focus, based on issues arising in prior financial reporting 
periods and where the directors have made significant subjective 
judgements, for example accounting estimates based on 
assumptions, including future events that are inherently 
uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by 
assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in 
the financial statements. 
We discussed these areas of particular audit focus with the Audit 
Committee. Their report on those matters that they considered 
to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is 
set out on page 53. 
Area of focus: Risk of management override of internal controls  
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this risk. This 
represents a particular risk in view of the apparent financial 
irregularities and expenditure for which no clear business 
purpose could be established, disclosed in the 2012 Annual 
Report and referenced in an Emphasis of Matter in our  
2012 opinion.  
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
In view of the issues encountered in the prior financial  
reporting period, we performed extensive testing of transactions 
during the year and at the year-end, with a particular focus  
on expenditure on hauling roads and other construction  
in progress, land related payments and expenditure on 
consulting services.  
In addition, we tested the appropriateness of manual journal 
entries. We considered whether there was evidence of bias  
by the directors in the significant accounting estimates and 
judgements relevant to the financial statements. We also 
interviewed the senior management team in respect of  
fraud and understand, in particular, the nature of material 
transactions and their business rationale. Additionally, we 
obtained representations from the directors. 
Area of focus: Risk of fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure management may feel to 
achieve the planned results. We focused on management’s 
ability to override controls to manipulate revenue. We also 
focused on the risk that the quality and therefore value of the 
coal sold, particularly at the period end, could be inconsistent 
with that reported, resulting in inflated revenues and profits 
before it is realised by the counterparty and adjusted in a  
subsequent period. Several contracts are also subject  
to provisional pricing terms which may result in 
under/overstatement of revenues. 
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus  
We performed testing of sales transactions based on vouching  
a sample back to supporting invoices and cash. We also 
performed testing over the appropriateness of manual journal 
entries affecting revenue by obtaining supporting evidence and 
an understanding of the rationale. 
To address the risk that the quality of coal sold may be 
manipulated we tested for refunds applied or credit notes  
raised in respect of 2013 sales. We also inspected legal 
correspondence for evidence of damages or penalties being 
sought in respect of mis-selling of coal. We also checked 
provisional pricing estimates to final agreed prices to test that 
adjustments were recognised in the appropriate financial 
reporting period. 
Area of focus: Consolidation and financial statement  
close process 
There is a history of a significant number of necessary 
adjustments being recorded by PT Berau late in the year end 
reporting process. As these adjustments are manually entered 
into a spreadsheet, this increases the risk of input error in the 
preparation of the financial statements. 
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
We tested journal adjustments booked over the course of the 
year as well as those booked post year end to supporting 
evidence obtained directly or through the reporting received 
from PwC Indonesia. We also tested the mathematical accuracy 
of the consolidation. 
Area of focus: Impairment of goodwill and mining properties  
The group’s non-current assets, which are predominantly 
goodwill and mining properties, are material and their value  
is sensitive to changes in the commercial environment. 
Determination of any potential impairment requires that the 
directors make a number of significant judgements including  
the use of estimates and assumptions regarding reserves and 
resources (including the probability of the CCoW extension), 
production forecasts and forecasts of operating costs, sales 
prices and capital expenditure.  
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
We tested management’s pricing assumptions, against a range 
of third party bank and broker forecasts to assess whether they 
are in a reasonable range based on the expectations of a typical 
market participant. We also tested the discount rate applied  
and are satisfied that they have been appropriately derived from 
market data including risk free rate and inflation assumptions. 
We also assessed the reasonableness of management’s 
production assumptions by comparing them against a report 
from independent third party mining experts commissioned by 
management to assist in the development of their ‘life of mine’ 
plan and we also met with these experts to discuss their work. 
We obtained evidence to support other key inputs into the model 
such as contractor cost assumptions, based on contracts,  
and obtained evidence to support the reasonableness of 
management’s capital expenditure assumptions. We also tested 
the integrity of the valuation model, including the formulae 
applied in the model.  87 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Area of focus: Capitalisation and subsequent valuation of 
construction in progress and land related payments 
The Group’s other non-current assets relating to construction  
in progress and acquisition of land are material. There are a 
number of areas where management judgement impacts the 
carrying value of these assets. These include: the decision to 
capitalise or expense certain costs, the timing of the transfer 
from assets in the course of construction to property, plant and 
equipment, and the recoverability of the amounts capitalised 
through future use of the relevant asset.  
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
We tested construction in progress expenditure in the year  
to assess whether it met capitalisation criteria in accordance 
with IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and the Group’s 
accounting policies and performed physical verification,  
as applicable.  
We obtained evidence, including invoices, contracts and cash 
payments to support the recording of land acquisition costs  
and assessed management’s key judgements about the 
recoverability of the capitalised balances, including the purpose 
and expected timing of usage of the land according to the ‘life of 
mine’ plan. 
Area of focus: Disclosure of related party transactions 
Notwithstanding the appointment of a new management team  
in 2013 and the implementation of new related party procedures  
at PT Berau, following the qualification in our audit opinion on 
the Group’s 2012 financial statements, the completeness of the 
Group’s related party disclosures remained an area of focus for 
the 2013 audit.  
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
We obtained details of transactions and contractual 
arrangements entered into in the year from management.  
We performed procedures to assess the completeness of the 
information by obtaining and assessing transaction listings from 
the Group’s ledgers and independently determining whether  
the counterparties were related parties based on the definitions 
within IAS 24 ‘Related party disclosures’. We also considered 
information obtained from other procedures performed as part 
of our audit work, and from work performed by Internal Audit. 
We tested the disclosures in the Group financial statements 
against the requirement of IAS 24, and obtained representation 
from the directors regarding completeness of the disclosures.  
Area of focus: Uncertain current tax exposures and related 
provisions and the calculation of deferred tax 
We focused on this area because tax exposures can change 
materially as a result of the evolution of tax policy, legislation 
and interpretations by management and tax authorities. 
We also considered that there was a risk of error in the 
calculation of the deferred tax calculation due to the complexity 
and manual nature of the calculations. 
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
We tested the assumptions and key judgements taken by 
management in calculating the current tax exposures, 
considering new tax legislation and our understanding of 
developments in the interpretation of tax legislation. 
We also inspected correspondence between management and 
the tax authorities and considered this in the context of accruals 
recorded by management. 
We tested the assumptions made in respect of the recognition  
of deferred taxes and audited the underlying deferred  
tax calculations. 
Going Concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement, set out on page 83, in relation to going concern.  
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s financial statements using the going concern 
basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the 
Group and Parent Company have adequate resources to remain 
in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at 
least one year from the date the financial statements were 
signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ 
use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a  
going concern. 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
– the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the  
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; 
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be  
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006; and 
– the information given in the Governance Report set out on 
pages 45 to 51 in the Annual Report with respect to internal 
control and risk management systems and about share 
capital structures is consistent with the financial statements. 
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion: 
– we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or 
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
– the Parent Company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law have not been made. We have no exceptions to 
report arising from this responsibility.

Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, a corporate governance statement has not 
been prepared by the Parent Company. We have no exceptions 
to report arising from this responsibility. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of  
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Parent 
Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’). We have nothing to report having

On page 83 of the Annual Report, as required by the Code 
Provision C.1.1, the directors state that they consider the  
Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy. On pages 53 and 54, as required by C.3.8 of the 
Code, the Audit Committee has set out the significant issues  
that it considered in relation to the financial statements, and  
how they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
– the statement given by the directors is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or 
– the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Other information in the Annual Report 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: 
– materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or 
– apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group and Parent 
Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
– is otherwise misleading. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the directors  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 83, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information 
Further to the approval of shareholders on 17 December 2013, Bumi plc changed its name to Asia Resource Minerals plc, with effect 
from 19 December 2013. Asia Resource Minerals plc (formerly Bumi plc) (the “Company”) is a company domiciled and incorporated 
in the UK. The address of the registered office is Atlas House, 3rd Floor, 173 Victoria Street, London, SW1E 5NH. The Company along 
with its main operating subsidiary, PT Berau Coal Energy Tbk (“PT Berau”), a coal mining group of companies listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange, and their subsidiaries, comprise “the Group”. The Company also holds an investment in PT Bumi Resources Tbk 
(“PT Bumi”) which is also listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and which was classified as an associate from the date of 
acquisition to 30 September 2012 (see Note 15) and as an available for sale asset thereafter. PT Bumi is also engaged in coal  
mining operations and exploration and development of mineral mining concessions. 
2. Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.  
These policies have been consistently applied, unless otherwise stated.  
2.1 Basis of preparation 
a) Statement of compliance 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee Interpretations (“IFRIC”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“IFRSs as adopted by the EU”), and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation  
of available for sale financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit and loss. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.  
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to  
the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 3 below. 
These consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of US dollars (“$”). 
b) Going concern 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements, the Directors have considered the business activities as 
set out on pages 10 to 15 as well as the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 38 to 41. Based on the Group’s 
cash flow forecasts and projections, the Board is satisfied that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its facilities for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.  
2.2 New accounting standards 
The Group applied all applicable new standards and interpretations published by the IASB and as endorsed by the European Union 
for the year beginning 1 January 2013, being IFRS 13, IFRIC 20 and amendments to IAS 1, IAS 12 and IAS 19. The new standards that 
had a material effect on the Group were IFRIC 20 “Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine” which is discussed in 
Note 2.11 and IAS 19 (revised) “Employee Benefits” which is discussed in Note 2.16. 
The Group did not early adopt any standard or interpretation published by the IASB and endorsed by the European Union for which 
the mandatory application date is after 1 January 2013. 
The following new standards, interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, subject to EU 
endorsement, but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013 and have not been early adopted by the Group:

   95 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
The Group does not currently expect any of these changes to have a material impact on the results, except as outlined below.  
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those 
measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification 
depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where 
the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in 
other comprehensive income rather than the Income Statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group is yet to 
assess the full impact of IFRS 9. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by  
the IASB. 
Although still in discussion, potential changes to IFRS 10, IAS 27 and IAS 28 relating to the unit of account for investments could have 
a significant impact. The IASB is proposing to issue an exposure draft to clarify the fair value measurement of quoted investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. The current proposals state that the fair value measurement of an investment composed 
of quoted financial instruments should be the product of the quoted price of the financial instrument multiplied by the quantity of 
instruments held. The IASB noted that quoted prices in an active market provide the most reliable evidence of fair value. In the same 
way, the IASB also tentatively decided that the fair value measurement of cash generating units (CGUs) for impairment testing when 
those CGUs correspond to a quoted entity should be the product of their quoted price multiplied by the quantity of instruments held.  
Management continue to monitor the IASB discussions, but maintain their current interpretation of the present standards is that, for 
consolidated subsidiaries, the individual assets such as goodwill and mining properties should be assessed by reference to how a 
typical industry participant would value the underlying mining concession, using discounted future cash flows incorporating future 
development plans. If the fair value of PT Berau was measured on the basis of multiplying the quoted price by the number of shares 
held, the value would be $451m (2012: $597m). This would lead to an impairment in the Income Statement of $746m in 2013. 
2.3 Consolidation 
The consolidated financial information consists of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
a) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. All intragroup transactions, balances, income and  
expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies have been adopted across the Group. 
b) Associates 
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an equity interest and over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. The Income Statement reflects the Group’s share 
of the results of the associate, which is net of interest and taxation, and presents this as a single line item in arriving at Group profit 
before finance items and income tax on the face of the Income Statement. The Group’s share of post acquisition movements in other 
comprehensive income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Adjustments are made at Asia Resource Minerals 
plc level to ensure consistent accounting policies have been adopted across the Group. Where the Group ceases to have significant 
influence, any retained interest is re-measured to fair value at the date significant influence is lost, with the change in the carrying 
amount recognised in the Income Statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as a financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income in respect of that entity are reclassified to the Income Statement.  
c) Transactions with non-controlling interests 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from 
non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net 
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Principal accounting policies continued 
2.4 Revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from the sale of goods (coal) in the ordinary course of 
the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of applicable sales taxes, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales 
within the Group. 
Under the terms of PT Berau’s Coal Contract of Work (“CCoW”), the Government of Indonesia (the “Government”) is entitled to  
13.5% of the coal production of PT Berau. Rather than deliver coal to the Government, as agreed PT Berau markets and sells the 
Government’s coal entitlement and pays the Government the cash proceeds less certain charges. Revenue in the Income Statement 
includes the proceeds of the sales of the Government’s entitlement as the Group suffers the credit risk associated with these sales. 
The Government’s entitlement is recognised as a royalty expense as part of the cost of sales. 
Sales revenue is only recognised on individual sales when persuasive evidence exists that all of the following criteria are met: 
– the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer; 
– neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods 
sold, has been retained; 
– the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; 
– it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group; and 
– the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be measured reliably.  
These conditions are satisfied when title passes to the customer. In most instances sales revenue is recognised when the product  
is delivered to the destination specified by the customer, which is the vessel on which it will be shipped, the destination port or the 
customer’s premises. The sale prices are based on the Newcastle Free on Board (“FOB”) benchmark with relevant adjustment for 
calorific value, moisture, ash, sulphur content and other factors. 
Occasionally, products are “provisionally priced”. When the price adjustment for a particular year has not been agreed with the 
customer at the time a delivery is to be made, the Group will continue to invoice coal at the prior year’s price and adjust the price 
after reaching an agreement with the customer. When this occurs, the Group records the sales revenue on a prevailing market  
price for the coal and adjusts the sales revenue amount when a price agreement is reached with the customer. 
2.5 Foreign currency translation 
a) Presentation currency 
The Group’s financial statements are presented in millions of US dollars (“$”) which is also the functional currency of the main 
entities in the Group. As required to be disclosed by the Companies Act 2006, the exchange rate between US dollars and GB Pounds 
is as follows: the average rate for year to 31 December 2013 was $1.565 to £1 (2012: $1.585 to £1), and the rate at 31 December 2013 
was $1.649 to £1 (2012: $1.6168 to £1). 
b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of  
such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the appropriate Income Statement classification matching the nature of the foreign exchange gain  
or loss. 
2.6 Taxation 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
in the countries where the Group and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and 
establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial information. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates 
(and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to 
the extent that it is probable that future reasonably estimated taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised. 
   97 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates 
except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it 
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on 
deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent  
that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which  
the temporary difference can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is provided in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions. These adjustments may relate to assets such as mining 
rights or resources that, in general, are not eligible for income tax allowances. In such cases, the provision for deferred tax is based 
on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its nil income tax base. The existence of a tax base for capital gains tax 
purposes is not taken into account in determining the deferred tax provision relating to such mining rights or resources because it is 
expected that the carrying amount will be recovered primarily through use and not from disposal. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a  
net basis. 
2.7 Impairment of non financial assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life such as goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use are not subject to amortisation and 
are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised  
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Non financial assets other than goodwill that 
suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 
2.8 Other exceptional costs 
Expenditure for which no clear business purpose could be established has been classified separately as other exceptional costs in 
the consolidated Income Statement and consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This expenditure had been disclosed by previous 
management as hauling roads and other construction in progress, land related payments, consulting services and acquisition 
related goodwill.  
2.9 Exploration and evaluation expenditure and assets 
Exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for coal and mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and 
the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. 
Exploration and evaluation activity includes: 
– Gathering exploration data through topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies 
– Researching and analysing existing exploration data 
– Exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling 
– Determining and examining the volume and grade of the resource 
– Surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements 
– Examining and testing extraction and treatment methods 
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are charged to the Income Statement.  
Licence costs paid in connection with a right to explore in an existing exploration area are capitalised and amortised over the  
term of the permit. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred except in the following circumstances,  
in which case the expenditure is capitalised. 
In respect of coal and mineral activities: 
– the acquisition of a concession or licence area of interest at the exploration and evaluation stage from a third party, which is 
measured at fair value on acquisition; otherwise  
– when the existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit has been established. 
   98 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Principal accounting policies continued 
2.9 Exploration and evaluation expenditure and assets continued 
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is not amortised as the asset is not available for use, but is monitored for 
indications of impairment. Where a potential impairment is indicated, an assessment is performed for each area of interest in 
conjunction with the Group of operating assets (representing a cash generating unit) to which the exploration is attributed. To the 
extent that capitalised expenditure is not expected to be recovered it is charged to the Income Statement. 
Cash flows associated with capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure are classified as investing activities in the consolidated 
statement of cash flows, and exploration and evaluation expenditure related cash flows that are expensed are classified as operating 
cash flows. 
2.10 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment 
comprises the purchase price, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by management, to the extent that they relate to the asset and are the responsibility of 
the Group. 
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised into its various components where the useful life of the 
components differ from the main item of property, plant and equipment to which the component can be logically assigned. 
Expenditure incurred to replace or modify a significant component of property, plant and equipment is capitalised and any remaining 
carrying value of the component replaced is written off as an expense in the Income Statement. Subsequent expenditure on property, 
plant and equipment is only capitalised when the expenditure enhances the value or output of the asset beyond original expectations 
and it can be measured reliably. 
Costs incurred on repairing and maintaining assets are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, which are represented by the proceeds on disposal of such 
assets less their carrying values at that date, are recognised in the Income Statement. 
a) Mining properties 
Mining properties consist predominantly of the fair value of mineral resources acquired through business combinations. On 
acquisition, an assessment is made of the reserves and resources where they relate to a mine that is fully operational, the fair value 
of the reserves and resources are classified as mining properties and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment.  
When proven reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure disclosed 
within intangible assets is reclassified as mining properties, and is disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment.  
All subsequent development expenditure relating to the construction of infrastructure required to operate the mine is capitalised  
and classified as assets under construction. Development expenditure is net of proceeds from the sale of ore extracted during the 
development phase. On completion of the development phase, all assets included in assets under construction are reclassified as 
either plant and equipment or mining properties. 
b) Depreciation 
Property, plant and equipment, including mining properties, are depreciated over their useful lives, the lease term, or the term of the 
CCoW, whichever is shorter. At the balance sheet date, 12 years are remaining under the original CCoW. Depreciation commences 
when an asset is available for use.  
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis, except for the mining properties in 
production, which are depreciated on a unit of production (“UoP”) basis as follows: 
Category Estimated Useful Life
Land not depreciated
Land improvements and buildings 20 years
Plant, furniture, fixtures and office equipment 3 to 10 years
Assets under construction  not depreciated
Mining properties over CCoW on a UoP basis
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Changes to the estimated 
residual values or useful lives are accounted for prospectively. 
Costs associated with commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by 
management, are capitalised. Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they 
are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. 
   99 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
2.11 Deferred stripping 
It is necessary to remove overburden and other waste materials to open the mining area before production commences. The process 
of removing overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping. 
The new interpretation IFRIC 20 “Stripping Costs in the production phase of a surface mine” states, stripping activity undertaken 
during the production phase may create two benefits – the first being the extraction of ore (inventory) in the current period and the 
second being improved access to the ore body to be mined in a future period. Where the benefits are realised in the form of ore 
produced, the production stripping costs are accounted for in accordance with IAS 2 “Inventories”. Where the benefit is improved 
access to ore to be mined in the future, these costs are recognised as a non-current asset, the stripping activity asset (“SAA”)’, if 
required criteria are met. To recognise SAA, all the following criteria must be satisfied: 
– it is probable that the future economic benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to 
the entity 
– the entity can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved 
– the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably 
Following the adoption of IFRIC 20 on 1 January 2013, management has reassessed its position and in relation to PT Berau’s mining 
operations, costs incurred in respect of overburden and waste materials removed are now expensed as incurred. This is because 
management has determined that the impact is immaterial. No expenses are allocated to inventory as none of the overburden is  
of ore quality. This is a change to the previous accounting policy where costs in relation to overburden and waste material were 
capitalised. Please see Note 34. 
2.12 Financial instruments 
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or  
as available for sale. The classification depends on the nature and purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition. The designation of financial instruments 
is revaluated at every reporting date. 
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Derivatives are included in this category unless they are designated as hedges. The Group does not designate any other financial 
assets as fair value through profit or loss. Assets in this category are classified based on their maturity. The Group does not acquire 
financial assets for the purpose of selling in the short term. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially 
recognised at fair value. Gains and losses on initial recognition resulting from fair values that do not include any observable market 
conditions for the same instrument are deferred and recognised in the Income Statement in full on completion. 
b) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are classified as current assets or non-current assets based on their maturity date. Loans and receivables comprise 
cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments) in the balance sheet. Loans and receivables are 
carried at amortised cost less any impairment. 
i. Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short term highly liquid investments. 
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, generally have an 
original maturity of 90 days or less and are subject to an insignificant risk of adverse changes in value. However, certain deposits  
of greater duration can be classified as cash equivalents if the funds can be withdrawn at short notice with an insignificant risk of 
adverse changes in value. Cash that is pledged or encumbered and is not readily available is classified separately as restricted cash.  
ii. Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method, reduced by any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there  
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. Indicators of impairment would include significant 
financial difficulties of the debtor, likelihood of the debtor’s insolvency, default in payment or a significant deterioration in credit 
worthiness. Any impairment is recognised in the Income Statement. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against 
the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the Income Statement. 
Included in this account are the trade receivables which pertain to amounts due from customers for coal sold in the ordinary course 
of business.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Principal accounting policies continued 
2.12 Financial instruments continued 
c) Available for sale financial assets 
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within  
12 months of the end of the reporting period. The Group holds certain securities, which have been reclassified as available for  
sale, and are measured at fair value on initial recognition. Such securities are classified as available for sale, rather than as an 
investment in an associate, if the Group does not have the power to exercise significant influence over the investee. Subsequent to 
initial recognition they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, are recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income and reflected in shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of available for sale 
securities is determined by reference to quoted prices at each reporting date. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative 
gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to the Income Statement. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or at amortised cost, as appropriate. 
Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of financial liabilities at amortised cost, inclusive of directly 
attributable transaction costs. The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows: 
a) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include mainly derivative liabilities unless they are designated as effective 
hedging instruments. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value during  
a reporting period immediately recognised in the Income Statement. 
b) Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
After initial recognition, trade and other payables, interest bearing loans, notes and borrowings are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method taking into account principal repayments or reductions. The calculation also takes into 
account any premium or discount paid or received either on acquisition or on redemption. It also includes transaction costs and  
fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement when the 
liabilities are derecognised. Included in this category are trade and other payables and borrowings. 
i. Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers. Trade and other payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year otherwise they are 
presented as non-current liabilities. Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
ii. Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement 
over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent it is probable that some 
or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence 
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. 
c) Derecognition of financial liabilities 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, transferred, cancelled  
or expired. 
2.13 Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily on a weighted average cost basis. Cost of coal 
inventories is determined by a 12 month rolling weighted average of historical production costs, while cost of spare parts inventories 
are valued at cost, determined on a moving average basis. Net realisable value is the estimated sales amount in the ordinary  
course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Stores and consumable supplies are charged  
to production in the period they are used. 
Allowance for inventory obsolescence is provided to reduce the carrying values of inventories to their net realisable value based on 
the review of the status of the inventories at the end of the period.  
2.14 Leases 
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group has substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the 
lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases. Payments under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease.  101 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
For finance leases, each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, 
net of finance charges, are included in other long term payables. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the Income 
Statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset 
and the lease term. 
2.15 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when (i) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; (ii) it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense. 
a) Environmental rehabilitation provision 
The Group has an obligation to undertake restoration, rehabilitation and environmental work when environmental disturbance is 
caused by the development or ongoing production of a mining property.  
Rehabilitation costs are a normal consequence of mining, and are provided for as and when a legal or constructive obligation to incur 
costs associated with rehabilitation arises. The environmental rehabilitation provision consists of costs associated with continuous 
mine reclamation during mine operations. It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred over a period in excess of 16 years. 
Long term environmental rehabilitation provisions are measured based on the net present value of the estimated future costs. 
Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group’s businesses estimate their respective costs based on feasibility 
and engineering studies using current restoration standards and techniques, taking into account the Group’s environmental policy 
and current Indonesian environmental and regulatory requirements, including the requirements of the CCoW. 
The unwinding of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of provisions is charged to the Income Statement in each 
accounting period as a financing cost. 
b) Mine closure provisions 
Mine closure provisions, which include decommissioning, demobilisation and other closure activities, are recognised when the 
economic life of the mine ends within the period of the existing life of the CCoW because they relate to the facilities which are in use 
over the life of the mine. 
The initial mine closure provision together with other movements in the provisions for environmental costs, including those resulting 
from new disturbance, updated cost estimates, changes to the estimated lives of operations and revisions to discount rates are 
capitalised in mining properties, within property, plant and equipment. These costs are then depreciated over the useful life of the 
assets to which they relate on a UoP basis. 
2.16 Retirement benefits 
Benefits in the form of retirement pensions are provided to certain employees and retirees under defined benefit and defined 
contribution plans. 
The Group is required to provide a minimum amount of pension benefits in Indonesia defined by local labour laws and agreements. 
Since the Indonesian labour laws and agreements set the formula for determining the minimum amount of benefits, in substance 
the Indonesian requirements represent defined benefit plans. 
Obligations under defined benefit plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, 
discounted to their present value using interest rates of Government bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be 
paid and of a duration consistent with the plan obligations. Government bonds have been used as there is no liquid market for high 
quality corporate bonds in Indonesia. 
The amount recognised in the Income Statement in respect of defined benefit plans mainly comprises of service cost and interest. 
Service cost comprises principally the increase in the present value of the obligation for benefits resulting from employee service 
during the year and also amounts relating to past service and settlements of plans. Interest is calculated using the discount rate  
on the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of each year for each plan. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability 
resulting from actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. Following the adoption of IAS 19 (revised) 
“Employee Benefits” on 1 January 2013, management has revised the accounting for the defined benefit pension scheme eliminating 
the use of the corridor method of accounting for the actuarial gains and losses and introducing changes to the way in which such 
plans are accounted for in the Consolidated Income Statement and the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. Please see  
Note 34. 
For defined contribution plans, pension expense represents the amount of employer contributions payable for the year.

2.17 Ordinary shares 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Where any Group company purchases the Company’s ordinary shares, the consideration 
paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s owners until the 
shares are cancelled or reissued. 
2.18 Merger reserve 
Upon implementation of the Scheme of arrangement in 2011, whereby Asia Resource Minerals plc (formerly Bumi plc) succeeded 
Vallar Limited (formerly Vallar Plc) as the new parent company for the Group, the Group’s ordinary shares have been re-presented 
as that of Asia Resource Minerals plc (formerly Bumi plc), with a nominal value of £6. The difference between Vallar Limited’s net 
assets and the nominal value of the shares in issue is recorded in the merger reserve. In addition, certain consolidation adjustments 
are also recorded in the merger reserve. 
2.19 Business combinations and goodwill 
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised) – 
“Business Combinations”. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, 
the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset 
or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. 
The excess of: the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair 
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is 
recognised directly in the Income Statement. 
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of critical estimates and 
assumptions to determine the value of assets and liabilities, and contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and 
revenues and expenses reported during the year. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, the Group regularly 
revises its estimates in light of currently available information. Final outcomes could differ from those estimates. The main 
judgements and estimates used in preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented below. 
3.1 Identification of other exceptional costs 
PT Berau’s new management conducted an extensive review of the financial position at PT Berau in March 2013 and identified 
significant expenditure, predominantly in 2012, which had no clear business purpose. These costs had been attributed, by former 
management, to activities or items which might ordinarily have been of value to PT Berau. In conducting its review, management  
had to apply judgement in assessing expenditure in 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 to determine the substance of counterparties 
and whether the services performed or assets acquired were of value to the business. This expenditure has been classified as other 
exceptional costs and shown separately in the Consolidated Income Statement to separate it from costs incurred in the ordinary 
course of business.  
3.2 Determination of coal reserve estimates 
The Group reports its coal reserves in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 Edition (the “JORC Code”), prepared and published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the 
Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia based on 
advice from an independent third party working with management in house experts. The term “coal reserve” is defined in the JORC 
Code as the economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated coal resource. Coal reserves are subdivided in order of 
increasing confidence into “probable coal reserves” and “proved coal reserves”. 
Under the JORC Code, the term “coal resource” refers to a concentration or occurrence of coal of intrinsic economic interest in or  
on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, 
quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a coal resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific 
geological evidence and knowledge. Coal resources are subdivided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into “inferred”, 
“indicated” and “measured” categories. 
   103 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
Reserves and resources determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, 
the assessment of life of mine stripping ratios and in forecasting the timing of the payment of close down and restoration costs and 
clean-up costs. In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral resources are only taken into account where there is 
a high degree of confidence for economic extraction. 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating coal reserves, and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation  
may change significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, 
production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in the reserves  
being restated. 
3.3 Recoverable amount of goodwill and property, plant and equipment 
The recoverable amount of goodwill and property, plant and equipment is based on estimates and assumptions regarding, in 
particular, the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the asset. Predicted future cash flows include 
estimates of future costs to produce, proven and probable reserves and resources, future commodity prices, foreign exchange rates 
and discount rates.  
Judgement and estimation is required for all elements of the future cash flows, but especially the length of the mining licence and 
the conversion of resources to reserves.  
To date, no first generation CCoW has reached its initial expiry period and therefore there is no precedent for extension, although  
this is envisaged in the terms of the CCoW. Recent legislation from the Government of Indonesia has indicated that CCoWs may  
be extended in the form of an Izin Usaha Pertambangan (IUP) issued by the central government. Whilst the terms of the extension 
would need to be negotiated, the legislation allows for first-term CCoWs, such as that held by PT Berau, to be extended into an IUP 
without need for a tender. Management has risk adjusted future cash flows based on its estimate of the likelihood of favourable 
extensions of the mining licence beyond the initial CCoW period to 2035 and subsequently 2045.  
Future cash flows are also dependent upon the ability to economically mine in areas where mineable reserves have not yet been 
established to JORC standards. Judgement is required to support the anticipated conversion of resources to reserves and associated 
cash flows. Management has based this judgement on their knowledge of the geology and exploration activity conducted in the 
concession area, prior experience of the conversion of resources to reserves through additional drilling, and an estimate of the 
production costs and capital expenditure requirements. 
3.4 Taxation 
Taxes are paid by the Group’s subsidiary in Indonesia under a number of different regulations and laws, which are subject to varying 
interpretations. In addition, these can change frequently and the judicial system does not have well developed rules of precedent. 
This, in turn, may result in transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past being scrutinised in greater detail  
and additional taxes may be assessed based on new interpretations of the legislation and tax positions. Accordingly, management’s 
interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group’s subsidiary may be challenged by the 
relevant authorities. 
Under Indonesian tax laws, fiscal periods up until 2007 remain open for 10 years, or until the end of 2013 whichever is earlier and 
fiscal periods ending after 2007 remain open for five years after the time that the tax becomes due. 
At the date of these financial statements, the Group’s subsidiary, PT Berau has received several tax assessment letters that are not 
yet finalised. PT Berau has filed objections and/or appeals that are still in process or pending decisions, the outcomes of which are 
not presently determinable. Management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the tax position 
included in these financial statements will be sustained. 
3.5 VAT recoverable  
There is an ongoing dispute with the Government of Indonesia which resulted from a change in the VAT law in 2001 when coal 
became a VAT exempt supply. This change meant that PT Berau could no longer claim credits for its input VAT on purchases. 
However, under the Coal Contract of Work (CCoW), PT Berau is indemnified against Indonesian taxes not in effect at the time of 
signing of the CCoW. On this basis, PT Berau claimed reimbursement for input VAT paid from 2001. The claims were rejected  
and PT Berau began setting off the VAT receivable against royalty payments due under the CCoW. The VAT receivable and royalty 
payable amounts have been presented separately on a gross basis within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, 
respectively. Whilst there is no current indication that the amount may not be recoverable, PT Berau management believes that 
there may be a low risk that the receivable may not be recovered in whole or in part. Further details are in Note 18.

6. Other exceptional costs 
As discussed in the Asia Resource Minerals plc 2012 Annual Report, new management at PT Berau conducted an extensive review  
of the financial position of PT Berau in March 2013 and identified significant expenditure, which had no clear business purpose. 
Previous management at PT Berau had attributed these costs to hauling roads and other construction in progress, land related 
payments, consulting services and acquisition related goodwill. The expenditure was predominantly incurred in 2012, however 
expenditure of a similar nature was also incurred in January and February 2013 under previous management and accordingly this 
has also been presented as other exceptional costs. These amounts are shown separately in the Consolidated Income Statement  
to separate them from costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.

8. Underlying earnings and underlying EBITDA 
The Group presents underlying earnings and underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“underlying 
EBITDA”) as additional measures to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of its operations. 
Underlying earnings and underlying EBITDA exclude separate items. Separate items are those items of financial performance  
that the Group believes should be separately disclosed. Separate items include, when applicable, impairment of goodwill and  
other assets, costs of acquiring and integrating acquisitions, fundamental restructuring of business, profit or loss on disposal of  
a business or significant other asset material claims and settlements, other exceptional costs and significant gains and losses  
on derivative instruments. 
The results of PT Bumi, which were treated as an associate for the nine months to 30 September 2012, have been excluded from 
underlying earnings and underlying EBITDA as PT Bumi is being held for sale and it no longer represents a part of the ongoing 
operations of the Group.

11. Taxation continued 
With effect from 1 April 2012, the main rate of corporation tax was reduced from 26% to 24%. Legislation to reduce the main rate of 
corporation tax from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was included in the Finance Act 2012. Accordingly, the Company’s profits 
for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 23.25%. Further reductions to the main rate were proposed in the Finance 
Act 2013, which received Royal Assent on 17 July 2013, to reduce the rate to 21% by 1 April 2014 and a further 1% to 20% by 1 April 
2015. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s deferred tax balances. The Indonesian corporate tax 
rate is 25%, with the exception of the tax charged within a CCoW which incurs a tax rate of 45%.

1. This represents goodwill arising on the acquisition of PT Pelayaran Sandita Perkeson Maritim Tbk, PT Kirana Berau and PT Manira Mitra where the excess consideration 
above the fair value of assets acquired had no business purpose. This was written off to other exceptional costs in 2012.  
Impairment tests for goodwill 
Goodwill arising through acquisitions has been allocated to individual or Groups of cash generating units (CGUs), each representing 
the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
The carrying value of the Group’s goodwill of $518m has arisen on the acquisition of PT Berau on 4 March 2011, which is treated as 
the Group’s sole CGU. 
The Group’s annual impairment review resulted in no impairment charge for the year. PT Berau’s recoverable amount has been 
assessed based on fair value less costs of disposal using discounted cash flows. The discounted cash flow model used to determine 
the recoverable amount is a level 3 model in the fair value hierarchy as it’s valuation includes management assumptions on key 
unobservable data that significantly affects the fair value. 
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time. They are significantly affected by a 
number of factors including ore reserves and production estimates, commodity prices, discount rates, future operating costs and 
capital expenditure. Cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and production plans to the end of the Coal Contract of 
Work (CCoW), including two 10 year extensions, appropriately risk adjusted.  
The key assumptions relating to the calculation of PT Berau’s fair value less costs of disposal are the long term thermal coal price; 
production volumes; operating costs; and discount rates. 
The medium term (2014 to 2018) forecast benchmark thermal coal price is within the range supported by market analysts of $85 to 
$105 per tonne (2012: $90 to $113 per tonne) in nominal terms. This price is then adjusted for various coal quality parameters, such 
as calorific value, moisture and sulphur content, to derive the expected realised selling prices on a free on board (FOB) basis. 
Post tax cash flows were estimated for the period of the Coal Contract of Work (CCoW), and discounted using a post tax discount  
rate of between 9.9% and 10.4% (2012: 9.8% and 10.5%) expressed in nominal terms. The operating costs included in the fair value 
assessment are calculated based on PT Berau’s production plans taking into consideration PT Berau’s asset optimisation strategies 
for the remainder of the CCoW. Price assumptions for inputs are based on analysis of market fundamentals and are made 
consistent with related output price assumptions. The Coal Contract of Work expires in 2025, with further extensions permitted, 
subject to terms and conditions being agreed. Management has included two 10 year extensions in the fair value less costs of 
disposal at 31 December 2013, with additional risk adjustments as appropriate.  
   110 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
13. Intangible assets continued 
The excess of recoverable amount over carrying value is $201m. Whilst the Directors remain confident in the assumptions used  
in determining the recoverable amount, it is estimated that the following adverse changes in key assumptions would lead to 
corresponding decreases in fair value less costs of disposal, and would lead to an impairment charge in the year: 
 
Value assigned to the 
key assumption up to 2025
Change in the key assumption which 
would result in the recoverable 
amount equalling the carrying value
Thermal coal price in nominal terms ($/t) 85-127 2.1%
Operating costs per tonne in nominal terms ($/t) 50-62 2.8%
Production volumes (mt) 26-40 6.5%
Discount rate (% absolute) 9.9 1.2%
Each of the sensitivities above was determined assuming the relevant key assumption moved in isolation, except where modifying 
the thermal coal price directly affects certain input costs, and further assumes that management does not take any mitigating 
actions. However, this is for disclosure purposes and under those circumstances management could take mitigating action such  
as changes to the mine plan, cost reduction initiatives and additional sales strategies.

IAS 28 “Investments in Associates” includes a rebuttable presumption that where a company has more than 20% of the voting  
equity in another company, it is presumed to be an Associate. Following the initial investment of 25% in the ordinary share capital  
of PT Bumi in March 2011, which increased to 29% in July 2011, Asia Resource Minerals plc (formerly Bumi plc) determined it  
had significant influence over PT Bumi. In addition to the rights associated with the Group’s equity investment, influence was also 
conveyed by common management teams as Asia Resource Minerals plc shared the same Chief Executive Officer, Ari Hudaya, and 
Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Beckham, with PT Bumi.  
During the course of 2012 there were a number of events that led Asia Resource Minerals plc to review the influence that it had  
over PT Bumi. These included: the resignation of Andrew Beckham from the Board in March 2012; the extension of certain financial 
arrangements between PT Bumi and the Recapital Group at the end of August 2012 against the wishes of Asia Resource Minerals 
plc, and finally the resignation of the President Director of PT Bumi, Ari Hudaya, from the Board on 24 September 2012.  
On 5 November 2012, Asia Resource Minerals plc announced the result of its review, which determined that it was not able to exert 
significant influence over PT Bumi and that it was longer appropriate to account for its shareholding in PT Bumi as an associate in 
accordance with IAS 28, with effect from 30 September 2012. 
Following the Board’s decision in 2012, that Asia Resource Minerals plc was no longer able to exert significant influence, the 
investment in PT Bumi was accounted for as an available for sale investment in accordance with IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement“ with effect from 30 September 2012. IAS 28 requires that any share of the results of an associate 
previously reported in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income should be transferred to the Income Statement. Accordingly, 
$6m was transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in 2012. 
The Group’s share of the results of its associate for the nine months to 30 September 2012, and its aggregated assets (including 
goodwill) and liabilities as at 30 September 2012 are as follows:

Trade and other receivables includes taxes of $381m (2012: $409m) representing amounts claimed by PT Berau from the 
Government of Indonesia. This amount is part of an ongoing dispute with the Government of Indonesia which resulted from a change 
in the VAT law in 2001 when coal became a VAT exempt supply. This change meant that PT Berau could no longer claim credits for 
its input VAT on purchases. However, under the CCoW, PT Berau is indemnified against Indonesian taxes not in effect at the time  
of signing of the CCoW. On this basis, PT Berau claimed reimbursement for input VAT paid from 2001. The claims were rejected  
and PT Berau began setting off the VAT receivable against royalty payments due under the CCoW. The VAT receivable and royalty 
payable amounts have been presented separately on a gross basis within trade and other receivables and trade and other  
payables, respectively. 
With effect from 1 January 2013, the mining industry operating under CCoWs has agreed in principle with the Government of 
Indonesia that input VAT is recoverable on a prospective basis. However, as part of the agreement, sales tax of 1% will be applied  
to certain services. There has been no agreement on the remaining balance as at 31 December 2012. 
The Group’s exposure to credit and currency risks related to trade and other receivables is disclosed in Note 24.

a) Bank loans 
Outstanding bank loans at 31 December 2013 were $6m (2012: $12m).  
There were $nil undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2013 (2012: $6m). 
b) Senior Secured Notes 
On 8 July 2010, Berau Capital Resources Pte Ltd (BCR), a wholly owned subsidiary based in Singapore, issued $350m of 12.5% 
Senior Secured Notes. On 29 July 2010, BCR also issued an additional $100m of 12.5% Senior Secured Notes (together the  
‘2015 Senior Notes’). PT Berau used the net proceeds of the 2015 Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facility to repay 
indebtedness. The maturity date of the 2015 Senior Notes is 8 July 2015, and interest is payable semi-annually and commenced  
on 8 January 2011. The 2015 Senior Notes bear an interest rate of 12.5% per annum. The carrying value at 31 December 2013 was 
$464m (2012: $473m). 
On 13 March 2012, PT Berau issued $500m Senior Notes with a maturity date of 13 March 2017 (“2017 Senior Notes”). The 2017 
Senior Notes bear an interest rate of 7.25% per annum. PT Berau used the net proceeds to repay the balance outstanding on the 
Senior Secured Credit Facility and will use the remainder of the proceeds to fund capital expenditure and other operating activities. 
Interest is payable semi-annually and commenced on 13 September 2012. The carrying value at 31 December 2013 was $489m 
(2012: $486m) including an adjustment to reflect deferred finance charges.    115 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013

PT Berau early repayment options 
The fair value of the financial instruments of $9m (2012: $24m) represents the fair value of the early repayment options of the 2015 
Senior Notes and the 2017 Senior Notes. The 2015 Senior Notes can be repaid from 8 July 2013 at a price of 106.25% and the 2017 
Senior Notes can be repaid from 13 March 2015 at 103.625%. The fair value represents the value of a call option that arises due to 
the difference between the market rate of interest that PT Berau could have borrowed at on the respective year end date and the 
actual rate of interest paid on each Senior Note, based on an option pricing model. The key inputs into the option pricing model are 
interest rate volatility and the actual US treasury rates representing the risk free rate which are based on observable market values; 
the time value of money which is based on the redemption dates; and the refinancing rate. If the refinancing rate increased by  
100 base points then the value of the derivative would decrease by $1.2m (31 December 2012: $10m), and if the refinancing rate 
decreased by 100 base points the value of the derivative would increase by $1.4m (31 December 2012: $10m). The prepayment option 
is a level 3 financial asset as its valuation includes the refinancing rate, which is considered to be the key unobservable input that 
significantly affects the fair value. The change in fair value of the repayment option has been recognised in full in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. 
24. Financial risk management 
24.1 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s policies with regard to financial risk management are clearly defined and consistently applied. They are a fundamental 
part of the Group’s long term strategy, covering areas such as foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit 
risk, liquidity risk and capital risk management. 
24.2 Market risk 
a) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group is naturally hedged against foreign exchange risk because the percentage of costs in US dollars is aligned with the 
revenues the Group receives in US dollars. This relationship also holds true for the Group’s revenues and costs in the Indonesian 
Rupiah. Based on an assessment of volatility of the US dollar: Indonesian Rupiah exchange rate over the preceding 12 months, as at 
31 December 2013, an increase of 5% in the value of the US dollar against the Indonesian Rupiah is considered reasonably probable 
and this would have increased the Group’s operating loss by $1.2m (2012: an increase of 5% was considered reasonably probable 
and would have increased the operating loss by $1.3m). This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant. An increase of 
5% in the value of the US dollar against the Indonesian Rupiah would have increased the Group’s charge for change in value of 
available for sale asset by $7.1m (2012: $17.7m) through the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. 
b) Commodity price risk 
The movement in coal prices is determined by macro-economic factors, with short term global supply and demand conditions 
further adding to volatility. The Group has taken steps to mitigate this risk by modelling the impact of movements in coal prices, 
closely monitoring the cost components, and adjusting plans and activities accordingly. 
The Group’s normal policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices. Exceptions to this rule are subject to strict limits laid 
down by the Board and to internal controls. The Board does not generally believe commodity price hedging would provide long term 
benefit to shareholders. 
Contract prices for coal are generally agreed annually with customers, although volume commitments vary by product. 
c) Interest rate risk 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow 
interest rate risk, which is offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value 
interest rate risk. 
A 1% increase in the floating interest rate would have a positive $4.5m (2012: $5.8m) impact on the consolidated profit for the year 
and a 1% decrease in the floating interest rate would have a negative $4.5m (2012: $5.8m) impact on the consolidated profit, as the 
Group’s debt is largely at a fixed rate. A 1% increase in interest rates has been used based on management judgement and historical 
experience to best reflect future movements.

24. Financial risk management continued 
24.3 Credit risk 
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial 
institutions and receivables. The Group places funds with banks and financial institutions only if independently rated with a minimum 
rating of B+ (BBB+ is a higher rating than B+). 
The maximum exposure the Group faces due to credit risks on cash and cash equivalents is as follows:

Total cash and cash equivalents 436 436  
* The 2012 numbers have been restated to reflect the reclassification of certain short term bank deposits to restricted cash. Refer to Note 34. 
The Group requires all customers to provide irrevocable letters of credit or pay by confirmed electronic transfer. The historical level 
of customer default is minimal and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high. Of the year 
end trade receivables balance, the following were past due at the balance sheet dates:

Less than one month 3 5
One month to two months – 6
Over two months – 7
Total trade receivables 76 144
The overdue receivables ageing profile above is typical of the industry in which certain of the Group’s businesses operate. Given the 
existing insurance cover (including letters of credit from financial institutions) and the nature of the related counterparties, these 
amounts are considered recoverable. There was no impairment provision in relation to receivables at 31 December 2013 (2012: $nil). 
24.4 Liquidity risk 
Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group Finance. Group Finance monitors 
rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining 
sufficient headroom on its debts at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants on any of its borrowing 
facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal 
balance sheet ratio targets and external regulatory and legal requirements.

25. Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets 
The Group has deferred tax assets of $122m (2012: $107m) relating to unused tax losses. These deferred tax assets have not been 
recognised as it is not expected that taxable profits will be available against which these assets can be utilised. The vast majority of 
the unused tax losses have been created in Indonesia, where tax losses are valid for 5 years. 
In addition, the Group has a deferred tax asset of $388m (2012: $420m) relating to the unrealised tax loss in respect of its investment 
in available for sale financial assets. This deferred tax asset has not been recognised as it is not expected that the future taxable 
profits in the form of chargeable gains will be available against which this asset can be utilised.

26.1 Redeemable Deferred Shares 
The Redeemable Deferred Shares were allocated and issued in order for Asia Resource Minerals plc to satisfy the minimum share 
capital requirement for the Company to be reregistered as a public company under the Companies Act 2006, which was effected  
on 1 March 2011. There were 50,000 Redeemable Deferred Shares of £1 each in the capital of Asia Resource Minerals plc that 
carried no voting rights and had no economic value. These shares were redeemed and cancelled on 31 October 2012 and a capital 
redemption reserve was created equivalent to the nominal amount of £50,000.  
26.2 Merger Reserve 
Upon implementation of the Scheme, the Group’s ordinary shares have been represented as that of Asia Resource Minerals plc, with 
a nominal value of £6. The difference between Vallar Ltd’s net assets and the nominal value of the shares in issue is recorded in the 
merger reserve. In addition, certain consolidation adjustments are also recorded in the merger reserve. 
No dividends have been paid or proposed for the year.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
29. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets 
Contingent liabilities 
The Group is subject to various claims in the normal course of business. These include but are not restricted to land claims. 
Occasionally, local residents issue claims against the Group with regard to the mining on areas of land where ownership is in dispute 
between the Group and local inhabitants. The majority of cases are resolved with no material liability assumed by the Group. 
No contingent liabilities were secured on the assets of the Group at 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012. 
Contingent asset 
On 26 June 2013, the Company and Rosan Roeslani, the former President Director of PT Berau, entered into a settlement agreement 
providing for the return of $173m to PT Berau, either as assets or cash. The amount is considered as a contingent asset as recovery 
is not certain and therefore it is not appropriate to recognise a receivable.  
There were no significant contingent assets in the Group at 31 December 2012. 
30. Commitments 
At 31 December, the Group had the following outstanding capital commitments and commitments under non-cancellable  
operating leases:

Operating leases relate principally to land and buildings, vehicles and shipping vessels and are principally recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement under the heading of cost of sales.  
31. Related party and other transactions 
Under IFRS, disclosure is required of all transactions between Group companies and their related parties. Related parties include 
entities controlled by Directors or shareholders of ARM and its subsidiaries. 
In 2012, as well as disclosing related party transactions as required under IAS 24, the Board also made a voluntary disclosure of 
transactions where the ultimate beneficiary was unclear. This voluntary disclosure has been extended for transactions in 2013  
which were made before the appointment of new management at PT Berau on 7 March 2013. 
Following the strengthening of controls over related party transactions, the Conflicts Committee undertook a review of all such 
transactions and relationships. Following the review, the Group ceased trading where it was appropriate and in particular with 
companies where the ultimate beneficiary was unclear. 
31.1 Related party transactions 
The Directors believe that material contracts with related parties have been identified, as set out below, based upon a broader 
assessment of contracts and payments. They can be grouped into four categories, entities with ownership or management links to 
Rosan Roeslani, the Bakrie family, Samin Tan or Nathaniel Rothschild. 
Rosan Roeslani  
Rosan Roeslani controls the Recapital Group of companies. He is the former President Director of PT Berau (until 7 March 2013) and 
a Non-Executive Director of ARM (until 19 December 2012). He indirectly held a 13.1% shareholding in ARM until 19 February 2013 
and continues to hold a 3% interest in PT Berau Coal Energy Tbk. The Directors therefore consider that Rosan Roeslani and the 
Recapital Group were related parties until 7 March 2013. Hence no transactions or balances after 7 March 2013 have been disclosed 
as related parties in the tables below. 
   121 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
Bakrie Group 
The Bakrie Group includes entities controlled by the Bakrie family which has been represented on the Board of ARM by Nalin 
Rathod, who was Non-Executive Director from 1 January 2013 to 21 February 2013 and Chief Executive Officer from the 26 March 
2012 to 31 December 2012. The Bakrie Group ceased being a related party on completion of the Separation Transaction. 
Samin Tan 
Samin Tan has been chairman of ARM since 26 March 2012 and controls the Borneo Group of companies. Subsequent to the year 
end and completion of the Separation Transaction, Samin Tan resigned as Chairman of ARM on 27 March 2014, but remains a  
Non-Executive Director and increased his ultimate holding in the voting ordinary shares in ARM from 29.9% to 47.6%. 
Nathaniel Rothschild 
Nathaniel Rothschild is a significant shareholder in ARM and remains a person with considerable influence over the activities of  
the Group. 
The following table summarises the related party transactions in the period.

*  For 2012, an amount of $2.9m has been restated from other transactions (mining services) into related party transactions after clarification of the ultimate beneficiary. 
a) The terms of this fuel supply agreement, which represents approximately 29% (2012: 25%) of fuel consumed by PT Berau, are considered by management to be on 
acceptable commercial terms.  
b) Prepaid lease costs for land to enable the planned expansion of the mine. 
c) The terms of this shipping agreement is considered by management to be on acceptable commercial terms.  
d) No transactions were made in either 2013 or 2012 although the contract commits PT Berau to approximately $60 million over five years. The business need for this 
arrangement is being reviewed, and if appropriate, management will seek an early termination of the contract. 
e) The terms of this barging arrangement is considered by management to be on acceptable commercial terms. 
f) The agreement under which PT Berau made use of private jets was terminated during 2013. 
g) Other purchases from entities related to the Recapital Group include insurance, office lease costs and general consulting costs. During 2013 management vacated the 
premises that PT Berau previously leased from Recapital and moved to alternative accommodation. It has also reduced the level of business with these entities and where 
appropriate has discontinued the arrangement.  
h) This entity leases light vehicles for use in mining operations. In 2012 the Company was not able to confirm the ultimate beneficiary of this entity but believed that it could be 
connected to Recapital. It therefore voluntarily disclosed transactions with this entity as being connected. Based on further research by management in 2013 it has now 
been determined that the entity is related to Recapital. In 2013, all transactions for both 2012 and 2013 have been disclosed as related party transactions. Management has 
decided that no further new business will be conducted with this entity and is ensuring that contracts are being terminated where possible. 
i) Mining services are provided by an entity which is 39.3% owned by PT Bumi, which is understood to be controlled by the Bakrie Group. These costs represent around 3% 
(2012: 3%) of total costs paid to mining contractors and are not considered by management to have any unusual commercial terms.

31. Related party transactions continued 
j) The Group conducted transactions with an entity related to Nathaniel Rothschild and James Campbell, the sole activity being the supply of professional services. James 
Campbell was considered a related party until he resigned from the ARM Board of directors on 14 June 2012.  
k) The Group conducted transactions with entities related to Nathaniel Rothschild, the activity being the payment of professional services and business expenses.  
l) The Borneo Group provided staff and advisory services in relation to the review of financial position of PT Berau, marketing services, mine planning and other activities. 
m) PT Bank Pundi Indonesia Tbk is a bank related to Rosan Roeslani. Although term deposits at the PT Bank Pundi Indonesia Tbk had market related interest rates, this 
account has now been closed by management. 
n) PT Capitalinc arranged the purchase of equipment under finance leases to PT Berau in 2012. 
o) PT Recapital Advisors provided services in relation to the issue of a $500m bond in 2012.

*  At 31 December 2012, an amount of $0.4m has been restated from other transactions (mining services) into related party transactions after clarification of the  
ultimate beneficiary. 
a) The amounts paid in the prior year represent prepaid leases for land acquired by the counterparty to enable the planned expansion of the mine by PT Berau and the 
development of commercial and community infrastructure post-mining. The basis for the amounts paid has been reviewed by management who are of the opinion that the 
lease payments are appropriate in relation to the economic value of the land to PT Berau for future mining operations. This balance is no longer considered a related party 
at 31 December 2013. 
b) This amount represents an unsecured loan to the founder shareholder, PT Bukit Mutiara, (a shareholder in ARM until February 2013) in relation to tax due by Bukit 
Mutiara on the IPO of PT Berau. The term of the agreement was 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 and a demand has been sent to PT Bukit Mutiara for repayment of 
the loan which is now due. The interest charged to PT Bukit Mutiara is at a favourable rate which is below prevailing market conditions. The loan agreement was signed on 
behalf of PT Berau by its former President Director, who also controls PT Bukit Mutiara. Although no longer considered a related party at 31 December 2013, this amount 
is overdue and provided for whilst the company pursues repayment.

*  For 2012, an amount of $2.9m has been restated from other transactions (mining services) into related parties transactions after clarification of the ultimate beneficiary. 
a) These costs include geological services, the provision of labour and vehicle rentals. 
b) In 2012, land compensation costs represent amounts paid to a number of agents acting on behalf of PT Berau who compensate landowners for loss of earnings arising 
from the mining operations gaining access to their land for mining purposes. Management was not able to satisfy itself that there was a proper business purpose for the 
amounts paid in 2012 and has disclosed the payments as ‘other exceptional costs’ in the prior year. 
c) Costs attributed to haulage roads and other related construction-in-progress paid to contractors. Management has not been able to satisfy itself that there was a proper 
business purpose for the amounts paid up to and including February 2013 totalling $6.1m (2012: $71.3m) and has disclosed the payments as ‘other exceptional costs’. 
Following the change in PT Berau management which took place at the EGM on 7 March 2013, no further payments have been made to these contractors and the 
payments in 2013 took place in January and February 2013, prior to the change in PT Berau’s management. An additional $0.6m (2012: $7.8m) was incurred for further 
advance payments for the extension of stockpile facilities for which PT Berau has entered into a long term lease with the counterparty. This project has a proper  
business purpose.  123 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
d) In 2010, PT Berau entered into a consulting contract with Velodrome Worldwide Ltd (“Velodrome”), an entity based in Singapore. Velodrome was included within the scope 
of the Macfarlanes investigation but it has not been possible to identify its ultimate owners. In 2012, based on a review of services provided, the contract with Velodrome 
was terminated with effect from 31 December 2012, without penalty, and no further payments were made. 
e) In 2010, PT Berau entered into a fund management contract with Chateau Capital (“Chateau”), and invested $75m. Chateau is a Cayman Island based investment 
manager. Chateau was included within the scope of the Macfarlanes investigation but it has not been possible to identify its ultimate owners. Whilst the investment in 
Chateau was recorded at nil on acquisition by ARM, fund management fees were paid for part of 2012. Repayment of the fund management fees and original investment  
is being pursued against Chateau. 
f) During 2012, the former Directors of PT Berau approved the acquisition of 100% of the equity in two infrastructure companies. The current management at PT Berau has 
valued these two acquisitions and considers that they were acquired for an excess consideration which did not have a clear business purpose and therefore written off the 
excess in 2012 as ‘other exceptional costs’. Although the former management of PT Berau certified that none of the vendors in these transactions were related parties, 
current management has not been able to confirm the identity of the vendors and the ultimate beneficiaries of the transactions to establish the extent to which they may 
be connected.

parties where the ultimate beneficiary was not clear. These pledges were removed in full during April 2013. 
31.3 Compensation for key management personnel 
In accordance with IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”, key management personnel are those persons having authority and 
responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. 
In 2012, compensation for Directors was separately disclosed in the remuneration report, whereas this year compensation for

34. Changes in accounting policies and reclassifications 
Asia Resource Minerals plc adopted IFRIC Interpretation 20 “Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine” on  
1 January 2013. In addition, management has reclassified the presentation of land related prepayments to mining properties as it is 
considered to be more appropriate to include these costs as part of the development of the mine. Management has also reclassified 
certain short term bank deposits from cash and cash equivalents to restricted cash due to the expected length of time these deposits 
can be accessed. These deposits are held to secure performance bonds required by customers in the ordinary course of business. 
Finally, the changes to IAS 19 (revised) “Employee Benefits” have been adopted on 1 January 2013. The changes have had the 
following impact on the financial statements.

PARENT COMPANY STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 130 ASIA RESOURCE MINERALS | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information, statement of compliance and basis of preparation 
Asia Resource Minerals plc (formerly Bumi plc) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK under the 
Companies Act 2006 and is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company’s registered address is Atlas House, 3rd Floor,  
173 Victoria Street, London, SW1E 5NH. The Company’s registered number is 7460129. 
2. Accounting policies 
The Company is the ultimate parent entity of the Group. The Company’s financial statements are included in Asia Resource Minerals 
plc (formerly Bumi plc) consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013. As permitted by section 408 of the 
Companies Act, the Company has not presented its own Income Statement or Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The Company’s loss for the year was $418m (2012: $2,432m)  
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee Interpretations (“IFRICs”) as adopted by the European 
Union. They also comply with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. 
The financial statements are presented in US dollars, rounded to the nearest million. They are prepared under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.  
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Company financial statements are, where relevant, the same as those  
set out in Note 2 to the Group financial statements with the addition of the following: 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less impairment provisions. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, 
the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income 
generating unit on a value in use basis or at its fair value less costs of disposal if higher. The discount rate applied is based upon  
the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant unit. 
As highlighted in Note 2 of the Group financial statements, the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) Board meeting 
discussed how the fair value of non-current assets should be determined. This discussion clarified an area of interpretation within 
the existing standards and highlighted that investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures in stand-alone entity accounts 
and in particular, the fair value of cash generating units (“CGU”), when those CGUs correspond to a quoted entity, should be the 
product of their quoted price multiplied by the number of shares held and not by reference to an assessment of fair value using 
discounted future cash flows.  
Management has therefore, in line with prior year, used the quoted market price in assessing the fair value less costs of disposal  
in stand-alone entity accounts. This impacts the investment in Vallar Limited, which indirectly holds 85% of the share capital of  
PT Berau through Vallar Investments UK Limited (“VIUK”), as it values this investment with reference to the quoted market price  
of PT Berau, causing an impairment to the value of the investment. 
3. Investment in subsidiary

The Company’s sole investment is in Vallar Ltd, which is a 100% owned subsidiary incorporated in Jersey and is an intermediate 
Group holding company. Vallar Limited’s main assets are an indirect investment in PT Berau and PT Bumi.  
Details of indirectly held subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 32 of the Financial Statements.

Deferred Redeemable Shares of £1.00 were issued on 28 February 2011.

share capital requirement for it to be reregistered as a public company under the Companies Act. These Deferred Redeemable 
Shares were redeemed and cancelled on 31 October 2012 and a capital redemption reserve was created equivalent to the nominal

Warning to shareholders 
Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of the blue and 
offered shares that often turn out to be worthless or non existent, or an 
inflated price for shares they own. These calls come from fraudsters operating 
in “boiler rooms” that are mostly based abroad. 
While high profits are promised, those who buy or sell shares in this way 
usually lose their money. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has found most share fraud victims are 
experienced investors who lose an average of £20,000, with around £200m lost 
in the UK each year. 
Protect yourself 
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted shares, a premium 
price for shares you own, or free company or research reports, you should 
take these steps before handing over any money: 
1. Get the name of the person and organisation contacting you. 
2. Check the Financial Services Register (FSR) at www.fca.org.uk/register to 
ensure they are authorised. 
 
 
3. Use the details on the FSR to contact the firm 
4. Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are no contact 
details on the register or you are told they are out of date. 
5. Search the FCA’s list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing 
business with. 
6. REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares or other investments,  
you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong. 
Report a scam 
If you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA using the 
share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out 
about the latest investment scams. You can also call the FSA Consumer 
Helpline on 0800 111 6768. 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action 
Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

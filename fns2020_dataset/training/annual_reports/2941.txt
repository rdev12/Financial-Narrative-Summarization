Underlying operating profit
As the UK’s largest support services
business, we provide facilities management
and services for large, complex property
estates, infrastructure services for roads
and railways, utility services and
consultancy services, for a wide range 
of public and private sector customers.
Around 80 per cent of our revenue in 
this sector is generated from customers 
in the public and regulated sectors.
> Our support services activities continue 
to be a major driver of earnings growth 
as we continue to grow revenue at margins
of between four and five per cent.
> Our forward order book for support 
services at 31 December 2008 was worth
£10.8 billion (2007: £8.4 billion) and we 
had a pipeline of probable new orders worth
approximately £0.6 billion (2007: £0.6 billion).
In 2008, Carillion renewed its contract to provide
integrated facilities management services for all BT’s 
UK properties, which will generate over £500 million 
of revenue for the Group over five years.  05 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Section 02 – What we do
UK facilities management and services
Carillion provides public and private sector customers with a wide range
of facilities management and other support services for buildings and
infrastructure, from fully integrated property management solutions for 
large, complex estates, to single services in selected markets, such as
mechanical and electrical engineering maintenance. For example, we 
provide integrated property management services for HSBC’s UK network 
of retail banks, BT, Virgin Media and for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.
We also manage Norwich Union’s domestic and commercial property
insurance claims, from customer call centres to the completion of repairs. 
UK Government services
In this sector our services are primarily focused on defence, health and
education. We use our wide range of capabilities, including project finance,
design, construction, maintenance and facilities management, to deliver
services through Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and non-PPP contracts. 
We are the largest private sector supplier of support services to Defence
Estates, the largest private sector supplier of non-clinical support services to
the NHS and a leading supplier for the UK Government’s Building Schools 
for the Future (BSF) programme. In each of these sectors we provide project
finance, design and construction services, as well as facilities management.
UK infrastructure services
Carillion has long-term contracts for the Highways Agency and for Local
Authorities for the management and maintenance of around 20,000
kilometres of the UK road network. We also provide a wide range of 
rail services, including project and consultancy services for Network Rail,
Transport for London and Passenger Transport Executives, and we maintain
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. We are also one of the UK’s leading suppliers 
of infrastructure services for the installation, repair and maintenance of 
utility services, including water, gas, electricity and telecommunications. 
Middle East facilities management and services
In the Middle East, our Joint Venture business, Emrill, provides facilities
management services for a growing portfolio of properties, including 
those we are building for our Joint Venture partners, Al Futtaim and 
Emaar Properties, for whom Emrill is the preferred supplier of facilities
management services. Emrill therefore complements our construction 
activities in the Middle East and we expect it to grow steadily as new Al
Futtaim and Emaar properties are completed and added to Emrill’s portfolio. 
Canada and the Caribbean road maintenance 
and facilities management and services
Carillion is the leading private sector supplier of road management and
maintenance services in Ontario and Alberta, where we maintain the
equivalent of some 16,000 kilometres of two-lane highway. Our facilities
management business in Canada is also growing, driven by our market
leadership in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects in the health sector. 
We have completed two of the first PPP hospitals to be built in Canada in
which we provide non-clinical services, we have our third major PPP hospital
under construction and a good pipeline of further opportunities in this sector.

The new £254 million Queen Alexandra Hospital,
Portsmouth, is a Public Private Partnership project being
delivered by a Carillion joint venture for the Portsmouth
Hospital NHS Trust under a 35-year contract, which includes
the provision of project finance, design, construction,
maintenance and facilities management.  07 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Section 02 – What we do
UK health
Carillion has delivered a total of 10 PPP hospitals and other healthcare
facilities and has a further three under construction. Our projects included 
the first PPP hospitals in the UK and in Canada, the Darent Valley Hospital,
Kent, and the Royal Ottawa Hospital. Carillion has since sold its equity
investments in a number of projects, generating substantial value for 
the Group. At 31 December 2008, our PPP portfolio included three UK
hospital projects. In addition, we are currently the preferred bidder 
for two Independent Sector Treatment Centres and Carillion has been
announced as the frontrunner to become the preferred bidder for a 
major new PPP hospital in Bristol.
. 
UK defence
Our projects in this sector include the Government Communications
Headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, which has won a number 
of awards as one of the UK’s outstanding PPP projects. We also have 
three projects under construction for the Ministry of Defence, Allenby
Connaught, one of the largest PPP projects in the UK to date, to provide 
new accommodation and other facilities for the Army across the South 
of England, the new Permanent Joint Headquarters, Northwood, and 
the Royal School of Military Engineering in Chatham, Kent.
UK transport
In the transport sector, we have delivered six major PPP highway projects,
including one of the first in the UK, namely the widening of the M40
between Junctions 1A and 3. Carillion also delivered the first PPP rail project
in the UK, which involved upgrading sections of the Chiltern Line Railway,
together with London’s Marylebone Station. The sale of equity investments 
in transport projects has also created substantial value for the Group. 
At 31 December 2008 our portfolio of PPP investments included three 
major highway projects. 
UK education
To date, Carillion has built over 50 schools under the PPP and Building 
Schools for the Future (BSF) programmes. We currently have 18 schools 
under construction and we are shortlisted for a further 200 schools, under 
the UK Government’s £45 billion BSF programme to replace or upgrade all
secondary schools in England. We were also recently awarded one of the 
first contracts to provide a new primary school under the UK Government’s 
£7 billion Primary Capital Programme to replace or upgrade Primary Schools. 
Canada health
Canada has a substantial PPP investment programme, currently estimated 
to be worth in the region of £10 billion. Carillion has established a leading
position in the health sector, delivering two of the first PPP hospitals in
Canada, the new William Osler Hospital in Toronto and the Royal Ottawa
Hospital, both of which have moved successfully into the operational phase.
We are currently building our third PPP hospital, the Sault Area Hospital 
in Ontario, and early in 2009 we were awarded the contract to finance and
build a major extension to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Barrie, Ontario.

Section 02 – What we do
Abu Dhabi
Our Joint Venture business, Al Futtaim Carillion, was awarded two major
projects in Abu Dhabi in 2008, the £250 million Marina Hotel, which will 
span the new Formula 1 racetrack on Yas Island, and infrastructure works for
a new aluminium smelter for Emirates Aluminium, worth some £200 million.
During a visit to Abu Dhabi in November 2008 by UK Prime Minister, Gordon
Brown, and UK Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform, Lord Mandelson, Al Futtaim Carillion signed a heads of terms
agreement with ALDAR to build the £550 million Al Muneera development. 
Egypt
In 2008, Al Futtaim Carillion started work on the first-phase of Cairo 
Festival City, an Al Futtaim development with an estimated construction 
value of some £2 billion. The scope of this development is very similar 
to that of Dubai Festival City and includes retail, leisure, commercial and
residential elements. 
Dubai
In 2008, Al Futtaim Carillion continued to focus selectively on building and
infrastructure projects for some of the region’s leading developers, with 
whom we have established strong, long-term relationships. These projects
included further phases of a number of multi-billion pound developments,
notably Dubai Festival City for our joint venture partner, Al Futtaim, the 
Burj development for Emaar Properties and the Motor City development 
for Union Properties. We are also a long-standing supplier to Dubai
Aluminium, for whom we secured further infrastructure work in 2008.
Oman
Our Joint Venture business in Oman, Carillion Alawi, delivers a wide range 
of building and infrastructure projects. Its current projects include the 
prestigious House of Musical Arts, for which it was awarded a £120 million
contract in 2007 by the Oman Royal Court Affairs, and infrastructure works
for the Asian Beach Games for which it was awarded a £20 million contract 
in 2008.

healthcare facilities for the NHS.
UK infrastructure services
Our infrastructure activities include road construction, marine works, 
flood defence, industrial, water, wind energy and other specialist civil
engineering services, primarily for public sector customers. Current projects

for the 2012 London Olympics Media Centre and framework contracts for 
the Scottish Prison Service worth some £75 million.
Canada and the Caribbean
In Canada, a substantial proportion of our construction services work 
relates to the delivery of Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, notably 
in the health sector, where we are building our third PPP hospital, the 
£200 million Sault Area Hospital in Ontario. Other major projects in 
Canada include the £70 million Sunnybrook Hospital and a £35 million 
Honda Campus development. In the Caribbean, we have a number of
substantial contracts, including the £70 million Viceroy Resort in Anguilla 
and the £30 million Board of Inland Revenue Tower in Trinidad.

Section 03 – Our performance
In view of the Group’s strong performance in 2008 and positive
prospects for 2009, the Board is recommending a final ordinary
dividend for 2008 of 8.9 pence per share, making the total
dividend for 2008 13.0 pence, an increase of 18 per cent on the
total paid in respect of 2007 (11.0 pence). The final dividend 
for 2008 will be paid on 19 June 2009 to shareholders on the
register at close of business on 24 April 2009.
Delivering such a strong performance in 2008 while successfully
integrating the Alfred McAlpine business is testimony to the
quality and commitment of our people. On behalf of the Board 
I should like to thank all our employees for the outstanding
contribution they have made to Carillion’s success in 2008. 
Roger Robinson has decided to retire from the Board and as 
a Director of the Company at the Annual General Meeting 
on the 6th May 2009. Roger joined the Board in 1999 when
Carillion was launched as an independent company, following 
its de-merger from Tarmac plc, where he had served in a number 
of senior positions. Roger has played a major part in Carillion’s
development and success and is widely respected throughout 
our industry, in which he intends to maintain an active interest. 
He leaves the Board with our grateful thanks and very best 
wishes for the future.
With the wider economic background expected to become
increasingly difficult, delivery of our business objectives will
become more challenging. However, Carillion is a well-balanced
and resilient business, with a robust balance sheet, a £20.4 billion
order book and strong market positions. Therefore, the Board
continues to expect the Group to deliver materially enhanced
earnings in 2009. 
Philip Rogerson 
Chairman
4 March 2009
Revenue, including Joint Ventures
(1)
increased by 32 per cent to 
£5.2 billion (2007: £4.0 billion), primarily due to the acquisition 
of Alfred McAlpine in February 2008.
Underlying profit before tax
(2)
increased by 55 per cent to £157.5
million (2007: £101.8 million) and underlying earnings per share
(2)
grew by 19 per cent to 34.3 pence per share (2007: 28.9 pence),
reflecting both revenue and margin growth.
The Group’s balance sheet remains robust, with underlying cash
flow from operations of £198.3 million (2007: £135.7 million)
again well ahead of underlying profit from operations of £165.2
million (2007: £101.2 million). Net borrowing at 31 December
2008 was £226.7 million (2007: £44.9 million), considerably 
better than our year-end target of £300 million. The increase 
in net borrowing since December 2007 reflects a number of
investments made during the year, the largest of which was the
acquisition of Alfred McAlpine.
This acquisition represented a major step in Carillion’s strategic
development by creating the UK’s largest support services business
and significantly increasing the Group’s overall strength and
resilience. The benefits of the acquisition continue to exceed our
expectations, with integration and re-organisation cost savings 
now expected to increase by 67 per cent from our original target
of £30 million per annum to an annual run rate of £50 million by 
the end of 2009. Absolute savings were £15 million in 2008 and
are expected to be £35 million in 2009 and £50 million in 2010.
At the year end, the Group had a forward order book of 
£20.4 billion (2007: £16.0 billion) with the increase due to the
acquisition of Alfred McAlpine and to organic growth. In addition,
the Group had a pipeline of probable new orders at the year end
worth some £3.1 billion (2007: £3.6 billion).
(1) Continuing operations 
(2) Continuing operations before intangible amortisation, 
impairment of other investments, curtailment gain,
restructuring costs and non-operating items. 
Carillion continued to perform strongly in 
2008 and has once again delivered substantial
earnings growth. This has been achieved in an
increasingly challenging economic environment
and reflects the success of the Group’s strategy
in creating a strong and resilient business.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our performance
Carillion’s strong progress continues to be driven 
by our consistent and successful strategy for
sustainable, profitable growth. This strategy has
delivered a sixth successive year of significant
earnings and dividend growth, as well as creating 
a balanced and resilient business.
We are committed to the highest standards 
of corporate responsibility through behaving 
in accordance with our core values and our
award-winning sustainability strategy. 
Our strategy 
> Grow support services and Public Private Partnership 
projects organically and by acquisition.
> Develop and market integrated solutions tailored 
to the needs of customers, including project finance, 
design and construction, maintenance and lifetime 
asset management.
> Maintain a strong and selective construction 
capability focused on higher added-value contracts for 
long-term customers.
Our values
> Openness
> Collaboration 
> Mutual dependency 
> Professional delivery
> Sustainable, profitable growth 
> Innovation
Operational risk management
Carillion has rigorous policies and processes in place to identify,
mitigate and manage strategic risks and those specific to
individual businesses and contracts, including economic, social,
environmental and ethical risks. These processes are described 
in more detail in the Corporate Governance report on page 49.
The more significant areas of risk for the Group and the
measures being taken to mitigate and manage them are
summarised here. 
We apply our risk management processes to every aspect of our
operations from choosing our market sectors and the contracts
we bid for to the selection of our suppliers and sub-contractors.
We also apply them to every stage of a contract from inception
to completion, in order to deliver the cash-backed profit we
expect and high-quality services for our customers.
Risk
> The impact of the current global economic downturn on
the financial stability of our customers, partners and
suppliers.
Mitigation
> Applying rigorous selectivity criteria to the choice of customers,
projects, partners and suppliers, in relation to their financial
stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms
and conditions. 
Risk
> Managing major contracts to ensure they are delivered
on time, to budget and to the required standards.
Mitigation
> Applying rigorous selectivity criteria to ensure that we take on
contracts only where we understand the risks involved and can
manage them; applying equally rigorous policies and processes 
to monitor and manage contract performance. 
Headline objectives
Support services
> To grow earnings at operating margins of between four and
five per cent.
Public Private Partnership projects
> To use the strong positions we have established in our chosen
sectors of the Private Finance market in the UK and Canada to 
win projects in which equity investments will create significant
value for the Group.
Middle East construction services
> To increase Carillion’s share of revenue from our joint venture
businesses in the Middle East from £337 million in 2007 to
around £600 million by the end of 2009, at an operating 
margin of some six per cent.
Construction services (excluding the Middle East)
> To increase the operating margins of our construction activities 
in the UK, Canada and the Caribbean in order to improve the
combined margins for all our construction activities, including 
the Middle East, towards three per cent by 2010.

2008 Acquisitions
Alfred McAlpine
The acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in February 2008 was a further
major step in Carillion’s strategic development and it continues to
deliver benefits ahead of our original expectations. 
The Carillion and Alfred McAlpine businesses are an excellent
strategic fit and combining them has created the UK’s largest
support services business, with enhanced positions in our chosen
market sectors. 
Carillion is now a well balanced, more resilient and soundly
financed business, with 55 per cent of our operating profit coming
from support services, 14 per cent from our equity investments in
Public Private Partnership projects, 17 per cent from Middle East
construction services and 14 per cent from construction services
(excluding the Middle East).
Combining the two businesses also created the opportunity to
generate cost savings, which are now expected to reach an annual
run rate of £50 million a year by the end of 2009, £20 million a
year more than we expected at the time of acquisition. 
Vanbots Group
The acquisition of the Vanbots Group, a well established
construction management services group in Canada, for 
£17 million in October 2008, was also an important strategic
development for our business in Canada. The skills and strong
market reputation, particularly in the health sector, of the Vanbots
Group have significantly enhanced our ability to provide integrated
solutions, especially for Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects,
further reinforcing our leadership in the PPP market and the health
sector in particular. 
Group key performance indicators in 2008
1. Continue to attract, develop and retain excellent 
people by being an employer of choice.
Meeting or exceeding our customers’ expectations depends
primarily on the quality of our people. Therefore, the ability to
attract, develop and retain excellent people by becoming an
employer of choice continues to be our top priority. 
In 2008, we made further good progress through the leadership,
personal development and employee engagement programmes
we operate across the Group to help all our people fulfil 
their potential and contribute to Carillion’s success.

Section 03 – Our performance
Creating a culture of trust and open communication is essential 
to the success of our policies and programmes for developing 
our people. Our managers and supervisors seek to engage with 
all our people through regular one-to-one meetings, individual
performance and development reviews and monthly team talks,
supported by newsletters and our national award winning
company newspaper, Spectrum.
Listening to what our people tell us and acting upon it is vital to
good communication. To that end and to help us monitor and
measure our progress, we conduct employee surveys. For example,
every year we hold ‘The Great Debate’, an interactive survey in
which our people, selected randomly from across the Group, share
their views on a wide range of issues, which are important to 
their development and satisfaction and to the success of Carillion.
In 2008, over 2,800 people took part in ‘The Great Debate’, 
the results of which showed that we continue to make good
overall progress on these issues and that the levels of satisfaction
expressed by our people compared favourably with those achieved
by other top UK companies.
2. Be the recognised leader in the delivery of Safety 
and Sustainability.
The Health and Safety of our people and everyone who works
with us or is affected by our operations is paramount. 
In 2005, we set the demanding objective of eliminating reportable
accidents by 2010. Known as ‘Target Zero’, this objective is led by
our Board and requires the constant vigilance and commitment 
of everyone in Carillion to ensure that safe working practices are
consistently adopted and supported by rigorous reviews, audits
and training.
In 2008, the Group’s Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) remained at
0.14 reportable accidents per 100,000 man hours worked (2007
AFR: 0.14), which continues to rank with the best in our sector
and follows year on year reductions in our AFR of 22 per cent in
2007, 25 per cent in 2006 and 35 per cent in 2005. 
While it is disappointing that we have not achieved a further
reduction in 2008, we have maintained our AFR at this level
during a period of considerable change and re-organisation,
resulting from acquiring and integrating the Alfred McAlpine
business, during which time 79 per cent of our projects achieved
zero reportable accidents. 
The total number of hours worked in 2008 increased by 
33 per cent to 281 million, with the total number of reportable
accidents under RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995) increasing by 30 per
cent to 384 (2007: 295).
We deeply regret that in 2008 there were three fatal accidents
involving employees of sub-contractors working on Carillion
project sites, one in the UK, one in the Middle East and one in the
Caribbean. Each of these incidents was a personal tragedy and 
our thoughts are very much with the families and friends of those
who died. Six prosecutions of Carillion by the Health and Safety
Executive were concluded in 2008. Four of these related to
accidents that occurred in the former Mowlem and Alfred
McAlpine businesses between 2003 and 2007, before they 
were acquired by Carillion. 
In 2008, Carillion once again submitted information on the 
Health and Safety performance of all its UK business units to the
Corporate Health and Safety Performance Index, having been 
the first and only major construction company to do so in 2006.
This Index, which is sponsored by the Health and Safety Executive,
covers all aspects of Health and Safety management and
performance. A wide range of industries participate in the Index,
which enables us to benchmark our performance beyond our 
own industry sector. In 2008, we improved our Index score to 
8.0 (2007: 7.4), which was well above the mean score of 6.6.
In October 2008, Carillion launched ‘Behaving Safely’, which set
out the behaviours expected of everyone, including supervisors
and managers. This standard is being used throughout our
business to challenge and improve safety behaviours.
In 2008, we continued to demonstrate our leadership in
sustainability by winning the 2008 Sunday Times Best Green
Companies Award for large and medium-sized companies with a
high environmental impact. The award was based on a survey that
tested the credentials of participating companies by examining
their corporate policies and by asking employees to comment on
whether green policies are truly embedded in the companies for
which they work. A resounding 76 per cent of Carillion employees
believed that Carillion practised what it preached.
We also achieved a ‘gold’ performance ranking in Business 
in the Community’s Corporate Responsibility Index, published 
in 2008, achieving a score of 92.5 per cent and topping the
Construction and Building Materials Sector. Alfred McAlpine also
achieved a ‘gold’ performance ranking with a score of 90.5 per
cent, which topped the Support Service Sector. The Corporate
Responsibility Index involves a detailed assessment of strategy,
management processes and performance. The average score of 
all participating companies was 82.6 per cent, which demonstrates
that we not only continue to be the leader in our sector, but also
that our performance compares favourably with that of all
participating companies. Carillion also continues to be a member
of the FTSE4Good Index and we were delighted to be ranked
among the top 22 most ethical companies in the FTSE350 in 
2008 by the Observer newspaper’s ‘Good Company Guide’.  Group Chief Executive’s review

3. Deliver revenue growth of a minimum of five per cent. 
Total revenue
(1)
in 2008 increased by 32 per cent, due primarily 
to the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine.
4. Successfully integrate Alfred McAlpine and deliver
integration cost savings that put us on track to achieve
savings at an annual run rate of £30 million per annum 
by the end of 2009.
The integration of Alfred McAlpine has gone very well and by 
the year end was substantially complete, with the benefits of this
acquisition well ahead of our original expectations. Integration 
and re-organisation cost savings are now expected to reach a run
rate of £50 million per annum by the end of 2009, £20 million
more than we expected at the time of acquisition. The one-off
cost of delivering these savings is anticipated to be £55 million, 
an increase of £25 million on the £30 million we expected to 
incur to deliver savings at a run rate of £30 million per annum. 
5. Achieve earnings per share growth that puts us 
on track to deliver materially enhanced earnings per 
share in 2009, following the Alfred McAlpine acquisition.
Underlying earnings per share
(2)
increased by 19 per cent to 
34.3 pence per share (2007: 28.9 pence). This reflected the
Group’s overall strong performance and better than expected
benefits from the Alfred McAlpine acquisition, including a
continuing improvement in the Group’s operating margin to 
3.2 per cent (2007: 2.6 per cent).
6. Generate cash-backed operating profit.
The delivery of cash-backed profit continues to be an absolute
priority within all our businesses. Our rigorous focus on cash
management once again resulted in strong underlying cash flow
from operations of £198.3 million (2007: £135.7 million), which
represented 120 per cent of underlying profit from operations 
of £165.2 million (2007: £101.2 million). 
7. Achieve year-end net borrowing in the region 
of £300 million. 
Net borrowing at 31 December 2008 was £226.7 million 
(2007: £44.9 million), considerably better than our target of 
£300 million. Net borrowing at 31 December 2008 was higher
than at 31 December 2007 due to the acquisition of Alfred
McAlpine, which was financed by a combination of borrowing 
and new Carillion shares. Reducing net borrowing to well below
our £300 million year end target reflects our success in delivering
strong cash flow from operations, in line with our continuing 
focus on cash management.
Group key performance indicators in 2009 
In order to continue the Group’s strong progress and deliver
materially enhanced earnings in 2009, the Board has set six 
Group key performance indicators for 2009, namely
• to attract, develop and retain excellent people by 
being an employer of choice
• be the recognised leader in the delivery of safety 
and sustainability in the sectors in which we operate
• deliver integration and re-organisation cost savings
arising from the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine of 
£35 million in 2009 and achieve cost savings at an
annual run rate of £50 million per annum by the 
end of 2009
• deliver materially enhanced earnings 
• generate cash-backed operating profit
• continue to reduce year-end net borrowing.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Section 03 – Our performance
Outlook and prospects 
An increasingly difficult economic environment background 
will undoubtedly make the delivery of our business objectives 
more challenging. 
However, the acquisition and successful integration of the Alfred
McAlpine business has created a well-balanced and more resilient
business, with a £20.4 billion order book, a pipeline of probable
new orders of some £3.1 billion and strong positions in our
chosen market sectors. 
The outlook in support services remains positive as we continue 
to have our strongest ever pipeline of opportunities for new work,
as public and private sector customers seek to reduce estate
maintenance and facilities management costs through outsourcing
these services. We therefore expect support services to remain a
major driver of earnings growth in 2009.
In Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects we expect 
the outlook in our chosen market sectors to remain positive,
particularly the UK education sector and the health sector in
Canada. We continue to expect opportunities to add new projects
to our portfolio of PPP equity investments and to continue our
policy of selling equity investments in mature projects, which
generates significant value for the Group. 
The outlook in our Middle East markets changed significantly in
the second half of 2008. The huge level of investment we have
seen over the past few years in Dubai is now slowing down 
and we expect to see a reduction in our activities there in 2009.
However, overall we expect further growth in Middle East
construction services, driven increasingly by the expansion of 
our activities in Abu Dhabi. Having broadened our geographical
and customer base, we still expect to increase Carillion’s share 
of revenue from our Middle East businesses from the 2007 level 
of £337 million to around £600 million by the end of 2009, at
an operating margin of some six per cent.
In construction services (excluding the Middle East) we will
continue to focus on growing margins rather than revenue, 
a strategy we put in place well before the current economic
downturn. This supports our objective of increasing the operating
margin for all of our construction activities towards three per cent 
by 2010. In Canada and the Caribbean, we expect to make further
progress in 2009, driven primarily by growth in PPP construction 
and highways maintenance in Canada.
Given the overall outlook across each of our reporting segments, 
I believe that Carillion is well placed to make good progress 
in 2009, despite increasingly challenging market conditions. 
I therefore continue to expect Carillion to deliver materially
enhanced earnings in 2009, in line with the objective set 
when we acquired Alfred McAlpine in February 2008, and to
continue to reduce year-end net borrowing.

Our performance
Richard Adam
Group Finance Director
Carillion performed strongly in 2008 to deliver 
19 per cent growth in underlying earnings per
share and to achieve or exceed all of our key
financial and strategic objectives.
Earnings growth in 2008 was driven by a strong underlying
performance by the Carillion Group together with better than
expected benefits from the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in
February 2008. This has created a solid platform upon which we
expect to build in 2009 to deliver materially enhanced earnings
growth.
Carillion is the UK’s largest support services business with strong
maintenance, private finance, design and construction capabilities,
which enable the Group to deliver fully integrated, life-time asset
management solutions for buildings and infrastructure. 
The Group has operations in the UK, Middle East and Canada and
the Caribbean and our principal market sectors and activities are
described on pages 2 to 11.
Accounting policies
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards and there have been no changes in accounting policies
during 2008. The Group’s significant accounting policies are
described on pages 68 to 71.
Group overview 
Total revenue from continuing operations in 2008 increased by 
32 per cent to £5,205.8 million (2007: £3,951.7 million), including
revenue from Joint Ventures of £772.0 million (2007: £621.0 million).
Total underlying profit from operations increased by 63 per cent 
to £165.2 million (2007: £101.2 million), including profit from
Joint Ventures of £45.1 million (2007: £36.8 million). 
The underlying profit from operations margin increased to 
3.2 per cent (2007: 2.6 per cent) and reflected our continuing
drive to improve margins through contract selectivity, cost
reduction and greater efficiency.  23 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Section 03 – Our performance
After a net financial expense of £7.7 million (2007: £0.6 million
income), underlying profit before tax was £157.5 million (2007:
£101.8 million), an increase of 55 per cent. Underlying earnings per
share on the same measure increased by 19 per cent to 34.3 pence
(2007: 28.9 pence).
Intangible amortisation and impairment of other investments
amounted to £54.5 million (2007: £21.5 million). Restructuring
and re-organisation costs were £58.2 million (2007: £14.2 million),
of which £55.0 million related to the acquisition of Alfred
McAlpine and £3.2 million to the acquisition of the Vanbots
Group. Non-operating income was £35.6 million (2007: £28.3
million), generated from the sale of equity investments in Public
Private Partnership projects. In addition, a curtailment gain of
£35.5 million (2007: Nil) has been recognised as a result of
completing the consultation process relating to closing Carillion’s
main defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual on 5 April
2009. This is in line with the Group’s strategy for managing the
risk associated with these schemes, which have been closed to
new members for a number of years. 
Total exceptional and non-operating items therefore amounted to
a net cost of £41.6 million (2007: £7.4 million), leaving reported
profit before tax of £115.9 million (2007: £94.4 million). 
Total Group taxation was £4.1 million (2007: £8.3 million). Group
taxation on underlying profit before taxation
(1)
was £22.9 million
(2007: £18.3 million), which, when combined with Joint Ventures
taxation of £10.7 million (2007: £9.0 million), represented an
underlying effective tax rate of 20 per cent (2007: 25 per cent).
Profit after tax was £111.8 million (2007: £86.1 million) and
minority interests were £3.5 million (2007: £2.5 million), leaving
profit attributable to Carillion shareholders of £108.3 million
(2007: £76.0 million). Basic earnings per share were 28.4 pence
(2007: 27.1 pence). 
Underlying cash flow from operations of £198.3 million again
comfortably exceeded underlying profit from operations of 
£165.2 million. After payments of £50.5 million to pension 
funds, in line with our pension deficit recovery plan, net capital
expenditure of £26.4 million, restructuring and other costs of
£32.4 million, interest, tax and dividend payments of £62.2 million
and a net cost for acquisitions and disposals of £227.0 million,
net borrowing at 31 December 2008 increased by £181.8 million
to £226.7 million (2007: £44.9 million), significantly better than 
our target of £300 million, set at the time of the Alfred
McAlpine acquisition.
Acquisitions
On 12 February 2008, Carillion acquired UK support services
company, Alfred McAlpine, for a total consideration of £554.5
million, satisfied by issuing 112.9 million Carillion shares, valued at
the mid-market price at close of business on the day preceding the
effective date of acquisition of 337.75 pence per share, £171.7
million in cash and £1.3 million of loan notes. At acquisition,
Alfred McAlpine had net borrowing of £96.4 million.
The Carillion and Alfred McAlpine businesses are an excellent
strategic fit and combining them has created the UK’s largest
support services business, with enhanced positions in our chosen
market sectors. Therefore, the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine was
a further major step in Carillion’s strategic development, giving us
a well balanced and more resilient business. Combining the two
businesses has also enabled us to improve efficiency and deliver
substantial integration and re-organisation cost savings, which 
we expect to reach an annual run rate of £50 million a year 
by the end of 2009, £20 million a year more than we expected 
at the time of acquisition. 
On 8 October 2008, Carillion acquired the Vanbots Group, a 
well-established construction management services group in
Canada, for a consideration of £17.0 million. The skills and strong
market reputation, particularly in the health sector, of the Vanbots
Group have significantly enhanced our ability to provide integrated
solutions, especially for Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects,
further reinforcing our leadership in the PPP market and the 
health sector in particular.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our performance
Support services
Revenue in support services increased by 37 per cent to £2,463.5
million, primarily due to the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 54 per cent to £113.5
million, reflecting revenue growth and a significant improvement
in the operating margin to 4.6 per cent (2007: 4.1 per cent). 
The value of our forward order book for support services at 31
December 2008 was £10.8 billion (2007: £8.4 billion), with the
increase due to the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine and organic
growth. In addition, we had a pipeline of probable new orders
worth £0.6 billion (2007: £0.6 billion).
During the year we secured a number of significant new contracts
in our key market sectors of integrated facilities management,
especially for large complex property estates, and infrastructure
services. Notable successes in integrated facilities management
included renewing our existing contract with BT for a further five
years, worth over £500 million, and new contracts for up to five
years for Philips, AXA, Northamptonshire County Council and
Nationwide, together worth over £450 million. 
In infrastructure services, we secured an £85 million, five-year
contract for the Highways Agency for the maintenance of
motorways and trunk roads in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire,
Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, together with those in 
the Luton and Milton Keynes Unitary Authorities.
Our utility services business also made good progress in 2008,
winning new contracts for infrastructure services in its key market
sectors of electricity, water, gas and telecommunications. Notable
successes included a £60 million contract for Scottish Power,
electricity infrastructure contracts worth over £17 million, contracts
for gas metering worth over £15 million and extensions to existing
contracts worth in the region of £50 million.
We have made a good start to 2009, winning a five-year
integrated facilities management contract for a multi-national
blue-chip customer, worth some £75 million, a seven year UK rail
maintenance contract worth £80 million and a six-year highways
maintenance contract in Canada, worth £170 million. 
Our pipeline of contract opportunities also continues to be strong,
as both public and private sector customers continue to seek
outsourcing solutions for facilities management and infrastructure
and utility services. Therefore, we expect to make further progress
in support services in 2009.

Integrated facilities
management 
for Philips
Carillion’s joint venture in the Netherlands with Arcadis NL was 
awarded a £350 million, five-year facilities management contract by
Philips in 2008. The Joint Venture is providing an integrated service
solution, including facilities management, maintenance, cleaning,
security, logistics and space planning for around 1.6 million square
metres of Philip’s estate in the Netherlands, including office and
production facilities.  Public Private Partnership projects
At 31 December 2008, we had a portfolio of 21 equity investments
(2007: 23) in financially closed Public Private Partnership (PPP)
projects in which we had already invested some £56.9 million of
equity and had commitments to invest a further £88.4 million,
which will bring our total equity investment in these projects to
£145.3 million. 
Our ability to win and deliver PPP projects successfully into the
operational phase continues to create significant value for the
Group. PPP concession contracts are typically for 25 to 35 years.
When bidding for these projects we target a 15 per cent internal
rate of return on our equity investments over the concession period.
The net present value of an equity investment is calculated by
discounting the cash returns it generates over the concession period
at a discount rate appropriate to the risk associated with achieving
these returns. When the construction of a project is complete and 
it has moved successfully into the operational phase, this risk is
significantly reduced, which attracts a lower discount rate and a
higher net present value. At this point, the project is mature and 
we have the option of selling our equity investment and reinvesting
the proceeds in new projects. 
During 2008, we added three new projects to our portfolio – the
Nottingham City Council Building Schools for the Future project,
Cleadon Park Health Centre in South Tyneside and the Royal School
of Military Engineering project for the UK Ministry of Defence – in
which we expect to invest a total of £8.2 million of equity. In March
2009, the North Bristol NHS Trust announced that it is planning to
appoint Carillion as the preferred bidder for the new £1.6 billion
hospital at Southmead in Bristol, in which we expect to invest up 
to £40 million of equity.
We also sold equity investments in a further six mature projects,
generating net cash proceeds of £59.9 million, which reflected a 
net present value for the cash flows from these investments based
on an average underlying discount rate of under 5.5 per cent. 
These latest sales bring the total number of equity investments that
we have sold over the last five years to 23, which has generated
cash proceeds of £179 million and a pre-tax profit of £104 million. 
The Directors’ valuation of our portfolio at 31 December 2008 
was £216 million (2007: £266 million), based on discounting 
the cash flows from our remaining portfolio of investments, 
at an average of nine per cent (2007: eight per cent), which 
reflects the fact that our current projects are at various stages of
completion, with 10 fully operational and 11 still in construction. 
Underlying operating profit in this segment incresed by 17% to
£29.8 million, as growing returns from our maturing portfolio 
of investments more than offset the cumulative effects of selling 
three equity investments in December 2007 and six investments
during 2008.
In 2009, we expect to reach financial close on the three projects 
for which we are currently the preferred bidder and in which we
plan to invest approximately £5.3 million of equity. In addition, we
are shortlisted for a further eight projects with a potential equity
requirement of up to £76 million. With this strong pipeline of new
projects and both the UK and Canadian authorities committed 
to long-term PPP programmes, notably the Building Schools for 
the Future programme in the UK and the hospital programme in
Ontario, we believe the outlook in this segment remains positive.

Our share of the revenues of our Middle East businesses increased
by 38 per cent to £464.2 million as a result of organic growth in
Dubai and Oman and first-time contributions, in particular from 
Abu Dhabi, where we started work on two major new projects in
2008, and from Egypt. 
Underlying operating profit rose by 36 per cent to £34.5 million,
reflecting revenue growth at a stable operating margin of 7.4 per
cent (2007: 7.5 per cent). 
In 2008, our Middle East businesses continued to use their strong
market positions and reputation for high quality services to
negotiate new orders with selected customers in our chosen 
sectors of the building and infrastructure markets. At 31 December
2008, our Middle East construction services order book stood at
£0.8 billion (2007: £0.7 billion) and we had a pipeline of probable
new orders worth £0.9 billion (2007: £1.0 billion).
During 2008, we were awarded a number of significant new
projects in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Oman. 
We have been particularly successful in extending our operations
into Abu Dhabi, where Al Futtaim Carillion was awarded a £250
million contract by ALDAR to build the prestigious Marina Hotel
that will sit astride the new Formula 1 race track on Yas Island and
contracts by EMAL (Emirates Aluminium) for infrastructure work
worth over £200 million. In addition, Al Futtaim Carillion signed a
heads of terms agreement with ALDAR to build the £550 million
Al Muneera development in Abu Dhabi, the contract for which
was signed in February 2009. In Oman, Carillion Alawi was
awarded a £20 million contract by the Oman Tourist Development
Company to build the next phase of the infrastructure for the
Asian Games.
The outlook in our Middle East markets changed significantly 
in the second half of 2008. The huge level of investment we 
have seen over the past few years in Dubai is now slowing down 
and we expect to see a reduction in our activities there in 2009. 
In anticipation of this, we had already diversified our business in
the region by extending operations to Abu Dhabi and Egypt early
in 2008. As Dubai slows, we expect our growth in the region 
to be increasingly driven by Abu Dhabi, which continues to
implement its ‘Plan 2030’ involving major investment in building
and infrastructure for which funding is expected to be secure. 
Given the strength of our order book and pipeline of probable
orders, and the opportunities we expect for further projects,
especially in Abu Dhabi, we expect to remain on track to achieve
our objective of increasing our share of revenue in the Middle East
from the 2007 level of £337 million to around £600 million by 
the end of 2009, at an operating margin of some six per cent.

Marina Hotel
The £250 million Marina Hotel on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi is being 
built by Al Futtaim Carillion for ALDAR. It forms part of an impressive
development to accommodate the Formula 1 Grand Prix in November
2009, which will see the motor racing circuit pass through the centre 
of the new hotel from which the occupants will have excellent views 
of the circuit in luxurious surroundings. Construction services 
(excluding the Middle East)
Revenue in construction services increased by 26 per cent to
£2,099.7 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Alfred
McAlpine. 
The 79 per cent increase in underlying operating profit to 
£28.7 million, reflected the increase in revenue and an improved
operating margin of 1.4 per cent (2007: 1.0 per cent), in line 
with our strategy of focusing on growing margins rather than
revenue in order to improve our operating margin for all
construction activities, including the Middle East, towards 
three per cent by 2010. 
Focusing on long-term customers and projects that offer better
margins and for which funding is expected to be more secure, 
has resulted in around 80 per cent of our work in this segment
coming from the public and regulated sectors, with the remaining
20 per cent coming from the private sector. Overall, investment 
by the public and regulated sectors continues to hold up well,
which is evidence of the Government’s commitment to maintain,
and in some areas accelerate, projects to mitigate the effects of
the economic downturn. Consequently, the impact on Carillion 
of the slow down in private sector investment has been relatively
minor and more than outweighed by the progress we have made
with growing margins through project selectivity. 
New order intake remained healthy in 2008 and our order book 
at 31 December 2008 stood at £3.5 billion (2007: £1.8 billion) 
and our pipeline of probable new orders was worth some 
£1.5 billion (2007: £0.9 billion). 
Notable new contracts in the UK in 2008 included Building
Schools for the Future projects worth over £400 million, the £330
million second satellite at Heathrow Terminal 5, the £300 million
Royal School of Military Engineering project, the £250 million
Media Centre for the 2012 Olympic Games, the £157 million
Library of Birmingham project and a £57 million contract for
student accommodation at the University of Aston. In Canada
significant new contracts, including the Sault Area Hospital, a
£200 million Public Private Partnership project, which will generate
some £40 million of construction revenue, the £70 million
Sunnybrook Hospital and a new £35 million campus development
for Honda.
New order intake has also continued to be positive in the first two
months of 2009. In the UK, we have been awarded a £120 million
contract for the Bankside development in London and in Canada
we have achieved financial close on our fourth major hospital to
be built using private finance, the £144 million Royal Victoria
Hospital, in Barrie, Ontario. In addition, the North Bristol NHS 
Trust has announced that it is planning to appoint Carillion as 
the preferred bidder for the new hospital at Southmead in Bristol,
which is expected to generate approximately £450 million of
construction revenue for the Group.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on increasing margins,
even if this means that revenue reduces, in order to improve our
combined operating margin for all of the Group’s construction
activities towards three per cent. This strategy is supported by 
our substantial, high quality order book and pipeline of probable
orders, which provide sufficient visibility for us to be confident 
of achieving our expectations for construction services in 2009.

Our performance
Intangible amortisation and impairment of 
other investments
Intangible amortisation and impairment of other investments 
of £54.5 million (2007: £21.5 million) comprises £42.8 million in
respect of intangible assets arising primarily from the acquisition 
of Mowlem in 2006, Alfred McAlpine in 2008 and the Vanbots
Group in 2008 and an impairment charge of £11.7 million in
respect of Carillion’s investment in the Alice Springs to Darwin
railway, a Public Private Partnership project acquired with 
Mowlem. The carrying value of our investment in this project 
has been reduced to zero, following the project being placed 
in administration.
Curtailment gain 
As part of the Group’s policy for managing the risks and liabilities
associated with its defined benefit pension schemes, Carillion’s
main defined benefit schemes will close to future accrual on 
5 April 2009. As a result of completing the consultation process
relating to closing these schemes to future accrual, a curtailment
gain of £35.5 million (net of expenses of £2.8 million) has been
recognised in the income statement. 
Restructuring costs
A summary of these costs is provided in the table below.
2008 2007
£m £m
Alfred McAlpine integration and re-organisation costs 55.0 –
Vanbots Group integration and re-organisation costs 3.2 –
Mowlem integration and re-organisation costs – 9.5
Operational structure review costs – 4.5
Rail activities review costs – 0.2
58.2 14.2
The acquisition of Alfred McAlpine is delivering better than
expected benefits, with integration and re-organisation cost
savings expected to reach an annual run rate of £50 million by 
the end of 2009, £20 million more than expected at the time of
acquisition. The one-off costs of delivering these savings have
increased from £30 million to £55 million and have been
recognised in full in 2008. Integration of the Vanbots Group is
progressing well, with the costs and benefits in line with our
expectations. 
Non-operating items
Non-operating items in 2008 amounted to £35.6 million 
(2007: £28.3 million) and related to gains on the disposal of
investments in mature Public Private Partnership projects, as
described on page 26.
Net financial expense 
The Group had a net financial expense of £7.7 million (2007: £0.6
million income). This comprised a net expense of £25.1 million in
respect of borrowings, interest received in respect of loans to
Special Purpose Companies for Public Private Partnership projects
of £4.8 million and a net interest credit from retirement benefit
schemes of £12.6 million. 
Taxation
The effective tax rate on the Group’s and Joint Ventures’
underlying profit was 20 per cent. This reflects the agreement 
of certain prior year tax issues with the tax authorities, together
with a mechanism for the use in 2008 and beyond of certain tax
losses. At 31 December 2008 the Group had £355 million of
corporate tax losses in the UK that are available to reduce future
tax payments. The Group’s ability to maintain its effective tax rate
at 20 per cent is further underpinned by the UK Government’s
proposal to exempt UK companies from taxation on foreign
earnings from April 2009. 
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share from continuing operations
increased by 19 per cent to 34.3 pence (2007: 28.9 pence). 
This substantial increase reflected the Group’s strong operating
performance, notably by growing operating margins on increased
revenue and by reducing central costs.
Dividend 
Carillion has a progressive dividend policy of increasing the
dividend paid to shareholders broadly in line with earnings growth,
after taking account of the investment needs of the business.
Consistent with this policy, the Board has recommended a final
dividend in respect of 2008 of 8.9 pence, making the full-year
dividend 13.0 pence, an increase of 18 per cent on the total paid
in respect of 2007 (11.0 pence). Underlying dividend cover was
2.6 times and similar to that in 2007.

of cash-backed profit has resulted in underlying cash flow from
operations of £198.3 million being significantly ahead of
underlying profit from operations of £165.2 million. Net borrowing
at 31 December 2008 has been reduced to £226.7 million,
considerably better than our target of £300 million.
Additional cash payments to the Group’s pension’s schemes
amounted to £50.5 million, in line with our pensions deficit
recovery plan. The cash cost of restructuring and re-organisation 
of £32.4 million was less than the £58.2 million charged to profit,
because the latter recognised in full the costs associated with the
acquisitions of Alfred McAlpine and the Vanbots Group, including
some whose cash impact will fall after 31 December 2008.
Interest, tax and dividends on the Group’s enlarged share capital
base increased to £62.2 million. Net capital expenditure of 
£26.4 million, reflected the needs of the enlarged group: the 
net cash inflow in 2007 arose because capital expenditure of 
£25.1 million was more than offset by income from the sale of
assets, notably rail plant and property. The cash outflow in respect
of acquisitions and disposals in 2008 primarily reflected the costs of
acquiring Alfred McAlpine and the Vanbots Group, including debt
acquired, together with the cost of investments in Public Private
Partnerships (PPP) projects, net of proceeds from the sale of equity
investments in PPP projects. 
Balance sheet 
Carillion’s balance sheet remains strong and is supported by 
£590 million of committed bank facilities that mature on 
30 September 2012.
2008 2007
£m £m
Property, plant and equipment 167.2 131.5

Net assets 872.6 502.9
The increases in property, plant and equipment and in intangible
assets were predominantly due to the acquisition of Alfred
McAlpine. The increase in investments in Joint Ventures reflected
the Group’s equity investments in Public Private Partnership
projects, the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine and profit generated
during the year. The movement in inventories, receivables and
payables was also primarily due to the acquisition of Alfred
McAlpine. The movement in the Group’s net retirement benefits
liability was due to a number of factors, with increases resulting
from the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine and the deterioration 
in equity values during the year, being partially offset by the
curtailment gain and additional cash payments made to our
pensions schemes under our deficit recovery plan.

Our performance
Committed bank facilities
The Group’s main committed facility comprises a £590 million
syndicated five-year facility, repayable on 30 September 2012. 
The syndicate comprises 14 relationship banks, including four
mandated lead arrangers – The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Bank of
Scotland plc, Bayerische Landesbank, London branch, and Lloyds
TSB Bank plc. This syndicated facility was arranged in September
2007 on favourable terms, before the severe tightening of the
credit markets. This facility has proved to be more than adequate 
to finance the £171.7 million cash element of the £554.5 million
consideration for the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine, in February
2008, and to support the operations of the enlarged group. 
Treasury policy and risk management
The Group has a centralised Treasury function whose primary 
role is to manage funding, liquidity and financial risks. In addition,
Treasury sources and administers contract bond and guarantee
facilities for the Group. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not
enter into speculative transactions. The Board sets policies within
which Treasury operates that ensure the most effective financing
of the Group’s operations and limit exposure to financial risk.
Financial risk
The areas of significant financial risk facing the Group relate 
to funding, liquidity, counter party risk, foreign exchange and
interest rates.
Funding and liquidity 
In addition to Carillion plc’s principal borrowing facilities described
above, money market and short-term overdraft facilities are
available to Carillion plc and certain subsidiaries. Operating leases
are also employed to fund longer-term assets. The quantum of
committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is regularly
reviewed by the Carillion Board and is designed to satisfy the
requirements of the Group’s business plan.
Counter party risk
The Carillion Group undertakes significant financial transactions
only with counter parties that have strong credit ratings. The limits
and requirements in respect of such transactions are reviewed
regularly by the Board of Carillion plc.
Foreign exchange
The Group hedges all significant currency transaction exposures
using foreign exchange risk management techniques. In order to
protect the Group’s balance sheet from the impact of exchange
rate volatility, foreign currency net assets are hedged using
matching currency loans equivalent to at least 60 per cent of the
net asset value, where these assets exceed the equivalent of £10
million. Profits arising within overseas subsidiaries are not hedged
unless it is planned to make a distribution. Such distributions are
then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The average and year end exchange rates used to translate the
Group’s overseas operations were as follows.
Average Year end
£sterling 2008 2007 2008 2007
Middle East (US Dollar) 1.84 2.00 1.44 1.99
Oman (Rial) 0.71 0.77 0.55 0.77
UAE (Dirham) 6.75 7.63 5.28 7.31
Canada (Dollar) 1.95 2.14 1.77 1.96
Trinidad (Dollar) 11.52 12.64 9.04 12.52
Interest rates
The Group’s borrowing facilities are at floating rates of interest
linked to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, UK base rate or
prevailing local currency interest rates. The Group has not entered
into interest rate derivatives to fix or hedge interest rate risk and
currently none are outstanding. Certain longer-term assets have
been financed using fixed rate leases.
Carillion has invested equity in a number of Joint Venture Special
Purpose Companies (SPC) to deliver Public Private Partnership
projects. SPCs obtain funding for these projects in the form of
long-term bank loans or corporate bonds without recourse to 
the Joint Venture partners and secured on the assets of the SPC. 
A number of SPCs have entered into interest rate derivatives as a
means of hedging interest rate risk. These derivatives are interest
rate swaps that effectively fix the rate of interest payable.
Credit risk
An analysis of the Group’s credit risk is provided in note 29 on
page 98.
Operational risk management
The Group has rigorous policies in place to identify, mitigate 
and manage strategic risks and those specific to our individual
businesses and contracts. These are summarised on pages 16 
and 17 of the Group Chief Executive’s review. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, the
financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position
and borrowing facilities are described in Section 03 of the financial
statements on pages 14 to 34, entitled Our Performance. In
addition note 29 to the financial statements includes the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its
financial risk management objectives; details of its financial
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with 
long-term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers
across different geographic areas and industries. As a
consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed 
to manage its business risks successfully despite the current
uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors confirm that, after making enquiries, they have a
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our performance
Section 03 – Our performance
In this section of our annual report we provide 
a summary of what we are doing to make our
business more sustainable. A more detailed
account is provided in our 2008 Sustainability
Report, which will be published on our 
website in April 2009.
Strategy
We have a well established strategy model for sustainable
development, which is aligned with the four priority areas
defined by the UK Government in its sustainable development
strategy, ‘Securing the Future’, namely
• sustainable communities and workforce
• natural resource protection and environmental enhancement
• climate change and energy
• sustainable consumption and production.
We have identified 12 behaviours and activities across these
four priority areas, details of which can be found in our 2008
Sustainability Report, that affect the delivery of our business
objectives.
Managing sustainability 
Our commitment to sustainability is driven by our Board,
supported by a Sustainability Advisory Committee. This
Committee is chaired by our Chief Executive, John McDonough,
and includes a number of Executive and Senior Directors. The
Committee also benefits from expert advice from two external
members, Jonathon Porritt, Chair of the UK Government’s
Sustainable Development Commission and founder of Forum 
for the Future, and Julia Cleverdon, Vice President of Business 
in the Community (BITC).
The Sustainability Advisory Committee is supported by a
Sustainability Forum comprising our senior business leaders, 
to inform the development of our sustainability strategy, share
best practice and ensure the effective dissemination of our
sustainability strategy and policies. All Carillion business units
have a sustainability plan and objectives, which form an integral
part of their annual business plans. 
Enviros, one of the UK’s leading environmental consultancy
businesses, which we acquired as part of Alfred McAlpine, 
has also been used to support the development of our
sustainability strategy.
Each year we organise a ‘Sustainability Week’, a Group-wide
programme that coincides with World Environment Day and
focuses on how individuals and teams can adopt a more
sustainable lifestyle and contribute to making Carillion a more
sustainable business. In 2008, a graduate team organised 
the week’s activities and succeeded in engaging the support of
more of our employees than ever before. For the first time, we
also supported a charity during our 2008 Sustainability Week,
raising £10,000 for Barnardo’s.
Our performance
In 2008, Carillion won the Sunday Times Best Green Companies
Award for large and medium-sized companies with a high
environmental impact. The survey tested the credentials of
participating companies by examining their corporate policies
and by asking employees to comment on whether green policies
are truly embedded in the companies for which they work. 
A resounding 76 per cent of Carillion employees believed that
Carillion practised what it preached.
Presenting the award, the Managing Editor of The Sunday Times,
commented, ‘Carillion is no ‘Johnny-come-lately’ to the green
cause. It has had an environmental policy in place for 14 years,
dating from the time when environmental protests about road
building and other construction projects started to hit the public
consciousness’. 
We also achieved a ‘gold’ performance ranking in Business in 
the Community’s Corporate Responsibility Index, published in
2008, achieving a score of 92.5 per cent and topping the
Construction and Building Materials Sector. Alfred McAlpine also
achieved a’gold’ performance ranking with a score of 90.5 per
cent, which topped the Support Services Sector. The Corporate
Responsibility Index involves a detailed assessment of strategy,
management processes and performance, which enables us to
benchmark our performance externally. The average score of all
participating companies was 82.6 per cent, which demonstrates
that we not only continue to be the leader in our sector, but 
also that our performance compares favourably with that of all
participating companies. 
Carillion continues to be a member of the FTSE4Good Index 
and we were delighted to be ranked among the top 22 most
ethical companies in the FTSE350 in 2008 by the Observer
newspaper’s ‘Good Company Guide’. 
In 2008, as well as continuing to set specific sustainability targets
for each of our business units and for the Group as whole, we are
focusing in particular on a number of important areas, namely
• embedding our Sustainability Excellence Model into our
business units and reviewing their progress on a quarterly
basis
• a carbon reduction strategy with action plans to support
delivery of our challenging target of reducing our carbon
emissions by 50 per cent by 2010, measured against a 
2006 baseline
• improving the processes through which we capture data 
on our carbon emissions
• delivering our commitments on sustainable procurement
through applying the framework methodology developed 
by the UK Government’s Sustainable Procurement Task Force
• improving our performance in the Business in the
Community’s Corporate Responsibility Index.
The Group’s sustainability targets for 2008 were based on 
14 specific and measurable targets. In order to drive continuous
improvement, we set demanding targets and our performance
against them is independently audited by Bureau Veritas. A full
report on what we have achieved will be published in our 2008
Sustainability Report, in April 2009.  Sustainable Communities and Workforce
Creating a sustainable business requires the commitment of 
all our people – the ‘Carillion community’. We seek to achieve 
this through our Health and Safety, leadership, personal
development and employee engagement programmes, 
which are described in more detail 
on pages 18, 19, 42 and 43. 
How we do business is based on our belief that it’s not only what
we do that matters, but also how we do it, which drives our
commitment to ‘living’ our values in everything we do. Through
Values awards we recognise the outstanding contributions our
people make to our success in delivering an excellent service to
our customers and in 2008 1,322 Carillion people received a
Values award. 
We are proud that our people are also independently winning
prestigious awards. Helen Jones, one of our chartered Civil
Engineers, received the Future Star Award in the 2008 Property
and Building Services sector of the Atkins Inspire Awards. These
awards are made annually to encourage, recognise and reward
exceptional women, aged between 21 and 30 and working in
the built environment, who demonstrate significant personal
achievements and the ability to be role models in the future. 
Our commitment to sustainable communities also extends
beyond our own people. We have a community engagement
strategy for all our major worksites and projects and we
encourage our people to understand how we can have positive
impacts on the communities in which we operate and to
participate in community activities. 
Carillion gives over one per cent of its pre-tax profits in cash 
or in kind to community activities. For example we support the
Business Action on Homelessness (BAOH) campaign, designed 
to help homeless people break the cycle of ‘no home, no job’ ,
through the ‘Ready to Work’ programme.
As the UK’s leading private sector provider of construction skills
training, we contribute to the development of individuals and
communities. At the end of 2008, we had nearly 2,700 people 
in apprenticeship and other training programmes in our 19 UK
training centres. We also provided training on behalf of the
Prince’s Trust ‘get into construction’ programme to 315
candidates in 2008.
National resource protection and 
environmental enhancement
What we do and how we do it can have significant impacts 
on the use of natural resources and the environment and we 
use our knowledge and skills to develop sustainable service
solutions and to create positive 
impacts in these areas.
Carillion has developed and implemented environmental
management systems across the Group and over 99 per cent 
of our UK operations are accredited to ISO14001, by a registered
third party.
The preservation of natural habitats and the wildlife they support
is important both socially and environmentally. Eight years ago,
we entered into a partnership with the Wildlife Trusts and
established the Carillion Natural Habitats Fund. To date we have
contributed over £220,000 to the fund, to finance 38 projects
providing opportunities for our people to volunteer and support
the preservation of natural habitats. Our 2008 graduate
induction programme included a programme of environmental
improvement work at Rudyard Lake near Leek, Staffordshire. 
In recognition of our ongoing commitment to integrate
sustainability into everything we do, we have adopted the UK
Government’s Sustainable Procurement Taskforce (SPTF) ‘Flexible
Framework’. This framework provides a step-by-step approach 
to demonstrating leadership in sustainable procurement and we
plan to achieve Level 4 by 2010.
We understand that sustainable procurement is also important 
to our customers and this year Carillion signed the Ministry of
Defence’s Sustainable Procurement Charter, confirming our
commitment to sustainability and procurement best practice as a
major supplier to Defence Estates. 
Carillion continues to be a member of the WWF-UK Forest and
Trade Network and during 2008 re-affirmed our commitment to
eradicating illegal timber products from our supply chain. We are
committed to using timber from sources certified by the Forest
Stewardship Council on all our projects. We report the volumes
and sources of the timber we use to the WWF-UK FTN annually
and develop detailed action plans for improvement.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our performance Climate change and energy
Climate change is increasingly recognised as the most serious
long-term threat to human prosperity and lifestyle. Effective
management and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions has become increasingly important, as we realise 
that the way in which companies operate will need to change
significantly if we are to respond 
effectively to this threat. 
We aim to build on our leadership in sustainability by reducing
our direct CO
2
emissions by 50 per cent by 2010 from a 2006
baseline. We have developed a carbon reduction strategy and
policy, which involves measuring and reporting every quarter on
our carbon footprint in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol carbon accounting standard. Our carbon footprint
covers our direct Scope 1 and 2 emissions generated from
buildings, transport, travel, waste and from plant powered by
fossil fuel on project sites. 
We are focusing our activities on areas in which we can have the
greatest direct impact by reducing carbon emissions generated by 
• employee business travel
• commercial vehicles
• plant fuel
• our offices.
The acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in February 2008 has had 
a significant effect on Carillion’s carbon footprint, due to the 
size of the acquired business and carbon-intense nature of its
activities. Details of our performance in respect of measuring 
and reducing our Carbon Footprint will be published in our 
2008 Sustainability Report.
To manage our carbon emissions effectively, we also need to
consider our indirect impacts and in 2009 we plan to identify
and begin to manage our indirect Scope 3 emissions.
Our commitment to tackling climate change is also reflected 
in the way we work with our customers to provide sustainable
buildings, infrastructure and lifetime facilities management 
and services. 
Carillion will report in more detail on its carbon emissions in 
its 2008 Sustainability Report and through participation in the
Carbon Disclosure Project.
Sustainable consumption and production
Carillion’s leadership in developing and implementing its
sustainability strategy model, which relates our impact on 
the environment and on society to business performance, has
made a major contribution to the Group’s risk management
policies and processes. 
These policies and processes address strategic risks and those
specific to individual businesses and contracts, including
economic, social, environmental and ethical risks, and are
therefore fundamental to the management of the Group at 
every level of our activities.
In 2008, we undertook a customer perception survey, which
sought the views of our customers on a wide range of issues,
including the importance of sustainability. The survey showed
that 70 per cent of our customers believe that sustainability 
and Carillion’s ability to deliver sustainable solutions are very
important, a two per cent increase on the figure reported in 
our 2007 customer perception survey.
We believe that our leadership in sustainability differentiates us
from our competitors. We seek to understand the needs of our
customers and their objectives in respect of sustainability and to
use our knowledge and skills to meet their needs by developing
sustainable solutions. We also seek to promote sustainable
solutions by explaining to our customers how a sustainable
approach can not only create positive impacts on the
environment and on society, but also reduce costs, increase
efficiency and improve the quality of the services we offer.
In 2008, Carillion Planned Maintenance received Energy
Efficiency accreditation from the Carbon Trust for its Royal Courts
of Justice contract. This is the first award of its kind within Her
Majesty’s Court Services (HMCS) and recognises that the Royal
Courts are being managed and operated to optimise energy
performance. Since 2006, when Carillion Planned Maintenance
secured this contract for the Royal Courts of Justice, it has
implemented initiatives to deliver greater efficiency and a
reduced carbon footprint.

Employees
Information relating to employee numbers and remuneration is
given in Note 7 on page 79.
Employees are key to achieving Carillion’s business strategy and
the Group is committed to improving their skills through training
and development and nurturing a culture in which employees
feel valued for their contribution and are motivated to achieve
their full potential. 
Carillion’s core values of openness, collaboration, mutual
dependency, sustainable profitable growth, professional delivery
and innovation have been developed to emphasise the changing
working practices required to succeed in an environment where
partnership and integrated solutions are becoming the norm. 
It is Carillion’s aim to foster a working environment in which 
all employees are treated with courtesy, dignity and respect.
Carillion strives continually to eliminate all bias and unlawful
discrimination in relation to job applicants, employees, business
partners and members of the public. Employees who become
disabled are, wherever possible, retrained or provided with
equipment so that they can continue their employment.

The objectives of Carillion’s Equal Opportunities and Diversity 
Policy are
• to have a workforce that represents and responds to the
diversity of customers and today’s society
• improved safety and quality provided by a balanced and
productive workforce
• lower staff turnover, absenteeism and sickness levels leading
to cost savings
• to provide a fair working environment in which discrimination
will not be tolerated
• to create a working environment free from discrimination,
harassment, victimisation and bullying
• to work towards finding ways for under-represented groups
to fully realise their potential within the Carillion organisation
and to take reasonable steps to help such groups 
• to ensure that all employees are aware of the Group Equal
Opportunities and Diversity Policy and to provide any
necessary ongoing training to enable them to meet their
responsibilities under it
• Carillion also recognises the merit of developing a workforce
that incorporates the many diverse skills and backgrounds
available from within the total population and accordingly, 
will strive to become an organisation that will recognise, 
value and understand diversity and to provide its employees
with genuine opportunities to improve and reach their 
full potential
• to ensure that all applicants are treated fairly during
recruitment processes and in accordance with legislation and
The Codes of Practice covering all grounds for discrimination
• to regulate review procedures and selection criteria for
promotion to ensure that individuals are selected and treated
according to their relevant individual abilities and merits.
Carillion places great importance on open and regular
communication with employees through both formal and
informal processes. As part of this commitment, a Group
newspaper, ‘Spectrum’, is produced on a regular basis for 
all employees. 
The views of employees on matters affecting their interests are
also sought through ‘The Great Debate’. This is a major exercise
which was undertaken by the Group in each of the last five 
years to capture the feelings and views of as wide a range of
employees as possible. These views are then taken into account
in the development of work-related initiatives as part of
Carillion’s strategy to become an employer of choice. In 2008,
around 2,800 UK employees attended ‘The Great Debate’
sessions.
Carillion stages ‘The Great Debate’ as part of the ongoing 
quest for cultural change and to produce step changes which
• raise understanding of what drives motivation, morale,
engagement and performance
• allows employees to take ownership and be empowered 
to build and implement solutions
• demonstrates Carillion’s desire to change attitudes and
behaviours based on listening to the views of its employees.
Additionally, ‘Team Talk’ which is held monthly provides Carillion
employees with face-to-face communication with their line
managers and facilitates two-way communication, discussion
and feedback. It focuses on local issues and key corporate
messages and information. 
One-to-one meetings between individual employees and their
line managers are also held to discuss performance and progress.
Employees can also exchange best practice information via a
Knowledge Management Forum on the Group intranet.
Carillion seeks to involve all employees in its leading edge
programmes to integrate safety into everything it does and 
to improve its environmental performance, including the
understanding and application of the principles of sustainability.
Further information on Health and Safety is given in the Group
Chief Executive’s review on page 19 and on Sustainability in 
the Sustainability review on pages 35 to 37.
Carillion also involves, engages and consults with employees
through ‘People Forums’ across the Group which give employees
the opportunity to express their views on business issues.
Specifically, the objectives of the ‘People Forums’ are to
• improve employee information and consultation
• help employees feel more involved and valued
• support the continued education and development of
employees
• improve business performance by enabling employees to be
better aware of the business climate in which they operate
• help employees to be responsive to and better prepared 
for change.

Governance
Section 04 – Governance
General principles
The Board is firmly committed to high standards of corporate
governance. During the year to 31 December 2008 and as
detailed below and in the Remuneration report, the Company
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (June 2006) except 
in respect of Board balance (Combined Code principle A.3.2).
The reason for non-compliance in this matter is explained below.
Ethics and Business Integrity Policy
Carillion has a clear and unequivocal approach to business
integrity and ethics which underlies the Carillion values of
openness, collaboration, mutual dependency, sustainable,
profitable growth, professional delivery and innovation. 
The Ethics and Business Integrity Policy demonstrates how
Carillion will conduct its business to the highest ethical standards.
The policy applies to all employees of any Carillion group
company. The way Carillion delivers this policy is and will be
reflected in the way the Group competes for business, through
the quality and value of its work and through the reliability 
and reputation of its employees.
The policy is
• business integrity: we do not give or accept bribes. We do 
not sanction or accept any illegal payments, allowances, or
gifts-in-kind. We will investigate fully all alleged breaches. 
We will dismiss any employee who has breached this policy
• mutual respect: we do what we say we will do. We treat 
our people fairly and with respect at all times, avoiding
discrimination and bullying. We provide a safe and healthy
working environment, and respect sustainable principles in 
all our dealings
• trust: we engender trust within our work groups and
companies, respecting diverse traditions and cultures. We
respect the trust placed in us by others, not least when we 
are asked to take responsibility for aspects of their business 
or resources. We maintain and demand high professional
standards and demand honesty and openness. We avoid
conflicts of interest wherever possible, and we proactively
declare any unavoidable conflicts for open scrutiny and
resolution
• legality: we respect the rule of law in all our dealings. 
We clearly communicate procedures for disciplining those
who do not comply with the law or our standards and
policies. We maintain a system for confidential reporting 
of breaches of our standards and policies
• human rights: we support the belief that human rights are
universal and adhere to the principles of human rights in 
our operations. We support the United Nations Universal
Declaration on Human Rights.
This policy is carried into Carillion’s business through a series 
of detailed procedures. They allow Carillion to carry into practice
its reputation for conducting business to the highest ethical
standard which is essential to its relationships with customers,
business partners, employees, shareholders and the public. 
The detailed procedures reflect the way Carillion competes for
business, through the quality and value of its work and through
the reliability and reputation of its people.
The Ethics and Business Integrity Policy and its implementation 
is reviewed annually by the Board.
Directors
The Board
With effect from 1 January 2008, the Company is led by a 
Board comprising five Executive and five Non-Executive Directors.
The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors are
considered to be independent of management. They each 
have wide areas of experience and have no business or other
relationship that could materially interfere with their independent
judgement. David Garman is the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director.
Until 1 January 2008, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
comprised more than half of the Board. However, given the
increase in the size and complexity of the business due to
acquisition, the Board resolved that additional executive
representation on the Board was required. However, Roger
Robinson has decided to retire as a Director at the Annual
General Meeting on 6 May 2009. The Company will then once
more be fully compliant with the provisions set out in Section 1 
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the Executive Directors’
service contracts are terminable by one years notice. 
A detailed internal evaluation of the Board’s corporate
governance procedures and compliance was again conducted 
in 2008 by the Chairman in conjunction with the Company
Secretary. The internal evaluation took into account the views 
of each of the Directors on (i) the role of Directors, (ii) the
performance of the Board, the Chairman and the Non-Executive
Directors, (iii) Board committees, (iv) leadership and culture, 
(v) corporate governance (vi) Directors’ remuneration, 
(vii) relations with shareholders and (viii) Board accountability 
and audit. The Board at its meeting in November 2008 reviewed
the results of the internal evaluation and, where required, issues
were acted upon in order to further enhance the effectiveness 
of the Board’s procedures and working practices. 
This is the seventh year that this process has taken place and 
will be repeated annually as the Board considers it satisfactory. 
In addition, reviews of the performance of each of the Directors
has taken place.  Corporate Governance report

Governance
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the
Group Chief Executive as adopted by the Board, encompasses
the following parameters
• the primary job of the Chairman of a public company is to
provide continuity, experience and governance while the
Group Chief Executive provides leadership, energy,
imagination and the driving force
• the Chairman is viewed by investors as the ultimate steward
of the business and the guardian of the interests of all the
shareholders. Nonetheless, it is essential that the outline of
their respective roles encourages the Chairman and Group
Chief Executive to work well together to provide effective 
and complementary stewardship
• the Chairman must:
– take overall responsibility for the composition and capability
of the Board
– consult regularly with the Group Chief Executive and be
available on a flexible basis for providing advice, counsel 
and support to the Group Chief Executive.
• the Group Chief Executive must: 
– manage the Executive Directors and the Group’s day to 
day activities
– prepare and present to the Board strategic options for
growth in shareholder value
– set the operating plans and budgets required to deliver 
the agreed strategy
– ensure that the Group has in place appropriate risk
management and control mechanisms.
The Board had a programme of eight meetings in 2008 and 
also meets on an ad hoc basis as required.
A formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for
consideration and decision is maintained. These matters include
• statutory matters such as the approval of final and interim
financial statements and the recommendation of dividends
• appointments to, and removals from, the Board and the 
terms of reference and membership of Board committees
• approval of Group strategy and annual budgets
• approval of authority levels, financial and treasury policies
• authorisation for any acquisition or disposal
• review of the internal control arrangements and risk
management strategies
• review of corporate governance arrangements.
The Executive Directors and the Carillion subsidiary companies
operate within clearly defined limits of authority delegated by 
the Board and any matters outside of these limits must be
referred to the Board for consideration.
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is
responsible to the Board for ensuring that agreed procedures and
applicable rules and regulations are observed. The Board approves
the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary. 
Any Director may, in furtherance of his or her duties, take
independent professional advice when necessary, at the expense 
of the Company. 
The Board is provided with regular and timely information on 
the financial performance of businesses within the Group, and 
of the Group as a whole, together with reports on trading
matters, markets, sustainability and other relevant issues.
Board Committees
The principal Board Committees are the Remuneration 
Committee, the Audit Committee and the Nominations
Committee. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to each 
of these committees. The terms of reference of each of the 
Board Committees are available on the Carillion website at
www.carillionplc.com or on request from the Company Secretary.
The membership of each of the principal committees is as follows:
Remuneration Committee

Other Board matters
Policy on external appointments
Recognising that external appointments can broaden their
knowledge and so be of benefit to the Company, Executive
Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to accept a
limited number of such appointments and retain the fees received
for such appointments. John McDonough is a Non-Executive
Director of Tomkins plc and Richard Adam is a Non-Executive
Director of SSL International plc.
Nomination and remuneration of Directors
The appointment of a Director is a matter for resolution by 
the Board as a whole, taking advice from the Nominations
Committee.
For Board appointments, the Nominations Committee uses 
the services of the recruitment consultants JCA and Odgers.
Details of potential candidates are provided by the consultants
and initially reviewed by a sub-committee of the Nominations
Committee. Meetings with selected candidates are then held
with Directors. Subsequently, the Nominations Committee meets
to recommend an appointment, which is then proposed to the
Board for approval.
In the case of Non-Executive Directors, initial appointments are
normally for three years; re-appointment is subject to review and
is not automatic. 
The fees of Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board
as a whole, taking into account the commitment required and
participation in the work of committees and other advisory
services in relation to the business of the Group. In advising the
Board on such fees, it is the policy of the Executive Directors to
seek independent external advice concerning the appropriateness
of the amounts by comparison with general practice. The level of
fees currently payable to the Non-Executive Directors is based on
independent external advice.
The remuneration of the Directors is dealt with in the
Remuneration report on pages 51 to 58.
Retirement of Directors by rotation
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election 
at least every three years. The Directors retiring and seeking 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
6 May 2009 are David Maloney and Vanda Murray.
Additionally, new Directors are subject to election by shareholders
at the first opportunity following their appointment. 
The service contracts of the Executive Directors and the terms
and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors
are available for inspection at the registered office of the
Company during normal business hours on any weekday 
(bank holidays excepted) and at the Annual General Meeting.
Roger Robinson will be retiring at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 6 May 2009 and will therefore not be seeking
re-election. Corporate Governance report

Induction and development of Directors
Directors are provided with a comprehensive information pack 
on joining the Company and are advised of their legal and 
other duties and obligations as a director of a listed company. 
In addition, all new Directors receive induction on their
appointment covering such matters as the operation and
activities of the Group, the role of the Board and the Company’s
corporate governance procedures. Directors are also briefed 
by the Company’s external advisors, where appropriate, on
changes to legislation or regulation or market practice as well 
as receiving briefings from business groups throughout the year.
At least once a year, the Board visits an operational site and in
November 2008 the Directors visited the Group’s operations in
Dubai. Directors also visit other operations and staff. 
The regular updating of Directors’ skills and knowledge is
encouraged and a procedure has been established whereby the
Company Secretary is notified by Directors of their requirements
in this respect.
Relations with shareholders
In addition to communicating with shareholders generally from
time to time, the Executive Directors and the Director of Group
Corporate Affairs meet regularly with representatives of major
shareholders in order to foster the mutual understanding of
objectives. The details of these meetings are reported to the
Board. The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive
Director are available for meetings with representatives of major
shareholders as required.
Private and institutional shareholders are encouraged to attend
the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
The Company complies fully with the provisions of the
Combined Code in respect of the notice, content of agenda 
and conduct of its Annual General Meetings. The Chairmen 
of the Remuneration and Audit Committees will be present at
the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2009 to respond to
shareholders’ questions.

Carillion Group 
• compliance with statutory and other external requirements
• reviewing the systems of internal control including financial,
operational compliance and risk management

Main activities of the Audit Committee in the year 
to 31 December 2008
Financial statements
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management
and the external auditors the annual and interim statements. 
In this context, the Committee also reviews the written reports 
of KPMG on issues arising from the annual audit and the review
of the interim results.
Internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control. This responsibility includes clearly determining
the control environment and reviewing annually the effectiveness
of the internal control system. However, such a system can
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance for Directors ‘Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’, the
Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks (both financial 
and non-financial and including Corporate Social Responsibility
risks) faced by the Group (including joint ventures and overseas
businesses). The process has been in place for the year under
review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and
accounts and is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Assurance over the design and operation of internal controls
across the Group is provided through a combination of the
following techniques
• Internal Audit carries out audits to assess the adequacy and
effectiveness of internal controls over the key risks faced by the
business and reports its findings to management, the Executive
Directors and the Audit Committee. The Audit Plan is
presented to and approved by the Audit Committee annually
• recommendations to improve the system of control are made
by Internal Audit. The implementation of these
recommendations is followed up and reported on quarterly
• Internal Audit independently reviews the risk identification
procedures and control processes implemented by
management 
• a process of Control Risk Self-Assessment is used in the Group
where Directors and senior managers are required to detail and
certify controls in operation to ensure the control environment
in their business areas is appropriate. They also confirm
annually, in writing, that risk management processes and
appropriate controls are in place and are operating effectively
• Internal Audit advises on aspects of the design and
application of internal controls in key business projects and 
on policy and procedure changes.
Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Audit Committee reviews the assurance procedures and
ensures that the level of confidence required by the Board is
obtained. It also ensures the financial reporting process is 
credible and reliable. The Audit Committee presents its findings
to the Board regularly and the Head of Internal Audit has direct
access to the Audit Committee members. 
Any significant internal control issues would be disclosed in 
this report.
Risk management
The Group Head of Risk is responsible for advising on strategic
risk issues across the Group, and for oversight of risk training.
The Group Head of Risk is also responsible for carrying out an
independent appraisal of all projects before submission to the
Major Projects Committee (see page 50). This appraisal ensures
that the differentiating factors of the Group’s offer have been
properly identified so maximising the opportunities available; 
it also involves ensuring that all inherent and residual risks
associated with the project have been properly identified 
and considered.
In addition, the Risk Forum, a committee of risk professionals
from each of the business groups, meets on a quarterly 
basis to assess the strategic risks facing the Carillion Group. 
The conclusions of the Risk Forum are reported to the Board. Corporate Governance report
continued
50 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Governance
The Major Projects Committee, a committee of the Board, acts 
as the sanctioning body for major commitments and transactions
including capital expenditure, major contracts and company and
business acquisitions and disposals. This committee has delegated
authority up to specified levels of risk as determined by a risk
assessment matrix, beyond which Board approval is required.
Practical guidance for all staff is maintained in Group policy 
and procedure documents regarding the authorisation levels for
commitments, contract selectivity and bidding, the provision of
guarantees and management accounting as well as reporting
and resolution of suspected fraudulent activities. The Board has 
a policy to prosecute individuals found to have defrauded the
Company or its subsidiaries. Learning points for management 
are identified and action plans implemented to minimise the
recurrence of fraud. 
Employees are encouraged to raise genuine concerns about
malpractice at the earliest possible stage and a confidential
‘whistleblowing’ hotline provided by an independent third 
party is available.
Management is responsible for the identification and evaluation
of significant risks applicable to its areas of business together
with the design, operation and monitoring of suitable internal
controls. These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may
be associated with a variety of internal or external sources,
including control breakdowns, disruption in information systems,
competition, corporate social responsibility, natural catastrophe
and regulatory requirements. Management is also responsible 
for timely and accurate reporting of business performance and
for ensuring compliance with the policies set by the Board in 
its areas of business. Regular performance review meetings 
are held where management reports to the Executive Directors
on business performance, risk and internal control matters. 
The results of these meetings are presented to the Board.
The Executive Directors report to the Board on material 
changes in the business and the external environment that 
affect significant risks. The Group Finance Director provides 
the Board with regular financial information, which includes 
key performance indicators and a summary of risk. These 
key performance indicators and risks are listed in the Group
Chief Executive’s review on pages 16 to 21. Where areas 
for improvement are identified, the Board considers the
recommendations made both by the Executive Directors 
and by the Audit Committee.
This report is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.
Audit independence
The Audit Committee and Board place great emphasis on the
objectivity of the Group’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, in their
reporting to shareholders.
The KPMG audit director and manager are present at Audit
Committee meetings to ensure full communication of matters
relating to the audit.
The overall performance of the auditor is reviewed annually 
by the Audit Committee, taking into account the views of
management, and feedback is provided to senior members 
of KPMG unrelated to the audit. This activity also forms part of
KPMG’s own system of quality control. The Audit Committee 
also has discussions with the auditor, without management being
present, on the adequacy of controls and on any judgmental
areas. These discussions have proved satisfactory to date.
The scope of the forthcoming year’s audit is discussed in 
advance by the Audit Committee. Audit fees are reviewed by 
the Audit Committee after discussions between the businesses
and the local KPMG offices and are then referred to the Board
for approval. Rotation of audit director’s responsibilities within
KPMG is required by their profession’s ethical standards. The
current audit director responsible for the Carillion engagement 
is in his fourth year of signing the report. There is also rotation 
of key members within the audit team. 
Assignments awarded to KPMG and its associates have been 
and are subject to controls by management that have been
agreed by the Audit Committee so that audit independence 
is not compromised. In summary, the procedures are
• audit related services: as auditor this is the main area of work
of KPMG and its associates. If any additional accounting
support is required then this is considered competitively
• tax consulting: in cases where they are best suited, Carillion
uses KPMG and its associates but the Group also uses 
other tax consultancies. Significant pieces of tax work are
evaluated competitively
• general and systems consulting: all significant consulting
projects (when permissable) are subject to competitive tender.
Other than audit, the Group Finance Director is required to give
prior approval of work carried out by KPMG and its associates 
in excess of a predetermined threshold; part of this review is 
to determine that other potential providers of the services have
been adequately considered.
With regard to the provision of non-audit services, relevant
ethical guidance is taken into account. 
The proceedings of the Audit Committee are reported to the
Board, identifying any matters in respect of which action or
improvement is required.
These controls provide the Audit Committee with adequate
confidence in the independence of KPMG in their reporting 
on the audit of the Group.

Governance
Section 04 – Governance
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act (Schedule 7a) and Section 1 of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (June 2006) and has been approved by 
the Board and the Remuneration Committee. 
The Board is responsible for determining policy for remuneration 
of the Directors of Carillion plc and key members of the senior
management team. The Board determines the fees of the Non-
Executive Directors based on independent external advice. The
Remuneration Committee consists exclusively of independent 
Non-Executive Directors, namely David Garman (Chairman), David
Maloney, Steve Mogford and Vanda Murray. The Remuneration
Committee is responsible for formulating policy for remuneration 
of the Executive Directors, setting their remuneration framework
and recommending to the Board the remuneration of the Executive
Directors. The full terms of reference of the Remuneration
Committee are available on the Company’s website and are
reviewed annually by the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee is assisted in remuneration decisions
by Susan Morton, Group HR Director and by John McDonough,
Group Chief Executive. The Group Chief Executive is consulted on
the remuneration of his direct reports and other senior executives.
No Executive Director or employee is present or takes part in
discussions in respect of matters relating directly to their own
remuneration. Additionally, the Remuneration Committee uses
Deloitte & Touche LLP to provide salary survey and benchmarking
information. Deloitte & Touche LLP , which was appointed in 2005,
also advises the Company on pensions investment and has carried
out due diligence in Canada for the Company, but otherwise has
no other connections with the Company. 
Executive Director remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee ensures that the total remuneration
package for Executive Directors is aligned with the Company
reward philosophy to support its strategic objective of attracting,
developing and retaining excellent people and encouraging them
to work in line with Carillion’s values. This specifically includes
achieving high standards in respect of sustainability (which
encompass Carillion’s health and safety, environmental and 
social performance targets). Remuneration and other benefits 
are reviewed annually with regard to competitive market practice
and, where considered appropriate, are supported by external
independent surveys.
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the year and all
members attended both meetings.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed a balanced, fair and
competitive reward package. The Group incentivises and rewards
Executive Directors in a manner which is consistent with the Group’ s
objectives and aligns the interests of the Directors with those of
shareholders. As a result, a substantial proportion of Executive
Directors’ remuneration is variable.
Elements of Remuneration
The elements of Executive Director Remuneration are summarised
below and explained in more detail on pages 52 to 57.
Basic salary
This is reviewed annually, taking account of individual experience
and performance by reference to information provided by
independent sources. The Remuneration Committee has adopted
a policy of setting basic salary in line with the median of the
market range of salaries for equivalent roles.
Annual performance bonus
This is also reviewed annually and the participants are employees
who are able to influence and encourage collaboration across
Carillion to meet demanding financial targets and the delivery 
of clear and stretching key performance indicators with regard to
the personal element. The plan is designed to drive and reward
excellent operational performance and encourage longer term
sustainable growth.
Long-term (share-based) incentives
These are intended to require and reward exceptional performance
and are linked to performance targets that are aligned to the
interests of shareholders. Awards are currently made only under
the Carillion plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2006, known internally
as the Leadership Equity Award Plan (‘LEAP’). Each Executive
Director is required to hold shares acquired through LEAP until the
value of their total shareholding is equal to their annual salary. 
Carillion share-based incentives comply with the share 
dilution guidelines.
Pension benefits
The Committee takes account of pension benefits and associated
costs in reviewing remuneration policy. The aim is to offer
competitive pension benefits whether delivered through defined
benefit or defined contribution schemes.
Other benefits
These may include cars or car allowances, private healthcare and
salary supplements in place of approved pension provision. Remuneration report

Governance
Service contracts
Each Executive Director’s service contract is terminable on one year’s
notice from the Company. On termination of their employment,
Executive Directors have no additional entitlement to compensation
for loss of office. Service contracts also contain provision for early
termination but the Remuneration Committee does not consider 
it to be in the best interests of shareholders to specify in these
contracts the compensation payable in the event of early termination.
In such cases, the Remuneration Committee will consider the specific
circumstances together with the Company’s commitments under the
individual’s contract. The principle of mitigation would be applied to
reduce any compensation payable to departing directors, with each
case being taken on its own merits. There were no termination
benefits in the year to 31 December 2008.

Name Commencement Period Term
Richard Adam 2 April 2007 12 months rolling
David Hurcomb 1 January 2008 12 months rolling
Don Kenny 1 July 2006 12 months rolling
John McDonough 1 January 2001 12 months rolling
Roger Robinson 29 July 1999 12 months rolling
Non-Executive Directors are not employed under contracts of
service, but are generally appointed for fixed terms of three 
years renewable for further terms of one to three years, if both
parties agree. 
Basic salary and other benefits
Current salaries and benefits are set out in the table opposite. Salary
increases for Executive Directors in 2008 averaged six per cent, in
line with independent advice obtained from Deloitte & Touche LLP ,
with the exception of Don Kenny and David Hurcomb who, as
recent and new appointments to the Board, received salary
increases to reflect their increase in responsibilities. Increases in 
2009 will be two per cent to reflect the current economic climate 
and in line with pay awards for other employees.
Annual performance bonus and deferred bonus plan
Annual bonuses are reviewed each year by the Remuneration
Committee, which sets performance targets geared to key financial
indicators and individual performance objectives. In 2008, the
Executive Directors had the potential to earn annual bonuses up 
to a maximum of 100 per cent of their basic salary for outstanding
performance in respect of specific financial targets (based on
earnings per share) and confidential personal performance
objectives. The 2008 maximum bonus opportunity limits the 
annual cash payment to 30 per cent of salary, with the balance
deferred into shares of the Company that are held in a trust in 
the participant’s name and vest after two years, subject to the
participant still being employed by the Company. The number of
shares allocated is determined by the price prevailing at the date
the annual report and accounts for the prior year is published. 
By using this mechanism, the value individuals receive at the 
point of vesting is aligned to the value delivered to shareholders
over the same period and may go up or down. The bonuses
awarded to the Executive Directors are set out on page 53. In
relation to potential future bonus opportunities, the weighting
between the personal and financial elements changes to 25 per
cent personal and 75 per cent financial and the maximum amount
that may be taken in cash is limited to 50 per cent of the actual
award made with a similar deferral mechanism for the balance. 
The assessment of the element in respect of personal performance
is based on the delivery of clear and stretching key performance
indicators. Tax and national insurance is calculated on the deferred
element based on the value of the shares at the vesting date and
paid at that point. 53 Carillion plc

Pension benefits 
Executive pensions
Until April 2003, it was the Company’s policy to offer membership
of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme to Executive Directors and
other senior employees. This scheme was operational from 
1 October 1999. The scheme is a funded, HMRC Registered,
defined benefit scheme to which members contribute seven per
cent of pensionable earnings. The main features are
• pension payable at the normal retirement age of 60 
(except in cases of ill health or early retirement)
• pension accrual rate for Executive Directors of 1/30th of 
final pensionable salary for each year of service subject to 
a limit on pension of two-thirds of final pensionable salary 
• increases to pensions in payment (in excess of the State
Guaranteed Minimum Pension) in line with price indexation
up to five per cent per annum for service to 5 April 2006 
and 2.5 per cent per annum for service after that date
• life assurance of four times salary 
• pensions payable in the event of ill health, and
• on death (in service or after retirement), spouse’s and/or
dependent’s pension at two-thirds of member’s prospective
pension.
The Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants
with effect from 1 April 2003. Since that date, pension provisions
for senior managers and Executives have been through their
existing Carillion scheme (for current employees) or the Carillion
Pension Plan (for new employees). The Carillion Pension Plan 
is a defined contribution pension arrangement that provides
members with pensions at retirement based on the accumulated
value of their notional pension account within the plan.
With the exception of Richard Adam and David Hurcomb, the
Group makes contributions to a registered defined benefit
scheme on behalf of the Executive Directors in respect of
earnings up to the internal earnings cap. In addition, a salary
supplement is paid in respect of earnings over the internal cap
equal to the payments the Group would have paid to the
registered defined benefit scheme had the cap not been in
operation. Salary supplements are taxed at source. For Richard
Adam and David Hurcomb, the Company makes contributions 
to a registered defined contribution pension plan (up to the
internal earnings cap) and a salary supplement in respect of
earnings in excess of the internal cap. During the year, the
Company contributed £48,130 to the Carillion Pension Plan for
Richard Adam and £48,130 for David Hurcomb. The Company
does not contribute to any pension arrangements for Non-
Executive Directors.
The Company agreed with the Trustees of the Carillion pension
schemes to continue to operate an earnings cap after April 
2006 when the external cap was removed. The Carillion cap
commenced at the level of £110,000 for the tax year 2006-07 
and rises in line with the published increases in HMRC’s Life Time
Allowance up until 2010 in line with the table below.
Cap
Year £
2008-09 121,300
2009-10 129,000
2010-11 132,700
All the Executive Directors will be subject to this cap on salary 
in respect of their pensionable pay. Bonus and other benefits
received by Executive Directors do not count towards pensionable
pay. Following the completion of consultation with the active
members of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme, this Scheme will 
close to future accrual with effect from 5 April 2009 and past
service benefits will be linked to pensionable salaries at that date.
For service from 6 April 2009, the Executive Directors who are
members of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme will receive benefits
through the Carillion 2009 Pension Plan on a defined contribution
basis consistent with that provided to Executive Directors in the
Carillion Pension Plan. 55 Carillion plc

performance against a broad equity market index of the UK’s

Long term (share) incentives
In 2006, the Carillion plc 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan (known
internally as the Leadership Equity Award Plan (‘LEAP’)) was
approved and the existing Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) and
Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) ceased to operate save
in relation to awards outstanding at that time.
Executive Directors may also participate in the Company’s
Sharesave Scheme.
LEAP terms
The LEAP is offered to key people in the Company to provide an
opportunity to earn a potentially higher level of reward but only
where there is commitment from those individuals and stretching
performance targets are met. 
In any financial year, Executive Directors may receive an award
under the LEAP over shares worth 150 per cent of their basic
annual salary (excluding bonuses and benefits in kind), other
senior executives may receive an award under the Plan over
shares worth up to 100 per cent of their basic annual salary. 
The extra 50 per cent awarded to Executive Directors will only
vest if exceptional performance is achieved. In exceptional
circumstances a first award of up to 200 per cent of salary can
be made under the rules. Thereafter the maximum opportunity
will be 150 per cent of basic salary.
Under the terms of the Plan, awards of ordinary shares in the
Company (for nil consideration or their nominal value) or grants
of options over ordinary shares (with a zero or 0.01 pence per
share exercise price) can be made. The Remuneration Committee
determines the exercise price of an option. 
All awards/options are subject to a minimum three year
performance period from the date of the award. The vesting 
of the shares is subject to the relevant participant remaining 
in employment and the achievement of specified stretching
performance conditions based on annual average growth in
earnings per share above the Retail Price Index. The progression
is linear between each of the target levels specified. 
Growth in earnings per share:
Level 1 RPI + 3% pa 30% vests
Level 2 RPI + 7% pa 50% vests 
Level 3 RPI + 12% pa 100% vests 
Level 4 RPI + 25% pa Extra 50% vests
Levels 1 to 3 apply to all participants, level 4 applies to the
Executive Directors.
Awards were made in July 2006, April 2007 and April 2008. At
31 December 2008 a total of 2,909,871 shares were outstanding
under the LEAP .

(i) The ESOS options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the Company’s shares on the three business days
immediately preceding the date of grant. Options under the Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 (which
carries certain tax advantages for UK employees) and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 are exercisable normally between 
three and 10 years after the date of grant, subject to the achievement of the performance condition. For options granted from 2003
onwards, the following performance condition prevailed:
Average compound annual earnings 
per share growth (before exceptional items) Percentage of option
in excess of RPI over the three-year period following grant that becomes exercisable
Less than 4% 0%
4% 30%
Above 4% and below 10% 30% to 100% (straight-line basis)
10% or more 100%
Grants of options using this performance condition were made in 2003, 2004 and 2005. With regard to the options granted on 1 July 2003,
31 March 2004 and 15 March 2005, Carillion met the performance target such that 80 per cent, 71 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively
of the shares under option are now exercisable.
(ii) At 31 December 2008, Executive Share Options were outstanding over 1,754,361 shares (2007: 2,073,978 shares) under both
schemes at exercise prices ranging from 125.2 pence to 242.75 pence. 
(iii) The option over 254,532 shares at an option price of 210.7 pence granted to John McDonough in March 2002 under the ESOS1999
was made later in the year than had been specified at the time of his appointment which resulted in an increased option price of
67.3 pence. Therefore, in order to ensure that he will be in no worse nor better a position as a result of the delay in the grant, a
maximum cash adjustment of 67.3 pence per share (less tax) will be made when and if the option is exercised.
(iv) David Hurcomb has an option under the Sharesave Scheme which was applied for prior to him being appointed an Executive
Director. The option may normally be exercised on completion of a three year savings contract, at the exercise price of 337.5 pence. 
(v) Sharesave options were granted in November 1999 over 6,140,194 shares, in October 2002 over 3,995,803 shares and in November
2006 over 2,580,461 shares. At 31 December 2008, options over 1,684,664 ordinary shares of 50 pence each were outstanding

Section 04 – Governance
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the annual report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Group
financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides 
in relation to such financial statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true 
and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Parent Company financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Parent
Company. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company
financial statements, the Directors are required to
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company financial statements
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’
Remuneration report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Independent auditors’ report to the 
members of Carillion plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Governance
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Carillion plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Consolidated
Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company
Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the
Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and
the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also
audited the information in the Remuneration report that is
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we may state to
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report 
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the EU, and for preparing the Parent Company
financial statements and the Remuneration report in accordance
with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ responsibilities on page 59.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part
of the Remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report 
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.
The information given in the Directors’ report includes that
specific information presented in the Operating and Financial
Review that is cross-referred from the Principal Activities and
Business Review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or
information specified by law regarding Director’s remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report 
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the
Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls,
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the International
Standards for Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration report 
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in preparation
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration report 
to be audited. 61 Carillion plc

Section 05 – Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements
68 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Significant accounting policies
Carillion plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled and
incorporated in the United Kingdom (UK). The consolidated
financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31
December 2008 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in
jointly controlled entities.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for
issuance on 4 March 2009.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared and
approved by the Directors in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
(EU) (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its
parent company financial statements in accordance with UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP). These are
presented on pages 113 to 120.
Basis of preparation
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to
the Group’s financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. 
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the
following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value:
derivative financial instruments, pension scheme assets, cash 
and cash equivalents and financial instruments classified as
available-for-sale.
The following interpretation has been endorsed by the EU by the
year end and is effective for the year ending 31 December 2008
• International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 11
‘Group and treasury share transactions’.
This interpretation has no impact on the Group’s financial
statements.
The following standards and interpretations have been endorsed
by the EU by the year end but are not yet effective for the year
ending 31 December 2008
• Amendments to International Accounting Standard 1
‘Presentation of financial statements – A revised presentation’
• Revised International Accounting Standard 23 ‘Borrowing
costs’
• International Financial Reporting Standard 8 – 
‘Operating segments’
• International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 14
‘The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding
requirements and their interaction’.
The following interpretation is effective for the year ended 
31 December 2008 but has not yet been endorsed by the EU
• International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 12
‘Service concession arrangements’.
The following standards and interpretations are effective for the
year ended 31 December 2009 but have not yet been endorsed
by the EU
• Revised International Financial Reporting Standard 3 ‘Business
combinations’ 
• International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 16
‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’.
The Group has considered the impact of these new standards 
and interpretations in future periods on reported profit and 
net assets. The only impact of the above presently identified is 
in relation to International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee 14, which is expected to reduce net assets at 
1 January 2009 by £14.4 million. The Group has chosen not 
to early adopt any of the above standards and interpretations.
Basis of consolidation 
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial
statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the
Company drawn up to 31 December 2008. Control exists when
the Group has direct or indirect power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic
benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date that control
transfers to the Group until the date that control ceases. The
financial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same
reporting year as the Company.
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries.
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the 
Group undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint
control with third parties. The Group’s interests in jointly
controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method.
Under this method the Group’s share of the profits less losses 
of jointly controlled entities is included in the consolidated 
income statement and its interest in their net assets is included 
in investments in jointly controlled entities in the consolidated
balance sheet. Where the share of losses exceeds the interest in
the entity the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition 
of further losses is discontinued. Interest in the entity is the
carrying amount of the investment together with any long-term
interests that, in substance, form part of the net investment 
in the entity.
Financial statements of jointly controlled entities are prepared for
the same reporting period as the Group except for
• Modern Housing Solutions (Prime) Ltd
This entity has a 31 March year end, and the results are included 
in the Group accounts based on management accounts, prepared
for the 12 months to 31 December 2008.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled
operation, that company accounts for the assets it controls,
the liabilities and expenses it incurs and its share of the income.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial
statements on the same basis.
Financial statements 69 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Other non-current asset investments
Other non-current asset investments are classified as available 
for sale financial assets and are recognised at fair value. Changes
in fair value in the year are recognised directly in the statement 
of recognised income and expense. Dividend income from
investments is recognised when the right to receive payment 
is established.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions that have occurred since 
1 January 2004 represents the difference between the fair value 
of the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an acquired entity.
Consideration includes the attributable costs of the acquisition. 
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 goodwill is
included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the
amount recorded under previous GAAP .
Positive goodwill is recognised as an asset in the consolidated
balance sheet and is subject to an annual impairment review.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised
separately as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of jointly controlled entities is
included within the carrying value of the investment. Negative
goodwill is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is based on 
the useful economic lives of the assets concerned, which are
principally as follows
Computer software and licences
• straight-line over three-five years.
Customer contracts and lists
• Planned Maintenance Group
consumption of economic benefits over six years
• Mowlem 
consumption of economic benefits over 35 years
• Alfred McAlpine 
consumption of economic benefits over 12 years
• Vanbots Group
consumption of economic benefits over five years.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to
each of the Group's cash generating units expected to benefit
from the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that 
the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of
any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets 
of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is
not reversed in a subsequent period.
Impairment
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to
amortisation and are tested for impairment at each balance 
sheet date. Assets subject to depreciation and amortisation are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement 
based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds 
the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset.
Construction contracts
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated
reliably, contract revenue and costs are recognised by reference 
to the degree of completion of each contract, as measured by 
the proportion of total costs at the balance sheet date to the
estimated total cost of the contract.
Insurance claims, incentive payments, and variations arising from
construction contracts are included where they have been agreed
with the client.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent 
of contract costs incurred where it is probable those costs will 
be recoverable.
The principal estimation technique used by the Group in
attributing profit on contracts to a particular period is the
preparation of forecasts on a contract by contract basis. 
These focus on revenues and costs to complete and enable an
assessment to be made of the final out turn of each contract.
Consistent contract review procedures are in place in respect 
of contract forecasting.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in 
which they are incurred.
Where costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised 
losses exceed progress billings, the balance is shown as due 
from customers on construction contracts within trade and 
other receivables. Where progress billings exceed costs incurred
plus recognised profits less recognised losses, the balance is
shown as due to customers on construction contracts within
trade and other payables.
Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is
appointed preferred bidder. Provided the contract is expected 
to generate sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery and 
the award of the contract is probable, pre-contract costs 
incurred post the appointment as preferred bidder are included 
in amounts owed by customers on construction contracts.
Where pre-contract bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, 
the proceeds are initially applied against the asset included 
in amounts owed by customers on construction contracts. 
Any excess recoveries are carried forward as deferred income 
and released to profit over the period of the contract.

Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable,
excluding value added tax, for services supplied to external
customers. It also includes the Group’s proportion of work carried
out under jointly controlled operations during the year. Revenue
from service contracts is recognised by reference to services
performed to date as a percentage of total services to be
performed. Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction
contracts.
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is based on historical cost, less the estimated residual
values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets concerned.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment 
is depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of 
their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows:
Freehold buildings 40-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements Period of lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles three-ten years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter
of the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.
Leasing
Operating lease rental charges are charged to the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, 
plant and equipment at the lower of fair value at the date of
acquisition or present value of the minimum lease payments. 
The capital element of outstanding finance leases is included
in financial liabilities. The finance charge element of rentals is
charged to the income statement at a constant periodic rate 
of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials and land for development 
and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it 
is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for 
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect
of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,
providing for temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax
benefit will be realised.
Foreign currencies
In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the
exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the
balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are
included in the income statement.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities 
are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date. Income statements and cash 
flows of overseas entities are translated into sterling at rates
approximating to the foreign exchange rates at the date of 
the transaction. Gains or losses arising from the consolidation 
of overseas entities are recognised in the translation reserve.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved
through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign
currencies. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of
the hedges are recognised in equity and ineffective portions are
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Employee benefits
(a) Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group,
amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they
fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the International
Accounting Standard 19 ‘Retirement benefits’ cost of providing
benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method. The charge to the income
statement reflects the current service cost of such obligations,
and where applicable, past service cost. 
The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost of
scheme liabilities are included within financial income and
expenses in the income statement.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet
represents the excess of the present value of the scheme liabilities
over the fair value of scheme assets. When the calculation results
in an asset to the Group, the amount recognised is limited to the
net total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present
value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future
contributions to the plan. Differences between the actual and
expected returns on assets and experience gains and losses arising
on scheme liabilities during the year, together with differences
arising from changes in assumptions, are recognised in the
statement of recognised income and expense in the year.
The Group’s contributions to the scheme are paid in accordance
with the scheme rules and the recommendations of the actuary. 
Financial statements 71 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) Other post-retirement benefit obligations
Certain Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare
benefits to their employees. The expected costs of providing 
these benefits are accrued over the period of employment and
are calculated by independent actuaries based on the present
value of the expected liability.
(c ) Share-based payments
Members of the Group’s senior management team are entitled 
to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
and the Leadership Equity Award Plan (LEAP). In addition, UK
employees are able to participate in the Sharesave scheme.
The fair value of the ESOS, LEAP and Sharesave schemes at 
the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. For all schemes the fair value determined at grant date is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based
on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs
qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to 
the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled
entities relating to the construction of assets in Public Private
Partnership (PPP) projects are capitalised until the relevant assets
are brought into operational use.
Borrowing costs are charged to the income statement using 
the effective interest method.
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at the
proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental issue
costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust is deducted 
from the retained earnings reserve. Where such shares
subsequently vest in the employees under the terms of the
Group’s share option schemes or are sold, any consideration
received is included in the retained earnings reserve.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past
event, and where it is probable that an outflow will be required 
to settle the obligation.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has an
approved restructuring plan that has either commenced or been
announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The
principal financial assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(a) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then 
are stated at amortised cost.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair
value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash
equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank
deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Bank
overdrafts are also included as they are an integral part of the
Group’s cash management.
(c) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then are
stated at amortised cost.
(d) Bank and other borrowing
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
All borrowing is subsequently stated at amortised cost with 
the difference between initial net proceeds and redemption 
value recognised in the income statement over the period 
to redemption.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
the contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured in
future periods at their fair value. The method of recognising 
the resulting change in fair value is dependent on whether the
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
A number of the Group’s PPP jointly controlled entities have
entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging
interest rate risk. The effective part of the change in fair 
value of these derivatives is recognised directly in equity. Any
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income
statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the
income statement in the periods when the hedged items will
affect profit or loss. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the
estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to
terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge
against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency
exposures. In cases where these derivative instruments are
significant, hedge accounting is applied as described above.
Where hedge accounting is not applied movements in fair 
value are recognised in the income statement. Fair values are
based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Net borrowing
Net borrowing comprises cash and cash equivalents together 
with bank overdrafts and loans, finance leases and other loans.

Each year, whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of
goodwill balances allocated to its cash generating units. In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on
internal valuations of each cash generating unit.
Management consider Support services, Construction services, Public Private Partnership Projects and Head Office as distinct reporting
segments. Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash generating units (CGUs), detailed above, within the Construction services
and Support services reporting segments. Our CGUs have been identified within our reporting segments as those businesses that
generate cash inflows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
13. Intangible assets (continued)
Following the re-organisation of Carillion in December 2007 and the Alfred McAlpine acquisition in February 2008 a number of our
businesses were consolidated and, as a result, the CGUs previously reported in our 2007 financial statements have been reclassified to
align to our new structure. The restructuring allowed a clear mapping of the previously reported CGUs to the new CGUs based upon
managerial responsibility. The main effects of these changes were to consolidate Regional and National Building, now fully integrated 
as our Building CGU, Regional Civils was mapped to our infrastructure CGU, with rail and rail projects being consolidated into our new
infrastructure services CGU and all facilities businesses including Citex and Planned Maintenance into our Business services CGU.
The Carillion and Alfred McAlpine businesses are an excellent strategic fit and combining them has created the UK’s largest support
services business, with enhanced positions in our chosen market sectors. The acquisition of Alfred McAlpine was a strategic decision
which enabled the Group to significantly enhance our support services capabilities and to generate substantial cost savings in business
services and therefore the entire goodwill arising on this acquisition has been allocated to the Business services CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions have been reviewed in the light of the current economic environment which has resulted in more conservative
estimates about the future. The impact of the current global economic downturn on the financial stability of our customers, partners and
suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their financial stability, the security of project
funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the CGUs. Whilst the Group has five CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services are
consistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU. Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support
services CGUs are consistent so one discount rate has been applied to each CGU. In determining the discount rate, management have
sought to arrive at a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost 
of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt. In calculating the cost of equity a range 
of market risk premiums were used with a Beta value of 0.9. A market premium of 9.0 per cent was used to calculate a pre-tax 
discount rate of 13.0 per cent for the CGUs in the Construction services segment. A market premium of 5.1 per cent was used to
calculate a pre-tax discount rate of 9.0 per cent for the CGUs in the Support services segment. The annual growth rates are based on
internal assessments with no growth anticipated for the Construction services segment and the Infrastructure services CGU and growth
expected in the Business services CGU segment at 5.0 per cent for the next five years, 2.5 per cent growth for years six to ten which
reflects expected changes in Retail Price Index and no growth thereafter.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent annual financial budgets approved by management and
extrapolates cash flows based upon the growth rates indicated above. The impairment tests at 31 December 2008 show that for the
Business services CGU the number of years required to recover the carrying value was 15 years and in all other CGUs this is less than
seven years. Management consider that these pay back periods are not excessive given the long-term strategic benefit of all the
acquisitions and in particular the acquisitions of Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine.
As at 31 December 2008, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash
generating units tested exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge
The amortisation charge of £44.2 million (2007: £20.6 million) is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of £119.0 million arising on the acquisition of Mowlem will be 79 per cent complete by 2016. 
The remaining amortisation charge will be incurred over the following 25 years. Amortisation of the intangible assets of £125.4 million 
arising on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine will be 84 per cent complete by 2013 with the remaining amortisation charge continuing 
until 2019.

2008 2007
£m £m
Tax losses 71.0 65.0
The tax losses do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses due 
to the lack of certainty concerning the quantum and timing of future years taxable profits of the companies concerned.
Deferred tax includes a liability associated with temporary differences arising from unremitted earnings from investments in overseas
subsidiaries, branches and jointly controlled entities of £12.7 million (2007: £7.0 million).
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in jointly controlled entities 
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £4.1 million (2007: £Nil).

Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign
operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. The translation
reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments 
related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is
derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999. The reserve increased on acquisition of Mowlem on 
23 February 2006 and Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares. 
The Group has opted to credit the merger reserve rather than the share premium account as permitted by the Companies Act 1985. 
The £42.1 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised 
on the Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine acquisitions.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings include the reserve for the Company’s own shares which comprises of the cost of the Company’s shares held by the
Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the
Group’s share incentive schemes. The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows:

At 31 December 2008, the ESOP held 419,827 (2007: 61,909) of the Company’s shares. During the year the Company acquired
1,257,104 of its own shares for £4.7 million to meet the plan’s future commitments. The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except
for a total payment of one pence at the time each dividend is paid.
In addition to the ESOP , the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘Quest’). During the year,
210,859 (2007: 2,643) ordinary shares in the Company held by the QUEST were transferred to employees of the Group following the
exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme.
At 31 December 2008 the total number of shares held under the QUEST amounted to 8,904 (2007: 219,763) and had a market value of
£22,100 (2007: £0.8 million).
The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.

In addition to the above, the Group has four ESOS option schemes which have a grant date before 7 November 2002. The total 
number of options outstanding at 31 December 2008 for these schemes amounted to 1,010,733 (2007: 1,010,733) with a remaining
contractual life of either two or three years.

28. Guarantees and contingent liabilities (continued)
Carillion JM Limited (CJM) (formerly Mowlem) has been the subject of the Office of Fair Trading’s (OFT) on-going investigation of cover
pricing in the construction industry (under The Competition Act 1988). The investigation relates to CJM’s construction business and
relates entirely to periods prior to CJM’s acquisition. No other member of the Group has been subject to the investigation. CJM has 
co-operated fully with the OFT. Any fine ultimately arising would be subject to the statutory maximum financial penalty of 10 per cent 
of world-wide revenue of the undertaking concerned in the business year prior to the infringement. Group management believes that 
it is extremely unlikely that any fine imposed will approach this amount. Group management also does not believe that customers have
suffered any loss or damage as a result of any actions taken by CJM.
Guarantees and counter indemnities have been given to financial institutions in respect of the provision of performance and other
contract related bonds that are issued in the normal course of business.
Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its construction activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings. The resolution of these
proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Group’s financial position.
29. Financial instruments
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed
primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management
policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board 
of Directors. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East, Canada and the Caribbean. In order to protect the
Group’s balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 
£10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value. Net investment hedging of overseas
operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies or where this is not practicable in a currency
which the relevant currency closely follows. Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in
equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution. Such distributions are then treated
as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Primarily the Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. Any individual exposures that are
significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Each movement of five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profit before tax and equity as follows:

Of the total foreign currency borrowing of £109.8 million (2007: £70.6 million), the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas
currency net assets amounts to £62.6 million (2007: £32.6 million). The foreign exchange loss of £8.9 million (2007: loss of £2.7 million)
on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve.

Euro 38.7 (56.8) 142.0 (188.7)
South Pacific Franc – (4.4) – (4.3)
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest bearing debt is predominantly sterling borrowing that arose from the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 and Alfred
McAlpine in 2008, ongoing working capital requirements and foreign currency denominated borrowing for hedging net assets of
overseas operations. Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate. No interest rate
hedging is currently undertaken by the Group’s subsidiaries. However, a number of the Group’s Public Private Partnership jointly
controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar borrowing would increase the annual net interest charge by
approximately £0.3 million, in respect of Canadian dollar borrowing an increase of £0.4 million, in respect of United Arab Emirates
Dirham denominated borrowing an increase of £0.1 million, and in respect of sterling borrowing an increase of £3.3 million.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the
need to carry significant net debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core
relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan and short term overdraft facilities. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities
available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels. The average net borrowing during
2008 in the period since the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine was £329.8 million (2007: £130.3 million).

Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging. Policies and
procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history. Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging
transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board
level or within predetermined limits.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management
following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. The
movement in the provision is as follows:

There are £72.9 million (2007: £26.2 million) of trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been 
provided against, which are all more than six months overdue.
In the current global economic climate, whilst uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased, on balance the Group believes
that debtors will meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables and amounts owed by customers on
contracts recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided as at 31 December 2008.
Overall, subject to the global economic climate, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.

In addition to the above, a number of the Group's Public Private Partnership (PPP) jointly controlled entities have entered into interest
rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk. Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these
PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group. The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and
hedge future movements across a range spanning up until September 2035. At 31 December 2008 the Group's share of the total net
fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to £43.7 million (2007: £34.5 million) of which
£26.1 million (2007: £23.0 million) (and the related deferred tax asset of £7.3 million (2007: £6.9 million)) has been recognised in the
hedging reserve.

Capital risk management
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for
shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of the dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or process
during the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.

Acquisitions in 2008
On 12 February 2008, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Alfred McAlpine for total consideration of £554.5 million.
The total consideration was satisfied by the issue of 112.9 million Carillion plc shares valued at the quoted mid-market price at the 
close of business on the day preceding the effective date of acquisition of 337.75 pence and £171.7 million in cash and £1.3 million 
of loan notes.
Alfred McAlpine, its subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities operate in a number of sectors and industries, particularly facilities
management, infrastructure services, civil engineering and construction.

The principal fair value adjustment relates to £184.5 million of goodwill on the Alfred McAlpine balance sheet at the date of acquisition
which is reclassified at the same value as goodwill on Carillion’s balance sheet under the requirements of International Financial
Reporting Standards.
The £15.5 million accounting policy adjustment results from applying Carillion’s policy in respect of expensing rather than capitalising
mobilisation costs associated with the commencement of new contracts.
The £90.3 million of acquired intangible assets relates to the value ascribed to acquired customer lists and contracts.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of £615.0 million represents the present value of future income streams expected to be generated

32. Acquisitions and disposals (continued)
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008, Alfred McAlpine and the Vanbots Group contributed a reported loss before 
tax of £34.1 million (after £83.2 million of restructuring costs and intangible amortisation) to consolidated profit for the year. If both
acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2008, Group revenue would have been £4,681.4 million and profit before tax would have 
been £113.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Acquisitions in 2007
There were no business acquisitions during 2007.
Disposals in 2008
During 2008, the Group disposed of equity investments in six Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities. The disposals generated
cash consideration of £59.9 million (after deducting disposal costs of £0.1 million) and a non-operating profit of £35.6 million.
In February and March 2008, the Group received £25.9 million of cash consideration relating to the disposal of three Public Private
Partnership jointly controlled entities announced by Alfred McAlpine prior to acquisition. These disposals do not generate any profit in 
the post acquisition period as the investments were included at fair value in the acquired balance sheet of Alfred McAlpine.
Disposals in 2007
During 2007, the Group disposed of certain non-core businesses which were classified as discontinued operations. The effect on the
Group of the disposal of these businesses is disclosed in note 9. In addition, in September 2007 the Group disposed of Sovereign Harbour
Marina Limited, generating cash consideration of £10.7 million and a non-operating profit of £3.7 million. In December 2007, the Group
disposed of equity investments in three Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities. The disposal generated cash consideration of
£21.5 million (after deducting costs of £50,000) and a non-operating profit of £23.6 million. Disposals of other jointly controlled entities in
2007 generated proceeds of £0.5 million and a non-operating profit of £0.9 million.
33. Retirement benefit obligations
Carillion operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below:
Principal defined benefit schemes
Carillion Staff and ‘B’ Pension Schemes
Both schemes are defined benefit schemes and were closed to new entrants on 1 April 2003. Existing members will no longer accrue
benefits for future service with effect from 5 April 2009.
An actuarial valuation of the Staff and ‘B’ schemes was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuary as at 31 December 2005
using the projected unit credit method. The market value of the schemes’ assets at that date were £485.0 million and £106.4 million
respectively, which represented approximately 90 per cent and 94 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date 
on an ongoing basis, after allowing for future increases in salaries. The regular on-going contributions paid during the year were 
£9.9 million (2007: £10.7 million) in respect of the Carillion Staff Pension Scheme and £0.9 million (2007: £1.0 million) in respect of 
the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme.
As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees of the Staff and ‘B’ schemes, payments were made to the schemes during
2008 of £16.0 million (2007: £18.0 million) and £2.0 million respectively (2007: £2.0 million). Recovery payments of £1.9 million and
£0.2 million per annum to the Staff and ‘B’ schemes respectively are scheduled to commence from March 2010 and cease at the end 
of 2015. The next actuarial valuations are due at 31 December 2008.
The Group expects to pay regular ongoing contributions of approximately £2.4 million to the Staff scheme and £0.2 million to the

IAS 19 disclosures
The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were:
31 December 2008 31 December 2007
UK Canada UK Canada
Rate of increase in salaries 3.80% 3.00% 4.90% 3.20%
Rate of increase in pensions* 2.80% 2.04% 3.40%* 2.20%
Inflation rate 2.80% 2.04% 3.40% 2.20%
Discount rate 6.30% 7.50% 5.60% 5.55%
* Where schemes have adopted the new 2.5 per cent per annum cap on increases to pensions in payment the assumption is 2.2 per cent per annum (2.4 per cent p.a. in 2007) rather than the higher
amount shown above.
The market values of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change
before they are realised. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA
corporate bonds. The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation. All the schemes, except 
the Railways Pension Scheme, have adopted a basis using the medium cohort tables on the recommendation of the Scheme Actuary.
The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specific assumptions based on industry experience.
The Carillion Staff Scheme, the Carillion Public Sector Scheme, the Mowlem Staff Scheme, the Mowlem (1993) Scheme and 
Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan adopted the ‘PA92(YOB=1965)mc + 2 years’ table for non-retired member’s mortality and the
‘PA92(YOB=1935)mc + 2 years’ for retired members’ mortality at the last valuation. The previous bases were ‘PA92(Base) – 3 years’ 
and ‘PA92(Base) – 1 year’ respectively.

The Canadian actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefits under local
GAAP , CICA 3461. The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental inflation rates in relation to the Post Retirement
Benefit Plan. The immediate trend rate is 10 per cent per annum with an ultimate trend rate of five per cent per annum (2013).
An increase of one per cent in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by £0.5 million and the total service cost by £0.1 million. 
A decrease of one per cent in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by £0.4 million and total service cost by £0.1 million.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury
stock and the actuary’s recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and
Expense as permitted under IAS 19.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 January 2004 in the Group statement of recognised income and
expense is £(9.6) million (2007: £97.8 million). The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on
transition to IFRS of £85.2 million and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the
schemes. Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the
Group statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2004.

Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting
policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a

In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in
relation to final out turn on each contract. On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome
cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable. Once the outcome 
can be estimated reliably the estimates of final out turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the 
specific risks within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract. The cost contingencies are reviewed
on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate. However, the nature of the risks on contracts are
such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews the estimated final out turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets
In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required 
in relation to final out turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached. Note 13 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. 
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group:
• expected return on plan assets
• inflation rate
• mortality 
• discount rate
• salary and pensions increases.
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 33.

Financial statements
Section 05 – Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements
114 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Significant accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Company’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They
are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative
financial instruments which are stated at fair value, and in
accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and law.
Taxation
Deferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences
between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial
statements and their recognition in the tax computation that 
have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except 
as otherwise required by FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’. Liabilities are
calculated on a non-discounted full provision basis. Assets are
calculated on the same basis, but are recognised only to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered.
Fixed asset investments
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary
undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost, less provision
for any impairment.
Leasing
The Company enters into finance lease arrangements on behalf
of subsidiary companies. As permitted by SSAP 21 ‘Accounting
for leases and hire purchase contracts’, the assets relating to the
finance leases are included in the financial statements of the
subsidiaries concerned. The capital element of outstanding
finance leases is included within borrowing. The finance charge
element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account at a
constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Own shares
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted from
the profit and loss account reserve. Where such shares
subsequently vest in the employees under the terms of the
Company’s share option schemes or are sold, any consideration
received is included in the profit and loss account reserve.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into sterling and recorded using the exchange rate prevailing 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and the
gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and 
loss account.
Financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities are cash 
at bank and in hand and borrowing. Cash at bank and in hand 
is carried in the balance sheet at amortised cost. Borrowing is
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs
and subsequently at amortised cost. In addition, the Company
enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and
infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. The forward 
contracts are measured initially at fair value, with changes in fair
value during the year recognised in the profit and loss account.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance
sheet date.
Share-based payments
Members of the Group’s senior management team are entitled 
to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
and the Leadership Equity Award Plan (LEAP). In addition, UK
employees are able to participate in the Sharesave scheme.
The fair value of the ESOS, LEAP and Sharesave schemes at 
the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. For all schemes the fair value determined at grant date is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the period in which any
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which
the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award
(vesting date).
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the
employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial
statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries
equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge
recognised in its consolidated financial statements with the
corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. Amounts
recharged to the subsidiary are recognised as a reduction in the
cost of the investment in subsidiary.
If the amount recharged exceeds the increase in the cost of
investment the excess is recognised as a dividend to the extent
that it reflects post acquisition profits of the subsidiary.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts 
to guarantee the indebtedness of subsidiary companies, the
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and
accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time 
as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to
make a payment under the guarantee.
Retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 ‘Retirement
benefits’. Employees of the Company participate in the Carillion
‘Staff’ and ‘B’ schemes which provide pensions on a defined
benefit basis. The assets and liabilities of these schemes relating 
to the Company cannot be readily ascertained on a reasonable
and consistent basis as the schemes are operated for the benefit
of the Carillion Group as a whole. Consequently, the Company
accounts for these schemes as if they were defined contribution
schemes. Details of the Group’s pension schemes are disclosed 
in note 33 of the consolidated financial statements.
For defined contribution schemes in which the Company’s
employees participate, amounts payable by the Company are
charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
Cash flow statement
A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted 
by FRS 1 (revised) ‘Cash flow statements’.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
2. Profit for the year and dividends
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the year. Carillion plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2008 of £62.5 million (2007: £17.6 million).
Fees paid to KPMG Audit Plc and its associates for non audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts
of Carillion plc because the Company’s consolidated accounts are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
A final dividend, declared in the previous year, of 7.5 pence per share was paid during the year, amounting to £29.6 million 
(2007: £16.6 million).
An interim dividend of 4.1 pence per share was paid during the year, amounting to £16.2 million (2007: £9.8 million).
A final dividend of 8.9 pence (2007: 7.5 pence) per share, amounting to £35.2 million (2007: £29.6 million), was approved by the 
Board on 4 March 2009 and will be paid on 19 June 2009 to shareholders on the register on 24 April 2009.

The merger reserve arose from the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 and Alfred McAlpine in 2008 whereby the consideration included the
issue of Carillion plc shares. The Company has credited the premium arising on the shares issued to the merger reserve rather than the
share premium account as permitted by the Companies Act 1985.
The profit and loss account reserve includes the reserve for the Company’s own shares which comprises of the cost of the Company’s
shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to
employees under the Group’s share incentive schemes. The movements in the reserve for own shares included within the profit and loss
account reserve are as follows:

At 31 December 2008, the ESOP held 419,827 (2007: 61,609) of the Company’s shares. During the year the Company acquired
1,257,104 of its own shares for £4.7 million to meet the plan’s future commitments. The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except
for a total payment of one pence at the time each dividend is paid.
In addition to the ESOP , the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘Quest’). During the year,
210,859 (2007: 2,643) ordinary shares in the Company held by the QUEST were transferred to employees of the Group following the
exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme. At 31 December 2008 the total number of shares held under the QUEST amounted to
8,904 (2007: 219,763) and had a market value of £22,100 (2007: £0.8 million). The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess
of 0.01 pence per share.

11. Pension arrangements
As the Carillion ‘Staff’ and ‘B’ defined benefit schemes are run for the Carillion Group as a whole, the Company is unable to identify its
share of the schemes’ assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Hence, as permitted by FRS 17, the schemes are
accounted for by the Company separately as if the schemes were defined contribution schemes. Details of the Group’s pension schemes
are disclosed in note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
12. Share-based payments
The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to purchase shares

www.shareview.co.uk/dealing. You will need your shareholder
reference number as shown on your share certificate.
Multiple accounts on the shareholder register
If you have received two or more sets of the documents
concerning the Annual General Meeting this means that 
there is more than one account in your name on the shareholder
register, perhaps because either your name or your address
appear on each account in a slightly different way. For security
reasons, Equiniti will not amalgamate the accounts without 
your written consent, so if you would like any multiple accounts
combined into one account, please write to Equiniti at the
address given on this page.
Electronic communications
In September 2008, Carillion wrote to shareholders detailing
changes regarding shareholder communications following the
introduction of the Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’). The Act
recognises the growing importance of electronic communications
and, following the adoption of updated articles of association 
at the May 2007 AGM, the Company is now able to provide
information to shareholders via the Company’s website.
Receiving the Company’s communications electronically allows
the Company to communicate with its shareholders in a more
environmentally friendly and cost effective way. It also offers
advantages in terms of speed and convenience and is a secure
method of delivering shareholder documentation. 
If you wish to register to receive future notifications issued by 
the Company by e-mail rather than by letter, please visit our
registrars’ website at www.shareview.co.uk and complete your
registration details.
Shareview
www.shareview.co.uk is a service offered by Equiniti that enables
you to check your holdings in many UK companies and helps you
to organise your investments electronically. You can also notify
Equiniti of a change of address or a change to dividend mandate
instructions. You can register for this portfolio service which is
easy to use, secure and free as long as you have access to the
internet by logging on to www.shareview.co.uk and following a
simple registration process.
Electronic proxy appointments
For the AGM to be held on 6 May 2009, you may, if you wish,
register the appointment of a proxy electronically by logging on
to the website www.sharevote.co.uk 
You will need your voting reference numbers (the Voting ID, 
Task ID and shareholder reference number shown on your form
of proxy). Alternatively, if you have registered for a Shareview
portfolio, log on to your portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk and
click on ‘Company Meetings’.
Please note that any electronic communication that is found to
contain a computer virus will not be accepted.
ShareGift
ShareGift is a charity share donation scheme for shareholders,
administered by the Orr Mackintosh Foundation. It is especially
for those who may wish to dispose of a small parcel of shares
whose value makes it uneconomic to sell on a commission basis.
Further information can be obtained at www.sharegift.org or
from Equiniti.

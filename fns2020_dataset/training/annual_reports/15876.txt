Chairman’s statement
In an extremely difficult economic environment I am pleased to be able to report an excellent set of results for 2009. The
turnaround in profitability of the Group since 2007 has been significant with an improvement of £0.6m profit from continuing
operations.
The Group generated revenues from continuing operations of £1.76m, an increase of 4% compared to the previous year
(2008:£1.69m) and EBITDA of £0.17m (2008: loss £0.28m) an increase of 666%. Operating profit before tax from
continuing operations of £0.14m (2008: loss £0.06m) an increase of 344%. Cash generated from operating activities of
£0.14m (2008: £0.02m)
I believe this is a truly exceptional achievement in the worst market for many years and is testimony to the Group’s strategy,
skills of our staff, and to the leadership of our business.

CEO’s statement
I was extremely pleased with the trading performance of the Group in 2009. In 2007 and 2008 a number of cost cutting
measures were implemented which allowed the business to mitigate the downside of expected tough trading conditions.
Revenues increased year on year across both divisions in the Group. The reduction in the cost base combined with the increase
in revenues was responsible for the 344% increase in operating profit before tax and the delivery of the best trading
performance to date.
Publishing Division Overview
The Jewish News & Media Group is the umbrella brand for the group’s publishing businesses which include the Jewish News
Limited and TotallyJewish.com Limited.  
The group publishes on and offline media for the UKs Jewish community including:
• A weekly newspaper, ‘Jewish News’
• A quarterly lifestyle magazine, ‘Pulse’
• An annual Celebrations magazine, ‘TotallyJewishSimchas’
• A community portal, ‘www.TotallyJewish.com’
• An annual Wedding exhibition, www’TotallyJewishSimchas Live!’
Performance Highlights
• Revenues of £1,080,000, + 4.6% yr/yr.
• EBITDA of £252,000, +138% yr/yr.
• Operating Profit of £228,000, +192% yr/yr.
Operational Highlights
This division continued to consolidate its growing reputation as the number one Jewish media organisation in the UK.
In 2009 an events division was launched through a Wedding exhibition, TotallyJewishSimchas.com, at the Village Hotel, Elstree
Herts. The exhibition was attended by over 1,500 visitors and 80 paying exhibitors.
A series of Q&A sessions with high profile political leaders saw David Milliband and Boris Johnson face questions from over 150
paying Jewish News readers and in Q1 2010 Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague continued this high profile initiative.
An aggressive marketing campaign was launched which included the creation of a new media pack and website,
TheJNgroup.com as well as individual promotional websites for each of the two magazines in the divisions portfolio, Pulse
(www.JNPulse.co.uk) and TJ Simchas Magazine (www.TJSimchaMag.co.uk). A showreel promoting the work of the JN Media
Group is expected to be launched in Q2 2010.
Outlook for 2010
The aim is to continue to develop and expand the portfolio including the launch of an Education exhibition for the Jewish
community. Combined with the annual Wedding exhibition the short to medium term objective is to grow the revenue of the
event division for the events division so that it accounts for 10% of the publishing division’s revenues. Exhibitions are seen as
a growth area and provide a realistic cross selling opportunity to existing clients within the division.
The annual Celebrations magazine, TotallyJewishSimchas, will be published quarterly. The lifestyle magazine, Pulse, is already
published four times a year which will mean eight glossy magazines will be published in 2010.

Directors’ report 
(continued)
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.  The Board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.  These policies have remained unchanged
throughout the year.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of shareholders’ funds and borrowings.  The Group borrows principally in
Sterling at floating rates of interest.  At the year end, none of the Group’s external borrowings were at fixed rates.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain a balanced financing structure.  Any necessary short term flexibility is achieved by the use of
overdraft facilities.
Political and charitable contributions
The Company made neither political contributions, nor donations to UK charities, during the year.  
Auditors
The auditors, Royce Peeling Green Limited have indicated their willingness under Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006 to
continue in office and a resolution that they be reappointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Secretary. During the period they were as follows:
Dr M J Sinclair

remuneration and other benefits for each of the executive Directors, including performance-related bonus schemes, grant of
share options, pension rights and compensation payments.  The Board itself determines the remuneration of the non-executive

reviewing a wide range of matters, including half year and annual results before their submission to the Board and for
monitoring the internal controls that are in force to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets. The
Committee advises the Board on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration for both audit and non-audit
work, and discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with the external auditors.  The Committee keeps under review
the cost effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.

The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s financial and non-financial controls. Internal control
systems are designed to meet the particular needs of the Group and the risks to which it is exposed and by their nature can

Accounts 2009  12/4/10  16:19  Page 13 12
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have
elected to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union and the company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law. Under company law the directors must not
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group
and company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. The directors are also required to prepare financial
statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative
Investment Market.  
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
Website publication
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available on a website.
Financial statements are published on the company's website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The
maintenance and integrity of the company's website is the responsibility of the directors. The directors' responsibility also
extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

Independent auditors’ report  to the members of Totally plc
We have audited the financial statements of Totally Plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 which comprise the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the Company Balance Sheet and the related
notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Auditing Standards (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s and Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.  
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

• the parent company’s financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally

Going concern
In forming our opinion, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 3 to the financial statements
concerning the uncertainty as to the adequacy of the future funding of the Company and Group. In view of the significance of
this uncertainty we consider that it should be drawn to your attention but our opinion is not qualified in this respect.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report, Chairman’s statement, CEO’s statement, and Corporate
Governance statement. for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial
statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
• We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2009
1. General information
Totally Plc is a public limited company (“Company”) incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985
(registration number 3870101). The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Unit 611
Highgate Studios, 53-79 Highgate Road, London NW5 1TL. The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the AlM Market of
the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”)
The Group’s principal activities have been publishing and the provision of internet and communication services. The Company’s
principal activity is to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries.
2. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
The Company’s financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of
Directors and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by D Assor on 9 April 2010.
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 and
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis and as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 no income statement is presented for the Company. The
Company incurred a loss of £17,000 for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: loss £1,317,000).
3. Basis of preparation
The financial year represents the 365 days to 31 December 2009, and the prior financial year, 366 days to 31 December
2008. The financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000)
except when otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies set out in note 4 have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial
statements.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the following
reasons. The Group currently meets its day to day working capital requirements through two overdraft facilities which are
repayable on demand.  
The Group has confirmed the availability of a facility of £700,000 with Bank Hapoalim which was renewed on 8 July 2009
until 30 June 2010. As security for the facility, the bank has obtained the unlimited Joint and Several Guarantees of Dr. Michael
J. Sinclair (non-executive Chairman), and Mr Leo Noe.
In addition, a working capital facility of £50,000 has been agreed with NatWest which is secured on the Group’s debtor book.
This facility is due for renewal on 31 March 2010.
The Directors have prepared projected cash flow information for the period ending 12 months from the date of their approval
of these financial statements. 
On the basis of cash flow forecasts and discussions with the Group's bankers, the Directors consider that the Group will be
able to operate within the facilities currently agreed. 
Inherently, there can be no certainty in relation to these matters, but the Directors believe that the going concern basis of
preparation continues to be appropriate.

Notes to the financial statements

4. Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements include the results of the Company and all its subsidiaries, together with the Group’s share
of the post-tax results of its joint ventures all of which are prepared up to the same date as the parent company. Uniform
accounting policies are adopted by all companies in the Group.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The results of subsidiaries are included in the Group
income statement from the date of acquisition until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions and balances
between Group companies are eliminated upon consolidation. The results of The Jewish Advocate Publishing Corporation have
been included to 1 September 2008.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities in which the Group has an interest. The Group’s share of the results of its joint
ventures is included in the Group income statement using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in joint ventures is carried in the Group balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share
of net assets of the entity, less any impairment in value.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the financial statements of the
Company.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can
be reliably measured. Revenue represents the amounts, excluding valued added tax derived from advertising, marketing and
technical services. Revenue is recognised in the profit and loss account on the accruals basis.
Revenue from advertising is recognised on the date of the specific publication to which the advert is included.
Revenue from technical services is recognised as contract activity progresses to the extent that revenue can be reliably
measured. Hosting and maintenance income within technical services is spread on a straight line basis over the period to which
the hosting and maintenance period relates.
Finance costs
Finance costs comprise interest payable on the bank overdrafts and are recognised on an accruals basis.
Intangible assets
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Externally acquired computer
software and software licences are capitalised at the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. These
assets are considered to have finite useful lives and are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic
lives of each of the assets, considered to be between three and five years. Computer software is carried at cost less
accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Costs relating to development of computer software are capitalised once
the recognition criteria are met. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised over the
estimated useful life of the software.
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Notes to the financial statements

4. Accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Furniture and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. Cost
comprises the aggregate amount paid to acquire asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of
operating as intended
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values by equal instalments over the estimated
useful economic lives as follows:
Computer equipment - 2 and 5 years
Fixtures and fittings - 2 and 3 years
Short leasehold property - lease term
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate on an annual
basis. An item of furniture and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the period that the asset is
derecognised.
Impairment of assets
At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews amounts of its tangible fixed assets to determine whether there is any
indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
assets, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent
of the impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the company
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. For tangible and intangible
assets excluding goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be cash generating asset or the trading company whichever is the smaller
CGU. For goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be the business acquired.
An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss
subsequently reverses due to a change in its original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which are generally received on end of month following terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of
their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is made when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered
in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is considered remote.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of
three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Company’s cash
management are included as components of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.

Notes to the financial statements
(continued)
4. Accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies 
a) Foreign operations
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates. The results
of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year. The average US dollar to sterling
exchange rate for the period to 1 September 2008 was 1.97. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation at year-end
exchange rates of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to equity and are reported in the statement of recognised
income and expense.
b) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate ruling
at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
The Company has a short lease on its premises.  This is accounted for as an ‘operating lease’ and the rental charges are
charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.  Other operating leases are treated in the
same manner.  
Internally generated intangible assets – research and development expenditure 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-generated
intangible asset arising from the Group’s technology development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
• An asset is created that can be identified; 
• It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and 
• The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.  Where no
internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period
in which it is incurred.
Share-based payments
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) of the Group in the form of share-based payment transactions,
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’).The fair value of
the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted,
excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. All share options are valued using an option-pricing model (Black-
Scholes). This fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme, with
the corresponding increase in equity.
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and
actual levels of options vesting, with the corresponding adjustment made in equity.
Accounts 2009  12/4/10  16:19  Page 25 24
Notes to the financial statements
(continued)
4. Accounting policies (continued)
Income taxes
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the taxation
authorities based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred income
tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the tax bases and the
accounting bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax is calculated on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are
expected to applying the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except for an asset or liability in a transaction that
is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset against
each other only when the Company has a legally enforceable right to do so.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The Company makes judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The resulting accounting estimates calculated using these judgements and
assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results but are based on historical experience and expectations
of future events. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision effects only that period, or in the period
of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The estimates and assumption that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are those
related to establishing depreciation and amortisation periods for the Company and the estimates in relation to future cash flows
and discount rates utilised in impairment testing.
Change in accounting policies
a) Change in revenue recognition policy
There has been a change in the revenue recognition policy in the year, and consequently the results of the previous year have
been restated. The board has reviewed the accounting policy specifically with reference to publications, where advertising
revenue is generated both via magazine advertising (print media) and online advertising. The past policy was to recognise
revenue on the earliest publication date, whether this was online or as published via print media. The new policy is to recognise
revenue on the latest publication date, whether this is online or published via print media. The change in policy reflects the
uncertainty and subjectivity in dividing advertising income between online and print media. The new policy provides more
relevant and reliable financial information.
The impact of the prior year adjustment on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income has been to increase the
revenue reported in 2008 by £4,000 and to reduce cost of sales by £1,000. There has been no impact on the tax credit. The
impact on the Statement of Financial Position is to increase accruals and deferred income at 31 December 2008 by £48,000
to £137,000, and by £53,000 to £161,000 at 1 January 2008.
In accordance with IAS1(revised) a balance sheet as at the date of the beginning of the earliest comparative period (1 January
2008) has been presented. Other than the disclosures in note 15 the change in accounting policy has not affected any other
balance sheet notes.

4. Accounting policies (continued)
b) New standards and interpretations effective from 1 January 2009 
During the year the Group has adopted IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007)”.
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007) includes the requirement to present a Statement of Changes in
Equity as a primary statement and introduces the possibility of either a single Statement of Comprehensive Income (combining
the Income Statement and a Statement of Comprehensive Income) or to retain the Income Statement with a supplementary
Statement of Comprehensive Income. The first option has been adopted by Totally Plc. As this standard is concerned with
presentation only it does not have any impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
None of the other new standards, interpretations and amendments, also effective for the first time from 1 January 2009, have
had a material effect on the financial statements.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments is also mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 however the Group elected to
apply the standard early in its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
c) Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the
group’s accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2009 and which the group has decided not to adopt early.
Those likely to affect the Group:
Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This revision was
endorsed by the EU on 15 June 2009. This revision requires prospective application and may result in acquisition costs being
recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, intangible assets being recognised even
when it cannot be reliably measured, and the option to gross up the balance sheet for goodwill attributable to minority
interests. This will be applicable in the future if the Group were to make any further acquisitions, which is not currently
anticipated.
Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July
2009). This amendment was endorsed by the EU on 15 June 2009. This amendment requires prospective application and
could result in a change in differences where acquisitions or disposals of subsidiaries are made in stages. This could be
applicable if the company made piecemeal acquisitions or disposals in the future, which is not anticipated,
None of the other standards are considered likely to have a material affect on the group’s financial statements.

6. Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations during 2008 comprise the sale of The Jewish Advocate Publishing Corporation to The Zvhil-Mezbuz
Rebbe, Grand Rabbi Y.A Korff of Boston (“the Rebbe”) on 1 September 2008. In consideration for the sale, 20,500,000 1p
Ordinary Shares held by the “Rebbe” were redesignated as Deferred Shares.
The Deferred Shares issued carried no voting rights, no rights to attend general meetings of the Company, and no rights to
receive dividends. The Deferred Shares do carry a right to participate in any return of capital to the extent of 0.01 pence per
Deferred Share but only after each Ordinary Share has received in aggregate capital repayments totalling £1,000,000 per
Ordinary Share.
Therefore it is the opinion of the Board that the Deferred Shares are, for all practical purposes, valueless.
In addition warrants held by the Rebbe to subscribe for 4,394,350 Ordinary Shares were cancelled as part of the sale.
Furthermore under the terms of the agreement the Rebbe will pay additional consideration to the Company in the event of:-
1) a sale of the whole or a substantial number of the Jewish Advocate Shares; or
2) a sale of the whole or a substantial proportion of the business and assets of the Jewish Advocate.
This was 40 per cent of the difference between the consideration received by the Rebbe at the time of such sale and the value
of the Consideration shares (20,500,000 1p Ordinary Shares) on 1 September 2008 if the sale is effected within one year or
33 per cent of the difference in the event that such sale is effected within two years.
The directors believe that the likelihood of such a disposal is not probable, and therefore no asset has been recognised in the
financial statements.

Secured liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities during the year ended 31 December 2009 were represented by two overdraft facilities, both
repayable in less than one year. 
One overdraft is secured by a debenture over the Group’s trade debtors aged under 90 days, with a limit of £50,000 charging
interest at 3.75 per cent above bank base rate per annum. 
The second facility has a limit of £700,000 charging interest at 2 per cent above bank base rate per annum. As security for
the second facility, the bank has obtained the unlimited Joint and Several Guarantees of Dr Michael J. Sinclair (non-executive
Chairman), and Mr Leo Noe.  
At 31 December 2009 there was no difference between the book and fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities.  There were
no fixed rate liabilities during the year.
All monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are held in Sterling, the Group’s functional currency.

Issue of deferred shares
On 30 September 2008 20,500,000 1p Ordinary Shares were redesignated as Deferred Shares.
The Deferred Shares issued carry no voting rights, no rights to attend general meetings of the Company, and no rights to receive
dividends. The Deferred Shares do carry a right to participate in any return of capital to the extent of 0.01 pence per Deferred
Share but only after each Ordinary Share has received in aggregate capital repayments totalling £1,000,000 per Ordinary
Share.
Earnings per share
The calculation of the basic earnings / (losses) per share is based on the profit of £141,000 (2008 as restated: loss of
£1,081,000) and on 91,947,934 (2008: 107,322,909) ordinary shares being the weighted average number of shares in
issue during the period. The diluted loss per share for 2009 is based on a profit of £141,000 and 91,947,934 ordinary shares,
16,943,333 outstanding options and 100,213,012 outstanding warrants. The diluted earnings per share in 2008 is the same
as the basic earnings per share. In accordance with IAS 33 which prescribes that potential ordinary shares should only be used
as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease net profit or increase net loss per share
from continuing operations.
Share options
On 27 July 2009 7,575,000 share options at an exercise price ranging between 1.5 pence and 4.38 pence per share were
surrendered and 10,575,000 new options were issued at an exercise price of 1 pence per share. The options are exercisable
from the date of issue up to 27 July 2019.
On 8 October 2009, 1,050,000 share options at an exercise price ranging between 1.5 pence and 3.62 pence per share were
surrendered and a further 3,050,000 share options were issued at an exercise price of 1 pence per ordinary share. The options
are exercisable from the date of issue up to 8 October 2019.
In summary at 31 December 2009, there are 16,943,333 options still in issue.
Warrants currently in issue
On 21 May 2002, in conjunction with a share placing, subscribers to the placing shares were issued 4,583,329 warrants (one
warrant for every four shares subscribed). The warrants are exercisable at 5 pence per ordinary share. The warrants are
exercisable in the 45 day periods following either publication of the Company’s half year results or adoption of the Company’s
annual accounts.  The last exercise period is the earliest of either the 45 day period following the adoption of the Company’s
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 or, subject to certain exceptions, on a winding up of the Company where
there is a surplus payable to the ordinary share holders.

issue up to 18 June 2011. The 4,394,350 warrants have been cancelled on 30 September 2008 as part of the disposal of
The Jewish Advocate Publishing Corporation (see note 6).
On 30 September 2008 70,000,000 warrants were issued at an exercise price of 1 pence per ordinary share. The warrants

On 8 October 2009 166,666 warrants were issued at an exercise price of 1 pence per ordinary share. The warrants are
exercisable from the date of issue up to 8 October 2019.
In summary at 31 December 2009, there are 100,123,012 warrants still in issue.
Share premium account
The share premium account represents the amounts received by the Company on the issue of Ordinary Shares that are in
excess of the nominal value of the issued shares.
19. Share-based payment
During the year ended ending 31 December 2009 the Group and Company had two share based payment arrangements as
described below.
a) Employee Share Options
Totally plc Enterprise Management Incentive Plan
The estimated fair value of each option has been calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model for different
options granted between 17 December 2002 and 8 October 2009. The estimated fair value of options varies between 0.9
pence and 0.04 pence. The model inputs are share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility of 29 per cent,
no expected dividends, contractual life of three years, and a risk free interest rate of four per cent. It has been estimated
that 21% of options granted will be forfeited due to employees leaving during the three year vesting period. The actual
contractual life of 10 years has been used in the calculation. A reconciliation of option movements over the year is shown
below:

b) Warrants
The estimated fair value of each warrant has been calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model for different
warrants granted as outlined in Note 18. The estimated fair value of warrants varies between 0.8 pence and 0.01 pence.
The model inputs are share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility of 29 per cent, no expected dividends,
contractual life of three years, and a risk free interest rate of four per cent. A three year contractual life has been used to
reflect the non-tradability of the warrants compared to the actual contractual life of seven years. The full cost of the warrants
is recognised at the date of grant.

Notice of Annual General Meeting
(continued)
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a
“CREST proxy instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications
and must contain the information required for such instructions as described in the CREST manual. The message, regardless
of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy
must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent (ID: RA10) by the latest time (S) for
receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the
time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST applications host) from which the Company’s
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK &
Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and
limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST proxy instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member
concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting
service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or votint service provider(s) take(s) such action as shall be necessary to
ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections
of the CREST manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5) (a) of the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
6. Pursuant to regulation 41 (1) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (2001 No. 3755) the Company has

Chairman’s statement
This is my first report to shareholders 
following my appointment as Chairman in 
November 2013. This is an exciting time for 
Bovis Homes and I have been pleased with 
the strong results for 2013, the successful 
deployment of the growth strategy and the 
considerable opportunity that I see for the 
Group going forward.
The economic backdrop has shown signs of improvement 
over the last year and this has been reflected in a recovery in 
the UK housing market. The availability of mortgage finance 
is increasing in terms of the number of mortgages being 
approved, and the rates being charged on these mortgages 
are increasingly competitive. Although indices report that UK 
house prices increased strongly in 2013, after excluding the 
effects of London, house price rises are considered to have 
been modest across the country. However, the Government 
has also provided positive assistance, particularly through the 
Help to Buy scheme. As a result of these factors, consumer 
confidence has improved. 
With this improving backdrop, the management team at Bovis 
Homes has produced a strong set of results in 2013, delivering 
the targeted improvements in return on capital employed.  
The Group is increasingly benefiting from the compound 
positive effects of stronger volumes, higher average sales 
price and improving profit margins, driving profits and return 
on capital employed higher. The Group has also set the 
foundations for ongoing growth through its carefully targeted 
land acquisition strategy, continued product development and 
focus on balance sheet strength.
Financial performance
The Group delivered a strong increase in the return on capital 
employed by 2.7 ppts to 10.4% in 2013 with both profit 
margins and capital turn contributing to this improvement.  
The Group continues to be well capitalised with a strong 
balance sheet with net debt at the end of 2013 of £18 million.
Earnings per share and dividends
Basic earnings per share for the year have grown by 49%  
to 44.9p. Consistent with the intention to increase dividends 
progressively as earnings per share increase, the Board will be 
recommending a final dividend of 9.5p per share, which, when 
combined with the 2013 interim dividend of 4.0p, totals 13.5p 
for the year, an increase of 50% on the 2012 dividend. The 
final dividend will be payable on 23 May 2014 to shareholders 
on the register on 28 March 2014. It is the Board’s intention to 
continue to pursue this progressive dividend approach.
Future prospects
While delivering a strong profit result in 2013, the Group has 
built a significantly improved forward sales position at the start 
of 2014, which underpins volume growth for this year. With 
another year of carefully targeted but assertive land investment 
in 2013 ahead of utilisation and a strong land pipeline going 
into 2014, sales outlets are expected to grow during 2014 
and 2015, supporting further growth in reservation volumes. 
Assuming current market conditions continue, the location of 
these new sales outlets and the nature of the homes being 
developed is expected to further increase the Group’s average 
sales price and improve profit margins. Together with a 
continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, this is expected to 
deliver further strong growth in both capital turn, profitability, 
and ultimately shareholder returns.
People
The Board of directors has been delighted with the 
commitment and skill shown by the Group’s employees in 
delivering growth during 2013 and, on behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank them for their dedication and hard 
work. The Board would also like to extend its thanks to its 
subcontractors and suppliers.
Corporate governance
Bovis Homes is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance, including those related to the role and 
effectiveness of the Board and compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Details are set out in the 
corporate governance section on pages 33 to 41.
Ian Tyler 
Chairman Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  7
The Group has achieved excellent progress in 2013 with 
improved profitability and is well positioned for further growth
Corporate social responsibility
The Group remains committed to delivering strong Corporate 
Social Responsibility performance. During 2013, the Group was 
able to maintain its health and safety track record, as measured 
by incidence rate, notwithstanding a significant increase in build 
activity. In respect of customer satisfaction, 93% of customers 
were happy to recommend Bovis Homes to their friends. Focus 
remains high in the Group to make further improvements in both 
of these important areas, as part of the overall Corporate Social 
Responsibility strategy.
Conclusion
Looking ahead, I believe that the Group has the right strategy in 
place to deliver enhanced, sustainable shareholder returns in the 
years ahead and I look forward to working with the Board and 
executive team to continue the Group’s success.

Improving returns
The Group’s strategy remains to deliver material improvement in shareholder 
returns in the short term and maintain strong returns over the housing 
market cycle. In the foreseeable future the Group aims to achieve this by 
increasing profitability whilst improving the efficiency of capital employed. 
At the same time the Group will target making investments to enhance 
future returns potential in the land bank. At a certain point the Group will 
reduce the current assertive level of consented land purchase and drive 
profitability from converting more strategic land assets.
Enhanced operating profit
The Group is aiming to deliver enhanced profits in the foreseeable future 
from the compound positive effect of:
•  Volume growth from a greater number of sales outlets combined with 
an improving sales rate per site from an improvement in the quality of 
the average active sales outlet.
•  Higher average sales price from traditional homes on better located 
sales outlets.
•  Stronger profit margins from an increasing proportion of legal 
completions from new higher margin sites.
Enhancing future returns potential
The future growth and profitability of the Group is driven by improving 
the gross profit potential in the consented land bank. The Group aims to 
deliver this by:
•  Adding new consented sites to the land bank which will achieve higher 
profit margins.
•  Continuing investment in strategic land and delivering strategic land 
conversion through achievement of residential planning consent.
• Progressively trading out older, lower margin sites.
The high quality investments over the past four years have delivered 
material improvements in the future profit potential of the Group.
As the consented land market becomes more competitive, land acquisition 
will reduce closer to replacement level and the Group will source more of 
its land from strategic land conversion. 
Increasing efficiency of capital employed
Whilst investing assertively and rapidly growing output capacity, the Group 
needs to control the growth of capital employed by:
•  Efficient cash utilisation with larger sites being acquired on deferred terms.
•  Managing the land bank through acquiring mainly smaller sites and 
selectively selling consented land parcels on larger sites.
• Maintaining tight control of work in progress.

*Adjusted for IAS19R The Group has made good progress having successfully 
delivered on the strategies set out for 2013  
Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  9 10  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Strategic report  |  Our business
UK housing market in the medium term
The total UK housing stock is estimated to be around  
26 million homes. The average activity level over the long term 
within this market has resulted in 1.1 million transactions per 
annum. Post 2007 the housing market suffered a significant 
fall in activity levels initially to between 700,000 and 800,000 
transactions, down from circa 1.6 million transactions  
during 2007. During 2013, this is estimated to have increased 
back above one million transactions. The contraction in activity 
was due to a large reduction in demand, driven by the lack 
of availability of mortgage finance, as banks delevered in 
the aftermath of the financial crisis. The fall in activity was 
accompanied by a fall in the average sales price of homes from 
a peak of £199,600 in August 2007 to a low point of £154,700 
in April 2009 (according to Halifax), a fall of 22%. Adjusted for 
inflation, the real decrease has been greater.
Underlying demand from household formation, based on the 
Government’s latest estimates released in April 2013, suggested 
that English households were expected to grow by 221,000 
per year through to 2021. In terms of new build supply, the 
number of new home completions in England as reported by 
the Government for the 12 months to 30 September 2013 
was 107,950, an 8% decrease on the previous 12 months. 
Housing starts according to the Government for the 12 months 
to 30 September 2013 reached 117,110, an increase of 16% 
compared to the year before. Therefore the mismatch between 
longer term demand and supply continues.
UK housing market in the short term
Pricing
During 2013 pricing has moved positively, having been 
relatively flat in nominal terms for the last four years.  
This positive change is particularly driven by the London 
market, which is estimated to have increased by around 15% 
according to Nationwide. Excluding London, prices in England 
are estimated to have increased by between 5% and 7%. 
Pricing is driven by the factors affecting demand and supply 
within the overall housing market.
Housing demand
Although demand is affected by a range of factors, including 
affordability, confidence in the future direction of house prices 
and confidence over future employment prospects, the key 
demand determinant over the last five years has been the 
availability of mortgage finance. 
The three years to 31 December 2012 saw highly constrained, 
but relatively stable level of mortgage approvals, fluctuating 
primarily in the range of 45,000 to 55,000 approvals per 
month. This issue particularly affected customers requiring 
higher loan to value mortgages, many of whom were first 
time buyers. The experience during 2013 has been significantly 
more positive, with monthly mortgage approvals having 
reached a high of 71,638 in December 2013.
The Government announced during March 2013 that two 
products supported by the Government under the name Help 
to Buy would be launched. This announcement gained a high 
level of customer awareness and interest. The first product, a 
shared equity scheme, was launched in April 2013 exclusively 
for new build properties.

Approvals of mortgages for house purchases
2007 2013 Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  11
The UK housing market is recovering with greater consumer 
confidence and improved availability of mortgage finance
In the first six months of the scheme, 5,375 properties were 
acquired using the product. 92% of the purchasers were first time 
buyers and the average price of a property bought was £194,167. 
The second element of the scheme, a mortgage guarantee scheme, 
was launched in September 2013, the impact of which has yet to 
be understood.  The overall impact of the announcement and the 
launch of the first product has been positive, not only in enabling 
more customers to access mortgage finance, but also in increasing 
consumers’ confidence to purchase.
The decision by the Bank of England to withdraw the existing 
Funding for Lending Scheme support for mortgages is viewed 
positively by the Group, as it shows that the mortgage market is 
becoming more competitive.
Housing Supply
From 2010 to 2012 the quantity of buyers and vendors was 
relatively balanced. With the improving consumer confidence 
supported by the Government Help to Buy scheme, the level of 
demand in the housing market has improved substantially.
Residential land
The price of residential land is a residual value calculation, with a 
developer willing to pay a land price based on expected incomes 
less costs and a required development margin. When residential 
house prices change, the value of a piece of land tends to move 
by a factor of two or three. The value of residential land is also 
affected by the number of purchasers and the amount and type of 
residential land coming to market, as well as potential purchasers’ 
confidence of future house price movements.
During the last four years, the number of residential land purchasers 
in the market has remained relatively stable. Private housebuilders 
have struggled to access bank finance to fund their purchase at 
the leverage and at the price that they require and have effectively 
not been significant market participants. The main purchasers 
have been publicly listed housebuilders, who have demonstrated a 
disciplined approach when acquiring land. 
Until more capital becomes available to the wider new build  
sector, it is unlikely that the number of purchasers will  
increase substantially.
 
In terms of the supply of residential land, the quantity of planning 
applications made and granted fell significantly from 2008 to 
2011. With the launch of the National Policy Planning Framework 
(“NPPF”) in March 2012, the supply of residential land has 
increased materially in 2012 and H1 2013.
Different types of residential land sites come to market in terms 
of size, product type, location and former use (greenfield or 
brownfield). Larger sites, particularly in the south of England, tend 
to attract relatively few purchasers due to capital commitments, 
whereas smaller sites up to 50 plots may attract many more.  
Again, the product mix on a site may attract different levels of 
demand with, for instance, apartment schemes in city centres 
(outside London) likely to attract a limited number of purchasers, 
compared to traditional two storey detached housing sites.
Overall, the demand and supply dynamic of the land market 
remains favourable for well funded purchasers and residential land 
can be purchased at sensible returns.
Competitors
The second hand market remains the main competition for Bovis 
Homes. In a normal year, the Group would expect around 90% of 
residential transactions to be second hand, with pricing in the new 
build sector being set by reference to that market. The de-stocking 
by the housebuilders between 2008 and 2010 led to new build 
contributing a greater proportion of residential transactions.  
This was supported by housebuilders providing finance by way  
of shared equity products to home buyers, which enabled  
certain buyers to acquire homes with lower levels of equity in the 
new build market compared to the second hand market.  
With overall consumer confidence improving and transaction 
numbers increasing materially, it is likely that the new build sector 
will move back towards 10% of total housing market transactions.

Chief Executive’s report
Bovis Homes has made significant progress 
in 2013, delivering a strong improvement in 
revenue, profits and return on capital employed.
The Group has continued to acquire high quality land assets 
in the south of England and in prime locations in the midlands 
and northwest, where it is considered the housing market 
will be more robust. As a result, the Group has grown active 
sales outlets, leading to higher volumes. With an increasing 
proportion of legal completions from post downturn sites, 
average sales price and profit margins have improved.
Furthermore through an improvement in the efficiency of 
capital employed by active management of the land bank and 
work in progress, the Group has increased its capital turn.  
The combination of improved profitability and increased capital 
turn has delivered a strong improvement in the Group’s return 
on capital employed.
Bovis Homes aims to be a quality housebuilder delivering 
high returns generated from a strong land bank, much of it 
strategically sourced, and quality homes sold at a premium 
price. In order to deliver improved returns, the following  
clear strategic objectives for 2013 were set out and have  
been delivered:
• Increase operating profits
• Enhance future returns through targeted land investment
• Improve efficiency of capital employed
As a result of delivering against these three strategic objectives, 
the Group has achieved a significant increase in return on 
capital employed to 10.4% in 2013 from 7.7% in 2012.
Additionally the Group has focused on the following objectives:
• Deliver strong health, safety and environmental standards
• Deliver a strong customer service experience
Increase operating profits
Operating profit increased in 2013 by 46% to £82.8 million, 
as a result of the compound positive effect of an increased 
volume of legal completions sold at a higher average sales price 
generating a stronger profit margin. 
During 2013, the Group achieved 2,773 private reservations, 
a 48% increase on the 1,873 achieved in 2012. Net private 
sales per site per week increased by 34% to 0.59 (2012: 0.44), 
as a result of the improving quality of the Group’s active sales 
outlets and the benefit of a recovering housing market. Active 
sales outlets averaged 90 during 2013, an increase of 10% on 
the 82 achieved during 2012. 
One effect of the positive sales rate was that some sites were 
completed more quickly than expected. Also certain sites were 
launched later than anticipated due to planning delays.  
These two factors led to the Group achieving a marginally 
lower average number of active sales outlets than had been 
expected at the start of 2013.
The higher level of private reservations enabled the Group to 
deliver a 26% increase in private legal completions to 2,330 
(2012: 1,854), as well as carrying forward a significantly 
enhanced private forward order book of 692 private reservations, 
up from 249 at the beginning of 2013. This improved forward 
order book will support the Group’s volume ambitions for 
2014 and enable the Group to deliver a more balanced profile 
of legal completions through the year, with an increased 
proportion of its full year legal completions in the first half. 
Additionally, this will assist in improving the working capital 
cycle of the Group through the year.
During 2013, the Group supported new customers accessing 
the housing market using the Government’s Help to Buy 
shared equity scheme. In the year new homes were handed 
over to 872 customers who were able to use shared equity 
products, including the Help to Buy scheme, as part of their 
home purchase. During 2012, shared equity products (including 
Government backed schemes) were used to support customers 
buying 535 new homes. The Group sees the Help to Buy scheme 
as an attractive replacement for other shared equity products.
483 social homes were legally completed in 2013 (2012: 501), 
constituting 17% of total legal completions (2012: 21%).  
The Group decided to prioritise private build over social, 
particularly during Q4 2013, to ensure that private production 
was not constrained by tightness in the supply of sub-contract 
labour or materials lead times. At the beginning of 2014 the 
Group held 685 forward social reservations (2013: 529).
In aggregate the Group delivered 2,813 legal completions in 
2013, a 19% increase on the 2,355 in 2012. To support this 
significant increase in new home delivery, the Group increased 
its construction output in 2013 by 26% to 2,935 homes  
(2012: 2,322). Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  17
Strategy delivery is on track with further growth in 
returns supported by land investment
The Group achieved a 13% increase in private average sales price 
to £212,700 in 2013 (2012: £188,700). This has been driven 
primarily by changes in the Group’s product mix of private legal 
completions with an increase in larger traditional two storey homes 
and a decrease in townhouses. The Group considers that in its 
areas of operation sales prices have increased by between 2% and 
3% with stronger gains in the south of England offset by modest 
movements in the midlands and north of England. Including 
social homes, the Group’s average sales price was 14% higher at 
£195,100 (2012: £170,700).
Housing gross margin increased from 22.6% in 2012 to 23.5% 
in 2013, resulting from the increased contribution from legal 
completions on stronger margin sites acquired post the housing 
market downturn. This margin progression was impacted by the 
planned incremental year on year cost of circa £3.5 million to 
promote strategic land assets. 
The housing gross margin was also affected for the first time in 
many years by increases in build costs, mainly from labour rates. 
Increased activity in the new homes market has led to demand for 
subcontract labour exceeding supply. As a result, subcontractors 
have seen the ability to renegotiate at higher rates. Given the 
timing of such increases, the Group has been able to limit the cost 
impact well within the benefit from increasing sales prices.
As a result of the compound positive effect of volume growth, 
higher average sales price and improved gross profit margin, 
housing gross profit increased by 41% to £130.2 million  
(2012: £92.1 million). With overheads well controlled, the 
operating margin increased to 14.9% (2012*: 13.3%).
Enhance future returns through targeted  
land investment
The Group applies rigorous criteria for the acquisition of consented 
land, reflecting not only the anticipated margin and return on capital, 
but also site specific risks and geographic concentration risk.
2013 was a successful year for land investment. The Group continued 
to invest in high quality consented land assets, retaining its focus on 
specific areas of search in the south of England and prime locations 
in the midlands and northwest. During the year the Group added 
3,737 plots on 27 sites to the consented land bank at a cost of  
£225 million (2012: 2,651 consented plots at a cost of £161 million). 
The plots added have an estimated future revenue of £841 million 
and an estimated future gross profit potential of £216 million, based 
on current sales prices and current build costs, and are expected to 
deliver a gross margin of over 25% and a ROCE well in excess of  
the Group’s 20% hurdle rate. A further circa 2,800 plots on 12  
sites were contracted at the end of 2013, awaiting satisfaction of 
legal conditions. 
In 2014 to date, circa 2,300 consented plots on nine sites have been 
added to the consented land bank, many of these plots arising from 
the successful completion of the contracts secured during 2013.
Included in the sites added to date in 2014 is a major new settlement 
at Sherford in Devon, where the Group owns 1,658 consented 
plots. The land cost of this site is very low, due to the high level of 
infrastructure spend which is phased over the life of the site. As a 
result, the peak funding on this long term major project is expected 
to be between 1% and 2% of the Group’s net assets. Sherford will 
be an anchor site within the South West region over many years and 
is expected to deliver a strong margin and an excellent return on 
capital employed.
The consented land bank amounted to 14,638 plots as at 31 
December 2013 (2012: 13,776). The Group estimates that the gross 
profit potential on these consented plots at the 2013 year end, based 
on current sales prices and current build costs, was £727 million with 
a gross margin of 24.2% (2012: £600 million at 22.7%).
At the year end, the consented land bank included 9,197 consented 
plots (63% of total), which have been acquired since the housing 
market downturn (2012: 7,368 plots and 54% of total). The average 
consented land plot cost was £45,800 at the start of 2013 and 
increased over the year to £48,900, as a result of a lower number 
of written down plots held in the land bank (10% of land plots 
versus 13% at the start of the year) and the addition of new prime 
traditional housing sites where the average plot cost is higher.
The strategic land bank at 31 December 2013 contained 20,108 
potential plots (2012: 19,318). The Group converted circa 1,200 
plots of strategic land having achieved consent during 2013. The 
Group has continued to invest in new strategic land assets to assist in 
replenishing its consented land bank at strong margins in the future.
In addition, the Group has secured resolution to grant planning 
consent on three of its major strategic land assets at Winnersh, 
Witney and Bishops Stortford. These sites will deliver in aggregate 
over 1,200 consented plots at a significant discount to market 
value. Planning consents will be formally released once the planning 
agreements for each site are signed. Good progress continues to be 
made on a number of other major strategic projects, where material 
promotion costs are being incurred to achieve planning consents. 
This is expected to deliver significant numbers of consented plots 
over the next few years.
Improve efficiency of capital employed
Improving capital turn is critical to the Group’s ability to deliver 
material growth in return on capital employed. Capital turn  
has continued to improve from 0.5 in 2011 to 0.7 in 2013.  
The consented land bank is the key element of capital employed. 
While this has grown in size with the investments made by the 
Group, the average number of plots per active sales outlet has 
continued to decrease from 188 in 2011 to 158 in 2013.  
The average number of plots per site acquired in 2013 was  
138 plots, compared to 147 in 2012. 18  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Strategic report  |  Our performance
Work in progress turn increased to 2.7 times in 2013 from 
2.5 in 2012. Notional units of production at the end of 2013 
increased to 1,040 (2012: 918), as a result of the increase in 
active sales outlets and to facilitate higher legal completion 
volumes in the first half of 2014 over the first half of 2013. 
The value of work in progress has increased to £202.3 million 
from £172.7 million.
With the land investment undertaken to date and the strength 
of the ongoing land pipeline, the output capacity of the 
business is expected to increase. On the basis of current 
market conditions, capital turn should improve further in 2014 
and beyond.
Deliver strong health, safety and  
environmental standards
The Group is committed to delivering strong health and safety 
standards for its employees, subcontractors and other site 
visitors. It maintains a high level of organisational focus on its 
health and safety regime through comprehensive staff training, 
clear and accountable management processes and through 
regular and transparent reporting of performance. 
This is overseen, firstly, through the operational line, which 
takes day to day accountability for this area and, secondly, via 
a Group-wide oversight committee with nominated regional 
directors responsible for safety, run by the Group Director of 
Health and Safety and chaired by a senior Group manager. 
The Group also seeks to ensure that all of its employees and 
subcontractors who operate at or visit sites carry a CSCS card, 
indicating its commitment to a fully trained workforce. 
As the Group increased its build activity by 26% during 2013, 
the health and safety risk incidence rate across the business 
was maintained positively at 22.4 (2012: 23.1), the lower 
rate meaning stronger performance. This reflects a robust 
performance given the magnitude of the increase in employee 
numbers and subcontractor population during the year. 
The Group set itself challenging targets at the start of 
2013 with the ambition to further reduce health and safety 
risk incidence over a five year period. Disappointingly, the 
performance of the Group in the first year of this five year 
period was behind target. The Group continues to develop 
its health and safety processes and controls with the aim 
of improving performance in line with the targets set for 
2014. Health and safety will remain a key focus for regional, 
divisional and Group management.
The Group continues to regard sustainable development as 
critical to the long term creation of value for its shareholders. 
The housebuilding industry has an important role to play both 
in mitigating the impact of its building activities on the local 
environment and in the evolution of building techniques  
and advances, which reduce the carbon usage from new  
build developments.
During 2013, the Group has continued to focus on waste in 
order to drive down the quantity of waste produced in building 
a home. The quantity of active waste generated per home in 
2013 remained at 3.1 tonnes and the amount sent to landfill 
was reduced by 12%.
The Group works with a range of external stakeholders to 
agree and carry out development in a mutually acceptable 
manner, thereby ensuring that its developments take place in 
a way which mitigates the impact on the local environment, 
thereby balancing the needs of local communities for new 
housing with the requirement to avoid environmental damage.
Looking forward, the Group is focusing on ways to ensure 
that its products conform to good environmental standards, 
including the Code for Sustainable Homes. During 2013,  
1,036 of the Group’s homes were constructed to at least  
Code 3 of the Code for Sustainable Homes. Reflecting the 
existing contribution that the Group makes to the communities 
and environments in which it operates, the Group is  
pleased to report that it continues to be a member of  
the FTSE4Good index.
Given the nature of our business, scope of operations in  
the UK, business relationships, supply chains and labour 
practices we have not included information specifically about 
human rights in this report. We have an Ethical Code of 
Conduct and an Equal Opportunities policy which recognise 
the importance of high standards and treating our employees 
fairly. All policies can be found on the Company’s website at

Further details of the Group’s efforts and achievements during 
2013 in regards to Corporate Social Responsibility will be 
published in a separate report, available from the Company’s

Deliver a strong customer service experience 
for Bovis Homes customers
The Group is focused on delivering its customers a high quality 
home alongside a good level of service through the period the 
customer is buying the home and thereafter as the customer 
enjoys their new home. During 2013, 93% of customers 
reported that they would recommend Bovis Homes to a friend 
and this was reinforced by the award during February 2013 
of a five star customer satisfaction rating by the Home Builder 
Federation. During the course of 2013, the Group’s score in 
the Home Builder Federation customer satisfaction survey has 
dropped marginally below the 90% benchmark for the five 
star rating at 89%. 
Whilst remaining a robust customer satisfaction score, the 
Group was disappointed to see this deterioration in its external 
customer satisfaction rating and the gap which has opened 
between this external score and the customers’ response to the 
Group’s internal customer satisfaction survey.

The Group has reinforced its Customer Journey processes  
across the business with the view to improving its customer 
satisfaction performance.
The focus of the Group’s customer communication has remained 
digitally based during 2013, with the Group using the power of 
the internet to directly market its products to consumers, utilising 
internally generated mailing lists as well as via intermediaries such 
as Rightmove and Zoopla. Over 70% of customer enquires originate 
via the web.
IT connectivity is provided to the sales operations, enabling efficient 
and effective customer communication and the utilisation of an 
integrated CRM system. The selling process is supported by the 
Group’s bespoke prospect management system, which delivers 
on-site technology whilst integrating the Group’s prospect database 
with brochure fulfilment.
Employee diversity
The following table shows the gender split within the Group as  
at 31 December 2013. At Bovis Homes, 65% of the workforce is 
male, a relatively common proportion in the construction and 
housebuilding industries. While a lower proportion of senior 
management and directors are female, the Group encourages  
and supports gender diversity. As at 31 December 2013, there  
were five senior managers (all male) who were directors of  
Group subsidiaries.

Structure
In anticipation of increasing activity levels in 2014 and beyond,  
the Group is now operating from six regions in two divisions with  
plans for two further regions to become operational in the 
foreseeable future (previously the Group operated through a three 
region structure). This new structure will provide the Group with a 
business capacity of between 4,000 and 5,000 homes per annum, 
whilst maintaining close alignment to the localities in which it 
operates with significant local knowledge. The geographical focus 
of the Group remains exactly as before, being in the south of 
England and in prime locations in the midlands and northwest. 
Although this change will lead to a limited increase in the Group’s 
overhead expenditure in absolute terms, overhead efficiency is 
expected to continue to improve in 2014 and beyond.
The two divisions, South and Central, are led by Divisional 
Managing Directors, Malcolm Pink and Keith Carnegie respectively. 
The strength and experience of the Group’s existing senior 
management is demonstrated by six of the eight regional managing 
directors being internal appointments.
The Board
Colin Holmes has decided to retire from the Board at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 May 2014 after seven 
and a half years as a non-executive director and seven years as 
Remuneration Committee chairman. The Board would like to thank 
Colin for his valuable contribution during his time on the Board. 
Alastair Lyons will succeed as Remuneration Committee chairman 
following the AGM.
Market conditions
Housing market conditions improved materially during 2013.  
An increase in the number of mortgage products including a 
greater availability of high loan to value mortgages has supported  
a greater number of housing transactions. Bank of England 
mortgage approvals statistics show a significant increase during  
the second half of 2013 with monthly figures approaching a level 
more reflective of a healthy housing market.
Homebuyer confidence appears to have improved materially 
with more positive views on the future direction of house prices, 
employment and security of earnings. With this improving 
backdrop, trading conditions are expected to remain broadly 
positive during 2014, supporting sales rates and sales prices. 
House prices have been rising at a modest rate across many 
regional markets with stronger rises in the south of England, offset 
by more modest changes in the midlands and north of England.  
As expected, with activity and sales prices rising, the cost of 
building houses is also rising as material suppliers enjoy increased 
demand for their products and subcontractors see an ability to 
increase rates.
The Government’s Help to Buy shared equity product, launched in 
April 2013, has provided strong impetus to the new build industry, 
supporting first time buyers in particular. The Help to Buy mortgage 
indemnity product was also launched in Q4 2013 and, given it 
assists not just new build customers, the Group considers this 
Government backed product to be further support to activity in the 
wider housing market.
As a result of the positive activity in the housing market, the 
support provided to banks to facilitate cost effective mortgage 
lending via the Government’s Funding for Lending Scheme is  
being withdrawn. The Group views this development positively, as 
it signals that the mortgage market is beginning to operate more 
effectively without assistance. Current trading
The Group entered 2014 with a forward sales order position of 
1,377 homes, a 77% improvement on the 778 homes brought 
forward at the start of 2013. Of these, 692 were private homes 
(2013: 249) and 685 were social (2013: 529).
The Group has delivered 468 private reservations in the 
first seven weeks of 2014 (2013: 285), an increase of 64%. 
Operating from an average of 93 active sales outlets during this 
period (2013: 90), the Group has achieved a sales rate per site 
per week of 0.72, a 60% improvement on the 0.45 achieved in 
the comparable period in 2013. Sales prices achieved on these 
private reservations to date have been ahead of the Group’s 
expectations by circa 2%.
As at 21 February 2014, the Group held 1,875 sales for legal 
completion in 2014, as compared to 1,064 sales at the same 
point in 2013, an increase of 76%. Of these, private sales 
amounted to 1,160 homes (2013: 534), with social housing 
sales of 715 homes (2013: 530).
Build to Rent scheme – private rental sector
In 2012, the Government announced its Build to Rent scheme, 
with the intention of providing funding support to assist in 
the establishment of PRS vehicles. Whilst not yet contracted, 
the Group has agreed terms and is at an advanced stage in 
finalising agreements to deliver new homes under two separate 
PRS transactions on sites owned by the Group, each using 
support from the Government’s scheme.
The two transactions involve approximately 500 homes, of 
which circa 250 would legally complete in 2014 with the 
remainder in 2015. The profit delivery combined with the 
acceleration of capital turn enabled by these transactions would 
act as a further positive contributor to increasing the Group’s 
return on capital employed in both 2014 and 2015.
Outlook
The successful continued execution of the growth strategy in 
2013 has positioned the Group strongly to continue to grow  
in 2014 and beyond.
The sales achieved in 2014 to date combined with the expected 
growth in active sales outlets should enable the Group to 
deliver a strong increase in total reservations during 2014, 
assuming current market conditions continue. From these 
reservations excluding any potential volume arising from the 
PRS transactions (250 homes in 2014), the Group aims to 
deliver between 3,400 and 3,600 legal completions in 2014 
and a stronger forward order book for 2015.
This legal completion volume will represent major growth in 
the Group’s output and will require a material increase in build 
activity compared to 2013. During a period of constrained 
capacity in the material and labour supply markets, build costs 
for 2014 legal completions are expected to increase by between 
3% and 5%. However with a continuing tight focus on the 
Group’s operational performance, market rises in sales prices 
are expected to at least cover such cost increases.
The Group expects further growth in the proportion of legal 
completions from post downturn sites to increase both the 
average sales price and housing gross margin in 2014.  
When combined with improving overhead efficiency, the 
operating margin is expected to increase to approximately 17%.
With a clear focus on controlling the capital employed of the 
Group through management of the land bank and control 
of working capital, improving capital turn is expected to be 
at least 0.8 in 2014. Based on current market conditions 
continuing and excluding any potential volume arising for the 
PRS transactions, the Group expects to deliver a strong increase 
in return on capital employed to at least 14% in 2014 with the 
expectation of further progress thereafter.

Jonathan Hill 
Group Finance Director
The Group has delivered a strong financial 
performance, with profits and earnings 
growing significantly and with capital 
employed under control, delivering 
improved shareholder returns. At the same 
time the Group has maintained a prudent 
balance sheet position. 
Revenue
During 2013, the Group generated total revenue of £556.0 
million, an increase of 31% on the previous year (2012: 
£425.5 million).  Housing revenue in 2013 was £548.7 million, 
36% ahead of the prior year (2012: £402.0 million) and other 
income was £4.3 million (2012: £5.7 million). Land sales 
revenue, associated with one land sale and the recognition of 
deferred income on land sales legally completed in prior years, 
was £3 million in 2013, compared to three land sales achieved 
in 2012 with a total revenue of £17.8 million. 
Operating profit
The Group delivered a 46% increase in operating profit for  
the year ended 31 December 2013 to £82.8 million  
(2012*: £56.7 million) at an operating margin of 14.9% 
(2012*: 13.3%). Housing operating margin in 2013 was 
15.0% (2012: 12.7%) and reached 16.8% in the second  
half of 2013.
Housing gross margin increased to 23.5% in 2013 from 
22.6% in 2012. The gross margin benefited from the increased 
contribution from legal completions on sites acquired post the 
housing market downturn. As previously disclosed, the Group 
increased the promotional expenditure on strategic land by 
circa £3 million in 2013 over 2012, which held back the year 
on year margin growth. This level of cost incurred in 2013 to 
promote strategic land is expected to remain relatively stable 
during 2014.
The profit on land sales in 2013 was £0.1 million (2012 
benefited from a material profit of £4.8 million at a margin 
of 27%). Total gross profit was £130.3 million (gross margin: 
23.4%), compared with £96.9 million (gross margin: 22.8%) 
in 2012.
Overheads, including all sales and marketing costs, increased in 
2013 by 18%, as the Group invested early to support the large 
number of land assets acquired and the increased number 
of sales outlets. The overheads to revenue ratio improved to 
8.5% in 2013 from 9.5% in 2012*.
Profit before tax and earnings per share
Profit before tax increased by 48% to £78.8 million, 
comprising operating profit of £82.8 million, net financing 
charges of £4.3 million and a profit from joint ventures of 
£0.3 million. This compares to £53.2 million of profit before 
tax in 2012* , comprising £56.7 million of operating profit, 
£3.7 million of net financing charges and a profit from joint 
ventures of £0.2 million. Basic earnings per share for the year 
improved by 49% to 44.9p compared to 30.2p in 2012*.
Financing
Net financing charges during 2013 were £4.3 million  
(2012*: £3.7 million). Net bank charges were £3.5 million 
(2012: £2.6 million), as a result of higher net debt during 2013 
compared to 2012. The Group incurred a £3.1 million finance 
charge (2012: £3.1 million charge), reflecting the imputed 
interest on land bought on deferred terms. The Group also 
benefited from a finance credit of £2.3 million (2012: £1.7 
million) arising from the unwinding of the discount on its 
available for sale financial assets during 2013. There were  
£0.3 million of other financing credits during 2012.
Taxation
The Group has recognised a tax charge of £18.7 million at an 
effective tax rate of 23.7% (2012*: tax charge of £13.1 million 
at an effective rate of 24.5%). The Group has a current tax 
liability of £9.2 million in its balance sheet as at 31 December 
2013 (2012*: current tax liability of £5.7 million).

 Our performance 
Financial review Dividends
Given the ongoing material improvement in the Group’s 
performance and the confidence of the Board in the continued 
delivery of the Group’s strategy, the Board has proposed a 2013 
final dividend of 9.5p per share. This dividend will be paid on 23 
May 2014 to holders of ordinary shares on the register at the close 
of business on 28 March 2014. The dividend reinvestment plan 
gives shareholders the opportunity to reinvest their dividends in 
ordinary shares.
Combined with the interim dividend paid of 4.0p, the dividend 
for the full year totals 13.5p compared to a total of 9.0p paid in 
2012, an increase of 50%. The Board expects to grow dividends 
progressively as earnings per share increase.
Net assets
As at 31 December 2013 net assets of £810.3 million were  
£51.5 million higher than at the start of the year. Inventories 
increased during the year by £107.4 million to £971.0 million. 
The value of residential land, the key component of inventories, 
increased by £84.2 million, as the Group invested ahead of usage. 
At the end of 2013, the remaining provision held against land 
carried at net realisable value was £19.9 million, after utilisation 
of £8.7 million during the year. Other movements in inventories 
were an increase in work in progress of £29.5 million, offset by a 
decrease in part exchange properties of £6.3 million.
Trade and other receivables reduced by £23.1 million, with a 
reduction in debtors related to land sales of £12.7 million and 
lower amounts owing from housing associations. Available for  
sale financial assets held as current assets at 2012 year end of  
£7.2 million, relating to units held in an investment fund into 
which the Group sold show home properties, were fully recovered 
during 2013. Trade and other payables totalling £242.6 million 
(2012: £249.3 million) comprised land creditors of £123.8 million 
(2012: £123.8 million) and trade and other creditors of  
£118.8 million (2012: £125.5 million). Net assets per share  
as at 31 December 2013 were 604p (2012: 567p).
Pensions
Taking into account the latest estimates provided by the Group’s 
actuarial advisors, the Group’s pension scheme on an IAS19R  
basis had a surplus of £3.2 million at 31 December 2013  
(2012*: deficit of £3.2 million). Scheme assets grew over the year 
to £94.7 million from £85.2 million and the scheme liabilities 
increased to £91.5 million from £88.4 million. Scheme assets 
benefited from a £2.8 million special cash contribution made by 
the Group in December 2013.
As at 30 June 2013, an actuarial valuation was undertaken on 
behalf of the pension scheme trustee, which showed a deficit 
of £12.8 million at that date. The difference to the IAS19R basis 
results from more conservative assumptions on discount rate and 
mortality, as well as the additional special cash contribution of 
£2.8 million made during December 2013. A new schedule of 
contributions is in the process of being agreed between the Group 
and the pension scheme trustee.
Net cash and cash flow
Having started the year with a net cash balance of £18.8 million, 
the Group generated an operating cash inflow before land 
expenditure of £204 million (2012: £130 million), demonstrating 
the strong underlying cash generation from the Group’s existing 
assets. Net cash payments for land investment were £203 million 
(2012: £139 million). Non-trading cash outflow was £38 million.  
As at 31 December 2013 the Group’s net debt balance was  
£18.0 million with £12.0 million of cash in hand, offset by a  
drawn term loan of £25.0 million, £4.8 million of loans received 
from the Government and £0.2 million being the fair value of an 
interest rate swap. 
At the 31 December 2013, the Group had in place a committed 
revolving credit facility of £175 million, of which £50 million 
expires in December 2015 and £125 million in March 2017. 
Additionally the Group had a fully drawn three year term loan of 
£25 million, repayable in January 2016.
Financial risk and liquidity
The Group largely sees three categories of financial risk: interest 
rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Currency risk is not a 
consideration as the Group trades exclusively in the UK.
With regard to interest rate risk, the Group from time to time  
will enter into hedge instruments to ensure that the Group’s 
exposure to excessive fluctuations in floating rate borrowings is 
adequately hedged. The Group does not have a defined policy for 
interest rate hedging.

Credit risk is largely mitigated by the fact that the Group’s 
sales are generally made on completion of a legal contract at 
which point monies are received in return for transfer of title. 
During 2013, the Group made a limited number of sales with 
the provision of a shared equity investment by the Group as 
a key part of the Group’s sales incentive packages, either via 
the Government ‘FirstBuy’ scheme or via the Group’s own 
‘Jumpstart’ scheme. This has led to a limited increase in the 
size of the Group’s long term receivable Available for Sale 
Financial Asset balance which at 31 December 2013 was  
£44.8 million versus £43.9 million at 31 December 2012. 
Whilst this does represent an increase in credit risk in total, 
each individual credit exposure is small given the high number 
of counter parties. On average, individual shared equity 
exposure amounts to £21,000 (2012: £20,000).
Details of the Group’s financing arrangements are included on 
page 27. The Group regards this new facility as adequate in 
terms of both flexibility and liquidity to cover its medium term 
cash flow needs.
Financial reporting
The Group has adopted IAS19 (Revised 2011) “Employee 
Benefits”, which outlines the accounting requirements for 
employee benefits. The application of IAS19 (Revised 2011)  
has resulted in the interest cost and expected return  
on assets being replaced by a net interest charge/credit  
on the net defined benefit pension liability/ surplus.  
Certain costs previously recorded as part of finance costs 
or other comprehensive income have now been presented 
within administrative expenses. The comparative period has 
been restated with profit being £0.7 million lower and other 
comprehensive income £0.7 million higher including the tax 
impact of the changes. The impact on both basic and diluted 
earnings per share was a reduction of 0.5 pence. The Group 
records actuarial adjustments immediately so there has been 
no effect on the prior year pension deficit.
Other than IAS19R, there have been no changes to the 
Group’s accounting policies. These accounting policies  
will be disclosed in full within the Group’s forthcoming 
financial statements.

Economic environment
Economic 
recession 
reducing 
consumer 
demand
t
Continued uncertainty in the global 
economy and particularly the Euro 
area adversely affects consumer 
confidence and demand for new 
homes, with consequential impact 
on revenues, profits and potentially 
asset carrying values.
•  Close monitoring of lead indicators in the housing 
market, notably visitors to sales outlets, sales rates  
and ASP.
•  Managing build rates against sales activity.
•  Maintaining a rigorous approach to land acquisition, 
with spend focused in the south of England, where the 
economy is expected to remain more robust.
•  A cautious gearing position with a conservatively 
structured balance sheet is retained.
Political environment
Changes in 
Government 
policy towards 
the housing 
market affecting 
supply or 
demand
s
Changes to Government policies, 
which affect demand ranging from 
policies indirectly affecting consumer 
confidence (such as taxation levels) 
to direct policies such as Help to 
Buy, may affect demand, and thus 
revenues, profits and potentially 
asset carrying values.
Additionally changes to Government 
policies which affect supply, 
particularly planning, may have an 
impact on the Group’s ability to 
prosecute its growth strategy.
•  Proactive engagement with Government, both directly 
and through industry bodies, primarily the HBF.
•  See mitigations above for demand issues.
 
•  Proactive engagement with Government, both directly 
and through industry bodies, primarily the HBF.
•  Maintenance of land bank of at least 4 years to mitigate 
against short term changes.
Mortgage finance
Limited 
mortgage 
availability 
to new home 
buyers
t
The availability of mortgage finance, 
particularly deposit requirements 
for first time buyers, is fundamental 
to customer demand. Further 
restrictions on mortgages granted 
could reduce demand for homes and 
therefore revenues and profits.
•  Investing in land more suited to traditional homes, with 
reduced focus on the first time buyer.
•  Providing a range of purchase assistance schemes to 
our customers. 
•  Continually innovating to find additional ways to assist 
customers to purchase a home.
Land procurement
Insufficient 
investment in 
land to support 
business strategy
=
Expansion of the business and  
the delivery of the Group’s strategy 
to improve shareholder returns  
from the development of land is 
curtailed, with existing activity levels 
compromised.
•  Clearly defined strategy and geographical focus.
•  Rigorous due diligence for land acquisition to preserve 
defined hurdle rates.
•  Regular review of the pipeline of new land purchases.
•  Investment in procurement and promotion of strategic 
land opportunities.
•  Maintaining larger land bank to deal with periods of 
reduced investment. The availability of mortgage finance and customer deposit 
requirements are the key issues currently facing the Group
Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  31
As the activities of the Group evolve, the nature of the risks on which it is focused change. For instance, as the Group has acquired land 
successfully, the operational risk shifts to the progression of these sites into the build and sales phase, with the challenges of gaining 
detailed planning and of operationally gearing up the Group to increase build and sales activity. With sales conditions improving, risks 
move to our people and the stresses within the supply chain.

Dear Shareholder,
Bovis Homes made demonstrable progress during 2013, delivering 
a further significant improvement in returns, a continuation of 
substantial land investment and a materially increased forward order 
book for 2014. I am excited by the Group’s growth strategy and 
the progress that has been made against a backdrop of improving 
market conditions. The foundations are in place that will help to 
drive growth for the future. 
Corporate governance report
  Ian Tyler
Chairman
I am delighted to introduce my first Corporate Governance 
Report, following my appointment as Chairman at the end 
of November 2013. Bovis Homes has a reputation for high 
standards of corporate governance, which enables the  
Board to function effectively in supporting and monitoring  
senior management in the implementation of strategy.  
Strong growth is being delivered and this is translating into 
increased shareholder returns. I am excited and optimistic about 
the future at Bovis Homes and have learnt a great deal about 
the way it delivers value during my formal tailored induction 
and through discussions with the other directors and senior 
management. These discussions have reinforced my perception 
of good corporate governance as a strength at Bovis Homes, and 
my first Board and Committee meetings confirmed my view of a 
strong Board and a well managed Group. 
This report has been prepared and approved by the Board.  
On behalf of the Board, I confirm that during 2013 your 
Company was compliant with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”), with the exception that a 
performance evaluation of the previous Chairman, Malcolm 
Harris, was not carried out at the end of the year, given the 
timing of his retirement from the Board. The Company remains 
compliant with the Code in all other respects. I personally carried 
out the 2013 Board performance evaluation, which enabled me 
to gain first-hand knowledge of recent performance and valuable 
insights for the future. Further information is provided on page 
36 including the outcomes that we will be pursuing during 2014. 
2013 saw the full range of Board activities from review and 
challenge of strategy, including our strategy day, to presentations 
from regional management, site visits and review of succession 
planning for both our non-executive directors and executives. 
The non-executive directors provided constructive challenge and 
assisted in developing strategy and proposals put forward by 
the executive directors and the balance of non-executive and 
executive directors worked well. Board meetings were again held 
in all of the operating regions during the year and included open 
discussion with management teams on land acquisitions, new 
sales outlets and progress with their objectives.
There were no changes in our corporate governance best 
practice during 2013. During the year, the Board reviewed its 
policy on diversity, without making any substantive changes to 
the published version, which states that we will always make 
appointments to the Board based on merit. 
I would like to thank my colleagues on the Board for their warm 
and open welcome and I look forward to their collective support 
and strong individual contributions during the coming year.  
My predecessor, Malcolm Harris, retired from the Board at the 
end of November 2013 after five and a half years as Chairman, 
having been Chief Executive for twelve years, and the Board 
would like to recognise and thank him for his enormous 
contribution to Bovis Homes. On behalf of the Board, I would 
also like to thank Colin Holmes, who is retiring at the AGM after 
seven years as Remuneration Committee Chairman, both for his 
valuable contribution in this role and as a non-executive director. 
Bovis Homes values its dialogue with all our shareholders, 
whether in meetings and presentations during the year or at  
our AGM. I look forward to meeting as many major shareholders 
as possible during the year. Our 2014 AGM will be held on  
16 May 2014 and you will find the Notice at the end of this 
Annual Report. I look forward to chairing my first AGM and 
meeting shareholders that can attend.

Introduction
This report sets out the Company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (publicly available at www.frc.org.
uk) and also describes how the governance framework, set out 
in the annex to this report, is applied.
The Board is pleased to report that the Company has, 
throughout 2013, complied with and applied the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, as set out below, with 
the exception that a performance evaluation of the outgoing 
Chairman was not completed at the end of 2013 as a result of 
his retirement from the Board towards the year end.
The Board
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for 
the long-term success of the Group and its strategy, values and 
governance. It provides leadership, sets the Group’s strategic 
objectives and approves and monitors progress with business 
plans, budgets and forecasts, applying independent judgment. 
The schedule of matters reserved for the Board is reviewed and 
approved annually by the Board and a copy is available on the 
Company’s website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/investor-centre/
corporate-governance).
 The governance structure in 2013 is shown below.
Throughout the year and up to the date of this report, the 
Board comprised the Chairman, who is non-executive, three 
independent non-executives and two executive directors.  
On 29 November 2013, Malcolm Harris retired from the 
Board and Ian Tyler was appointed as the new non-executive 
Chairman. Ian was considered independent by the Board on 
appointment, which followed a recommendation from the 
Nomination Committee. 
A formal, comprehensive and tailored induction was provided, 
including visits to the regions and meetings with senior 
management. 
Biographical details for the directors are provided on page 32. 
Their dates of appointment / retirement, length of service to 
the end of 2013 and attendance at Board meetings in 2013 are 
shown below.

The Board benefits from a broad range of expertise and experience 
and has a strong blend of skills, which has allowed it to perform 
effectively to a high level during 2013. The new non-executive 
Chairman brings a strong track record of commercial experience 
in construction and infrastructure related industries which are 
expected to benefit the Group in the ongoing execution of its 
growth strategy. 
The three non-executive directors have been determined by the 
Board to be independent in character and judgement with no 
relationships or circumstances likely to affect, or that could appear 
to affect, their judgement. 
In accordance with the Code, all the directors will be offering 
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM, with the 
exception of Colin Holmes who has decided to retire from the 
Board at the AGM. The Board strongly supports all the individual 
director’s re-elections, taking account of the balance of skills and 
expertise and the performance of the Board as a whole. 
All the directors have service agreements or contracts and the 
details are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 47.  
A further term for John Warren running until the AGM in 2015  
was approved by the Board on 21 January 2014. 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and as permitted by 
the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board has authorised 
an actual conflict of interest and reviews annually a number of 
potential conflicts of interest. The Board is satisfied that powers to 
authorise actual and potential conflicts are operating effectively.
As mentioned in the Nomination Committee report, a progressive 
and orderly refreshing of the Board through to 2015 and beyond 
is underway, led by the new Chairman, and diversity is one 
consideration as part of this process.
Board meetings
There were eight meetings during 2013. The Board maintains and 
reviews a rolling agenda plan, which ensures that all key issues 
and matters reserved to the Board are discussed at the appropriate 
time. The Chairman reviews draft meeting agendas with the CEO 
and Company Secretary and the Company Secretary maintains a 
schedule of matters arising which is reviewed at each meeting.
The Board receives a comprehensive electronic meeting pack a 
week in advance of each meeting plus any other information 
required to enable it to discharge its duties. Meetings are conducted 
in an atmosphere of open discussion and debate, which enables the 
non-executive directors to challenge and test the strategy, policy 
and proposals put forward by the executive directors. 
At each Board meeting during 2013:
•  the CEO provided a review of business and current trading 
performance, recent developments and strategic issues.
•  the GFD provided a financial review, including results and latest 
projections, budgets, forecasts, Group KPIs and an analysis of 
share price valuation and movements.
•  the Board received regular reports covering health and safety, 
customer satisfaction, major shareholdings, litigation and  
human resources.
At particular points in the year, the Board reviewed:
•  strategy, management of risk, financial statements and regulatory 
announcements, dividend policy and bank facility refinancing. 
•  use of information technology and the marketing programme.
•  succession planning and the outcome of the 2012 Board 
performance evaluation. 
The Board also reviewed other topics, such as the market 
environment, land acquisitions, land sales, analysis of competitors, 
investor and analyst feedback, and regulatory and governance 
developments.
Four meetings were held in London and four were held in the 
regions, providing the opportunity to meet and interact with 
local management teams. Each of the three regions provided a 
presentation to the Board at these meetings and question and 
answer sessions followed. One meeting was preceded by an 
informal evening meeting with the Group Executive Committee (the 
senior management below the Board) and the Board also met its 
members at other points in the year. Visits to sites and sales outlets, 
including product viewings, took place in each of the three regions.
The annual strategy day in July provided the Board with the 
opportunity for an in-depth review of the immediate and longer 
term strategy for the Group and was preceded by an informal 
evening meeting with external guests. 
The previous and current Chairmen also held meetings with the 
non-executive directors without the executives present. 36  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Our governance
Corporate governance report
Board performance evaluation
The Board undertook an internal formal evaluation of its own 
performance towards the end of 2013. This started with a 
questionnaire designed to assess performance and ongoing 
effectiveness across key areas in 2013 and to maintain visibility 
on progress and outcomes since the 2011 external performance 
evaluation. It was followed by an interview process, conducted 
by the new Chairman with the directors, which explored and 
expanded on the views expressed.
A report was then presented to the Board and discussed.  
The overall conclusion was positive. The Board continues to 
operate effectively, with meetings being held in an atmosphere 
of open discussion and challenge, which facilitates debate 
and decision making. A common sense of purpose, strong 
communication and positive relationships were maintained 
during 2013. The broad range of expertise and experience 
amongst the non-executive directors is a key strength and the 
size and structure of the Board was thought appropriate for 
the current business. Future succession planning will include 
consideration of Board diversity, whilst looking to maintain the 
strengths on the Board.
The Board undertook the first external independent performance 
evaluation towards the end of 2011. This was conducted by 
Independent Audit (who have no other connection with  
the Company) using a document review, followed by an 
interview process. Priority action items were addressed during 
2012 and during 2013 ongoing progress with secondary action 
items was kept under review. Following the internal formal 
evaluation completed in 2012 the Board:
• increased focus on specific strategic issues
•  reviewed the risk appetite and selected past investment 
decisions,
•  continued to review the composition of the Board, including 
through the Nomination Committee
•  increased its knowledge of alternative business models and 
their relative performance.
Individual director assessments were carried out by the new 
Chairman towards the end of 2013, using a discussion and 
interview process which covered overall understanding of 
the business, effectiveness of contribution and challenge, 
communications, time commitments and training and 
development. The outcomes showed that all the directors are 
contributing effectively and are demonstrating commitment to 
their roles.
As explained in the introduction, a 2013 performance 
evaluation of the outgoing Chairman was not carried out as  
a result of his retirement from the Board at the end of 
November 2013. A performance evaluation of the new 
Chairman will be led by the Senior Independent Director at  
the end of 2014.
Board committees
The Board is supported by standing Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees and their memberships, roles and 
activities are set out in separate reports: Audit Committee on 
pages 62 and 63, Nomination Committee on page 64, and 
Remuneration Committee on pages 43 to 61. Each Committee 
reports to and has terms of reference approved by the Board 
and the minutes of Committee meetings are circulated to and 
are reviewed by the Board. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by John Warren, the 
Remuneration Committee is chaired by Colin Holmes and 
the Nomination Committee is chaired by Ian Tyler. With the 
retirement of Colin Holmes at the AGM, Alastair Lyons will be 
appointed chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Board completed a performance evaluation of its 
Committees during 2013 and it was concluded that they were 
contributing and functioning effectively and all were achieving 
their respective remits.
Focus areas Objectives for 2014
Strategy •   Continue to increase the Board’s focus on specific strategic issues, including early discussion planning 
input from the non-executivies for the strategy day.
Board meetings • Further increase engagement with regional management teams on visits to the regions.
Succession planning •   Continue to focus on non-executive succession planning, and to review the composition of the Board, 
including skills, experience and with regard to diversity.
Market conditions •  Further improve non-executive visibility of changing market trends and anticipated changes in 
operational performance.

Governance supporting the business
The Board aims to meet governance best practice where it fits our 
business and further details are set out below.
Amongst matters reserved for the Board are leadership of the 
Group, approval of strategy and budgets, oversight of operations 
and performance, capital structure, financial reporting, internal 
controls and approval of major expenditure and transactions. 
The Board has approved a written division of responsibilities 
between the non-executive Chairman and the Chief Executive  
and the role of the non-executive Deputy Chairman has been 
similarly defined. 
The Chairman is primarily responsible for:
•  the effective working of the Board, 
•  taking a leading role in determining the Board’s composition 
and structure, and
•  ensuring that effective communications are maintained with 
shareholders. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
•  the operational management of the Group,
•  developing strategic operating plans and presenting them to the 
Board, and
• the implementation of strategy agreed by the Board.
The Deputy Chairman supports the Chairman in ensuring that 
the Board is effective and constructive relations are maintained, 
in addition to acting as the Senior Independent Director, in 
which capacity he leads the annual performance evaluation of 
the Chairman and provides an additional point of contact for 
shareholders.
The Company’s Management Paper is subject to regular  
Board review. It contains appropriate controls, authorities and 
procedures across the range of the Group’s activities and includes 
the authorities and decision making delegated by the Board  
to management.
The advice and services of the Group Company Secretary 
are available to the directors. All directors have access to the 
Company’s professional advisers and can seek independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. No such advice was 
sought during the year.
Training is made available to directors when required and the 
Chairman is responsible for ensuring that directors continually 
update and refresh their knowledge and skills and familiarity with 
the Company, as appropriate to their role on the Board and on 
Board Committees. During 2013 the directors received governance, 
regulatory and technical updates.
The Company has an insurance policy in place which insures 
directors against certain liabilities, including legal costs.
Information on share capital is provided on page 67.
Shareholder engagement
The Company has a comprehensive investor relations programme, 
which allows the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director to 
regularly engage with our major shareholders. In addition to one-
to-one meetings through the year, the Company holds a series of 
presentations and meetings following the announcement of the 
final and half-yearly results. These presentations are made publicly 
available so that all shareholders can access them on the Group’s 
website at www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk. 
At the beginning of June 2013, the Company hosted an analyst 
and investor visit to its sales outlets at Filton, which included a site 
tour, product viewings and a presentation focused on progress 
in delivering strategy. Regional management attended and were 
available for discussion and the event was well received. 
The Board reviews feedback on investor relations meetings, visits 
and presentations, including the matters communicated and 
discussed. During 2013, the feedback was positive and helpful to 
the Board.
The Board also values other channels to obtain shareholders’ views. 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all directors are 
aware of any issues or concerns that major shareholders may have. 
In addition, the Deputy Chairman (also the Senior Independent 
Director) is accessible to shareholders. During the year, the previous 
Chairman and the Deputy Chairman met with the Group’s largest 
shareholder for discussion, which included Chairman succession. 
The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and the other non-executive 
directors attend analyst and investor presentations, giving major 
shareholders the opportunity to put their views and hold discussion 
with them.
All shareholders are invited to attend the Company’s AGM, which 
this year will be held on 16 May 2014. The full Board, including  
all Committee chairmen, attend and it values this meeting as a 
means of communicating with private investors and encourages 
their participation. All shareholders have the opportunity to  
exercise their right to vote and can appoint proxies if they are 
unable to attend. To facilitate this we provide an electronic  
voting facility. Shareholders attending the AGM have the 
opportunity to ask questions relevant to the business of the  
meeting and hear the views of other shareholders before voting. 
After the meeting the results of voting on all resolutions are 
published on the Group’s website. 38  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Our governance
Corporate governance report
Additional information
Risk management and internal control
The Code states that a board is responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing 
to take in achieving its strategic objectives. The Board has 
agreed that this important principle should form part of its 
consideration of strategy and all major decisions. The Board 
also has responsibility for maintaining sound risk management 
and internal control systems and, whilst monitoring and review 
forms part of the work undertaken by the Audit Committee, 
the Board is ultimately responsible for the management  
of risk. Risk is a regular agenda item, which allows all directors 
to review the quality of risk management processes, risk 
mitigation and the risk appetite. 
The Board has complied with Principle C.2 of the Code by 
establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the risks that are considered significant by the 
Company, in accordance with the FRC’s “Internal Control: 
Guidance to Directors”. This process has been in place for 
the period under review and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report and Accounts and includes compliance 
with provision C.2.1. It is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Monitoring is 
based principally on reviewing reports from Internal Audit and 
from management and covers all controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management 
processes. The Board operates a robust process of risk reporting 
and has clear procedures for identification and monitoring of 
key risks.
The Audit Committee reviews the system of internal control 
and risk management systems annually and reports its findings 
to the Board. It receives reports from the internal and external 
auditors and management which assess the effectiveness 
of internal control and risk management and make 
recommendations for improvements.
Risk assessment
As the activities of the Group evolve and grow, the nature of 
the risks on which it focuses evolve. A key part of the system 
of internal control is the maintenance of the risk analysis 
and matrix, compiled using the risk universe as the basis of 
identification and a process of evaluation that distils the impact 
of key risks, mitigation measures and residual risk for Board 
review, leading to assessment of changing risk tolerance and, 
ultimately, the risk appetite. During 2013, a full risk review and 
an interim risk review took place. In setting its approach, the 
Board aims to ensure that the Company is neither prevented 
from taking opportunities nor exposed to unreasonable risk.
Control framework 
The Group maintains a control environment, which is regularly 
reviewed by the Board. As new procedures and working 
practices are adopted, risk factors are reviewed and internal 
controls embedded into systems. The principal elements of 
the control environment include regular board meetings, the 
regional structure, defined operating controls and authorisation 
limits, an Internal Audit function and a comprehensive financial 
reporting system.
There are a number of elements of the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems that are specifically related to the 
Group’s financial reporting process:
•  there is a well understood management structure which 
allows for clear accountability and an appropriately granular 
level of financial control.
•  the structure is underpinned by documented authority 
levels for business transactions laid out in the Group’s 
Management Paper.
•  the process is further supported by process documents for 
both internal management reporting and external Group 
reporting which stipulates amongst other things reporting 
timetables and contents of key management reports.
The Group maintains computer systems that record financial 
transactions and whose effectiveness is reviewed by the Internal 
Audit function on a regular basis. Any findings arising from 
these exercises are reported to the Audit Committee.
Control over cash expenditure, which lies at the heart of any 
financial reporting process, is key. The Group maintains tight 
control in this area through a centralised Group payment 
function, regularly maintained authorisation documents and 
segregation of authorisation accountability.
The Group maintains a regular weekly and monthly financial 
reporting cycle, allowing management to assess the financial 
progress of the Group. This is further supported by a formal 
budget and forecast process which ensures that there is a 
robust and relatively recent financial forecast in place at all 
times against which to assess performance. Together with this 
financial reporting, the Group requires its regional management 
teams to report key business issues as part of a monthly 
regional reporting pack on a standardised basis.
Finally, there is a process of accounts preparation which ensures 
that there is an audit trail between the output from the Group’s 
financial reporting system and the Group’s financial statements 
as they are prepared for reporting.
Our governance Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for 
the foreseeable future. These enquiries consist of the production 
and review of detailed financial forecasts covering the period 
January 2014 to December 2016. These forecasts take into account 
current market trends with reasonable judgements and estimates 
applied to arrive at future cash flow estimates. As part of this 
review, the Group has analysed its forecast covenant compliance 
over this period linked to its banking facility, arriving at an 
assessment of the headroom evident between the forecast  
covenant test outcomes and the outcomes necessary to achieve 
covenant compliance. 
The Group entered into a new banking arrangement on  
29 January 2013. This arrangement provides a committed revolving 
credit facility with a limit of £125 million maturing in March 2017 
and a three year term loan of £25 million maturing in January 2016.  
On 23 August 2013, the limit for the committed revolving credit 
facility was increased by £50 million until 31 December 2015.  
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had no drawings under  
the £175 million revolving credit facility, and had net debt of  
£18 million. 
The Group regards the new banking arrangement as adequate 
in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its needs, particularly as the 
committed facility was increased by £50 million as recently as 
August 2013. More details on the Group’s approach to financial 
risk management are laid out in note 4.6. For these reasons, the 
Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
its accounts.

Corporate governance report
These guidelines have been adopted by the Board 
and provide guidance on how corporate governance 
principles are applied by the Company. 
1 Board membership and balance
The composition of the Board is reviewed on a regular 
basis to ensure that it remains appropriate for the 
successful direction of the business activities of the Group. 
Consideration is given to boardroom diversity and the mix 
of experience, skills, ability and vision of executive and non-
executive directors by the Nomination Committee. 
The Nomination Committee and the Board give regular 
consideration to planning for succession to Board and 
senior management positions, ensuring that appropriate 
management development measures are in place. The Board 
currently comprises the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman (also 
the Senior Independent Director), two further independent 
non-executive directors and two executive directors.
2 Board selection
The Board receives recommendations on the appointment 
of directors from the Nomination Committee, following an 
evaluation of the balance of knowledge, skills, experience 
and diversity available on the Board. This Board committee 
comprises the independent non-executive directors, the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive and meets as required in 
considering proposed changes to Board membership.
3 Non-executive director independence
The non-executive directors are independent in character and 
judgement and free from any business or other relationship 
which could affect or appear to affect the exercise of their 
independent judgement on matters under consideration 
by the Board. The receipt of fair remuneration and being a 
shareholder is not considered to prejudice independence or 
prevent a non-executive director from acting independently.
4 Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and 
there is a clear division of responsibilities between the two 
roles which has been set out in writing and approved by  
the Board. It is normal practice for the role of Chairman to be 
a non-executive position. The role of the Deputy Chairman 
has also been set out in writing and approved by the Board.
5 Number of directors 
An appropriate balance between executive and non-
executive directors is maintained and the size of the Board 
is set as necessary to achieve this. The number of non-
executive directors is decided so as to provide the diversity 
of skills, ability, vision and experience necessary for a sound 
independent contribution to the Board and the successful 
management of the Group’s business. By way of guidance, 
at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, will comprise 
independent non-executive directors. 
6 Length of appointment
Executive directors are employed on service contracts with 
notice periods which do not exceed one year. Non-executive 
directors’ service agreements set the length of their 
appointments at periods of up to three years and their  
notice periods up to twelve months. Their total length of 
appointment would not normally exceed nine years from  
the date of their first AGM election. 
The renewal of service agreements after two three year 
terms is subject to rigorous review and based on annual 
re-appointment thereafter, with the third year of the third 
term extending until the next following AGM.
Under the Articles of Association, all directors are subject to

Remuneration report
Our governance Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the 2013 Directors’ remuneration report. 
It covers the remuneration of the executive and non-executive 
directors and is divided into two sections, as required by the new 
remuneration reporting regulations. The policy report contains the 
three year remuneration policy to be submitted to shareholders in a 
binding vote at the 2014 AGM and the annual remuneration report 
explains the application of the policy in 2013 and 2014.
Overview
In 2013 Bovis Homes again delivered significant revenue and 
profit growth. In the year, basic earnings per share rose by 49% 
and Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) reached 10.4% 
(2012: 7.7%). The Group also acquired significant levels of high 
quality consented land, entering 2014 well positioned to further 
improve returns for shareholders. 
The remuneration policy of the Group underpins the 
achievement of these results and the long term goals of the 
Group for the coming years. The policy remained unchanged 
in the period under review and will do so for 2014, with the 
exception of the proposed increase to maximum award levels for 
the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which are set out below.
Remuneration in 2013
For 2013, the strong performance against the stretching financial 
and operational targets resulted in 98% of maximum being 
awarded for the annual bonus. The year saw the achievement of 
strong pre-tax profit growth (+48%) and importantly the Return 
on Invested Capital also increased to 10.4%.
The LTIP awards granted in 2011 will see 50% of awards vest 
due to the earnings per share (“EPS”) performance condition 
being met in full. This demonstrates the strong EPS out-
performance of the Group over the past three financial years, 
against stretching targets, with absolute cumulative EPS reaching 
93.1 pence. The second half of the LTIP award, based on 
relative total shareholder return (“TSR”), will lapse given that the 
comparator group achieved a median TSR of 188% over the last 
three years. 
Changes in remuneration for 2014
The Board is optimistic about the future prospects of the Group 
and wants to ensure that the executive directors are fully 
motivated to ensure all the potential opportunities are fully 
realised for the benefit of its shareholders. The Remuneration 
Committee, as part of an overall review of executive 
remuneration policy, therefore focused on long term 
performance related pay to ensure it is appropriately set for 
the future. As a result, the Committee is proposing that the 
maximum award under the LTIP be increased from 100% to 
150% of salary for the Chief Executive and to 125% of salary 
for the Group Finance Director. 
All other terms of the LTIP will remain unchanged and vesting 
will ultimately be dependent on the achievement of stretching 
performance targets. A resolution will be put to shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM to approve this change. Given the importance 
of this proposal, I have consulted with the Group’s major 
shareholders, who have indicated their support, subject to 
stretching targets being set by the Committee.
The Committee also considered the scale of the roles performed 
by both the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director, 
deciding that it was appropriate to increase their base salaries by 
3.33% and 3.70% respectively with effect from the start  
of 2014. The Committee is confident that both the salary 
and LTIP award increases are fully justified and commercially 
appropriate for the Group. 
Conclusion
I do hope you find that this report clearly explains the 
remuneration approach adopted at Bovis Homes and enables you 
to appreciate how it underpins the business growth and returns 
strategy. The Committee considers the remuneration policy fair 
and fully aligned with the interests of shareholders and looks 
forward to your support for the associated AGM votes.
Lastly, I am stepping down from the Board at the AGM on  
16 May 2014, after seven years as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. The role of Committee chair will be 
taken on by Alastair Lyons, whose significant experience will 
be of great benefit to the position. In retiring from the Board, I 
would like to thank my colleagues and the Group’s shareholders 
for their support during my time at Bovis Homes.

Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are to set, review and approve the remuneration policy and to determine the remuneration 
packages (including incentive plans and their performance criteria) and any changes to service contracts of the Chairman, executive 
directors and other designated senior executives including the Group Company Secretary. The Committee’s terms of reference are available 
on the Company’s website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance).
The remuneration policy
The Committee’s remuneration policy is designed to provide a market competitive, performance-related package which supports and 
facilitates the delivery of the Company’s strategy and the creation of long-term shareholder value. This remuneration policy will be 
proposed for adoption at the 2014 AGM. If approved it will apply on a legislative basis immediately following shareholder approval on  
16 May 2014.
The Committee keeps the remuneration policy under review to ensure it promotes the attraction, retention and motivation of the high 
performing executive talent required to deliver the business strategy. It is required that the policy be put to shareholders for approval 
every three years. Should any changes be required before the end of a three year period, the amended policy will be put to shareholders, 
following shareholder consultation as appropriate.
Components of the remuneration framework for executive directors
The policy table below summarises the main components of the remuneration framework, as detailed further in the report, a large 
proportion of which is performance related.
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Fixed pay
Base salary
To attract and retain 
high performing talent 
required to deliver 
the business strategy, 
providing core reward 
for the role. 
Ordinarily reviewed annually.
The review typically considers 
competitive positioning, the 
individual’s role, experience and 
performance, business performance 
and salary increases throughout  
the Group.
Market benchmarking exercises 
are undertaken periodically 
and judgement is used in their 
application.
Whilst we do not consider it 
appropriate to set a maximum 
base salary level, any increases will 
take into account the individual’s 
skills, experience, performance, the 
external environment and the pay of 
employees throughout the Group.
Whilst generally the intention is to 
maintain a link with employee pay 
and conditions, in circumstances such 
as significant changes in responsibility 
or size and scope of role or 
progression in a role, higher increases 
may be awarded.
Thus, where a new director is 
appointed at a salary below market 
competitive levels to reflect initial 
experience, it may be increased 
over time subject to satisfactory 
performance and market conditions.
Not applicable.
Benefits
To provide market 
competitive benefits 
consistent with role. 
Benefits typically include medical 
insurance, life assurance, membership 
of the Bovis Homes Regulated Car 
Scheme for Employees or cash car 
allowance, annual leave, occupational 
sick pay, health screening, personal 
accident insurance, and participation 
in all employee share schemes 
(SAYE and SIP). In line with business 
requirements, other expenses may be 
paid, such as relocation expenses.
We do not consider it appropriate to 
set a maximum benefits value as this 
may change periodically.
Not applicable.
Pension
To attract and retain 
talent by enabling long 
term pension saving.
Executives joining the Group 
since January 2002 can choose to 
participate in a defined contribution 
arrangement, or may receive a cash 
equivalent. A salary supplement may 
also be paid as part of a pension 
allowance arrangement.
Executives who joined the Group 
prior to January 2002 can continue 
to participate in the defined benefit 
pension arrangement, which is closed 
to new members. 
A pension allowance of up to 
20% of base salary may be paid to 
include membership of a pension 
arrangement, with any balance 
payable as a salary supplement.
Not applicable.

Policy report
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Variable pay
Annual bonus
To incentivise and 
reward the delivery 
of near term business 
targets and objectives.
The annual bonus scheme is a 
discretionary scheme and is reviewed 
prior to the start of each financial 
year to ensure that it appropriately 
supports the business strategy.
Performance measures and stretching 
targets are set by the Committee.
Bonuses are normally paid in cash. 
In any year in which no dividend is 
proposed discretion may be exercised 
to pay part, or all, of the bonus  
in ordinary shares, deferred for  
two years.
Actual bonus amounts are 
determined by assessing performance 
against the agreed targets after 
the year end. The results are then 
reviewed to ensure that any bonus 
paid accurately reflects the underlying 
performance of the business.
The annual bonus scheme offers 
a maximum opportunity of up to 
100% of base salary. Achievement 
of stretching performance targets is 
required to earn the maximum. 
Performance measures are selected to 
focus executives on strategic priorities, 
providing alignment with shareholder 
interests and are reviewed annually.
Weightings and targets are reviewed and 
set at the start of each financial year.
Financial metrics will comprise at least 
70% of the bonus and are likely to 
include one or more of:
• a profit based measure
• a cash based measure
• a capital return measure
Non-financial metrics, key to business 
performance, will be used for the balance.
Below threshold performance delivers no 
bonus and target performance achieves a 
bonus of 50% of base salary.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
To incentivise, reward 
and retain executives 
over the longer term 
and align the interests 
of management and 
shareholders.
Typically, annual awards are made 
under the LTIP.
Performance is measured over a 
performance period of not less 
than three years. LTIP awards do 
not normally vest until the third 
anniversary of the date of the grant.
Awards may be granted with the 
benefit of dividend equivalents, so 
that vested shares are increased 
by the number of shares equal to 
dividends paid from the date of grant 
to the date of exercise. 
The maximum annual award, under 
normal circumstances, is as follows:
•  150% of base salary for the CEO. 
•  125% of base salary for the GFD.
In exceptional circumstances an 
award may be granted under the 
LTIP rules up to 200% of base salary. 
The performance measures applied to LTIP 
awards are reviewed annually to ensure 
they remain relevant to strategic priorities 
and aligned to shareholder interests. 
Weightings and targets are reviewed and 
set prior to each award.
Performance measures will include long 
term performance targets, of which 
relative TSR will comprise at least one 
third and financial performance metrics 
will comprise the balance.
Below threshold performance realises 0% 
of the total award, target performance 
realises 30% and maximum performance 
realises 100%.
Notes to the policy table
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take 
account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
There are no provisions for the recovery of sums paid. The Company does not operate malus or clawback because the majority of measures approved by 
the Committee are outcome measures. Flexibility is retained to amend bonus outcomes if they do not reflect business performance.
The executive directors may request and the Company may grant salary and bonus sacrifice arrangements.
The LTIP rules permit the substitution or variance of performance conditions to produce a fairer measure of performance as a result of an unforeseen event 
or transaction and include discretions for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement 
or voluntary winding up. Non-significant changes to the performance metrics may be made by use of discretion under the LTIP rules. Awards are normally 
satisfied in shares, although there is flexibility to settle in cash.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments) that are not in line with the policy table set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed:
(i) before the policy came into effect; or
(ii)  at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is “agreed” at the time the 
award is granted.
Performance measures for the annual bonus scheme and the LTIP are selected to focus the executive directors on strategic priorities, both short term and 
those related to long term sustainable performance, providing alignment with shareholder interests. Targets for each performance measure are then set  
by the Committee in light of strategic objectives over the short term for the annual bonus scheme and over at least a three year performance period for 
the LTIP. In setting targets the Committee takes into account a number of reference points including internal and analysts’ forecasts. 46  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Our governance

•  Minimum performance reflects base salary as at 1 January 2014 and benefits and pension paid in 2013 (2014 policy for the defined 
contribution arrangement) as set out in the single figure on page 50.
•  Target performance reflects base salary as at 1 January 2014, benefits and pension paid in 2013 (2014 policy for the defined 
contribution arrangement) as set out in the single figure on page 50, cash bonus at 50% of maximum and LTIP vesting at threshold of 
30% of maximum.
•  Maximum performance reflects base salary as at 1 January 2014, benefits and pension paid in 2013 (2014 policy for the defined 
contribution arrangement) as set out in the single figure on page 50, cash bonus at 100% of maximum and LTIP vesting at maximum 
of 100%.
•  No share price, dividends or discount rate assumptions have been included in the charts above.
Non-executive director and chairman fees
The Board, comprising the Chairman and the executive directors, sets the remuneration of the non-executive directors, without  
their participation. The Remuneration Committee, with the Chairman absenting himself from discussions, sets the remuneration of 
the Chairman who receives an all-inclusive fee. The level of fees must be within the limit approved by shareholders, contained in the 
Articles of Association. Non-executive directors and the Chairman do not participate in the annual bonus scheme or the LTIP and are 
not eligible to join the Group’s pension schemes. All non-executive director and chairman fees are payable in cash and there are no 
additional fees or other items in the nature of remuneration.
Purpose and link

Approach to recruitment
In agreeing a remuneration package for a new executive director, it would be expected that the structure and quantum of variable pay 
elements would reflect those set out in the policy table above. However, the Committee would retain the discretion to flex the balance 
between annual and long-term incentives and the measures used to assess performance for these elements, with the intention that a 
significant proportion would be delivered in shares. Salary would reflect the skills and experience of the individual, and may be set at a level 
to allow future progression to reflect performance in the role. 
On recruitment, relocation benefits may be paid as appropriate.
This overall approach would also apply to internal appointments, with the proviso that any commitments entered into before promotion 
which are inconsistent with this policy can continue to be honoured under the policy. Similarly, if an executive director is appointed following 
the Company’s acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured.
An executive director may initially be hired on a contract requiring 24 months’ notice which then reduces pro-rata over the first year of the 
contract to requiring 12 months’ notice.
The Committee may award compensation for the forfeiture of awards from a previous employer in such form as the Committee considers 
appropriate taking account of all relevant factors including the expected value of the award, performance achieved or likely to be achieved, 
the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award. There is no specific limit on the value of such awards, but 
the Committee’s intention is that the value awarded would be equivalent to the value forfeited.
Maximum variable pay will be in line with the maximum set out in the policy table above (excluding buy-outs). The Committee retains 
discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard Policy to meet the individual circumstances when:
•  An interim appointment is made to a fill an executive director role on a short-term basis.
•  Exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a non-executive director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis.
For non-executive directors, the Board would consider the appropriate fees for a new appointment taking into account the existing level 
of fees paid to the non-executive directors, the experience and ability of the new non-executive director and the time commitment and 
responsibility of the role.
Service contracts and exit payments policy
The current executive directors’ service contracts contain the key elements shown below.
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period
Termination payment
12 months by either employer or director
Up to 12 months’ salary (excluding bonus or other enhancement)
The executive directors’ service contracts do not contain specific provision for compensation in the event of early termination, with the 
exception of 12 months’ base salary in the event of removal at an AGM.
When determining exit payments, the Committee would take account of a variety of factors, including individual and business performance, 
the obligation for the director to mitigate loss (for example, by gaining new employment), the director’s length of service and any other 
relevant circumstances, such as ill health. A departing director may also be entitled to a payment in respect of statutory rights. Should a 
departing director be required to retire and be eligible for an early retirement pension under the terms of the defined benefit pension 
arrangement, an actuarial reduction will only be applied, in accordance with the rules, if the departing director has not reached age 55.
The Committee would distinguish between types of leaver in respect of incentive plans. “Good leavers” (death, ill-health, agreed 
retirement, redundancy or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee) may be considered for a bonus payment having completed 
the full year and part year bonus payments may be paid and LTIP awards may vest taking into account performance conditions and pro 
rating for time in employment during the performance period, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The LTIP rules include discretion 
for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised for “good leavers” and, in exceptional circumstances, adjustment to the 
realisation date. In all other leaver circumstances, the Committee would decide the approach taken, which would ordinarily mean that 
leavers would not be entitled to consideration for a bonus and LTIP awards would lapse. 
The appointment of the Chairman and each of the non-executive directors is for an initial period of three years, which is renewable for 
further terms, and is terminable by the Chairman / non-executive director (as applicable) or the Company on twelve months’ notice. 
No contractual payments would be due on termination. There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination for the 
non-executive directors, with the exception of entitlement to compensation equivalent to 12 months’ fees or, if less, the balance of 
appointment, in the event of removal at an AGM.
Policy report 48  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Our governance
Remuneration report
Change of control
The LTIP rules include discretion for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised, subject to the performance 
conditions and awards being pro-rated for service, in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary winding up.
Additionally, all the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating to change of control. In general, outstanding awards would 
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been 
satisfied at that time, reflecting the time period to the date of the event.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and 
organisations outside the Group. 
Pay and conditions throughout the Group
The pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group are considered by the Committee in setting remuneration policy for 
the executive directors and senior management. The Committee is kept regularly informed on the pay and benefits provided to 
employees and base salary increase data from the annual salary review for general staff is considered when reviewing executive 
directors’ salaries and those of senior management. The Committee does not directly consult with employees when setting 
remuneration policy for the executive directors. 
Difference in the Company’s policy on remuneration of directors compared to employees
The remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed with pay and conditions throughout the Group in mind.  
The Committee believes that some differences are necessary to reflect responsibility and provide appropriate focus and  
motivation for delivery of the Group’s strategy. Executive directors, therefore, have a higher bonus opportunity than employees 
generally to motivate them to achieve stretching annual targets and they participate in the LTIP to provide focus on long term 
sustainable performance. This approach is designed to provide an appropriate emphasis on performance related pay.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on directors’ remuneration.  
Feedback received from meetings during the year and in relation to the AGM is considered, together with guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more generally, and taken into account in the annual review of remuneration policy.  
The Committee believes that it has a responsible approach to directors’ pay and that its policy is appropriate and fit for purpose.
Support from shareholders is evidenced by the 99.3% approval of the 2012 Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2013 AGM 
(see the annual remuneration report for further details). A letter was sent to major shareholders on 8 January 2014 setting out the 
proposed increase to maximum award levels for the LTIP and their feedback indicated that they were supportive of this change.

Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan
Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long 
Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. Each award is made subject to 
the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will ordinarily vest after three years. Discretions available to the 
Committee contained in the LTIP rules are set out in the policy table and also in the exit payments policy.
Awards vesting in respect of 2013
The LTIP awards made in 2011 were measured over the three year period to 31 December 2013 and will vest to the extent of 50% 
on 15 March 2014. Half of the award was measured against EPS performance, whilst the other half of the award was measured 
against TSR performance against an index.
The threshold EPS target was 55p, and maximum target was 80p measured on a cumulative three year basis. Absolute cumulative 
EPS over the three year performance period was 93.1p. Therefore, all of the part of the award based on EPS will vest.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the index and the maximum target was performance equal to 10% annual 
outperformance of the index. Actual TSR was below the median of the index of 188% and therefore none of the award based on 
TSR will vest.
Awards granted on 26 February 2013 (audited)
Awards of 110,854 shares were made to executive directors at 100% of basic salary at a grant price of £6.495, exercisable in 2016 
and subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2015, as follows:
 
Executive director
 
Type of award
Number of shares 
awarded
  Face value at date 
  of grant £000
 % of face value that  
would vest at threshold
David Ritchie Performance share award 69,284 450 30
Jonathan Hill Performance share award 41,570 270 30
The performance measures are unchanged from the prior year, namely TSR (33.3%), EPS (33.3%) and ROCE (33.3%).
The performance targets are: 
•  TSR – threshold performance equal to the median of the comparator group and maximum performance at median plus 10% per 
annum (unchanged from the prior year).
•  EPS – threshold performance at cumulative EPS of 130 pence and maximum performance at cumulative EPS of 165 pence.
•  ROCE – threshold performance at 11.5% and maximum performance at 14.5%.

Performance conditions
Total Shareholder Return (one-third of total award)
One-third of the award vests according to the Company’s TSR performance over a three year period against a bespoke unweighted index 
of housebuilding comparators. TSR performance relative to an unweighted index has been chosen as a performance measure as the 
Committee believe that this aligns reward with the delivery of superior market performance over the long term.

Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997 and expired in 2007, with the granting of 
options being suspended in 2004. The last options granted under the Scheme in 2003 vested in 2012.
Pensions
David Ritchie is a senior executive member of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme (“BHPS”). This is a contributory funded, defined 
benefit scheme, approved by HMRC. He receives a pension allowance of 20% of salary and some or all of this allowance can  
be used in relation to his membership of the BHPS, to the extent that it remains beneficial in light of new pension legislation.  
The balance is paid as a non-bonusable and non-pensionable salary supplement.
Jonathan Hill is a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan (“GPP”). The Plan is a contracted-in defined 
contribution arrangement. The Company’s contribution for Jonathan Hill is 15% of his base salary.
There are no special early retirement or early termination provisions for executive directors, except as noted in the exit payments 
policy. Any new appointments would include eligibility for membership of the GPP, unless the appointee was already a member of 
the BHPS.

Shareholding guidelines
Guidelines have been approved for executive directors in respect of ownership of Bovis Homes’ shares. The Board expects executive 
directors benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain 100% of the net value 
derived from the exercise as shares, after settling all costs and income tax due, until such time as the executive director holds shares with an 
historic cost equal to their basic annual salary. The executive directors’ progress in achieving the guidelines is shown below.

Implementation of remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2014
Changes in the way that remuneration policy will be implemented in 2014 versus 2013 include base salary increases for the executive 
directors and an increase in the maximum annual award under the LTIP from 100% to 150% of base salary for the CEO and from 100% to 
125% of base salary for the GFD.
Executive directors’ base salaries
The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2014 are as follows:
 
Executive directors
 
Position
 
2014 base salary
% increase  
from 2013
David Ritchie CEO £465,000 3.33%
Jonathan Hill GFD £280,000 3.70%
The increase for the CEO, David Ritchie, of 3.33% is warranted given his continued outstanding leadership and contribution to the Group. 
This is reflected in the strong profit improvement delivered by the Company in 2013 and the excellent positioning of the Group for 2014, 
following a difficult period for the house building industry.
The Committee decided that given his performance, increased experience and strong contribution to the Group, an increase of 3.70% 
would be made to the salary of Jonathan Hill, the GFD.
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for general staff increases.
Benefits will continue on the same basis as for 2013.

Approach to annual bonus
Following the annual review, it was concluded that the annual bonus scheme continues to measure key elements of performance 
that are in line with the Company’s stated strategy over the shorter term and so no changes are to be made for 2014 in terms of 
either performance measures or quantum. The Committee has decided not to disclose the detail of performance targets in advance 
as they are considered commercially sensitive, being indicative performance indicators closely linked to the Group’s growth strategy.  
It is not intended to provide this information in future years. However, the 2014 performance measures are described below.
Measure (%weighting) Rationale / link to strategy Profit before tax (50%)
Financial measures (90%)
Profit before tax Explicitly ties reward to financial performance.
Challenges management to deliver and out-perform profit target.
50%
Cash flow Demands tight cash management in the operational running of  
the business. 
A strong balance sheet is a key determinant of the Company’s ability 
to invest for the future, and thus deliver future profitability.
15%
ROIC Aligns the way the business is managed with the key interest of 
shareholders, being the return achieved on invested capital.
25% 
Non-financial measures (10%)
Customer service Quality of service is key to reputation and future success, both in 
terms of customer demand and achieved selling prices.
10%
Total opportunity 100%
Approach for Long Term Incentive Plan awards
The key features of the long term incentive arrangements remain the same as those for 2013 with the exception of:
•  Award sizes increased to 150% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the GFD (subject to 2014 AGM approval).
Performance conditions
Total Shareholder Return (one-third of total award)
The target for maximum vesting of outperformance of the index by 10% per annum is historically equal to at least upper quartile 
performance, and is thus deemed appropriately stretching. TSR will be calculated using a three month averaging period at the start 
and end of the period to smooth the impact of share price volatility on vesting.
Performance measurement Target performance Maximum performance
TSR Equal to the median of the Index Median plus 10% per annum
The constituents of the TSR index to be used for the 2014 awards have been increased by the addition of Crest Nicholson Holdings plc.

Earnings per share (one-third of total award)
The Committee adopted cumulative EPS targets for the 2014 awards. When setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 
2014 awards, the Committee considered data providing visibility over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and 
analysts’ forecasts, and set absolute minimum and maximum EPS targets of 230p and 280p per share to be measured on a cumulative basis 
over the three year performance period. Where EPS falls below the minimum, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS 
can be realised.
Performance measurement Target performance Maximum performance
EPS Cumulative EPS of 230p Cumulative EPS of 280p
Return on Capital Employed (one-third of total award)
When setting minimum and maximum absolute ROCE targets for the 2014 awards, the Committee again considered data providing visibility 
over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts’ forecasts. The Committee set absolute minimum and 
maximum ROCE targets for the 2014 awards of 17.0% and 20.0%, to be measured in the third year of the performance period (2016).
Performance measurement Target performance Maximum performance
ROCE 17.0% 20.0%
Pensions
Pension arrangements will continue on the same basis as in 2013. 
Non-executive directors’ remuneration 
The fees for the non-executive director positions in 2013 and for 2014 are set out below.
  2013 2014
Chairman fee £135,000 £160,000*
Deputy Chairman fee £63,000 £63,000
Non-executive director base fee  £43,000 £43,000
Additional fees:
 Audit Committee chair £8,000 £8,000
 Remuneration Committee chair £8,000 £8,000
* The new non-executive Chairman was appointed on 29 November 2013 at a market competitive rate, following the conclusion of a robust recruitment process. 
In setting the appropriate fee level, the Committee considered competitive positioning, the Chairman’s responsibilities, time commitment for the role and the 
size and complexity of the Company.
The fees for the non-executive directors were increased to their current levels with effect from 1 January 2013 and will next be reviewed 
with effect from 1 January 2015.

Advisers to the Committee
Deloitte LLP were appointed advisers to the Committee in August 2009. Deloitte provide independent advice on all aspects of executive 
remuneration and attend Remuneration Committee meetings when invited by the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee reviews the 
advice, challenges conclusions and assesses responses from Deloitte to ensure objectivity and independence. Deloitte did not provide any

relevant ethical guidance.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the

Main activities during the year
The Committee followed a programme structured around 
the annual reporting cycle and received reports from Internal 
Audit, the external auditors and management. The key activities 
undertaken were:
•  Discussed with the external auditors the key accounting 
considerations and judgements reflected in the Group’s results 
for the 12 months ending 31 December 2012.
•  Reviewed the 2012 annual report and accounts, to be able 
to recommend to the Board that they presented a true and  
fair view.
•  Considered and recommended to the Board the presentations 
for analysts.
• Assessed the results and effectiveness of the 2012 final audit. 
•  Reviewed and discussed with the external auditors the key 
accounting considerations and judgements reflected in the 
Group’s results for the six months ending 30 June 2013.
•  Evaluated and agreed the external auditors’ audit strategy 
memorandum in advance of their 2013 year-end audit.
•  Received reports from internal audit covering various aspects of 
the Group’s operations, controls and processes.
•  Assessed and agreed the internal auditor’s audit plan for 2014, 
based on the agreed risk universe, together with the required 
level of resource.
•  Monitored progress against actions from the external formal 
review of the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function 
completed in 2012.
•  Reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control and 
risk management systems and reported to the Board that there 
were no material control weaknesses.

by the FRC in a letter concerning certain accounting disclosures 
in the 2011 accounts.
•  Reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference.
•  Reviewed the Company’s whistleblowing policy and arrangements.
At its meeting in February 2014, the Committee discussed with 
the external auditors the key accounting considerations and 
judgements reflected in the Group’s results for the 12 months 
ending 31 December 2013 and reviewed the 2013 annual report 
and accounts, to be able to recommend to the Board that, 
taken as a whole, it was fair, balanced and understandable and 
provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
“ The Committee plays a fundamental role in protecting shareholders’ 
interests, with a remit that covers financial reporting, risk, internal 
control and oversight of external and internal audit.”

Significant areas
The key accounting judgements considered by the Committee 
in relation to the 2013 accounts and discussed with the external 
auditors, were:
•   Inventory provisioning - the level of inventory provisioning impacts 
the carrying value of the most significant balance on the balance 
sheet. Since the downturn in the land market in 2008 the Company 
has carried a provision to write down the carrying value of the land 
held within inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable  
value, less costs to sell, where this is less than the historic cost.  
The assessment of the level of provision required, requires the 
exercise of significant judgement by management. The Committee 
receives a regular report on this provision, updated by management, 
at relevant Committee meetings. At this year end the paper 
proposed an immaterial adjustment, which was in line with the 
forecast position and had been audited by the external auditors prior 
to the year end. The written down sites and any adjustments 
proposed were discussed and justified by management and the land 
write down provision remaining at the period end (£19.9 million) 
was reviewed, together with the profit attributable to the reversal of 
the provision on the sale of written down units during the year, 
which was not considered to be material. Following discussion, the 
Committee was satisfied that the judgements exercised were 
appropriate and that the provision was appropriately stated at the 
year end. Details of the movements in the provision are provided in 
note 3.1 to the accounts on page 83.
•  Available for sale financial assets - the assumptions used to fair 
value available for sale financial assets, (otherwise known as shared 
equity and details of which are provided in note 4.2 on page 86), 
affects the carrying value on the balance sheet. These assumptions 
require the exercise of significant judgement by management. This is 
assessed through the Committee discussing with management and 
the auditors the assumptions adopted and any adjustments made to 
those assumptions, including, in particular, the long run HPI 
assumption which is a key determinant of the expected final 
redemption value. Following discussion the Committee considered 
that the assumptions adopted were reasonable.
External auditors
During the year, KPMG Audit Plc resigned as auditors as a result of 
KPMG’s decision to gradually wind down activity in KPMG Audit Plc 
and the Board appointed KPMG LLP to fill the casual vacancy.  
The Committee reviewed the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors, which was confirmed in an independence letter 
containing information on procedures providing safeguards established 
by the external auditor. Regulation, professional requirements and 
ethical standards were taken into account, together with consideration 
of all relationships between the Company and the external auditors 
and their staff. Relations with the external auditors were managed 
through a series of meetings and regular discussions and we ensure 
a high quality audit by challenging the key areas of the external 
auditor’s work. The relationship is kept under review and, following 
adopted practice, the audit engagement partner rotated on 
completion of the 2011 final audit after five years in the post.
At its meeting in February 2014, the Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the external audit process as part of its consideration 
of the 2013 final audit. 
This included assessing delivery and content against the audit plan for 
the 2013 year end audit, including perceived changes in audit risks, 
consideration of the performance of the audit team and the quality of 
reporting, reviewing comprehensive papers from the external auditors, 
discussing and challenging conclusions and audit judgements and 
assessing responses from the external auditor, and obtaining feedback 
about the effectiveness and conduct of the audit from those involved.
Our 2014 AGM Notice contains a resolution for the re-appointment 
of KPMG LLP as auditors to the Company. In making this 
recommendation, the Committee took into account, amongst 
other matters, the independence and objectivity of KPMG LLP, the 
effectiveness of the external audit process and cost. The 2014 AGM 
Notice also contains a resolution to give the directors authority to 
determine the auditors’ remuneration, which provides a practical 
flexibility to the Committee. The external auditors have been in post 
since flotation in 1997 and there are no contractual restrictions on 
the choice of external auditor. The Committee has considered the 
length of KPMG’s tenure and the UK Corporate Governance Code 
requirements to tender external audit contracts at least every ten years 
and, whilst satisfied with KPMG’s effectiveness and independence, 
intends to conduct an audit tender process in the second half of 2014. 
In doing so, the Committee would comply with the Competition 
Commission Order relating to the statutory audit market for FTSE 350 
companies expected to come into effect from 1 October 2014. 
The Committee keeps under review its policy which requires the 
Committee to approve all non-audit services proposed to be 
undertaken by the external auditors, with the exception of tax advisory 
and compliance work undertaken in the ordinary course of business 
and audit related services, which are treated as pre-approved.  
When an approval request is made, the Committee has due regard  
to the nature of the non-audit service, whether the external auditor  
is a suitable supplier, and whether there is likely to be any threat  
to independence and objectivity in the conduct of the audit.  
The related fee level, both separately and relative to the audit fee is 
also considered. For an analysis of fees paid to the external auditors, 
see note 2.1 on page 81. The non-audit services provided during 
the year related to tax advisory and compliance work. Provision 
of these services is not considered to impair the external auditor’s 
independence or objectivity.
Performance evaluation
The Committee commenced a performance evaluation towards the 
end of 2013, using a discussion and interview process designed to 
produce an objective assessment of the Committee’s performance 
and audit effectiveness. The Committee was found to be effective and 
continued to be well run, with the level of accounting and financial 
expertise providing strong challenge. It was also concluded that the 
Committee had appropriate terms of reference and had fulfilled its 
remit in 2013 and that the audit process continued to be effective.

The Committee met six times in 2013. Alastair Lyons chaired two 
meetings and parts of other meetings that discussed Chairman 
succession planning. The new Chairman of the Company, Ian Tyler, 
chaired the final meeting of the year. For all meetings, papers were 
circulated sufficiently in advance to allow proper consideration 
of matters for discussion. The Group Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Committee.
Responsibilities and terms of reference
The key responsibilities of the Committee are:
•  Reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board 
(including skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) and 
making recommendations to the Board. 
•  Considering succession planning for directors and senior 
executives, taking into account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company and the skills and expertise needed in  
the future.
•  Monitoring the leadership needs of the Company and leading 
the process for Board appointments, ensuring they are 
conducted on merit, against objective criteria (including diversity), 
using the services of an appropriate external search consultant.
•  Making recommendations to the Board, including on the 
re-appointment of non-executive directors, the re-election 
of directors at the AGM, and membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees.
The Committee also reviews the results of the Board performance 
evaluation that relate to the composition of the Board. External 
legal or other independent professional advice can be obtained 
at the Company’s expense, although this facility was not utilised 
during the year.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/investor-centre/
corporate-governance).
Main activities during the year
During 2013, the Committee:
•  Reviewed the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
concluded that the present Board balance and composition 
remained appropriate, but would be kept under review.
•  Ran the recruitment process for the new Chairman of the 
Company, using objective criteria and the external search services 
of The Zygos Partnership (who have no other connection with the 
Company), and recommended appointment of the new Chairman 
to the Board. 
•  Considered succession planning for the other non-executive 
directors looking forward to 2015, including the phasing of new 
appointments, as part of a progressive and orderly refreshing of  
the Board.
•  Reviewed planning for executive director and senior management 
succession, against a background of organisational development.
•  Recommended that all the directors stand for re-election at 
the 2013 AGM in accordance with the UK Corporate  
Governance Code.
•  Approved the Nomination Committee report for the 2012 
Annual Report.
• Reviewed and updated the Committee’s terms of reference. 
The Committee also reviewed the results of the 2012 internal Board 
performance evaluation relating to the composition of the Board and 
to ensure all the directors had sufficient time to devote to their duties. 
Non-executive directors’ service contracts are renewed on an 
annual basis following the conclusion of a second three year term, 
subject to satisfactory performance and no need to re-balance the 
Board, with the third year of the third term extending until the 
subsequent AGM. Recommendations were made to the Board that 
service contracts for John Warren and Colin Holmes be renewed for 
further terms, following rigorous review, including their respective 
contributions, performance and commitment to their roles.
The principle of boardroom diversity is strongly supported and the 
Committee reviewed the diversity policy, first published in September 
2011. The policy sets out that appointments to the Board will always 
be based on merit, so that the Board has the right individuals in place, 
and explains that diversity is seen as an important consideration as 
part of the objective criteria used to assess candidates to achieve 
a balanced board. A decision was taken not to set measurable 
objectives and the Committee will continue to consider boardroom 
diversity in its succession planning discussions.
Performance evaluation
The Committee completed a performance evaluation towards the 
end of 2013 and a report was presented to the Committee and 
discussed. The Committee was found to be effective and it was 
concluded that it had fulfilled its remit in 2013 and had appropriate 
terms of reference.

Directors’ report
The directors have pleasure in submitting their annual report for 
the year ended 31 December 2013.
Results and dividends
The Group made a profit after taxation of £60.1 million  
(2012: £40.2 million). An interim dividend of 4.0p (2012: 3.0p) 
net per share was paid on 22 November 2013. The Board 
proposes to pay, subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting, a final dividend of 9.5p (2012: final 
dividend of 6.0p) net per share in respect of the 2013 financial 
year on 23 May 2014 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 28 March 2014. On this basis, the total 
dividend for 2013 will be 13.5p (2012: 9.0p). The dividend 
reinvestment plan, introduced in 2012, gives shareholders the 
opportunity to reinvest dividends.
Annual General Meeting
Notice of the 2014 Annual General Meeting to be held on 
Friday 16 May 2014 is set out on pages 102 to 104.  
Members wishing to vote should return forms of proxy to the 
Company’s Registrar not less than 48 hours before the time 
for holding the meeting. Shareholders with internet access may 
register their voting instructions via the internet by going to  
www.eproxyappointment.com.
Following a review of remuneration policy by the Remuneration 
Committee to ensure an approach to remuneration that 
underpins the Company’s long term growth and returns 
strategy, a resolution will be submitted to shareholders to 
increase the usual maximum award under the Long term 
Incentive Plan from 100% to 150% of basic salary.  
Following a consultation, major shareholders were supportive 
of this change, which focuses on the long term sustainable 
performance of the Company.
As in prior years, it is proposed that a general meeting that is 
not an Annual General Meeting can be called on not less than 
14 clear days’ notice. This resolution is required as a result 
of the implementation of the Shareholder Rights Directive, 
which increased the notice period for general meetings of 
the Company to 21 days, unless shareholders have approved 
the calling of meetings on 14 days’ notice. Ability to call a 
general meeting on 14 days’ notice would only be utilised in 
limited circumstances and where it was to the advantage of 
shareholders as a whole.
The Board has also resolved that a resolution be submitted 
to shareholders proposing the renewal of the authority to 
enable the Company to purchase up to 10% of its own shares. 
Presently, the directors have no wish to exercise the authority, 
but consider it appropriate to have the flexibility to do so.  
Any shares purchased would be cancelled.
The directors believe that all the resolutions to be considered 
at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of 
the Company and its shareholders as a whole. The directors 
unanimously recommend that all shareholders vote in favour of 
the resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of their 
own shares in the Company.
Directors
Details of the directors are shown on page 32. Malcolm Harris 
retired as non-executive Chairman on 29 November 2013 and 
Ian Tyler was appointed on the same date. Colin Holmes has 
decided to retire from the Board at the 2014 AGM after seven 
and a half years as a director and seven years as chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee.
Details of directors’ pay, pension rights, service contracts and 
directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are 
included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 43  
to 61.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all the 
directors will retire at the Annual General Meeting, to be held 
on Friday 16 May 2014, and being eligible, offer themselves for 
re-appointment, with the exception of Colin Holmes. Ian Tyler 
also offers himself for re-appointment in accordance with the 
Articles of Association.
Directors’ indemnities
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force under 
which the Company has agreed to indemnify the directors, 
to the extent permitted by law and the Company’s Articles 
of Association, in respect of all losses arising out of or in 
connection with, the execution of their powers, duties  
and responsibilities, as directors of the Company or any of  
its subsidiaries.
Corporate governance
The Board remains committed to high standards of corporate 
governance. Details relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code are given in the Corporate 
Governance report on pages 33 to 41.

Powers of the directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, UK legislation 
and any directions given by special resolution, the business of the 
Company is managed by the Board, which may exercise all the 
powers of the Company. The directors have been authorised to

under authority of resolutions of the Company passed at its Annual 
General Meeting. The rules in relation to the appointment and 
replacement of directors are set out in the Company’s Articles  
of Association.
Share capital
At the date of this report the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised a single class of share capital which is divided into 
ordinary shares of 50 pence. As at 21 February 2014, 134,098,952 
ordinary shares of 50 pence each have been issued, are fully paid 
up and are quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies 
of which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by 
writing to the Group Company Secretary. In particular, subject to 
applicable statutes, shares may be issued with such rights or 
restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution determine, 
or (if there is no such resolution or so far as it does not make 
specific provision) as the Board may determine. Shareholders are 
entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings of the 
Company, to appoint one or more proxies and, if they are 
corporations, to appoint corporate representatives. 
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every 
shareholder present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has 
one vote and on a poll every shareholder present in person or by 
proxy and entitled to vote has one vote for every ordinary share 
held. Further details regarding voting, including the deadlines for 
voting, at the Annual General Meeting can be found in the notes 
to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting at the back of this 
annual report and accounts. No shareholder is, unless the Board 
decides otherwise, entitled to attend or vote either personally or 
by proxy at a general meeting or to exercise any other shareholder 
rights if he or any person with an interest in shares has been sent a 
notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and has failed 
to supply the Company with the requisite information within the 
prescribed period.
Shareholders may receive a dividend and on a liquidation may share 
in the assets of the Company. None of the ordinary shares of the 
Company, including those held by the Company’s share schemes, 
carry any special rights with regard to control of the Company. 
Employees participating in the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive 
Plan may direct the trustee to exercise voting rights on their behalf 
at any general meeting.
The instrument of transfer of a certificated share may be in any 
usual form or in any other form which the Board may approve. 
The Board may refuse to register any instrument of transfer of a 
certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that the refusal 
does not prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking 
place on an open and proper basis. 
The Board may also refuse to register a transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is lodged, duly stamped 
(if stampable), at the registered office of the Company or any 
other place decided by the Board accompanied by the certificate 
for the share to which it relates and such other evidence as the 
Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor 
to make the transfer; (ii) is in respect of only one class of shares; 
and (iii) is in favour of not more than four transferees. Transfers of 
uncertificated shares must be carried out using the relevant system 
and the Board can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertificated 
share in accordance with the regulations governing the operation 
of the relevant system and with UK legislation. There are no other 
limitations on the holding of ordinary shares in the Company and 
the Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of 
securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.  68  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Our governance

Methodology
GHG emissions have been reported from all sources required under 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. These sources fall within the Group’s operational 
control and the consolidated statements. The Group does not have 
responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in the 
consolidated financial statements and are outside the boundary of 
operational control.
During the year, measures were put in place to collect emissions 
data from our construction sites for the first time. Where this 
data was incomplete at the year end, we have extrapolated total 
emissions by using (i) an averaging approach to extend data to a 
full year for sites with part-year data, and (ii) applied an average 
calculated from all sites to sites returning inadequate data.  
The calculations allow for sites which opened and closed during  
the year.
GHG emissions have been calculated using emission factors from 
UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 
2013. Scope 1 emissions arise from the consumption of gas at 
our facilities, diesel on construction sites and UK business mileage 
in fleet cars. Emissions from air conditioning in offices have been 
excluded as not being material. Scope 2 emissions represent 
purchased electricity.
Takeover directive
On a change of control, provisions in the Group’s syndicated 
banking facility agreements (described in note 4.3 to the accounts) 
would allow lenders to withdraw the facility.
All of the Group’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a 
change of control. Under these provisions, a change of control 
would be a vesting event, allowing exercise of outstanding options 
and awards, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions,  
as required.
There are a number of commercial contracts that could alter in the 
event of a change of control. None is considered to be material in 
terms of their potential impact on the Group in this event.
Financial risk management
Details of financial risk management and exposure to credit / 
liquidity risks are included in note 4.6 to the accounts.
Political donations
No political donations were made during the year ended 31 
December 2013. The Group has a policy of not making donations 
to political parties or incurring political expenditure.
Auditors
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this report 
confirms that:
•  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
•  each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
The auditors, KPMG LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue 
in office and, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006, resolutions concerning their re-appointment and 
remuneration will be placed before the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ report
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, 
the directors’ remuneration report and the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements, in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the directors are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
•  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
•  for the Group and Parent Company financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the 
above requirements in preparing the financial statements. 
The directors also confirm that they consider the annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group and Parent Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a strategic report, a directors’ report, 
a directors’ remuneration report and a report on corporate 
governance that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed  
on page 32 of this annual report confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
a)  the Group and Parent Company financial statements in this 
report, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretation and those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and of 
the Group taken as a whole; and
b)  the strategic report contained in this report includes a fair, 
balanced and understandable review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Auditor’s report
1  Our opinion on the financial statements  
is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Bovis Homes plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2013 set out on pages 75 to 100.
In our opinion: 
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
•  the group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU); 
•  the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. 
2  Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the group financial 
statements the risks of material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our group audit were as follows:
Net realisable value of inventories (£971.0 million)
Refer to page 63 (Audit committee report), page 83 (accounting 
policy) and page 83 (financial disclosures).
•  The risk - Inventories, which principally comprise the group’s 
land held for development and work in progress, are stated 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value (i.e. the forecast 
selling price less the remaining costs to build and sell).  
An assessment of the net realisable value of inventory is 
carried out at each balance sheet date and is dependent upon 
the group’s estimate of forecast selling prices and build costs 
by reference to current prices. £48.6 million of inventory is 
held at net realisable value. Accordingly, a change in the 
group’s estimate of sales price and build cost could have a 
material impact on the carrying value of inventories in the 
group’s financial statements. 
•  Our response - Our audit procedures in this area included, 
among others, challenging the group’s forecast sales prices 
by comparing the forecast sales price of a sample of houses 
to sales prices achieved and list prices of comparable houses 
as published by estate agents. We compared sales price trends 
forecast recorded in the appraisals to published indices.  
We also challenged the group’s forecast of build cost per 
square foot by comparing to the build costs for similar units on 
other sites and where there were differences we corroborated 
management’s explanations to subcontractor quotes. Our audit 
work was focused on low margin sites which are considered  
to have the most sensitivity to the Directors’ assumptions.  
We also considered the adequacy of the group’s disclosures  
in respect of the provision held against inventory carried at net 
realisable value.
Valuation of available for sale financial assets – shared 
equity (£44.8 million)
Refer to page 63 (Audit committee report), page 85 (accounting 
policy) and pages 86 and 90 (financial disclosures).
•  The risk - Available for sale financial assets are amounts 
receivable on extended terms granted as part of a sales 
transaction where the final amount repayable is dependent 
upon the value of the house at the repayment date and are 
carried at fair value. The valuation method for these assets is 
not based upon observable market data. Hence, the group 
uses a valuation model for which a number of assumptions 
have to be made, the key ones being expected house price 
movements and the discount rate reflecting, inter alia, the 
time value of money and the risk that the borrower is unable 
to repay the amount receivable. Changes in the assumptions 
used could have a material effect on the output of the 
valuation model and hence on the carrying value of the assets. 
•  Our response - Our audit procedures in this area included, 
among others, comparing the discount rate used in the 
valuation model to our own research on private transactions 
in mortgage and secured loans portfolios (with assistance 
from our own valuation specialist) and house price 
movements to house price forecasts published by real  
estate agents. We challenged the group’s estimate of the 
fair value by checking profits/losses earned from redemptions 
in the year and assessing how the experience to date had 
been included as part of the reassessment of assumptions. 
We also re-performed the group’s sensitivity analysis on the 
valuation and assessed whether the group’s disclosures about 
the sensitivity of the outcome of the valuation to changes in 
key assumptions properly reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of available for sale assets.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
Our governance Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  73
3  Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £3.9 million. This has been determined with reference to a 
benchmark of group profit before taxation (of which it represents 
5%) which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for 
members of the company in assessing the financial performance of 
the group.
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all uncorrected 
misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in 
excess of £0.2 million, in addition to other audit misstatements 
below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. In addition we considered whether any 
misstatements corrected by management identified during 
the course of the audit should be communicated to the Audit 
Committee to assist it in fulfilling its governance responsibilities.
The group’s operations are all accounted for at the group’s head 
office in New Ash Green, Kent. The group audit team performed 
the audit of the group as if it was a single aggregated set of 
financial information. The audit was performed using the materiality 
level set out above and covered 100% of total group revenue; 
group profit before taxation; and total group assets. Visits were 
made to regional offices for the purposes of performing tests of 
controls or making enquiries of regional management). 
4  Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
5  We have nothing to report in respect of 
matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains  
a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the  
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is 
otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
•  we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
•  the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
•  the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•  the directors’ statement, set out on page 39, in relation to going 
concern; and 
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 33 
to 41 relating to the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code specified 
for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 70, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of 
financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made 
solely to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/
auditscopeukco2013a, which are incorporated into this report as if 
set out in full and should be read to provide an understanding of 
the purpose of this report, the work we have undertaken and the 
basis of our opinions.

Notes to the financial statements
In preparing the 2013 financial statements, Bovis Homes Group PLC has made a number of changes in structure, layout and wording in order to make 
the financial statements less complex and more relevant for shareholders and other users.
The notes have been grouped into sections under five key categories:
1. Basis of preparation
2. Result for the year
3. Land bank and other operating assets and liabilities
4. Financing
5. Other disclosures
The key accounting policies have been incorporated throughout the notes to the financial statements adjacent to the disclosure to which they relate.  
All accounting policies are included within an outlined box. 
Where possible, wording has been simplified to provide clearer commentary on the financial performance of the Group.
1.0 Basis of preparation
1.1 General information
Bovis Homes Group PLC (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in associates 
and joint ventures.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 21 February 2014.
1.2 Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRS) and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). On publishing the 
Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all relevant periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.  
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and available for sale financial assets.
1.3 Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. The Directors reviewed detailed 
financial and covenant compliance forecasts covering the period to December 2014 and summary financial forecasts for the following two years.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group held cash and cash equivalents of £12.0 million and had total borrowings of £30.1 million. On 29 January 2013  
the Group entered into a £125 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in March 2017 and a three year term loan of £25 million expiring 
in January 2016. This financing arrangement replaced the Group’s previous £150 million committed revolving credit facility. During August 2013, 
the committed revolving credit facility was increased by an additional £50 million, expiring on 31 December 2015. As at 31 December 2013, the full  
£175 million was available for drawdown.
For these reasons, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis. 
1.4. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
made up to 31 December. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when 
assessing whether the Group controls another entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date 
that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Joint ventures are those entities in which the Group has joint control over the financial and operating policies. The consolidated financial statements 
include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control 
commenced until joint control ceases.
1.5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis 
of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.  80  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which  
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a 
significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Land held for development and housing work in progress
The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. To assess the net realisable value of land held for development 
and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are 
combined as residential properties for sale and sold. Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories 
and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost. Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to 
which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a realisable value. To the extent that the revenues 
which can be generated change, or the final cost to complete for the site varies from estimates, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different. 
A review taking into account estimated achievable net revenues, actual inventory and costs to complete as at 21 February 2014 has been carried out, 
which has identified no material net movement in the carrying value of the provision. These estimates were made by local management having regard 
to actual sales prices, together with competitor and marketplace evidence, and were further reviewed by Group management. Should there be a future 
significant decline in UK house pricing, then further write-downs of land and work in progress may be necessary. Further details on the carrying value of 
inventories is laid out in note 3.1.
Available for sale financial assets
The estimation of the fair value of available for sale financial assets requires judgement and estimation as to the quantum, timing and value of repayment 
of the Group’s receivable, as well as to the choice of instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate used to determine a discount rate. Note 4.6 contains 
a sensitivity analysis showing the impact of a change in the major judgement factors applied in the valuation of these instruments.
1.6 Segment reporting
As the Group’s main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, there are no separate segments, either 
business or geographic, to disclose, having taken into account the aggregation criteria provisions of IFRS8.
1.7 Exceptional items
Items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement. The Directors are  
of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business performance.  
Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing and newly-acquired 
businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or individual assets and asset impairments, including currently developable land, work in 
progress and goodwill.
1.8 Impact of standards and interpretations effective for the first time
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with 
a date of initial application of 1 January 2013:
IFRS13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements, when such measurements are 
required or permitted by other IFRSs. In particular, it unifies the definition of fair value as the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to 
transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS13, the 
Group has applied the new fair value measurement guidance prospectively, and has not provided any comparative information for new disclosures.
IAS19 (Revised 2011) “Employee Benefits” outlines the accounting requirements for employee benefits. The Standard establishes the principle that the 
cost of providing employee benefits should be recognised in the period in which the benefit is earned by the employee, rather than when it is paid or 
payable, and outlines how each category of employee benefits are measured, providing detailed guidance in particular about post-employment benefits. 
This impacts the measurement of various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures, but 
not the Group’s total obligation.
The application of IAS19 (Revised 2011) has resulted in the interest cost and expected return on assets being replaced by a net interest charge/credit on 
the net defined benefit pension liability/surplus. Certain costs previously recorded as part of finance costs or other comprehensive income have now been 
presented within administrative expenses.
The comparative period has been restated with profit being £0.7 million lower and other comprehensive income £0.7 million higher including the tax 
impact of the changes. The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share was a reduction of 0.5 pence. The Group records actuarial adjustments 
immediately so there has been no effect on the prior year pension deficit.
The other standards and interpretations that are applicable for the first time in the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013, 
have no effect on these financial statements. Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  81
Notes to the financial statements continued 
1.9 Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2013, and have not been 
applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Comments on specific new standards or amendments are as follows:
IFRS10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interest in Other Entities’, IAS27 (Revised) ‘Separate 
Financial Statements’ and IAS28 (Revised) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ all cover various aspects of Group Financial Statements but are 
not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Amendment to IAS32 will apply to the Group from 1 January 2014. This amendment provides guidance on the application of offsetting in financial 
statements. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and financial position.
IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was reissued in October 2010 as the second step in the IASB project to replace IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition  
and Measurement’. IFRS9 (2010) now includes new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities and the derecognition 
of financial instruments. The IASB is continuing the process of expanding IFRS9 to add new requirements for impairment and hedge accounting.  
In November 2013 the IASB officially removed the previous mandatory effective date (i.e. 1 January 2015) and decided that it would be no earlier than  
1 January 2015. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and financial position and will continue to assess the 
impact as the standard is revised by the IASB.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation. Of the above, IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’ has not yet been endorsed by 
the EU.
2.0 Result for the year
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of value-assed tax, rebated and discounts. Revenue does not include 
the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property. The net gain or loss arising from the 
legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Revenue is recognised once the value of the transaction can be reliably measured and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred. Revenue is recognised on house sales at legal completion. Revenue is recognised on land sales and commercial property sales from the 
point of unconditional exchange of contracts. For affordable housing sales in bulk, revenue is recognised upon practical completion.
Where land is sold with material development obligations, the recognition of revenue and profit is deferred until the work is complete.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives granted are recognised as 
an integral part of the total rental income.

Diluted earnings per share
The calculation of diluted earnings per share at 31 December 2013 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of £60,068,000 
(2012: £40,193,000) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2013 of 133,933,279  
(2012: 133,432,911).
The average number of shares is increased by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the period.  
This reflects the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the 
share option exercise price. The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period. Only share options 
which have met their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.

3.0 Land bank and other operating assets and liabilities
This section shows the assets used to generate the Group’s trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result. Liabilities relating to the Group’s 
financing activities are addressed in section 4. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in section 5.
3.1 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated net selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished goods.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost 
along with any expected overage. Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be 
paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, an adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost. Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these options, 
and provisions made accordingly to reflect loss of value. The impairment reviews consider the period elapsed since the date of purchase of the 
option given that the option contract has not been exercised at the review date. Further, the impairment reviews consider the remaining life of the 
option, taking account of any concerns over whether the remaining time available will allow successful exercise of the option. The carrying cost of 
the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option exercise.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land 
purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost. Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value 
of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element. The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land 
and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, 
in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.

The total provision for doubtful receivables is £0.3 million (2012: £1.0 million). 
The carrying value of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings represents the Company’s maximum credit risk. The directors consider these amounts to 
be fully receivable at year end.
Receivables which are past due but not impaired are not material.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.
3.3 Trade and other payables
Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which  
they relate. The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is recognised over the period of the 
credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Government grants
 
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. Government

The Group’s non-current liabilities largely relate to land purchased on extended payment terms. An ageing of land creditor repayments is provided in note 4.7. 
The Group’s other financial liabilities represent the fair value of a liability, based on the performance of the Lloyds Bank House Price Index from October 
2010 to March 2014. Note 4.6 highlights the sensitivity of this value to changes in the index. Deferred income includes £0.7 million of Government grants. 
This will be released to the income statement as the Group legally completes units on the related sites.
4.0 Financing
This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing activities.
4.1 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of 
the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

4.2 Available for sale assets
Available for sale financial assets - shared equity
Receivables on extended terms granted as part of a sales transaction are secured by way of a legal charge on the relevant property, categorised 
as an available for sale financial asset, and are stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in 
equity in retained earnings, with the exceptions of impairment losses, the impact of changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the 
‘effective interest rate’ method, which are recognised directly in the income statement. Where the investment is disposed of, or is determined to be 
impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period. Given its materiality, this 
item is being disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Available for sale financial assets relate to legal completions where the Group has retained an interest through agreement to defer recovery of a 
percentage of the market value of the property, together with a legal charge to protect the Group’s position. The Group participates in three schemes.  
‘Jumpstart’ schemes are receivable 10 years after recognition with 3% interest charged between years 6 to 10. The ‘HomeBuy Direct’ and ‘FirstBuy’ 
schemes are operated together with the Government. Receivables are due 25 years after recognition with interest charged from year 6 onwards at 
a base value of 1.75% plus annual RPI increments. These assets are held at fair value being the present value of expected future cash flows taking 
into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated date of recovery. 86  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial statements

During the prior year the Group received units in the TM Hearthstone UK Residential Property Fund valued at £7.2 million in exchange for a number of 
the Group’s showhome properties. In 2013 the units were fully redeemed for cash. 
4.3 Bank and other loans
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.  
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Government grants
The benefit on loans with an interest rate below market is calculated as the difference between interest at a market rate and the below  
market interest. The benefit is treated as a Government grant.

Interest free loan at fair value LIBOR +158 bps 2016 4,856 5,190
The interest free loan was obtained to facilitate large infrastructure investment at one of the Group’s sites in the South West. The amount available 
depends on the underlying investment undertaken with repayments of this facility reflecting expectations of cash inflow generation from sales at that 
site, the maximum facility available is £6 million. The nominal amount at 31 December 2013 was £5,000,000. This has been fair valued using an effective 
interest rate of LIBOR plus 158bps, creating an inputed interest charge which is accounted for as a government grant (see note 3.3), which decreases 
the loan position. Interest will effectively be charged on this fair valued position over the life of the facility so at relevant repayment dates the value in 
the accounts for the loan is reflective of the cash amounts to be repaid. The imputed interest charged in the period was £121,369, which increases the  
loan value. The long stop repayment date for this facility is 5 January 2016.
Details of facilities
On 29 January 2013 the Group has entered into a £125 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in March 2017 and a three-year term loan 
of £25 million expiring in January 2016. This financing arrangement replaced the Group’s previous £150 million committed revolving credit facility. 
The facility syndicate comprises four existing relationship group banks, one of which is providing the term loan, and one new bank. During August 
2013 the committed revolving credit facility was increased by an additional £50 million, expiring on 31 December 2015. The facility and the term loan 
include a covenant package, featuring three covenants tested semi-annually as per the previous facility agreement. The overall financing cost of the new 
arrangement is in line with the existing facility.
4.4 Net financing costs
Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arise.
The Group is required to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and production of a qualifying asset,  
as part of the costs of that asset. Inventories which are produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis over a short period of time are not  
qualifying assets. The Group does not generally produce qualifying assets.

Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of shares in the 
Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.

Reserve for own shares held
The cost of the Company’s shares held in the ESOP trust by the Group is recorded as a reserve in equity. During the year ended 31 December 2013, there 
were no share purchases. 156,969 shares awarded under the Group’s long term incentive plan vested during 2013 and accordingly the balance of the 
own shares held reserve reduced by £581,000. The Group has suspended all rights on shares held by the Group in the Company.
4.6 Financial risk management
Group
The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future development. 
In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide returns for shareholders over the housing market cycle as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a  
trading business.
The Group’s capital comprises its shareholders’ equity, added together with its net borrowings stated before issue costs. A five year record of its capital 
employed is displayed on page 101 together with a return on capital employed, which indicates that the Group has delivered strong growth in capital and 
return on capital employed over the past 5 years, subsequent to the housing market downturn. The sharp market movements in 2008, saw a fall in the 
Group’s capital employed, as inventory provisions reduced the asset base of the Group, leading to a reduction in retained earnings and thus shareholders 
equity. This was partially reversed in 2009 following a successful equity placing.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Group’s decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders’ equity and debt financing, the 
Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing or cash in hand. This is because the Group recognises that 
housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks. The Group would seek to manage its capital base through 
control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its 
capital structure.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank and other loans and overdrafts. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group also utilises financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
payables or receivables that arise directly from operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk. 
The valuation of the Group’s available for sale financial assets and a financial liability are also impacted by housing market price fluctuations, giving rise 
to market price risk.
a. Interest rate risk
Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure 
to fluctuations in interest rates. The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Group’s policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  89
Notes to the financial statements continued 
Hedging
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings where appropriate through procuring interest rate swaps, 
denominated in sterling. The decision whether to enter into a swap, and the timing of procurement of swaps depends on a number of key variables, on 
which management form judgements. These matters include management’s view of likely cash flows and indebtedness, interest rate movements and 
other macro-economic factors looking ahead. These assumptions are reviewed with the Group Finance Director on a periodic basis prior to any decision  
being made. Decisions made by management in this area are discussed with the Board to ensure transparency of decision making. At 31 December 2013, 
the Group had a £18.6 million interest rate swap relating to debt held within a joint venture. The Group pays a fixed interest rate of 1.505% and receives 
one month LIBOR. All costs are being taken directly through income, because the arrangement is not considered a cash flow hedge under IAS39. The fair 
value measurement of the Group’s derivative financial instruments include inputs which are based on observable market data. In July 2013 the Group 
entered into a £25.0 million cash flow hedge to protect against movements in interest rates. This hedge expires on 29 January 2016.

Effective interest rates and repricing analysis
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 4.3.
Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Group’s earnings, given that Group borrowings are 
variable in terms of interest rate. Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would 
not have a material impact on the financial statements.
b. Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales. There are 
certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales. The largest single amount outstanding 
at the year end was £2.6 million (2012: £5.9 million). The amount is secured against consented land. The Group retains these outstanding balances as 
trade and other receivables. The Group also carries credit risk with regard to available for sale financial assets which it classifies as other receivables. 
Whilst material in total, the individual risk is low given the high number of counterparties. Average exposure per transaction is £21,000 (2012: £20,000), 
and a second charge is retained to protect the Group’s interests. The carrying value of trade and other receivables equates to the Group’s exposure to  
credit risk. This is set out in note 3.2.
The Group’s trade and other receivables are secured against the following:
 2013 
£000
2012 
£000
Consented land 7,338 22,933
Second charge against property 46,404 45,553
Unsecured 34,375 49,276
 88,117 117,762
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction. This assessment is based upon management 
knowledge and experience. In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed 
of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
Company
The company’s exposure to credit risk is limited as a result of all outstanding balances relating to companies within the Group.
c. Liquidity risk
The Group’s banking arrangements outlined in note 4.3 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow 
needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk. The Group’s approach to assessment of liquidity risk is outlined in the section on the report on corporate governance 
relating to Going Concern which can be found on page 39. 90  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued 
d. Housing market price risk
The performance of the UK housing market affects the valuation of certain of the Group’s non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements 
applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress.

4.7 Financial instruments
Fair values
There is no material difference between the carrying value of financial instruments shown in the balance sheet and their fair value.
Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments:
Land purchased on extended payment terms
When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies 
based on this fair value assessment. Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.  
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance  
costs using the ‘effective interest’ rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the 
payment required.

Other financial liabilities
The Group determines the value dependent on management expectations of growth in the Lloyds Bank House Price Index. The liability is based on a future 
discounted cash flow for a nominal value tracking the index until March 2014.
Available for sale financial assets
The Group determines the fair value of its available for sale financial assets through estimation of the present value of expected future cash flows. Cash flows 
are assessed taking into account expectations of the timing of redemption, future house price movement and the risks of default. An instrument-specific 
market-assessed interest rate is used to determine present value via discounted cash flow modelling.
Fair value of quoted investments is based on the available price of those quoted investments at the balance sheet date.
Bank and other loans
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows. Interest free loans are fair valued using an effective interest rate method. 
See note 4.3 for further details.
Interest rate swaps
At each period end, an external valuation of the fair value of each interest rate swap is obtained from the relevant swap providers.
Trade and other receivables / payables
Other than land creditors, other financial liabilities and available for sale financial assets, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed 
to reflect the fair value. This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade 
with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
The Group uses an instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into 
Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets;
 Level 2:  fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 Level 3:  fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset/liability that are not based on observable 
market data (unobservable inputs). 92  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial statements

5.0 Other disclosures
This section includes all disclosures which are required by IFRS or the Companies Act which have not been included elsewhere in the financial statements.  
In our view, these disclosures are less important and/or material to the core operations of Bovis Homes Group PLC and as such they have been grouped 
together in section 5.
5.1 Income tax
Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable or receivable and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

5.2 Tax assets and liabilities
The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of  
previous years. Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability or asset 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will 
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when 
it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Current tax assets and liabilities
The current liability of £9,154,000 (2012: £5,719,000) represents the remaining balance of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior periods. 
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:

Factors affecting future tax charge
The 2013 Budget on 20 March 2013 announced a fall in the UK Corporation tax rate from 24% to 21% from 6 April 2014. In 2015 this will fall again 
to 20%.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further rate reduction, although this will reduce the company’s future 
current tax charge accordingly and reduce the company’s deferred tax asset (which has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date).
Non-current trade payables
The Group recognises differences between the fair value and nominal value of long term creditors relating to purchases of land for development and 
charges these differences as finance costs using the effective interest method. The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between 
fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost 
is charged on legal completion of the house sale. As at 31 December 2013, £10,194,000 (2012: £10,423,000) of finance costs had not received a  
tax deduction. The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to 
reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits
The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 (Revised): ‘Employee benefits’. This has 
generated a surplus of £3.2 million (2012: deficit of £3.2 million). As at 31 December 2013 a deferred tax liability of £863,000 (2012 deferred tax asset: £513,000)  
was recognised. Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  95

Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2: “Share-based payments”.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the Parent Company.  
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into 
account  the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on  
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity except when the share-based payment is cancelled 
where the charge will be accelerated.

Long term incentive plan
A long term incentive plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. One grant 
of awards under this plan was made in each of 2012 and 2013. Details of the vesting conditions of these awards are laid out in the Remuneration Report 
which can be found on pages 43 to 61.
Share options
The Group introduced a Share Option Plan in 2007 designed to provide middle management with effective incentivisation. Executive directors of the 
Company do not participate. This plan was approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting. 96  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued 
Save As You Earn share options
The Bovis Homes Group PLC 2007 Save As You Earn Option Scheme was established in 2007. Share options held in the Save As You Earn Option Scheme 
are not subject to performance conditions and may under normal circumstances be exercised during the six months after maturity of the agreement. Save As 
You Earn share options are generally exercisable at an exercise price which includes a 10% discount to the market price of the shares at the date of grant.
5.4 Property,plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes land and buildings at £9.7 million (2012: £9.9 million) and plant and machinery of £3.8 million (2012: 2.0 million).
5.5 Investments
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment. Following the issue of IFRIC11 in 2007, the Parent Company accounts for the  
share based payments granted to subsidiary employees as an increase in the cost of its investment in subsidiaries.

Transactions with Bovis Peer LLP
Bovis Homes Limited is contracted to provide property and letting management services to Bovis Peer LLP. Fees charged in the period, inclusive of VAT, 
were £147,000 (2012: £144,000).
Loans totalling £1,575,355 were provided in prior years at an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.4%. No other loans or sales of inventory have  
taken place. Interest charges made in respect of the loans were £46,000 (2012: £49,000).
5.6 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions include onerous contracts of £1.4 million (2012: £2.1 million) and other amounts of £2.1 million (2012: £1.6 million).
5.7 Employee benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 (Revised): “Employee benefits”. In respect of defined benefit schemes, the 
net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets. The discount rate used to discount the 
benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s 
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method. The operating and financing costs of such plans are 
recognised separately in the income statement; service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised 
in the periods in which they arise. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Pension cost note
The Company operates a UK registered trust based pension scheme that provides defined benefits. Pension benefits are linked to the members’ final 
pensionable salaries and service at their retirement (or date of leaving if earlier). The Trustees are responsible for running the Scheme in accordance with 
the Scheme’s Trust Deed and Rules, which sets out their powers. The Trustees of the Scheme are required to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries 
of the Scheme. There is a requirement that one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the Scheme.
There are three categories of pension scheme members:
• Active members: currently employed by the Company
• Deferred members: former employees of the Company
• Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings (allowing for future salary increases for active 
members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) and then discounting to the balance  
sheet date. The majority of benefits receive increases linked to inflation (subject to various caps). The valuation method is known as the Projected Unit Method.  
The approximate overall duration of the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2013 was 17 years. 98  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued 
Risks
Through the Scheme, the Company is exposed to a number of risks:
•  Asset volatility: the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, however the 
Scheme invests significantly in equities and other growth assets. These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide 
volatility and risk in the short term.
•  Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher 
defined benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in place). The majority of the Scheme’s assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only 
loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit. However, the caps in place limit the potential impact 
of higher inflation.
The Trustees and Company manage risks in the Scheme through the following strategies:
•  Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level 
of assets.
• Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
•  Pensionable Salary cap: Pensionable Salary increases are capped at 2.5% pa. Therefore, the impact on the Scheme of the Company granting salary 
increases above 2.5% is limited.
Retirement benefit obligations
The Group makes contributions to one defined benefit scheme that provides pension benefits for employees upon retirement.

Limitations of the sensitivity analysis
These calculations provide an approximate guide to the sensitivity of results and may not be as accurate as a full valuation carried out on these 
assumptions. Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are 
correlated.
Pensionable Salary increases are capped at 2.5% pa, as currently assumed, therefore changing the underlying assumption for future salary increases by 
+/- 0.5% has no impact on the liabilities

The most recent formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 June 2013. The results have been updated to 31 December 2013 by a qualified 
independent actuary. As part of this valuation exercise, the mortality assumptions for the scheme are now based on the CMI 2013 model with an uplift 
for future improvements in mortality in line with the medium cohort with a minimum improvement of 1.5%. These tables imply the following remaining 
life expectancy at age 65.
 
Remaining years of life at 65

Men 24.5 22.3
Women 26.9 24.6
As at 30 June 2013, an actuarial valuation was undertaken on behalf of the pension scheme trustee, which showed a deficit of £12.8 million at that 
date. The difference to the IAS19R basis results from more conservative assumptions on discount rate and mortality, as well as the additional special cash 
contribution of £2.8 million made during December 2013. A new schedule of contributions is in the process of being agreed between the Group and the 
pension scheme trustee. 
5.8 Related party transactions
Transactions between fellow subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation, as have transactions between the Company

Notes:
(i)  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and section 360 B(2) of the 2006 Act, the Company gives notice that 
only holders of ordinary shares entered on the register of members no later than 6.00pm on 14 May 2014 (or, in the event of any adjournment, on 
the date which is 48 hours before the time of the adjourned meeting) will be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting and a member may vote in 
respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in the member’s name at that time. Changes to entries on the register after the relevant deadline 
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 
(ii)  A registered member of the Company may appoint one or more proxies in respect of some or all of their ordinary shares to exercise that member’s 
rights to attend, speak and vote at a meeting of the Company instead of the member. A registered member appointing multiple proxies must ensure 
that each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attaching to different shares and must specify on the proxy form the number of shares in relation to 
which that proxy is appointed. A proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this Notice. 
If you do not have a proxy form and believe that you should have one, or if you require additional forms, please contact the Company’s Registrar, 
Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY. Members or their duly appointed proxies are requested to 
bring proof of identity with them to the meeting in order to confirm their identity for security reasons. A shareholder attending the meeting has 
the right to ask questions relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting in accordance with section 319A of the 2006 Act. In certain 
circumstances prescribed by the same section, the Company need not answer a question.
(iii)  The proxy form must be executed by or on behalf of the member making the appointment. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one  
or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the 
same shares. A corporation may execute the form(s) of proxy either under its common seal or under the hand of a duly authorised officer, attorney 
or other authorised person. A member may appoint more than one proxy to attend and vote on the same occasion.
(iv)  A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
(v)  Participants of the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan may instruct the trustee to vote on their behalf on a poll.
(vi)  The proxy form and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a notarially certified copy of that power or authority 
must be received at the office of the Company’s Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY 
or received via the Computershare website, (www.eproxyappointment.com) (full details of the procedures are given in the notes to the proxy form 
enclosed with the report and accounts and on the website) not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting. Completion of the proxy 
form, other such instrument or any CREST proxy instruction (as described in paragraph (vii) below) will not preclude a member from attending the 
Annual General Meeting and voting in person instead of through his proxy or proxies. The Company will announce the level of proxy votes for and 
against each resolution and the number of abstentions once the resolution has been voted on by a show of hands, except where a poll is called. 
When announcing a decision on a poll, the Company will disclose the total number of votes in favour and against and the number of abstentions on 
the Company website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk) and through a Regulatory Information Service. If a member returns both paper and electronic 
proxy instructions, those received last by the Registrar before the latest time for receipt of proxies will take precedence. Members are advised to read 
the website terms and conditions of use carefully.

Notice of meeting continued
(vii)  To appoint one or more proxies or to give an instruction to a proxy (whether previously appointed or otherwise) via the CREST system, CREST messages 
must be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number 3RA50) not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting. For this purpose, 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp generated by the CREST system) from which the issuer’s agent is 
able to retrieve the message. After this time any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be communicated to the proxy by 
other means. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed voting service provider(s) 
should contact their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) for assistance with appointing proxies via CREST. For further information on CREST 
procedures, limitations and system timings please refer to the CREST manual. The Company may treat as invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
 (viii)  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to 
the input of CREST proxy instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) 
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
(ix)  Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the 2006 Act to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated 
Person”) may have a right, under an agreement between him and the member by whom he was nominated, to be appointed (or to have someone 
else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise 
it, he may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement of the rights 
of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in paragraph (ii) above does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described in these 
paragraphs can only be exercised by members of the Company.
(x)   As at 3 March 2014 (being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice) the Company’s issued share capital consists of 134,099,952 
ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 3 March 2014 are 134,099,952.
(xi)   Under section 527 of the 2006 Act, members meeting the relevant threshold requirements set out in that section may require the Company to publish 
on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of 
the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold 
office since the last Annual General Meeting that the members propose to raise at the Annual General Meeting. The Company may not require the 
members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the 2006 Act. Where the Company 
is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the 2006 Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later 
than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes 
any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the 2006 Act to publish on a website.
(xii)  Under sections 338 and 338A of the Companies Act 2006, members meeting the threshold requirements in those sections have the right to require 
the Company: (a) to give, to members of the Company entitled to receive notice of the meeting, notice of a resolution which may properly be moved 
and is intended to be moved at the meeting; and/or (b) to include in the business to be dealt with at the meeting any matter (other than a proposed 
resolution) which may be properly included in the business unless (i) (in the case of a resolution only) it would, if passed, be ineffective, (ii) it is 
defamatory of any person, or (iii) it is frivolous or vexatious. Such a request may be in hard copy form or in electronic form, must identify the resolution 
of which notice is to be given or the matter to be included in the business, must be authorised by the person or persons making it, must be received 
by the Company not later than 3 April 2014, being the date six clear weeks before the meeting, and (in the case of a matter to be included on the 
business only) must be accompanied by a statement setting out the grounds for the request.
(xiii)  Except as provided above, members who wish to communicate with the Company in relation to the Annual General Meeting should do so using the 
following means: (1) by writing to the Company Secretary at the registered office address; or (2) by writing to the Company’s Registrar, Computershare

purposes for which and the manner in which your personal data is to be processed. The Company and any third party to which it discloses the data 
(including the Company’s Registrar) may process your personal data for the purposes of compiling and updating the Company’s records, fulfilling its 
legal obligations and processing the shareholder rights you exercise. Explanatory notes to the notice of meeting
Item 1: Reports and accounts
The directors are required to present to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting the report of the directors and the accounts of the Company for the 
year ended 31 December 2013. The report of the directors, the accounts and the report of the Company’s auditors on the accounts and on those parts of 
the directors’ remuneration report that are capable of being audited are contained within the Company’s annual report and accounts for the year ended 
31 December 2013 (the “2013 Annual Report and Accounts”).
Items 2 and 3: Directors’ remuneration policy and annual remuneration report
Under section 439 of the 2006 Act, the directors are required to present the directors’ remuneration report (other than the part containing the directors’ 
remuneration policy), prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (as amended), for the approval of shareholders by way of an advisory vote. The directors’ remuneration report, the relevant pages of which can be 
found on pages 50 to 61 of the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts, gives details of the directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2013 and 
sets out the way in which the Company will implement its policy on directors’ remuneration. The Company’s auditors, KPMG LLP, have audited those parts 
of the directors’ remuneration report capable of being audited and their report may be found on pages 72 to 73 of the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.
Under section 439A of the 2006, Act the directors are required to present the directors’ remuneration policy, prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended), for the approval of shareholders by way of a 
binding vote. The directors’ remuneration policy, which may be found on pages 44 to 48 of the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts, sets out the Company’s 
proposed policy on directors’ remuneration. A copy of the directors’ remuneration policy is also available on the website at www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk. 
or in hard copy on request from the Group Company Secretary. 
The vote on the directors’ remuneration report is advisory in nature in that payments made or promised to directors will not have to be repaid, reduced or 
withheld in the event that this resolution is not passed. In contrast, the vote on the directors’ remuneration policy is binding in nature in that the Company 
may not make a remuneration payment or payment for loss of office to a person who is, is to be, or has been a director of the Company unless that 
payment is consistent with the approved directors’ remuneration policy, or has otherwise been approved by a resolution of members.
If resolution 3 is passed, the directors’ remuneration policy will take effect immediately following the Annual General Meeting. A remuneration policy will 
be put to shareholders again no later than 3 years from the date of the Annual General Meeting. If resolution 2 in respect of the directors’ remuneration 
report is not passed, the policy will be presented to shareholders for approval at the next Annual General Meeting.
Item 4: Final dividend
Subject to the declaration of the final dividend at the meeting, the dividend will be paid on 23 May 2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 28 March 2014. 
Items 5 to 9: Re-appointment of directors
The UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) requires FTSE 350 companies to put all directors forward for re-appointment by shareholders on an 
annual basis. The purpose of this requirement is to increase accountability to shareholders. Accordingly, all the directors of the Company will retire at the 
Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-appointment, with the exception of Colin Holmes who is retiring from the Board. The Company’s 
Articles of Association require that any director appointed by the Board since the last Annual General Meeting shall hold office only until the next Annual 
General Meeting and, accordingly, Ian Tyler will offer himself for re-appointment on this basis.
The Code contains provisions dealing with the re-appointment of non-executive directors. In relation to the re-appointment of Alastair Lyons and John 
Warren as non-executive directors, the Chairman has confirmed following the formal performance evaluation conducted during 2013 that they continue to 
be effective in and demonstrate commitment to their roles, including commitment of time for Board and committee meetings. Alastair Lyons brings a broad 
range of business knowledge and skills to the Board, with a particular focus on mortgage lending and insurance industries. John Warren provides detailed 
financial and accounting expertise and has long standing experience in chairing audit committees. Ian Tyler was appointed non-executive Chairman on  
29 November 2013 and has considerable construction industry knowledge and international business experience.
The Board strongly supports and recommends the re-appointment of the directors to shareholders.
Biographical details of all the directors can be found on page 32 of the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.
Items 10 and 11: Re-appointment of auditors and auditors’ remuneration
The auditors of a company must be re-appointed at each general meeting at which accounts are presented. Resolution 10 proposes the re-appointment 
of the Company’s existing auditors, KPMG LLP, for a further year. Resolution 11 gives authority to the directors to determine the auditors’ remuneration.
Item 12: Authority to allot shares
The authority given to your directors at last year’s Annual General Meeting under section 551 of the 2006 Act to allot shares expires on the date of the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, this resolution seeks to grant a new authority under section 551 to authorise the directors to allot shares 
in the Company or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares in the Company up to an aggregate nominal amount of £22,327,642  
and also gives the Board authority to allot, in addition to these shares, further of the Company’s unissued shares up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £44,655,284 in connection with a pre-emptive offer to existing members by way of a rights issue (with exclusions to deal with fractional entitlements 
to shares and overseas shareholders to whom the rights issue cannot be made due to legal and practical problems). This is in accordance with the latest 
institutional guidelines published by the Association of British Insurers. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting 
(or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of the resolution). The directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
The amount of £22,327,642 represents less than 33.3% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital in issue as at 3 March 2014 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this Notice). The amount of £44,655,284 represents less than 66.6% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital 
in issue as at 3 March 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice). The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 
3 March 2014.
Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  105 106  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Supplementary information
Explanatory notes to the notice of meeting continued
The Board has no present intention to exercise this authority other than in connection with employee share schemes. It wishes to obtain the necessary 
authority from shareholders so that allotments can be made (should it be desirable and should suitable market conditions arise) at short notice and without 
the need to convene a general meeting of the Company which would be both costly and time consuming.
If the Board takes advantage of the additional authority to issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares in the Company 
representing more than 33.3% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital in issue or for a rights issue where the monetary proceeds exceed 33.3% of 
the Company’s pre-issue market capitalisation, all members of the Board wishing to remain in office will stand for re-election at the next Annual General 
Meeting following the decision to make the relevant share issue.
Item 13: Amendment to Long Term Incentive Plan
The Remuneration Committee completed a review of the Company’s remuneration policy with the introduction of the new reporting regulations for 
directors’ remuneration. This review particularly focused on long term performance related pay to ensure that it is appropriately set for the future and 
continues to be positioned appropriately in light of both individual and Company performance. As a result, the Board is proposing that the limit on the 
value of awards that may be granted under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) in normal circumstances be increased from 100% to 150% 
of an employee’s basic salary. Currently, the number of shares over which an LTIP award may be granted to an employee in any financial year may not 
normally have a market value at the date of grant (calculated by reference to the middle market price of a share on the relevant day) exceeding 100% 
of basic salary (this limit having been applied since 2004). All other terms of the LTIP will remain unchanged, including the ability of the Remuneration 
Committee to grant LTIP awards in exceptional circumstances with a market value of up to 200% of an employee’s basic salary. The Board is confident 
that this proposed increase is fully justified and commercially appropriate.
Item 14: Notice of general meetings
This resolution is required as a result of the implementation in 2009 of the Shareholder Rights Directive. The regulation implementing this Directive 
increased the notice period for general meetings under the 2006 Act to 21 days. The Company will be able to continue to call general meetings (other 
than an Annual General Meeting) on 14 clear days’ notice as long as shareholders have approved the calling of meetings on 14 days’ notice. Resolution 
14 seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, where it is intended that a similar resolution 
will be proposed. The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic voting under the Directive before it can call a general meeting on  
14 days’ notice. It is confirmed that ability to call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice would only be utilised in limited circumstances and where the 
shorter notice period will be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Item 15: Disapplication of pre-emption rights
Resolution 15 seeks authority for the directors to issue equity securities (as defined in the 2006 Act) in the Company for cash as if the pre-emption 
provisions of section 561 of the 2006 Act did not apply. Other than in connection with a rights issue or any other pre-emptive offers concerning equity 
securities, the authority contained in this resolution will be limited to the issue of shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £3,352,498 
which represents approximately 5% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital in issue as at 3 March 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of this Notice). In accordance with the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of Principles, the directors confirm their intention that no more than 
7.5% of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) will be issued for cash on a non pre-emptive basis during any rolling three-year period.
This resolution seeks a disapplication of the pre-emption rights on a rights issue so as to allow the directors to make exclusions or such other arrangements 
as may be appropriate to resolve legal or practical problems which, for example, might arise with overseas members.
There are presently no plans to allot ordinary shares wholly for cash other than in connection with employee share schemes. Shares allotted under an 
employee share scheme are not subject to statutory pre-emption rights.
The authority sought by resolution 15 will last until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting (or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of the 
resolution). The directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
Item 16: Authority to purchase own shares
This resolution renews the authority granted at last year’s Annual General Meeting to enable the Company to make market purchases of up to 13,409,995 
of its own shares, representing approximately 10% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital in issue as at 3 March 2014 (being the latest practicable 
date prior to publication of this Notice). Before exercising such authority, the directors would ensure that the Company was complying with the current 
relevant UK Listing Authority and ABI guidelines. No purchases would be made unless the directors believe that the effect would be to increase the earnings 
per share of the remaining shareholders and the directors consider the purchases to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders 
as a whole. Any shares so purchased would be cancelled. The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s 
ordinary shares but would like to have the flexibility of considering such purchases in the future.
Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) 
which may be paid for each ordinary share shall be the higher of: (a) an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for 
an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the 
Company agrees to buy the ordinary shares; and (b) an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share and the 
highest current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System (SETS). The minimum price (exclusive 
of expenses) would be 50 pence, being the nominal value of each ordinary share. The authority will only be valid until the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting in 2015.
As at 3 March 2014 there were options over 627,969 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which represent 0.47% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital at that date. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options would represent 0.52% 
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.
The directors consider that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders 
as a whole. Your Board will be voting in favour of them and unanimously recommends that you do so as well. Shareholder information

5 Chairman’s Statement
Alan Burns
Non-Executive Chairman and Founder
2010 was a busy year for Bahamas 
Petroleum Company and this success  
has continued into 2011 with our  
successful equity placing in March  
raising £45.6 million before expenses.
Dear Shareholder,
The oil business is one of the largest 
industries in the world and nations  
are divided into those that have oil 
and those that do not. Whilst there 
are strong geophysical indications  
of oil in our licence areas the only 
proof that there are deposits is to drill 
to find out. Noting that, The Bahamas 
has been drilled in the past and there 
is considerable drilling scheduled for 
this year in Cuban waters next to four 
of our licence areas, which gives us 
great encouragement. As we would 
expect, following the BP Macondo oil 
spill in April 2010, there has been a 
drive to update laws and regulations. 
We welcome this and understand the 
process is underway. We would only 
consider a drilling campaign under 
accepted international standards and 
procedures. In order to prepare, we 
have already taken the initiative and 
are undertaking an environmental 
impact assessment of our southern 
awarded licence and Cay Sal licence 
application areas.
We believe there is great incentive  
for drilling, both in terms of the 
requirement for oil products locally 
and for the oil revenues that the 
successful development of any oil  
find would bring for The Bahamas. 
For instance, The Bahamas 
government has recently revealed  
that the half-year Budget recurrent 
revenue estimates were down by  
a sum greater than 1% of gross 
domestic product (GDP). The 
Commonwealth of The Bahamas  
is particularly susceptible to oil 
pricing and imported supply  
as it is an archipelago with a 
dispersed population all relying on  
oil to provide their connection to the 
wider world. The islands are also 
highly dependent on tourism as a 
source of employment, which itself 
would not be possible without the 
supply of oil and gas for powering 
hotels, restaurants and other key 
tourist-related infrastructure. 
Furthermore, The Bahamas has been 
directly engaged in the oil trade for 
decades, with the major storage 
terminals on Grand Bahama providing 
significant revenues for the country  
so exploration activity can be viewed  
as an extension of its participation  
in the oil industry.
Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 6 We are pleased that we have found 
very promising structures in southern 
Bahamas waters remote from any 
Bahamian population and near the 
maritime border with Cuba. Cuba has 
announced that it will be drilling a 
number of wells in its waters adjacent 
to our licences and we are planning  
to drill our first well in 2012. While we 
have the right, we also have an 
obligation to drill our first well and are 
fortunate that the Commonwealth of 
The Bahamas is a nation with a well 
respected legal system, with our 
licences having been approved by 
two successive governments and 
signed into existence by both the 
Minister and the Governor General.  
Of course, post the Macondo blowout 
we would expect some improved 
drilling and environmental regulations 
to be in place prior to drilling 
commencing next year. 
Although the probable target is as 
good as I have ever seen in 40 years 
in the oil business we cannot be 
certain of anything until it is drilled.  
If it becomes a discovery, The 
Bahamas’ economy will be changed 
rapidly, bringing enormous benefits  
to every Bahamian. We are very 
enthusiastic about drilling and  
I thank you all for your support over 
the years with the many delays this 
extraordinary project has suffered. 
On 17 January 2011, we announced 
that Paul Crevello would take over  
my role as Chief Executive and that  
I would move to the role of Non-
Executive Chairman. This has been 
planned for some time but was 
brought forward due to my having 
been diagnosed with a medical 
condition which required surgery 
followed by a period of rehabilitation.  
I am pleased to note that we already 
had a succession plan in place.  
Paul had already been enlarging  
his team in The Bahamas and I had 
been enlarging the engineering team, 
readying the Company for the  
drilling programme. Accordingly  
the Company has not suffered from 
my illness. In addition, Mike Proffitt  
is taking a more active role as  
Finance Director.
We have been extremely fortunate in 
recruiting some fine young Bahamians 
and I feel certain they will greatly help 
to take the Company forwards into 
the future.
2011 is set to be a strong year for  
the Company and we look forward  
to updating you on our progress  
in due course.
In closing, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their support during 
the year and for the many best wishes 
I have received. I also appreciate the 
cooperation of the government of  
The Bahamas over the years and  
wish all Bahamians the very best  
for the future.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Burns
Non-Executive Chairman and Founder
We are pleased that we have  
found very promising structures

7 Environmental Report and the Oil Industry  
in The Bahamas
Bahamas Petroleum Company is dedicated to 
environmentally responsible exploration and 
preserving the environment for future generations.
The oil industry entered the 
Commonwealth of The Bahamas  
in 1947 with the drilling of the first 
exploration well on Andros Island. 
Over the following 40 years, four more 
wells were drilled across the country 
in onshore and offshore areas.  
In addition, two major oil storage 
terminals were constructed on 
Freeport and the country maintains 
one of the largest registries of oil 
transport tankers by deadweight 
tonnage in the world as at 1 January 2007 .
1
The five exploration wells in The 
Bahamas and five offshore wells 
drilled in adjacent waters of the 
Florida Keys were all drilled without 
incident. These wells were drilled  
in pristine marine coral reef 
environments or on adjacent islands 
and cays, and follow-up studies 
showed that the drilling activities did 
not impact the environment or the 
delicate coral reef communities 
(USGS). 
2
Andros #1 well, drilled in 1947 by 
Superior Oil Company, was drilled to  
a total depth of 14,585 ft (4,445 m) 
soon after World War II when oil 
companies began the search for  
more ‘Middle East’ type fields.

professional-paper/index.html.
Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 8 The Bahamas with their thick deposits 
of limestone, dolomite and anhydrite 
are similar to the geology of 
supergiant fields in the Middle East. 
The well encountered non-
commercial gas. Cay Sal #1 was 
drilled in 1958 on the shallow interior 
of Cay Say Bank, which lies in the 
southwest Bahamas between Cuba 
and the Florida Keys. This well was an 
early exploration wildcat venture by 
George Bush Sr. and Howard Hughes’ 
Zapata Oil Company and drilled by 
Gulf Oil Company. The well was 
drilled to 18,905 ft (5,762 m) with oil 
shows from near 7,000 ft (2,134 m) to 
total depth with no recorded impact 
on the environment. The well was 
deemed to be the first wildcat well 
drilled in the greater offshore waters 
of the Gulf of Mexico. Two wells were 
drilled in succession in 1970 and 1971 
onshore Long Island and in offshore 
waters north of Great Isaac (i.e. of 
approximately 31 km north of Bimini). 
The last well to be drilled in The 
Bahamas was the Doubloon Saxon  
#1 in 1986. This well was drilled in the 
shallow waters of the southwest of 
Great Bahama Bank near Gunchos 
Cay. It is the deepest well drilled to 
date in the region with a total depth  
of 21,740 feet (6,626 m). 
All of the wells contained indications 
of oil and gas. One well in the Florida 
Keys produced a limited amount of oil 
and the Great Isaac flowed limited 
gas and condensate to the surface. 
These wells demonstrate that the 
carbonate (limestone and dolomite) 
reservoirs drilled in The Bahamas  
do not contain the highly pressured 
reservoirs that occur off the 
Mississippi Delta, such as the  
BP Macondo well. Overpressured 
reservoirs are not typical of  
carbonate reservoirs. 
Alongside oil exploration, there is  
a long history of crude oil and refined 
petroleum products being shipped 
through Bahamian waters with the 
country hosting the fourth largest  
oil and petroleum products storage 
terminal in the world in Freeport, 
Grand Bahama. Oil loading and 
storage facilities were first installed in 
Freeport in 1968 with the construction 
of a refinery by Chevron Corporation. 
The refinery is no longer in use but 
the storage facility has expanded 
considerably. Known as The Bahamas 
Oil Refining Company (BORCO), the 
storage terminal was sold in January 
2011 by First Reserve Corporation to 
Buckeye Partners LP. The new owner 
intends to add approximately 7.5 
million barrels of flexible petroleum 
product storage to the existing 21.6 
million barrel facility. The expansion 
and upgrades will be phased in  
over the next two to three years  
with estimates of the proposed 
expenditure for the 2011 upgrades 
ranging from $200 million to $250 
million for the expansion of the jetty 
structure, the inland dock and berth 
developments and the terminal 
storage tanks. 
Statoil ASA acquired the rights to 
South Riding Point terminal, 35 km 
east of BORCO on Grand Bahama, in 
2009 for US$263 million. Statoil is 
investing between $200  
and $250 million in a major expansion 
project, including upgrades and 
expansions of the jetty structure, the 
inland dock and berth developments 
and terminal storage tanks in 2011. 
Both South Riding Point and BORCO 
facilities are undergoing growth  
and upgrading.
In addition, the port authority and  
shipbuilding facilities in Freeport  
are capable of providing petroleum 
services support and modest  
marine construction. We have 
investigated the reality of building up 
compartmentalised FPSO (Floating 
Production Storage and Offloading) 
units. Freeport has the capacity for 
expansion of the port in the event 
there is growth related to the 
petroleum exploration industry.
In 2007, Bahamas Petroleum 
Company plc was granted five oil 
exploration licences in the territorial 
waters and maritime Exclusive 
Economic Zone of the Commonwealth 
of The Bahamas. The licences 
encompass an area of approximately 
15,676 km
2
 (3,873,546 acres).  
As part of the Company’s long-term 
commitment to the development of 
the petroleum sector in The Bahamas, 
the Company is working to highlight 
and address environmental 
challenges and risks associated with 
industrial development in the area.
Ms Roberta Quant, a Bahamian 
environmental scientist, joined 
Bahamas Petroleum Company  
in January 2011 to manage the 
environmental aspect of the Company 
and ensure that environmental 
challenges and concerns are handled 
in a professional and sensitive manner 
with the ultimate goal being to protect  
the environment of The Bahamas.  
Ms Quant has worked for the 
government of The Bahamas as  
an Environmental Regulator and 
Protector and has a great deal of 
experience in environmental protection. 
Her expertise complements Dr Crevello, 
the CEO of the Company, who 
graduated from the University  
of Miami, Rosentiel School of Marine 
and Atmospheric Sciences and has 
vast experience with assessing coral 
reefs and understands the fragility of 
the marine and coastal ecosystems.

9 In June 2010, Bahamas Petroleum 
Company completed an 
environmental baseline study of the 
islands and islets of Cay Sal Bank, 
including Cay Sal (Island), Elbow Cay 
and Anguilla Cay with three marine 
and environmental graduate students 
from RSMAS University of Miami, 
Florida State University and Kansas 
State. The study showed that the 
beaches had varying amounts of 
minor contamination from tar residue, 
but overall the presence of tar was 
determined not to have been a 
contaminant from the Deep Horizon 
spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Preliminary 
analyses indicate the tar and asphalt 
found were derived from natural  
oil seeps. 
Cay Sal (Island) has less than 1% 
minor rocky coastline while the 
Anguilla shoreline is approximately 
60% rocky coast and Elbow Cay has 
no beaches and consists entirely  
of rocky cliff shoreline with 1 m  
to 10 m high cliffs. 
The Company successfully acquired 
2D seismic in June 2010 and January 
2011 by using the services of Spectrum 
ASA and Seabird Exploration (Osprey 
Explorer vessel) respectively. 
 
Both companies followed the 
International Association of 
Geophysical Contractors (IAGC)  
and the United Kingdom Joint Nature 
Conservation Committee (UK JNCC) 
guidelines for minimising the risk  
of injury or disturbance to marine 
mammals, as well as relevant local 
regulations. A scout vessel patrolled 
ahead of the seismic vessel in the 
course of monitoring the area, 
searching for marine mammals.  
In addition, the crew monitored the 
area but no marine mammals were 
identified during the surveys. 
Based on the positive results of  
the new 2D seismic the Company  
is progressing its exploration goals  
of initiating a 3D seismic survey in 
May 2011. A Letter of Award has been 
signed with CGGVeritas to use their 
Broadseis technology to acquire a 3D 
seismic survey commencing at the 
end of May 2011.
In late August 2010, as a result of  
the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion/
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico the 
government of The Bahamas imposed 
a moratorium on the consideration  
of any new oil exploration licence 
applications in order to allow the 
government to review the lessons 
learned from the spill and to establish 
a regulatory regime. Bahamas 
Petroleum Company is supporting  
the government’s efforts to establish 
regulations. The Company’s exploration 
programme is not affected by the 
hold-up. 
Bahamas Petroleum Company has 
initiated an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) inclusive of an 
Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP), an oil spill model study and  
a seabed geochemical study in 
addition to the 3D seismic programme. 
The EIA and EMP will be the first  
step of a series of submittals to the 
government to pave the way forward 
to a drilling campaign on schedule  
for 2012.
Bahamas Petroleum Company 
believes that exploration and the 
drilling of wells can be done safely  
in The Bahamas. The Company  
is dedicated to the protection of the 
environment for future generations 
and will ensure that internationally 
accepted drilling practices, policies 
and procedures are in place prior  
to undertaking a drilling campaign.

exploration programme in 2010 and 
the first quarter of 2011 by acquiring 
the first 2D seismic survey in the 
southern region of The Bahamas in 
over 25 years. The Company engaged 
Spectrum ASA to acquire an initial 
test survey of 194 km of 2D data 
designed to demonstrate the 
advances in modern seismic 
acquisition and technology over the 
vintage (1987 and older) seismic data. 
The vintage data was used by the 
Company to define the prospective 
500 million barrel leads reported in 
the Competent Persons Report 
published in 2007. 
The 2D seismic survey twinned 
selected vintage lines providing direct 
comparison of the new versus old 
seismic data. The test survey was 
unique in that we employed a 10 km 
long seismic cable versus the industry 
standard of 6 to 8 km. Previous 
vintage 1987 data was acquired using 
a short 4 km recording streamer.  
The longer cable and associated 
recording parameters were used 
because of the large size of the 
prospects, the broad curvature of  
the folds and the necessity to image 
deeper subsalt objectives. The 
Company took advantage of a seismic 
vessel transiting the region, resulting 
in significant cost savings.
The fully processed, Pre-Stack Time 
Migrated (PSTM) 2010 seismic data 
suggests that hydrocarbons are 
present in the southern area, 
indicated by what industry calls direct 
hydrocarbon indicators (DHI’s). DHI’s 
are interpreted indirectly by dim zones 
above the crest of structures, phase/
polarity changes at the crest of 
structures or by open sea floor vents, 
i.e. natural sea floor seeps, which are 
commonly associated with oil fields. 
The DHI’s, especially the vents, 
indicate an actively generating 
petroleum system.
Following the success of the June 
2010 survey, the Company engaged 
SeaBird Exploration (Osprey Explorer 
Vessel) in January 2011 and acquired 
a comprehensive, closely spaced 2D 
seismic survey in the southern fold 
belt. This survey was another first for 
the Company and The Bahamas in 
that it was the only closely spaced 
mid-water depth (i.e. ~ 500 m deep) 
survey to be undertaken in the 
southern Bahamas designed to map 
prospects. The survey (5 km to 10 km 
grid) focused on mapping the large 
fold belt prospects in our southern 
licences. The results are significant  
in that they define at least six major 
prospects that range in aerial size 
from 33 km
2
 (8,150 acres) to 465 km
2
 
(114,900 acres). Vertical 4-way 
closure, which is the maximum 
possible height for hydrocarbons  
to fill the structure, range from 100 m 
to as much as 1.5 km or more, 
depending on rock velocity 
properties. The seismic lines and 
associated maps clearly demonstrate 
the giant size and extent of the newly 
mapped prospects. This data is 
undergoing full processing through 
PSTM and will be passed on to Ryder 
Scott Consultants who will complete 
a resource evaluation of the prospects 
by the end of summer 2011.
The Company has awarded a 3D 
seismic contract to CGGVeritas to 
survey over the southern fold belt, 
which the Company will use to de-risk 
and prioritise the prospect portfolio. 
The Company intends to undertake  
a 2D survey over its northern licence 
where oil shows and a gas condensate 
reservoir were encountered in the 
Great Isaac #1 well. 
The joint venture licence application 
with Statoil over Cay Sal Bank  
is continuing to progress. The 
government of The Bahamas has 
requested that we undertake an 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) over the bank as part of the 
steps of moving the licences forward 
to the review and approval stage and 
these licences were gazetted on  
22 April 2010 as part of this process. 
The 2010 BP Macondo oil spill 
created a global shock wave across 
the industry and caused governments 
to reassess their drilling policies and 
procedures. The government of The 
Bahamas requested that the EIA 
evaluate the potential risks of our 
exploration area/programme as a 
prerequisite to awarding the licences. 
We expect to have clarification on the 
awarding of these licences upon 
completion of the EIA evaluation.
At the year end, the Company had 
US$6.1 million in cash and has firmly 
raised an additional US$31.4 million 
(£20.6 million) before expenses in 
March 2011, with a further US$37.9 
million (£25 million) before expenses 
which followed shareholder approval 
at an Extraordinary General Meeting 
held on 11 April 2011. The proceeds 
will go towards the acquisition of  
3D seismic and 2D shallow seismic 
(US$35.2 million), Geochemical 
sniffer/multibeam (US$6.4 million)  
and the remainder (US$27.7 million) 
on working capital and other 
exploration costs.
All in all, 2010 was an extremely 
positive year for the Company and 
2011 has already got off to a very 
strong start with the new 2D seismic, 
share placing and initiation of the 3D 
seismic survey. 
Outlook
I anticipate that 2011 will see 
significant growth in the Company, 
with the potential completion of 
further farm-ins to best position the 
Company, such that we enter 2012 
ready to drill our first of these giant-
size prospects. The Board continues 
to look to the future with confidence.
Yours sincerely,
Paul Crevello,
Chief Executive Officer

Giant Prospects – Bahamas Petroleum Company 
Map Structure Top of Cretaceous – PSTM Data
2011-2D PSTM Seismic Showing Top of Cretaceous Orange 
Horizon Mapped with the Newly Processed Data
Description: 2011-2D Seismic showing top of Cretaceous orange  
horizon mapped during survey to define structures
The processed PSTM (Pre-Stack Time 
Migration) such as the one shown  
here required several months to 
process with complex mathematical 
algorithms. These major structures 
were initially mapped during shipboard 
acquisition and verified the giant 4-way 
closure. The newly processed data 
confirms the size and closure of the 
initial shipboard interpretations and 
this table shows the exceptional size  
of each prospect.
The Cretaceous map shown was 
generated from the PSTM (Pre-Stack 
Time Migration) fully processed data. 
The horizon that the map is based on 
is the orange horizon shown in the 
underlying seismic cross-section. The 
bright areas on the map represent the  
highs on the horizon and the dark 
cool colours show that the horizon  
is very deep. The red and orange 
dashed lines outline the prospects.
The map illustrates four large structural 
folds that trend parallel to each other 
in a WNW ESE orientation. The folds, 
or anticlines, are separated by low 
synclines. Hydrocarbons are typically 
trapped in the crest of the anticlines. 
The structures range from 10 to 75 km 
long. The vertical four-way closure, 
which is the height to which oil can fill 
the structure, ranges from less than  
50 to 750 milliseconds in time. This is 
about 100 m to over 1.5 km thick.  
The seismic map demonstrates the 
prospects are indeed supergiant.  
Near term exploration will focus on  
3D seismic and sea bed geochemistry 
over these prospects and 2D seismic 
in the Miami licence.

Bahamas Petroleum Seismic Line June 2010 Survey
Reservoir and seals present across the northern field
2 km
Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 20 The 2D seismic line was acquired in June 2010  
across the southern licences of Bahamas Petroleum 
Company plc. The 2D line shows two major folds that  
are approximately 10 km across and over 1 second  
of apparent vertical closure. These structures were 
mapped as prospects in the January 2011 2D survey 
with the left fold over 70 km long and with > 1.5 km  
of vertical 4-way closure, i.e., 1.5 km of fill potential.  
The right fold is about 50 km long and ranges from  
100 to 300 m of vertical 4-way closure. 
Seafloor Seep or vent seen on the ocean bottom
The enlarged views of both folds show lateral continuity 
of strata across the width of the structures and, 
importantly, the lack of faults in the core of the structure. 
The right flank shows indirect evidence of an active 
hydrocarbon system by the presence of the sea floor 
vent or open hole. Preservation of the vent indicates  
that hydrocarbons are currently being generated today. 
These features are common in areas of oil fields. The 
Company will undertake a seabed geochemistry study  
to evaluate these sea floor features.

Internal Control
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve the Company’s strategic 
objectives. It cannot totally eliminate the risk of failure but will provide reasonable, although not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Going Concern
The Directors consider that the Company has adequate financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations 
through to the end of 2012 from existing liquid cash resources. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of preparing the financial statements. Further information regarding the appropriateness of the use of the going 
concern assumption in the basis of preparation can be found in note 2.1 to the financial statements.

Review of operations
During the year the Group underwent a Scheme of Arrangement which saw the redomicile of the Group from the Falkland 
Islands to the Isle of Man. The Scheme of Arrangement is described in greater detail in note 21 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
The Group undertook two placements of ordinary shares during the year, issuing a total of 189,842,860 ordinary shares 
and raising a total of $10,959,806 in funds net of fees.
The Group also saw the exercise of all outstanding share options during the year, resulting in the issue of 7,896,398 
ordinary shares to option holders and raising $574,882 in funds. 
Exploration work undertaken in the year has included the conducting of an environmental baseline survey in the Cay  
Sal region in June and the shooting of 2D seismic data in July. Analysis of the data acquired has allowed the Group to 
advance its understanding of the potential resource in the southern licence areas and has allowed the targeting of a more 
extensive seismic survey completed in January 2011. Preliminary results of shipboard analysis have proved positive with 
final results of the detailed analysis expected by the end of summer 2011.
Subsequent to the year end, on 16 March 2011 the Company announced the placement of 233,100,000 new ordinary shares 
at 18.75 pence per share, raising gross proceeds of £45.6 million in total. Of this placing, 110,000,000 ordinary shares were 
allotted on 17 March 2011 with the remaining 133,100,000 ordinary shares being allotted following shareholder approval at 
the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Members of the Company on 11 April 2011. It is intended that the proceeds of this 
placement be used to advance the Group’s technical work programme in its licence areas.

31 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable Isle of Man law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRS).
Isle of Man Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS. The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the financial position 
of the Group and Parent Company and the financial performance of the Group for that period. In preparing those Group 
and Parent Company financial statements the Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users  to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance;
State that the Group and Parent Company financial statements comply with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Parent Company will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions or qualifications  
as necessary.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group 
and Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group 
and Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the Group and Parent Company financial statements comply with 
the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the Isle of Man 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 32 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Bahamas Petroleum Company plc
Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying Group financial statements of Bahamas Petroleum Company plc which comprise  
the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2010 and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended and  
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. 
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable Isle of Man law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and 
for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s Members as a body in accordance with Section 15 of the Isle 
of Man Companies Act 1982 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the group financial 
statements are free from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of  
material misstatement of the group financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments,  
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the Group financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose  
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors,  
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Group financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
The Group financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2010, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; and 
The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Isle of Man Companies Acts  1931 to 2004. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 require 
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
We have not received all the information and explanations necessary for the purposes of our audit; and Certain disclosures of Directors’ loans and remuneration specified by law have not been complied with. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC

Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 38 The Scheme of Arrangement falls outside the scope of IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. Accordingly, following the 
guidance regarding the selection of appropriate accounting policies provided by IAS 8 “Accounting policies, changes  
in accounting estimates and errors”, the Scheme of Arrangement has been accounted for in these financial statements 
using the principles of merger accounting. This policy reflects the economic substance of the Scheme of Arrangement. 
Although the Scheme of Arrangement did not become effective until 15 June 2010, the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 are presented as if the Scheme of Arrangement had been effective on 1 January 
2009. In accordance with the requirements of merger accounting, the comparative information in these consolidated 
financial statements has been extracted from the BPC Limited consolidated financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2009. Those consolidated financial statements incorporated the results of BPC (Falklands) Limited and  
its subsidiary undertakings for the financial year ended 31 December 2009. Earnings per share are unaffected by the 
Scheme of Arrangement.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.  
It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The 
areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant  
to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.
Going concern
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able  
to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts that indicate that the Group will be able to meet its financial obligations 
through to the end of 2012 from its existing liquid cash resources and post year end placements of ordinary shares.
Additional cash resources may become available to the Group following the granting of three new exploration licences  
in the Bahamas resulting in the completion of the farm in agreement with Statoil and receipt of consideration funds. 
However, the Group’s ability to meet its obligations beyond 2012 is dependent on either further fund raising, completion  
of the Statoil farm in agreement or the agreement of further farm in arrangements of the Group’s licences.
a) Standards, amendments and interpretations relevant to the Group which became effective in 2010
IAS 36 (amendment), ‘Impairment of assets’, effective 1 January 2010. The amendment clarifies that the largest cash-generating unit (or group of units) to which goodwill should be allocated for the purposes of impairment testing is 
an operating segment, as defined by paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’ (that is, before the aggregation of 
segments with similar economic characteristics).
IFRS 2 (amendments), ‘Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions’. Effective from 1 January 2010.  
In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, and IFRIC 11,’IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, 
the amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were  
not covered by that interpretation.
b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are relevant to the Group but not yet 
effective and have not been early adopted
IFRS 9, ’Financial instruments’, issued in November 2009. This standard is the first step in the process to replace  IAS 39, ‘financial instruments: recognition and measurement’. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and 
measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the Group’s accounting for its financial assets. The standard is not 
applicable until 1 January 2013 but is available for early adoption. However, the standard has not yet been endorsed  
by the EU.
Revised IAS 24 (revised), ‘Related party disclosures’, issued in November 2009. It supersedes IAS 24, ‘Related  party disclosures’, issued in 2003. IAS 24 (revised) is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. 
Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted. However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards in future periods will have a material impact on  
the Group’s or the Company’s results.

39 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.2 Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses (including unrealised gains and losses on transactions between 
group companies) are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the Group.
The financial statements consolidate the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of the Company and its wholly 
owned subsidiary undertakings.
2.3 Segment reporting
All of the Group’s business activities relate to oil and gas exploration activities in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. 
The business is managed as one business segment by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who has been 
identified as the Chief Executive Officer (“the CEO”). The CODM receives reports at a consolidated level and uses those 
reports to assess business performance. It is not possible to assess performance properly using the financial information 
collected at the subsidiary level.
2.4 Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in United States Dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income. 
(iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) 
that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency  
as follows:
Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
Income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which 
case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and 
All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 40 2.5 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that  
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values,  
over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
– Computer hardware   3 years
– Computer software   3 years
– Furniture, fittings and equipment  4 years
– Motor vehicles    5 years
– Leasehold improvements  Over the life of the lease
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount (note 2.6).
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised within 
‘Loss on disposal of fixed assets’ in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
2.6 Impairment of assets 
Tangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment  
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Assets that are subject  
to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value 
in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-
generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal 
of the impairment at each reporting date. 
2.7 Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred which relates to more than one area of interest is allocated across the 
various areas of interest to which it relates on a proportionate basis. Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred by 
or on behalf of the Group is accumulated separately for each area of interest. The area of interest adopted by the Group  
is defined as a petroleum title.
Expenditure in the area of interest comprises net direct costs and an appropriate portion of related overhead expenditure, 
but does not include the general overheads or administrative expenditure not having a specific nexus with a particular 
area of interest.
Exploration expenditure for each area of interest, other than that acquired from the purchase of another entity, is carried 
forward as an asset provided that one of the following conditions is met:
The costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively by its sale; and
Exploration and/or evaluation activities in the area of interest have not, at the reporting date, reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and 
significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written off. Costs incurred  
in drilling exploration wells that fail to encounter significant hydrocarbons are written off in the year of failure.
Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010
Overview Business Review Corporate  
Governance
Accounts
41 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Exploration assets acquired are reassessed on a regular basis and related costs are carried forward provided that at least 
one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Expenditure is not carried forward in respect of any area of interest unless the Group’s right of tenure to that area of 
interest is current.
2.8 Financial assets
Other receivables
Other receivables are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance 
sheet date which are classified as non current assets. Other receivables are included in the balance sheet (note 14).
2.9 Cash and cash equivalents
For cash flow statement presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call 
with financial institutions, other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and 
bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts, where applicable, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance 
sheet.
2.10 Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2.11  Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year which 
are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade payables are recognised 
initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.12 Employee benefits
(i) Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave 
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non monetary benefits, expected to be settled within 12 months of the 
reporting date are recognised in other payables in respect of employees’ services up to the reporting date and are 
measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
(ii) Share-based compensation
The Group operates a share-based compensation plan. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange  
for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and 
share premium when the options are exercised.
(iii) Bonuses
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses. Bonuses are approved by the board and a number of factors 
are taken into consideration when determining the amount of any bonus payable, including the recipient’s existing salary, 
length of service and merit. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice 
that has created a constructive obligation. 
2.13 Revenue recognition 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method. 
2.14 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee  
are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) 
are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 42 3 Financial risk management 
3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to some financial risks: liquidity, market and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk 
management programme focuses on minimising potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.  
The Company’s activities are also exposed to risks through its investments in subsidiaries and accordingly are exposed  
to similar financial and capital risks as the Group.
Risk management is carried out by the Finance Director under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Finance 
Director identifies, evaluates and addresses financial risks in close co operation with the Group’s management. The Board 
provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as mitigating 
foreign exchange risks and investing excess liquidity.
(i) Liquidity risk
No profit to date
The Group has incurred losses since its inception and it is therefore not possible to evaluate its prospects based on past 
performance. Since the Group intends to continue investing in the exploration licences it currently holds an interest in, the 
Directors anticipate making further losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no certainty that the Group will achieve 
or sustain profitability or achieve or sustain positive cash flows from its activities.
Future funding requirements
The Group intends raising funding through the placing of ordinary shares and farm-outs of its licences. There is no 
certainty that the raising of sufficient funds through future farm-outs will be possible at all or on acceptable terms. This 
could substantially dilute the Group’s interest in the licences, however, given the size of the Group’s existing holding it 
would be expected, although there is no guarantee, that the Group will retain a significant equity interest in the licences.
Financial liabilities 
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise entirely of trade and other payables which all fall due within one year. The Group’s 
payment policy is to settle amounts in accordance with agreed terms which is typically 30 days.
(ii) Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and therefore is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency 
exposures. The exposure to foreign exchange risk is managed by ensuring that the majority of the Group’s major assets, 
liabilities and expenditures are held or incurred in US Dollars. At 31 December 2010 the Group held $945,777 of cash  
in Sterling (2009: $276,063) and an immaterial amount of trade and other payables denominated in Sterling.
At 31 December 2010, if the US Dollar currency had weakened/strengthened by 10% against UK Sterling with all other 
variables held constant, post-tax losses for the year would have been reduced/increased by approximately $95,000 
(2009: reduced/increased by $28,000), mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of UK Sterling-
denominated bank balances. Losses are more sensitive to movement in currency exchange rates in 2010 than 2009 due 
to larger amounts of UK Sterling currency held for corporate working capital purposes.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the Group’s cash deposits which are linked to short term deposit 
rates and therefore affected by changes in bank base rates. At 31 December 2010 and 2009 short term deposit rates 
were in the range of 0% to 1% and therefore the interest rate risk is not considered significant to the Group.
(iii) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks  
and financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating  
of ‘A’ are accepted.
3.2 Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern  
in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital 
structure to support the Group’s business operations and maximise shareholder value.
The Group is exposed to macroeconomic risks including, but not limited to, the strength of capital markets, the oil price 
and the risk of joint venture or supplier default, all of which could adversely affect the availability of future financing.

43 4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances.
4.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Going concern
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able  
to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts that indicate that the Group will be able to meet its financial obligations 
through to the end of 2012 from its existing liquid cash resources and post year end placements of ordinary shares.
Additional cash resources may become available to the Group following the granting of three new exploration licences in 
The Bahamas resulting in the completion of the farm-in agreement with Statoil and receipt of consideration funds thereof.
However, the Group’s ability to meet its obligations beyond 2012 is dependent on either further fund raising, completion  
of the Statoil farm-in agreement or the agreement of further farm-in arrangements of the Group’s licences. 
(b) Carrying value of exploration expenditure
Expenditure of $5,024,331 relating to the cost of exploration licences, geological and geophysical consultancy and 
seismic data acquisition and interpretation has been carried forward on the balance sheet at 31 December 2010  
(31 December 2009: $4,063,824). 
The consultancy expenditure incurred related to the gathering of historical data and the commencement of interpretation 
of this data.
Ultimate recoupment of exploration and evaluation assets carried forward is dependent on successful development and 
commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas.
(c) Prepayments
Prepayments comprise application fees paid to the government of The Bahamas for additional exploration licences, 
pending award. In the event that the Group’s applications are unsuccessful 50% of this amount is refundable to the 
Group.
No provision has been made in the accounts to write down the carrying value of these prepayments in the event that the 
applications are unsuccessful.

8 Income tax 
Until 31 December 2008 the Company was resident in both the UK and the Falkland Islands for tax purposes. Following 
the reverse takeover on 1 September 2008 all UK based operations and activities have ceased and therefore the Company 
migrated its tax residency to Jersey, effective 31 December 2008. This migration was subject to HMRC approval and  
a bank guarantee of £75,000 was provided to HMRC during the year ended 31 December 2008 pending finalisation of any 
remaining tax liability. During the current year, a further £75,000 was placed into the bank guarantee at the request of the 
Supreme Court of the Falkland Islands as a condition of the completion of the Scheme of arrangement (note 21), bringing 
the total USD balance to $232,211 (2009: $119,555). The Directors are of the opinion that any final tax liability arising from 
the UK or the Falkland Islands will be £nil. 
The Company’s 100% directly held subsidiary, BPC Jersey Limited is treated as a zero rated company under the 
amended Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961.
During the year, the Group underwent a Scheme of Arrangement which saw the Isle of Man subsidiary become the 
Group’s Parent Company, with the Group tax residency correspondingly being migrated to the Isle of Man. Companies 
incorporated and resident in the Isle of Man are subject to Isle of Man income tax at a rate of zero per cent. 
The Company’s 100% indirectly held subsidiary, BPC Perth Pty Ltd was dissolved in the year with no tax being payable. 
All other Group companies are within a tax free jurisdiction, that of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. Under current 
Bahamian law, the Company is not required to pay taxes in The Bahamas on income or capital gains.

45 8 Income tax (continued)
The credit to income tax in the year results from the release of a provision of $61,787 for employee benefit taxes in the 
Falkland Islands from previous years following agreement of a final assessment of $nil with the tax office in the Falklands 
Islands.
9 Basic and diluted loss per share 
(a) Basic
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
 
    2010 2009
    Group Group
Loss attributable to equity holders of the Company    $(5,318,458) $(2,425,421)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue    876,109,553 789,639,838
Basic loss per share (US cents per share)    (0.61) (0.31)
  
(b) Diluted  
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company had one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: 
share options. For these share options, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have 
been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on  
the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated as 
above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options. 
All outstanding share options were exercised in 2010. Subsequent to the year end the Company has issued share options 
to the Directors, employees and certain consultants (see note 22).

Total share options in issue (see note 17)    – 7,896,398
  
The effect of the above share options at 31 December 2009 is anti-dilutive; as a result they have been omitted from the 
calculation of diluted loss per share.

*  Exploration and evaluation assets and geological, geophysical and technical analysis    
Ultimate recoupment of exploration and evaluation assets carried forward is dependent on successful development  
and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas (note 2.7). These assets are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
At present the Directors do not believe any such impairment indicators are present.

As at 31 December 2010 and 2009, the Group has discharged all of its work obligations under the terms of the exploration 
licences and there is no requirement for the Group to commit to further exploration/evaluation activities in order to 
maintain the good standing of the licences.

iii) Annual rental commitments    
The Group is required under the exploration licences to remit annual rentals in advance to the government of The Bahamas 
in respect of the licenced areas. By letter dated 20 March 2008, the government of The Bahamas has approved a two 
year extension to the existing three year licence period which now expires on 26 April 2012. Although not specified, 
management has assumed that the annual rental for the licences during the two year extension period will be the same  
as the third year’s rental.
Rental payments on licence areas were resumed in the year due to the lifting of the Bahamian government requested halt 
on exploration activities.

51 21 Scheme of Arrangement   
On 15 June 2010 Bahamas Petroleum Company plc (formerly BPC plc) (“BPC plc”), a company incorporated in the  
Isle of Man, became the Parent Company of BPC (Falklands) Limited (formerly BPC Limited) pursuant to a Scheme of 
Arrangement approved by the Chief Justice of the Falkland Islands and the shareholders of BPC (Falklands) Limited,  
the then AIM listed holding company of the BPC Group (the “Scheme of Arrangement”). Pursuant to the Scheme of 
Arrangement, ordinary shares, each having a nominal value of £0.00002, of BPC Limited (“BPC Limited Ordinary Shares”) 
were exchanged, on a one for one basis, for ordinary shares, each having a nominal value of £0.00002, of BPC plc  
(“BPC plc Ordinary Shares”).
As a result of the Scheme of Arrangement, BPC (Falklands) Limited is now a wholly owned subsidiary of BPC plc.  
The BPC plc Ordinary Shares carry substantially the same rights as did the BPC Limited Ordinary Shares. The Scheme  
of Arrangement did not involve any cash payment for the BPC plc Ordinary Shares. Immediately after the Scheme  
of Arrangement became effective, BPC plc had the same Board of Directors, management and corporate governance 
arrangements as BPC Limited had immediately prior thereto. The consolidated assets and liabilities of BPC plc immediately 
after the effective time of the Scheme of Arrangement are the same as the consolidated assets and liabilities of BPC 
(Falklands) Limited immediately prior thereto.
BPC plc was incorporated on 25 August 2009. Prior to 15 June 2010 BPC plc was held in trust for the Group. The Group 
at the time maintained full control over the economic decisions of BPC plc.
All BPC Limited share options that were in existence immediately prior to the Scheme of Arrangement were exchanged  
on a one for one basis for share options in BPC plc with no change in terms or conditions.
On 29 December 2010, the Directors and shareholder of BPC (Falklands) Limited authorised a dividend in specie to be 
paid to the Parent Company, Bahamas Petroleum Company plc. As consideration for the dividend, BPC (Falklands) Limited 
transferred all of its net assets to Bahamas Petroleum Company plc, including its 100% holding in BPC Jersey Limited. 
22 Events after the balance sheet date    
On 17 January 2011 the Company announced the retirement of Alan Robert Burns as Chief Executive Officer of the  
Group and the appointment of Paul Daniel Crevello to this role. Mr Burns continues to serve the Group as Non-Executive 
Chairman.
On 3 February 2011 the Group completed the acquisition of 1,100 km of 2D seismic lines in its southern licence areas. 
Detailed analysis results are expected by the end of summer 2011.
On 16 March 2011 the Company announced the placement of 233,100,000 new ordinary shares at 18.75 pence per share, 
raising gross proceeds of £45.6 million in total. Of this placing, 110,000,000 ordinary shares were allotted on 17 March 
2011 with the remaining 133,100,000 ordinary shares being allotted following shareholder approval at the Extraordinary 
General Meeting of the Members of the Company on 11 April 2011. It is intended that the proceeds of this placement be 
used to advance the Group’s technical work program in its licence areas.
On 30 March 2011 the Company signed a Letter of Award with CGG Veritas to carry out the 3D seismic survey across the 
Group’s southern licence area.
On 12 April 2011 the Company issued 18 million share options to Directors, staff and consultants. The options have an 
expiry period of five years and are split into two tranches, 50% vesting on grant and 50% vesting when the share price  
of the Company reached 50 pence. Details of options granted to Directors are as below:

Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 52 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Bahamas Petroleum Company plc
Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Bahamas Petroleum Company plc (“the Parent Company”) 
which comprise the balance sheet as of 31 December 2010 and the statement of changes in equity and cash flow 
statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. 
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
applicable Isle of Man law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for 
such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 15 of the Isle 
of Man Companies Act 1982 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order  
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion  
on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
The financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Parent Company as of 31 December 2010, and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982; 
and 
The Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931-2004.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931-2004 require  
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
Proper books of account have not been kept by the Parent Company or, proper returns adequate for our audit have  not been received from branches not visited by us; or
The Parent Company’s balance sheet is not in agreement with the books of account and returns; or We have not received all the information and explanations necessary for the purposes of our audit; and Certain disclosures of Directors’ loans and remuneration specified by law have not been complied with.

Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 56 1 General information 
The separate financial statements of Bahamas Petroleum Company plc (the ‘Company’) are presented as required by the 
Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004.
The accounting reference date of the Company is 31 December. As these financial statements are the first to be prepared 
by the Company following its incorporation on 25 August 2009, they have been prepared for a period of 16 months.
The names of the Directors in office at any time during or since the end of the year are:

Paul Crevello Chief Executive Officer (appointed 30 November 2009)
Michael Proffitt Finance Director, Non-Executive (appointed 25 August 2009)
Dursley Stott Non-Executive Director (appointed 23 October 2009)
Edward Shallcross Non-Executive Director (appointed 1 February 2011)
2 Accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRS) and have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The Company’s accounting policies are in line with those of the Group, as detailed in note 2 of the consolidated financial 
statements.
Going concern
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able 
to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts that indicate that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations 
through to the end of 2012 from its existing liquid cash resources and post year end placements of ordinary shares.
Additional cash resources may become available to the Company following the granting of three new exploration licences  
in the Bahamas resulting in the completion of the farm in agreement with Statoil and receipt of consideration funds thereof.
However, the Company’s ability to meet its obligations beyond 2012 is dependent on either further fund raising, 
completion of the Statoil farm in agreement or the agreement of further farm in arrangements of the Group’s licences.
3 Loss attributable to members of the Parent Company
The loss dealt with in the financial statements of the Parent Company for the 16 months ended 31 December 2010  
is $643,104. As permitted by part 1 section 3(5) of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982, the Company has elected not  
to present its own statement of comprehensive income for the period.

Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
1 Introduction
Trading conditions in 2009 were some of the
toughest the automotive repair industry has seen
in recent times. Many smaller insurance repairs left
our marketplace as insurance policy excesses rose,
consumers tightened spending and the volume of
insurance claims reduced. Overall, I am pleased to
report that the Group negotiated these challenges
effectively and after a difficult first half, Nationwide’s
performance strengthened in the second half as
the management’s prompt actions took effect.   
Against this backdrop, results for the year are very
creditable and demonstrate the strengths of our
industry-leading business systems and processes,
which have enabled us to manage a volatile work
flow effectively.  
Nationwide’s financial position continues to be
very strong. The Group generates good cash
flows, has no borrowings and at the year end, its
net cash position stood at  £8.3m, substantially
higher than at the same point last year.   
We are pleased to recommend the payment of a
final dividend which maintains the total dividend
for the year at last year’s level.
Financial Results
Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2009
of £170.9m showed a 5% decrease on last year
(2008: £179.3m). This partly reflected the
reduction in insurance claims evident over the
year.  More significantly in terms of profitability,
the sales mix also changed as consumers
responded to the economic downturn and we saw
a marked drop in smaller cosmetic repair work,
which typically offers higher margins.  As we
reported at the half year, this change in the sales 
mix impacted gross margins in the first half,
reducing profitability by some £2.1m.  Following
management actions, I am pleased to report that
gross margins in the second half of the year
recovered strongly, moving from 44.3% in the first
half to 50.0% in the second half.  This six
percentage point improvement represents a very
strong turnaround and meant that the gross
margin for the year improved to 46.9%, from
46.5% in 2008. 
The statutory profit before tax (after non-recurring
items) was £5.1m against £7.1m in 2008.  Of this
£2.0m decline, £1.3m is attributable to an
increase in the IAS19 pension charge, which rose
significantly, from £209,000 in 2008 to £1.553m
in 2009. This higher level of charge is likely to be
maintained in 2010. The profit before tax before
non-recurring items was £5.4m (2008: £7.8m) and
earnings per share before non-recurring items
were 8.9 pence (2008: 12.8 pence).
The Group continues to generate very strong cash
flows and Nationwide’s balance sheet remains
robust, with nil borrowings and net cash of £8.3m
at 31 December 2009, some 53% higher than at
the same point last year (2008: £5.4m). This increase
in the Group’s net cash position reflects our focus
on improving working capital management.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to recommend a final
dividend of 3.3 pence per share (2008: 3.3 pence
per share), which maintains the total dividend for
the year at last year’s level of 5.0 pence per share
(2008: 5.0 pence per share). Subject to
shareholder approval at the Annual General

“...results for the
year are very
creditable and

strengths of our

business”
Michael Marx
Chairman Meeting on 15 June 2010, the final dividend will
be paid to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 28 May 2010.
Trading overview
It was a difficult year. The sharp and rapid drop in
smaller repair work was a marked feature in the
first half, with consumers avoiding non-essential
insurance repairs. The volume of repair jobs also
fell year on year, with the work flow harder to
predict than usual on a localised basis. While
trading conditions in the second half of the year
did not ease, there was a clear improvement in
the Group’s profitability as the measures we took
in the first half to protect and restore margins
yielded results.    
A large part of the management’s ability to manage
volatile trading conditions successfully derives from
Nationwide’s national scale and unrivalled operating
systems, which are underpinned by a single IT
platform. Our technology and systems enable us 
to manage our national network of bodyshops, 
call centres and mobile repair fleet in an integrated
manner for commercial and competitive advantage.
We believe that there is scope to drive further
operational efficiencies throughout the business 
and this remains a focus in 2010. 
It is pleasing to report that we were able to grow
our market share over the year, expanding our
relationship with RSA and signing new insurance
customers as well as new fleet customers.  
Our initiative to expand outside the insurance
market into the retail sector (where consumers pay
for vehicle repairs rather than insurers) continued 
to demonstrate good growth over the year. We are
now investing more significantly to develop our
retail sales and as part of this investment, we will be
making appointments to our senior management
team and expanding our mobile repair fleet.
Outlook
We do not expect market conditions in 2010 to
improve materially over last year.  However, as the
UK’s largest dedicated provider of accident repair
services, the group is well-positioned to trade well
and to execute its planned growth. We intend to
invest some £1m in the current financial year, over
and above our normal business development
spend, to support our expansion plans, which
have the objective over the next three years of
broadening Nationwide’s customer base and
developing additional income streams. Alongside
this, we will continue to build our insurance
customer business and to leverage further
operational efficiencies.
The business is underpinned by a strong balance
sheet and good cash flow and, looking ahead, 
we are encouraged by the growth opportunities
available to Nationwide and view long term
prospects positively.

71 Introduction
In a testing year, with reduced insurance claims
and a decrease in higher margin, light-damage
repair work, I am pleased to report that the
business has performed robustly. Nationwide
continues to generate high levels of cash and
profits and our dividends are comfortably
supported by earnings.  
I am especially encouraged by the recovery in 
the Group’s gross margins in the second half of
the year as the actions we took to manage the
downturn delivered the anticipated benefits.
Managing work flow efficiently through our
bodyshops is important in protecting gross
margins and our IT and integrated operations,
which include accident management call centres
and a mobile repair fleet alongside our national
network of bodyshops, are key to this. We aim to
lead our industry in service levels and customer
satisfaction and our focus on internal efficiency
also helps us to do this.  
The overall accident repair market is substantial
and, according to market analysts, generates five
million repair opportunities per year.  This equates
to a market spend in excess of £5 billion. As our
current market share is modest, the opportunity to
increase our market penetration remains exciting.
Currently, our core repair customers are motor
insurers and over the next three years, we aim to
broaden our customer base outside the insurance
marketplace, targeting consumers as well as fleet
operators. At the same time, we will continue to
develop our insurance relationships and to
capitalise on operational efficiencies.
Operations and Customer Relations
The accident repair market is mature and price
sensitive. Operating in such markets requires 
a methodical, measured approach to both
continuous business improvement and to
acquisitions. In 2009, as well as managing the 
downturn, our focus was on business
improvement and integrating previously acquired
sites. The six sites we acquired in 2008,
Scunthorpe, Gravesend, Redruth, Bristol, Kettering
and Perth, demonstrate the enhanced returns that
can be generated by the Nationwide model. In
2008, these sites incurred aggregate losses of
£230,000; by contrast, in 2009, the same sites
cumulatively contributed £273,000 to Group
profits. This process of looking for ‘continuous
improvement in performance’ is a key part of 
our culture and across our network of over 70
bodyshops, we see significant scope to continue
to raise performance levels to the benefit of both
customers and the business.
Our Operational Team focuses on delivering our
customers:-  
� Quality    � Value    � Speed    � Service
Our 2009 Customer Satisfaction Survey, which
contacts approximately 17,000 customers annually,
shows that the overall satisfaction of our customers
has increased to a record 87%, from 85% last year.
The same customers rated the “quality of the
repair” at 93%, reinforcing our confidence that we
deliver in this important area. The integrity of our
vehicle repairs is important to all of our customers
and to support this, in 2009, we took the decision
to implement, where appropriate, the industry’s
recently adopted British Standards Institution
Kitemark Standard (PAS 125). This standard allows
us to verify and demonstrate independently the
integrity of our repairs and equipment, the quality
of components used and the skill and competence
of our team. At the time of writing, out of a total
of 637 approved sites in the UK, 66 are Nationwide
bodyshops, representing some 10% of the total.
Value remains more difficult to quantify.  Insurance
companies are, by nature, price sensitive and our
ability to offer value remains a key factor in our
continued success. The 2009 account renewals 
Chief Executive’s Report

Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
“...customers rated
the “quality of the
repair” at 93%,
reinforcing our
confidence that 
we deliver in this
important area.”
Michael Wilmshurst
Chief Executive and wins suggest that we continue to offer value
and the recently released average repair cost data
confirms that we remain competitive.
The speed and the efficiency with which we repair
our customers’ vehicles is important to both car
owners who naturally want their vehicle repaired
and returned speedily and to insurers who can
often mitigate claim costs by rapid settlement and
repair. Our “cycle time” (key to key) measures the
time taken to complete a repair, from the day we
receive a vehicle on site to the day it is returned to
the customer. In 2009, this cycle time increased
marginally, from 12.5 days in 2008 to 12.7 days.
This increase is partially attributable to the slightly
larger types of repair we carried out in the period
but remains an area we can further improve.  
We believe that our planned expansion of our
currently small Mobile Restore operation (enabling
off-site repairs at customers’ premises), will assist
in the achievement of this objective, as will the
planned operational improvements at our sites.  
Offering a high level of customer service remains
at the heart of our offer and a key focus for us all.
The average satisfaction level confirms that we
continue to improve in this area. It remains our
objective to be a trusted and reliable provider of
automotive related services whether it be to
insurers, fleet operators or retail consumers.  
2009 also saw the continued development of our
Fast Fit+ offer, which provides MOTs and other “bolt
on” services, such as exhausts and tyres. Currently,
Fast Fit+ is being offered on a pilot basis at two of
our sites, at Kettering and Leicester. The move has
given us significant market knowledge and it
remains a potential area for further expansion.
Our national network of 71 wholly-owned
operational sites, linked by a single IT platform,
offers us unique capability in a highly fragmented
marketplace. This industry leading capability 
continues to prove attractive to existing and new
customers. As a result, 2009 saw the renewal and
expansion of our relationship with RSA as well as
new contracts with Equity Light Commercial
Vehicles, Broker Direct, Newline Insurance and BSM.
Network Services
Network Services provides our national network of
sites with important support. Key to this support is
its accident management service, which captures
new repair business for us and, critically, also enables
us to deploy repair work across our bodyshops in an
efficient manner. Our ability to direct work flow into
our national branch network continues to offer us
considerable market advantage.
Network Services also manages our Mobile Restore
and Mobile Solutions operations. Mobile Restore
currently operates a small fleet of vans which are
able to complete certain kinds of repair work ‘off-
site’ at customers’ premises or other preferred
locations. Typically this repair work comprises light
cosmetic damage, such as scratches, dents and
scuffs. We have now finalised our three year growth
plans for this business and will be launching a
‘business-to-consumer offer’, branded as ‘mobile
restore’ in the early summer. This business is
targeting, in particular, the ‘retail’ market, which 
we broadly define as those repairs not paid for by
insurers.  The retail market is estimated at £540
million and is currently growing, partly as a result of
increased excesses passed on by insurers. In 2009,
our retail sales generated £5 million of revenues and
the major part of this was achieved “on-site” i.e. at
our bodyshops. We are very confident that the
scope for us to increase our penetration of the retail
market through our ‘Mobile Restore’ operations and
our bodyshop network is significant.  
Our Mobile Solutions operations focus on glass,
electronic and air-conditioning related repairs,
which require specialist equipment and skills.  
Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
5
Originally established as a shared resource for
our bodyshops, this unit has potential for
growth and we have established a three year
plan for the business. As part of our growth
strategy, we have refined and enhanced its
offer and in the early summer, we will be re-
branding and launching it as ‘motorglass’.
Leading the development of both ‘mobile
restore’ and ’motorglass’ will be Steve
Thompson, one of our Executive Directors. We
will be strengthening our operational team to
support the growth plans of both businesses.
Looking Ahead
Nationwide has a sound balance sheet and its
model is highly cash generative.
Our unique operating platform gives us
considerable advantages in a market in which
we can significantly increase our penetration.
In the medium term, our objectives are:-
� to continue to improve our operations, 
increasing our ability to offer value, service, 
quality and speed to the benefit of our 
customers and our shareholders;
� to increase our share in the motor insurance 
company repair market and
� to identify and secure additional, and for us, 
largely new market opportunities in the fleet 
and retail market.
We are assuming that the economy will remain
challenging but are confident that the Group is
well placed for medium term growth.

Chief Executive’s Report Continued 6
Operating results
Overall turnover reduced by 5% from £179.3m to
£170.9m, which was indicative of a reduction in
claims volumes and consumer spending in general.
The change in sales mix and resultant decrease in
margin meant that operating profit after non-
recurring items fell by 18% to £5.5m from £6.7m. 
The Group reduced its cost base accordingly to
pre-empt any volume shortfall, with a year on year
reduction in distribution and administration costs
of £1.5m. 
Profit before tax after non-recurring items fell 
by 28% to £5.1m from £7.1m and earnings per
share has decreased by 28% to 8.4p.
Non-recurring items
During the year the group incurred a number of
non-recurring items. Firstly it recovered £171k
against the bad debt it provided for in 2008.
Secondly, the Group closed its Kidderminster site
and incurred a cost of £187k to exit the site. The
year also saw a significant drive to reduce costs
across the Group. This regrettably meant making
people redundant and £492k was incurred on
redundancy costs. Finally, as stated in note 5, the
Group experienced fires at two of its sites. A profit
of £200k was recognised on the “disposal” of the
assets at Norwich based on expected insurance
proceeds. The profit on the “disposal” of the
assets at Manchester was not recognised in 2009
as the insurance proceeds were not reasonably
certain. It will be recognised in 2010.
Pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit and defined
contribution pension scheme. The defined benefit
scheme was closed for future accruals on 31st July 
2006 with active members transferred to a new 
defined contribution section of the scheme.Under
IAS 19 the deficit in the scheme as at 31st
December 2009 was £20.3m (2008: £16.5m) or
£14.6m (2008: £11.9m) net of deferred tax. The
Group has agreed with the trustees to eradicate
the Scheme Specific Funding deficit by making
annual contributions of £2.6m for approximately
the next 9 years.
The Group has opted to amortise all actuarial
gains and losses above the corridor (10% of the
greater of assets and liabilities) over the future
working lifetime of the active membership. A full
actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme
was carried out as at 31 December 2008 and was
updated to 31 December 2009 by a qualified
independent actuary.
Cash flow
The net increase in cash during the year was
£2.9m (2008: an increase of £0.2m) which
produced a net cash balance at 31st December
2009 of £8.3m. This increase in cash is the result
of excellent working capital management and
credit control. Accordingly, trade receivables
decreased by £6.5m. 
The Company continues to invest in new plant
and equipment and in improvements to its sites;
£2.1m (2008: £2.8m). In addition, the Company
continues to pay a deficit contribution to its pension
fund of £2.6m (2008: £2.6m) and a dividend of
£2.2m was paid in 2009 (2008: £2.0m).
Allthough cash positive, the Group has a
committed bank facility with the Royal Bank of
Scotland for £8m until 31st December 2010.
“The net increase 
in cash during the
year was £2.9m”
Finance Director’s Review
Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
David Loftus
Finance Director Trade receivables
The Group’s trade receivables of £17.5m can 
be analysed between the three principal trading
units, NCRC (the bodyshops), Network Services
(the accident management company) and 
Mobile Solutions.
NCRC’s trade receivables are principally owed by
insurance companies and debtor days as at 31st
December 2009 were 33 days (2008: 38 days).
Network Services customer base includes
insurance customers and fleet operators and
includes debt invoiced by NCRC as well as its
Approved Repairer Network. Network Services
debtor days as at 31st December 2009 were 
31 days (2008: 47 days). 
Both business sectors have made a significant
improvement in their credit control procedures.
Tax
The effective tax rate is 28.5% which is slightly
ahead of the company’s effective rate of tax of
28%. The Group has no income tax losses
available but has capital losses of £4.1m available. 
Earnings per share 
The basic earnings per share are 8.4p (2008: 11.6p) 
a reduction of 28%. As a result of share options
being granted on 4th July 2006 and the average
market price of £0.90, the share options are not
included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation,
which remains at 8.4p.
Dividends 
The Board is proposing a final dividend in respect
of the results for the year ended 31 December
2009 of 3.3p per share (2008: 3.3p per share)
making 5.0p for the year as a whole (2008: 5.0p).
Subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting, this will be paid on 21 June
2010 to shareholders on the Register at the close
of business on 28 May 2010. The annual dividend
is covered 1.7 times by underlying earnings.
Key performance indicators
The Group reviews certain financial and non-
financial key performance indicators on a regular
basis and year-on-year comparisons are included
within the Directors’ Report. Despite inflationary
pressure it is very pleasing to report that the gross
profit margin has increased to 46.9% from 46.5%
in 2008. Cycle time is also a key measure of
performance and is measured across the group on
a weekly basis. The “key to key” measure i.e how
long a car is on site for has deteriorated slightly in
the year from 12.5 days to 12.7 days. 
Measurement of customer satisfaction is also a key
indicator and is measured monthly via a sample of
independent telephone surveys across all customers.
This has been increased to a creditable 87% from
85% in 2008.

Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 The Directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Principal activities and review of the business
As noted in the business review within the Chief Executive’s Report and Finance Director’s Review, the business of the Group is the repair of motor
vehicles and the provision of accident claim management services.
The strategy for 2009 was to improve margins within the core business and to introduce new insurance companies to branches where possible.
Considering the challenging economic climate, the Directors are pleased with the results for the year, which are in line with market expectations. 
This strategy will be maintained in 2010, together with a strategy to develop the Group’s mobile business and its retail sales opportunities. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors regularly review principal risks and uncertainties that affect the Group. These include avoiding the reliance on key customers for work
provision by diversifying contracts and extending the duration of contracts. The Group has implemented, where appropriate, the industry’s British
Standards Institution Kitemark Standard (PAS 125). This demonstrates our commitment to ensuring quality repairs.
The Group’s business continuity has been addressed by adopting a comprehensive disaster recovery program, which has been approved by the
Directors. In the event of a systems failure, work can be re-directed to an alternative bodyshop.
The details of the Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies are detailed in note 27 to the financial statements.

Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year and their interests in the shares of the Group are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 14. The Group has
taken out Directors and Officers liability insurance. J J Brade resigned as a director on 4 June 2009 and was replaced on the same date by C H B Mills.
Corporate governance
The Board is committed to the highest principles of corporate governance. As a Group quoted on AIM, the Group is not required to comply with the
requirements of the Combined Code.
The Board consists of three executive and three independent non-executive Directors, who take an active role in Board matters, and it meets eight times
in every year. The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and Group assets.
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee, consisting of the Chairman and C H B Mills, a Remuneration Committee consisting of the Chairman
and C H B Mills and a Nominations Committee consisting of the Chairman and Lady Judge.
The Audit Committee meets regularly with the external auditor and with the executive Directors to review the interim and final results, key areas of
accounting treatment and risk and control procedures. The Committee can meet with the external auditor without any of the executive Directors
being present.
The Remuneration Committee met in February 2010 and the Nominations Committee met in March 2009.
Employment of disabled persons
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment received from disabled persons having regard to their particular aptitudes
and abilities and wherever possible the Group continues the employment of, and arranges for reasonable adjustments to the working conditions of,
employees who become disabled persons while employed by the Group. Disabled employees are treated no differently from any other employees as
regards training, career development and promotion opportunities. The Group operated this policy throughout the year.
Directors’ Report

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
11 Directors’ Report 
Employee involvement
Effective employee relations are seen as key drivers in moving the Group forward. Consequently human resources, quality, health and safety and
training functions need to establish good communications with individual sites and are therefore organised on a divisional basis. This structure
enables staff to obtain the help and guidance they may need and keeps them informed of, and effectively involved in, the development of the
Group’s business. Regular review meetings are held at local, divisional and Group level to ensure that all employees are kept informed of the Group’s
objectives. Progress towards those objectives is measured and reported back to individual sites.
Supplier payment policy
The Group requires its subsidiaries to negotiate clear and satisfactory arrangements for the payment of suppliers, as part of the overall terms and
conditions of the supply and to make payment accordingly. Group trade creditor days at the end of the year were 54 (2008: 52). The Company trade
creditor days at the end of the year were 31(2008: 29).  
Share capital
Full details of the authorised and issued share capital of the Group are set out in note 21 to the accounts.
Summary of key performance indicators
The Directors have monitored the progress of the overall Group/Company strategy and the individual strategic elements by reference to certain
financial and non-financial key performance indicators.
Key performance indicator 2009 2008 Method of calculation
Turnover £170.9m £179.3m External turnover excluding value added tax

On behalf of the Board:
Michael Wilmshurst
Chief Executive
22 March 2010 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs). The financial
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of the profit or loss of the
Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to:
�
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
�
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
�
state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
�
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time the financial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as the Directors are aware:
�
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
�
the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from other legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

1. Nature of operations
Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc and its subsidiaries’ (the Group) principal activity is the provision of support services to the motor insurance
industry. Currently, this includes the repair of motor vehicles in the Group’s wholly owned sites and the provision of accident claim management services.
The strategy for 2009 was to maintain the profitability of the core business, to achieve consistency in margins and to introduce new insurance companies
to branches where possible. The integration of newly acquired sites was also paramount. Considering the challenging economic climate, the Directors are
comfortable with the results for the year and this strategy will be maintained in 2010, together with a strategy to develop the Group’s mobile business
and its retail sales opportunities.
The following is a list of the principal subsidiary undertakings of which Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc is either directly, or through subsidiary
undertakings, the beneficial owner of the whole of the equity share capital. All companies are engaged in motor trade activities. All are incorporated in
England and Wales.

2. General information
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by the EU and as developed and published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The measurement basis for individual items has been noted in the accounting policies below.
3. Summary of accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies have remained unchanged from the previous year,
except as noted below with regard to IAS 1 and IFRS8.
It should be noted that accounting estimates and assumptions are used in preparing the financial statements including the carrying amount of
goodwill (note 11) and provisions (note 22). Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions,
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The following significant judgements have been made in the financial statements: 
Intangible assets : Provisional fair values are placed on all property, plant and equipment at the date of acquisition, as certain asset values are
required to be estimated. No intangible asset arises on acquisition.
Onerous leases : Consideration has been given to the liabilities over the remaining life of  leases in respect of empty properties and the probability of
sub-letting these properties
Bad Debts : Consideration is given to those amounts which are overdue by more than 120 days and for which no cash has been received after the
year end. Impairment of those amounts is made where considered necessary.
Fire Claim : The directors have only included the estimated insurance proceeds from the fire claim where they could be reliably measured. Further
details are provided within note 5 to the financial statements
Pension Assumptions : The present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) at the balance sheet date and the amounts recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income are determined by an independent actuary based on assumptions detailed in note 15 to the financial
statements.
Depreciation : In accordance with  IAS 16, the Group has revised its estimate of the useful economic life of certain items of property, plant and
equipment. The impact on the financial statements was to reduce the depreciation charge by £545k (2008 : Nil)
The adoption of IAS 1 (Revised 2007) has not affected the financial position or profits of the Group, but gives rise to additional disclosures. IAS 1
(Revised 2007) introduces a “Statement of comprehensive income” The Group has chosen to prepare a single statement of comprehensive income
which incorporates the income statement and statement of other comprehensive income. The adoption of IFRS 8 has changed the segments that are
disclosed in the financial statements. Under IFRS 8, the accounting policy for identifying segments is now based on the internal management
reporting information that is regularly reviewed at Board level. Consequently, the results for the year of Network Services (Nationwide) and Mobile
Solutions have been separately identified and have been disclosed in note 4. Although the change in accounting policies in adopting IFRS 8 is
retrospective, the third balance sheet for the year ended 31 December 2007 has not been presented, because the information is unchanged from the
previously published financial statements.
The following Standards and Interpretations have been issued, but are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the group: 
- IFRS 9 Financial statements (effective 1 January 2013) 
- IAS 24 (Revised 2009) Related Party Disclosures (effective 1 January 2011) 
- IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Revised 2008) (effective 1 July 2009) 
- Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items (effective 1 July 2009) 
- Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions – Amendment to IFRS 2 (effective 1 January 2010) 
- Improvements to IFRSs 2009 (various effective dates, earliest of which is 1 July 2009, but mostly 2010) 
- IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised 2008) (effective 1 July 2009) 
- IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners (effective 1 July 2009) 
- IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers (effective prospectively for transfers on or after 1 July 2009)

As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, an income statement is not presented for Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc. Profit
for the year for Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc (the Company) was £2,255,984 (2008: £3,136,323).
Going Concern
The company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out in the
Business Review on pages 2 to 5. The financial position of the company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the
Finance Director’s Review on pages 6 to 7. In addition, note 27 to the financial statements includes the company’s objectives, policies and processes
for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Based on their review of the above, and consideration of the long term contracts with some of the main insurance companies and key suppliers, 
the directors believe that the company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook. The
directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has power to control the financial and operating policies, with a view to obtaining benefits. The
consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company as well as those entities controlled by the Group by 
full consolidation.
In addition, acquired subsidiaries and non subsidiary acquisitions are subject to the application of the purchase method. This involves the revaluation 
at fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not
they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are
included in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values, which are also used as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with Group
accounting policies. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets of the acquired
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated and unrealised losses are
eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Amounts reported in the financial statements of
subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income
for their respective periods of ownership. Inter-Company trading is eliminated from these accounts where appropriate.
Income and expense recognition
Revenue for Nationwide Crash Repair Centres Ltd is recognised upon the completion of the service after authority has been given by the customer to
undertake this work. Network Services (Nationwide) Limited recognises referral fee income based upon the number of jobs invoiced in a particular
accounting period. Intra-Group sales and value added tax are excluded from the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses (with the
exception of the IAS 19 pension adjustment) are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income upon utilisation of the service. Interest income
and expenditure are reported on an accruals basis.
Fire Claims
Gains arising from the receipt of insurance proceeds in excess of asset net book values, are only recognised when the insurance proceeds can be
determined with reasonable certainty. This is dependent on the site’s planned reopening date.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets
acquired less accumulated impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost.
Buildings, fittings and furniture are carried at acquisition cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis taking into account estimated residual values. Both estimated
residual values and useful economic life are reviewed annually.
The useful lives of property, plant and equipment can be summarised as follows:
Land – Nil
Buildings – 5 to 25 years
Plant and equipment – 3 to 10 years
IT equipment – 2 to 5 years
Land is not depreciated as it has an unlimited useful economic life.
On adopting IFRS, the Group and Company have taken advantage of the transitional rule that allows previously revalued fixed assets to be deemed to be
at cost.
Leases
Payments on operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term. Operating leases are those agreements where
the risk and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the lessee.

Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
The Group’s goodwill and property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is
allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest
level within the Group at which management controls the related cash flows.
Individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-
generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value in use, based on an internal discounted cash
flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying
amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of
goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Inventories
Inventories comprise materials and direct labour. At the balance sheet date inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Inventories are valued using the weighted average cost method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less any applicable selling expenses.
Accounting for income taxes
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting
period, that are unpaid at the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which
they relate, based on the taxable income for the year. All changes to current tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in
the statement of comprehensive income.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of
goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting
profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary
differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to
be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be
offset against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to
their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is on the annual
share option is recognised as a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet.
Most changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the statement of comprehensive income. Only
changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities that relate to a change in value of assets or liabilities that are charged directly to equity are charged or
credited directly to equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand as well as short term highly liquid investments such as money market instruments and
bank deposits.
Financial assets
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised, after initial recognition, at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, as
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Equity
Share capital is determined using the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium includes any premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are
deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
The revaluation reserve comprises gains and losses due to the revaluation of property, plant and equipment.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.
The capital redemption reserve was created on the acquisition by the Company of its own shares.
Share based payments
The Group operates two employee share option schemes. The fair value at the date at which the share options are granted is recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the vesting period, taking into account the number of options that are expected to
vest. In valuing the share options the Group has utilised the Black-Scholes option pricing model for tranche 1 of the options and the Monte Carlo
model for tranche 2 of the options with the weighted average share price being factored into the model. The expected life of the options has been
assumed to be three years for tranche 1 and five years for tranche 2 with the options being exercisable between three and ten years. The tranche 2
options have market conditions taken into account in the calculation of the fair value at grant date and do not impact the number of awards expected
to vest. The model assumptions used are included within note 21. No adjustments are made if the conditions are not met.

Pension obligations and short term employee benefits
Pensions to employees are provided through a defined benefit plan as well as a defined contribution plan.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent
on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary. The legal obligation for any benefits from this kind of pension plan remains with the
Group, even if plan assets for funding the defined benefit plan have been acquired. Plan assets may include assets specifically designated to a long
term benefit fund as well as qualifying insurance policies.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independent entity. The Group has no legal or
constructive obligation to pay further contributions after payment of the fixed contribution.
The asset/liability recognised in the balance sheet for defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) at the
balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the DBO is determined by
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are not recognised as an expense unless the total unrecognised gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the obligation
and related plan assets. The amount exceeding this 10% is charged or credited to profit or loss over the employees’ expected average remaining
working lives. Actuarial gains and losses within the 10% corridor are disclosed separately. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the
statement of comprehensive income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified
period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The contributions recognised in respect of defined contribution plans are expensed as they fall due. Liabilities and assets may be recognised if
underpayment or prepayment has occurred and are included in current liabilities or current assets as they are normally of a short term nature.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other payables. They are included in balance sheet line item ‘long term
financial liabilities’ and ‘trade and other payables’. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, through the statement of comprehensive
income, less settlement payments.
Dividend distributions to shareholders are included in ‘other short term financial liabilities’ when the dividends are approved by the shareholders’ meeting.
Other provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Other provisions are recognised when present obligations will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Group and they can be
estimated reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. A present obligation arises from the presence of a legal or constructive
commitment that has resulted from past events. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at the
balance sheet date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Any reimbursement expected to be received in the
course of settlement of the present obligation is recognised, if virtually certain as a separate asset, not exceeding the amount of the related provision.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class
of obligations as a whole. In addition, long term provisions are discounted to their present values, where time value of money is material.
All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resource as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, or the amount
to be provided for cannot be measured reliably, no liability is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, unless assumed in the course of a
business combination. These contingent liabilities are recognised in the course of the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired
in the business combination. They are subsequently measured at the higher amount of a comparable provision as described above and the amount
initially recognised, less any amortisation.
Probable inflows of economic benefits to the Group that do not yet meet the recognition criteria of an asset are considered contingent assets.
Investment in subsidiaries
Investments are valued at cost less any impairment and after deducting any dividends paid out of pre-acquisition profits.
4. Segment Analysis
The Group operates three main business segments, Nationwide Crash Repair Centres (NCRC), Network Services and Mobile Solutions (which
incorporates Mobile Restore). The former is the core business and comprises a dedicated network of repair centres across England, Scotland and
Wales. Network Services provides accident administration services to insurance companies and fleet operators, in the main deploying work to
Nationwide Crash Repair Centres Limited, while Mobile Solutions provides glass, air conditioning and auto-electronic services to the automotive
industry. Mobile Restore provides minor cosmetic repairs at the customers’ premises. The income and costs of the holding company are shown within
NCRC, which acts as the support function for the Nationwide Crash Repair Centres bodyshops.
The revenues and net result generated by the three business segments are summarised as follows:

During the year, the company suffered two fires at its sites in Manchester (August 09) and Norwich (September 09). The Group’s insurers have
accepted liability for the respective claims, which cover the loss of assets and business interruption (lost profits).
Included within Trade and other receivables as at 31 December 2009 is an amount of £1,336k which relates to amounts claimed under the policy.
This is after taking into account an interim payment from the insurers of £675k that was received in December 2009.
The Norwich site is planned to reopen in April 2010 and since the insurance proceeds could be reliably measured, a profit of £200k has been
recognised. The profit has arisen as the insurance proceeds of £300k are in settlement of fixed assets with a net book value of £100k. The gain on
the Manchester site could not be reliably measured, as the site is not expected to be operational until July 2010 and insurance recoveries were not
reasonably certain.

Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated using the net results attributable to the shareholders of the Company of £3,617,000 (2008: £5,022,000).
The weighted average number of outstanding shares used for basic earnings per share amounted to 43,197,220 (2008: 43,264,023).
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated using the net results attributable to the shareholders of the Company of £3,617,000  (2008: £5,022,000).
The weighted average number of outstanding shares used for diluted earnings per share amounted to 43,197,220 (2008: 43,672,070) and assumes that
none of the share options detailed in note 21 would be exercised given the average market price of £0.90
In the current year due to the average market price of £0.90, the share options are not included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation. In 2008,
the average market price was £1.23 and on this basis, the dilutive effect on weighted average shares at this price was 408,047.   
Underlying earnings per share
The underlying earnings per share has been calculated as follows:

Dividends
During 2009, the Company paid dividends of £2,160,000 (2008: £2,030,000) to its equity shareholders. 
These comprised:
– a final dividend in respect of 2008 of 3.3p per share paid in June 2009 (£1,426,000); and
– an interim dividend in respect of 2009 of 1.7p per share paid in November 2009 (£734,000).
The Board is proposing a final dividend in respect of the results for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 3.3p per share.

During the year, an adjustment of £16,000 was made to increase the goodwill of the Perth acquisition by £11,000 and the Redruth acquisition by
£5,000. This related to further costs of acquisition which were known but not quantifiable at that 31 December 2008.
All the above acquisitions are acquisitions on behalf of Nationwide Crash Repair Centres Limited, with the exception of Aquilo Motor Services which
was on behalf of Network Services (Nationwide) Limited.
Business of Gemini Accident Repair Centres
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units acquired. The recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units
determined above are based on value in use calculations, covering a detailed one year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows
using a 2.5% growth rate. These cash flows were extrapolated over ten years and discounted using a rate of 5%. A ten year period has been chosen
because management’s experience and knowledge of the business indicates that equivalent sites have a useful economic life in excess of ten years.
Management’s key assumptions for these cash-generating units include stable profit margins and resulting cash flows which have been determined
based on past experience in this market. The Group is not currently aware of any reasonable possible changes which would necessitate changes in its
key assumptions. 
Business of Aquilo Motor Services
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units acquired. The recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units
determined above are based on value in use calculations, covering a detailed one year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows

chosen because management’s experience and knowledge of the business indicates that equivalent business have a useful economic life in excess of
five years. Management’s key assumptions for these cash-generating units include stable profit margins and resulting cash flows which have been
determined based on past experience in this market. The Group is not currently aware of any probable changes which would necessitate changes in
its key assumptions.
Businesses acquired in 2008
During 2008 five businesses were acquired. Scunthorpe and Gravesend (February 08), Redruth (April 08), Kettering (October 08) and Perth
(November 08).The recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units determined above are based on value in use calculations, covering a detailed

and Hull (November 07). The recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units determined above are based on value in use calculations, covering a
detailed one year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows using a 2.5% growth rate. These cash flows were extrapolated over
ten years and discounted using a rate of 5%. A ten year period has been chosen because management’s experience and knowledge of the business
indicates that equivalent sites have a useful economic life in excess of ten years. Management’s key assumptions for these cash-generating units
include stable profit margins and resulting cash flows which have been determined based on past experience in this market.

15. Pension and other employee assets/obligations
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK which offers both pensions in retirement and death
benefits to members. Since 1 January 2002 the defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members.  The assets of the schemes are administered by
trustees independent of the Group. The Company made contributions of £2,583,000 (2008: £2,555,000) to the defined benefit scheme during the year.
The defined benefit scheme was closed for future accruals on 31 July 2006 with active members transferred to a new defined contribution section of the
scheme. In 2010 the company agreed with the trustees of the pension scheme to make annual contributions of  £2.6 million and the contribution is
expected to be £2.6 million in the year to 31 December 2010. This was agreed with a view to eradicating the Scheme Specific Funding deficit over a
period of approximately nine years.
The Group has opted to amortise all actuarial gains and losses above the corridor (10% of the greater of assets and liabilities) over the future working
lifetime of the active membership.
A full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2008 and was updated to 31 December 2009 by a qualified
independent actuary.

Discount rate 6.0 6.5 6.1 5.4
Inflation assumption 3.50 2.70 3.15 2.85 
The assumptions used in determining the overall expected return of the scheme have been set with reference to yields available on government bonds and
appropriate risk margins. The pre and post retirement mortality assumptions use the A92 and PA92 tables respectively. The 1992 series of mortality tables
were published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau and are based on mortality data from life assurance companies over the years 1991 to
1994 inclusive. The “A92” tables are based on the mortality experience of life assurance policyholders. The “PA92” tables are based on the mortality
experience of pension annuity policyholders.

All the above options were issued on 4 July 2006 and no additional share options have been granted since this date.
In total, £169,000 of employee compensation expense has been included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2009 (2008:
£240,000). The corresponding credit is taken to shareholders’ funds. No liabilities were recognised due to share based transactions.
Each Director has been granted two transfers of options. The first tranche is not subject to any vesting conditions and the second tranche is subject
to achievement of a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. Under both tranches, vested options can be exercised at any time between the
third and tenth anniversary of the date of the grant.
The accounting policy for share based payments is included within note 3, and the following have been factored into the model:
Exercise prices of £1.11 and £1.165, expected volatility of 25%, dividend yield of 3.00%, equivalent risk free rate of return being the rate of return
on zero-coupon Government bonds with a term equal to the expected life assumptions.
The Company’s assumptions regarding the volatility of its shares have been based on a review of market and competitors’ volatility.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
i) to safeguard the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for 
other stakeholders, and 
ii) to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

Group and Company
The Group and Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks which result from both its operating and investing activities. The Group and Company’s risk
management is coordinated at its headquarters and is regularly discussed by the Board of Directors. The Group and Company does not engage in the trading
of financial assets nor does it write options. The most significant financial risks to which the Group and Company is exposed to are described below:
i) Credit risk

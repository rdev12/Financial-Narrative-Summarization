Key highlights
2016 was another year of strong growth in revenue, profits 
and cash flows. Key highlights were:
• our listing on the London Stock Exchange;
• the launch of Money20/20 Europe, Lions Entertainment,
Bett Middle East, WGSN Insight and the WGSN single
platform contributing to organic growth on continuing
operations of 9.5%;
• the acquisition of One Click Retail;
• the decision to sell 13 Heritage Brands to refine focus to
scalable market-leading events and information services
brands with no material print advertising revenue; and
• the acquisition, after the year end, of MediaLink.
We have retained our focus on customer retention and 
engagement. Our goal throughout the year has been to 
further increase the number of customers we serve and 
simplify how we work so that we may deliver sustainable 
organic revenue growth, strong cash flow and increased 
margins.

1 “Organic” growth is calculated to provide a more meaningful analysis of underlying performance. The following adjustments are made: (a) constant currency (restating FY15 
at FY16 exchange rates); (b) event timing differences between periods (if any); and (c) excluding the part-year impact of acquisitions (of RNG and OCR) and disposals (of MBI). 
There were no event timing differences in 2015 or 2016. See the reconciliation on page 26. 
2 Adjusted EBITDA is IFRS operating profit before expensing: (a) depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortisation of software; (b) exceptional items; (c) amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets; (d) impairment of tangible fixed assets and software intangibles; and (e) share-based payments. 
3 Adjusted operating profit is IFRS operating profit before expensing: (a) exceptional items; (b) amortisation of acquired intangible assets; (c) impairment of tangible fixed assets 
and software intangibles; and (d) share-based payments.
4 Free cash flow is cash generated from operations before exceptional items, less capital expenditure and tax paid. Free cash flow conversion is this measure of free cash flow 
divided by Adjusted EBITDA from both Continuing and Discontinued Operations. See the reconciliation on page 25.
5  Leverage is net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA from both Continuing and Discontinued Operations.

increasingly offer both digital and live event elements, which 
enable customers to access valued information through 
market-leading products and platforms. Our clear operating 
structure makes us simple to deal with and allows our 
customers fast access to the information and connections  
they need. 
Data overload and saturation is driving 
customers to be ever more discerning, selecting  
a smaller number of trusted brands where they 
know they can rely on the information and 
access they gain and the difference it makes to 
their businesses. Our aim is to ensure our brands 
are the most sought out and trusted.

Chairman’s Statement
As Chairman, it is my pleasure to report full-year results which 
demonstrate a strong performance for the year ended 
31 December 2016.
The hallmark of this past year has been rapid, assured and 
continual progress against all of our priority goals. The IPO 
served as a catalyst for the seamless evolution of our focused 
portfolio of events and information services brands into a more 
integrated and customer-centric group.
Our larger, market-leading and scalable brands continued  
to lead the way with the development of new products  
and delivered strong organic growth. We augmented our 
capabilities with enhanced, data-driven forecasting  
and digital tools that enable more engagement with  
our customer communities. 
The acquisition of One Click Retail in August 2016 
strengthened our e-commerce analytics offering across the 
fashion and consumer product industries and our most recent 
announcement – the transaction with Cannes Lions’ long-time 
partner MediaLink announced in February 2017 – reinforces 
our digital advisory expertise to sectors not limited to the 
branded communication industry. Both of these high-growth 
acquisitions improve the diversification of Ascential’s footprint 
outside of the UK. 
The Company continues to refine its portfolio and, after year 
end, announced the planned disposal of 13 publishing-led 
Heritage Brands, the first of which, Health Service Journal,  
was sold in January 2017.

Chairman Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

Credit for this year’s performance is squarely placed with our 
talented and energetic management team who have been open 
to advice from a newly formed plc Board. Our Board was fully 
code-compliant shortly after the IPO with a broad range of 
relevant capabilities and a gender diversity that was recognised 
to be the best amongst the 350 most valuable FTSE companies 
with 57% female representation – a profile that is reflective of 
our broader employee base. 
Our former principal shareholders participated in an orderly 
disposal of the majority of their shares, resulting in a diversified 
share register of quality institutional investors. We are grateful 
to have been the beneficiaries of sound guidance received 
from former Chairman Tom Hall of Apax, and Non-Executive 
Director David Pemsel of Guardian Media Group, both of 
whom stepped down from the Board in September 2016 with 
our thanks for their contributions.
Continual customer engagement and a commitment to improve 
our proposition by our 1,600+ talented employees have led to 
admirable accomplishments in 2016. On behalf of the Board,  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees 
and customers for what has been a very successful year.
Group performance
The 2016 financial year was another successful one. Reported 
revenues from continuing operations grew by 16.8%, including 
the beneficial impacts of both acquisitions and currency. 
Revenue from continuing operations grew 9.5% on an Organic 
basis, Adjusted EBITDA was up 11.5% to £95.9m, margins 
expanded from 29.9% to 32.0% and free cash flow conversion 
was 85%. As these results show, we place a premium on 
organic growth. We are also committed to enhancing our 
proposition and capabilities through selective acquisitions.
Dividend
Ascential plc was incorporated in January 2016 and, as 
indicated at the time of the IPO, the Board targets a dividend 
payout ratio of 30% of Adjusted profit after tax. Consequently, 
the Board is recommending a final dividend of 3.2p per share 
to be paid on 15 June 2017 to shareholders on the register on 
19 May 2017 which, together with the Company’s maiden 
interim dividend of 1.5p paid in November 2016, makes a total 
dividend for the 2016 financial year of 4.7p. 
Outlook
While still early in 2017, we are encouraged by the current 
level of forward bookings and solid performances at events 
that have already taken place. The market is very dynamic and 
the Board is confident about our prospects for continued 
success in 2017.

Our capabilities: growth
Money20/20, the world’s largest FinTech event, is acknowledged as 
being at the centre of the payments industry. Founded in the US five 
years ago, Money20/20 successfully launched its first European 
edition in April 2016 – and was Ascential’s biggest launch to date. 
Money20/20 Europe was created in collaboration with our 
customers to provide a world-class experience for European FinTech 
innovators that directly met the needs of the industry specific to 
Europe. The content team then set out to create an unparalleled 
agenda with local, regional and global contributors from the entire 
commerce ecosystem, including retail, mobile, marketing services, 
data and technology. 
The event in Copenhagen delivered a platform where industry 
leaders could connect. Attending were the key companies and 
individuals building, disrupting and challenging the ways consumers 
and businesses manage, spend and borrow money. Money20/20 
Europe provided an opportunity to come together at scale and 
attracted more than 3,700 attendees, 420 industry leading speakers, 
200 sponsors, 100 media partners and C-level executives from 75 
countries. This was a superb example of getting a launch right and 
we have already announced a further extension of the Money20/20 
brand as it will launch in Asia in 2018. 
In a significant move to strengthen our products and services in the 
consumer goods and services to consumer consumption market 
segment, we acquired the market-leading e-commerce data analytics 
provider, One Click Retail, in August 2016. The business operates in 
an exciting part of the retail vertical, providing actionable insights to 
help leading consumer goods companies optimise their e-commerce 
activities, drive sales and optimise search engine performance.
The insights focus on product market share, its drivers, and the 
actions that can be taken to increase sales. Recent developments 
include the acquisition of international customers outside the US, 
the extension of the Dashboard to cover Walmart and the 
development of new subscription products: eCommSEO (to optimise 
e-commerce search rankings), PromoTrack (to enable tracking and 
optimising of promotional activity) and 3P Track (covering third party 
sales in the broader Amazon marketplace). 
One Click Retail enjoys a 142% customer value retention rate.  
As a high-growth, globally scalable subscription information service 
product, One Click Retail fits with Ascential’s strategy of owning 
scalable, global market leading products. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

They are both highly fragmented: top 10 exhibitions organisers 
represent only 19% of their market3 , while top 10 information 
market players represent only 28% of their market4. New 
organic and inorganic opportunities arise in these markets over 
time as end-markets and technologies evolve, generating 
demand for new events and digital products. 
These markets are expected to outpace GDP growth because 
of a growing importance of data and information on the one 
hand, and face-to-face interactions on the other.
Ascential market positioning
Companies that operate in these markets generally attempt to 
target and gain market leadership in selected end-markets. 16 
of Ascential’s 20 continuing brands, representing 91% of the 
Group's Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in 2016, 
are number 1 in their respective end-markets. Furthermore, 
several of Ascential’s key products occupy global positions, 
including WGSN, Cannes Lions and Money20/20.

Our strengths – What makes us different
Focused portfolio of 
market-leading brands
16 of our 20 continuing brands occupy number one positions 
in their markets. These generated 87% of the Group's 
revenues from continuing operations and 91% of Adjusted 
EBITDA in 2016.
At the heart of customer needs
A key pillar of our operations is a "customer first" strategy. 
This puts customer needs at the heart of Group strategy  
with constant research and analytics to ensure product 
development meets or exceeds their expectations.
Self-reinforcing business models
Network effects in our leading products enable products  
to benefit from their market-leading positions by driving the 
best propositions, leading to more customers and enabling  
us to sub-segment and extend their propositions, thereby 
further enhancing the products’ market-leading positions. 
Disciplined operational approach and 
portfolio management
The Group’s growth is underpinned by a relentless focus on 
its top growth brands, a few key customer-focused initiatives 
in a given year and customer retention. Active portfolio 
management ensures attention and resources are directed  
to those product brands with the strongest prospects.
Strong track record of growth
On a constant currency basis, excluding the impact of 
acquisitions and disposals, Group revenues grew in 2013, 
2014, 2015 and 2016 by 7%, 7%, 6% and 6% respectively.
Clear organic growth strategy
The Group has multiple levers for growth underpinned by  
its retention-first approach and through increasing the 
number of customers that buy our products and by seeking 
to upsell and cross-sell new products that we develop to our 
customer base. 
Strong margins and good cash generation
Through careful cost control and concentration of our cost 
base towards key products in each segment, the Group’s 
continuing Adjusted EBITDA margin has grown from 29.9% in 
2015 to 32.0% in 2016. Our negative working capital profile, 
combined with modest capital expenditure requirements, 
result in a high conversion of adjusted EBITDA to cash.  
In 2016, free cash flow conversion was 85%. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Customers purchase Ascential Information Services to  
identify, evaluate and act upon key industry trends, growth 
opportunities and risks. Subscription information services 
generate the vast majority of their income from digital 
subscriptions, while transactional services operate on  
a pay-per-report basis. 
Ascential’s leading product brands are based on a virtuous 
circle business model, whereby the development of the best 
proposition enables targeted sales and marketing to drive the 
most customers to that proposition, which gives Ascential  
the opportunity to sub-segment customers and extend 
propositions to their specific needs, and thereby reinforce  
a market-leading position. 
Cannes Lions is the world’s leading festival for creativity in 
branded communications. As the influence of Cannes Lions has 
grown, it has attracted a broad spectrum of companies and 
delegates, facilitating the launch of new propositions that 
reinforce Cannes Lions’ market leadership. For example, Lions 
Health was successfully launched as part of Cannes Lions in 
2014, Lions Innovation was launched as part of Cannes Lions  
in 2015, and Lions Entertainment was launched in 2016.
WGSN is the leading provider of information that helps fashion 
and design-led companies to design, buy (for resale) and market 
products that are on trend. The breadth, depth and accuracy of 
its trend forecasts and other information has attracted over 
6,000 customers and more than 93,000 users. As the user 
base extended beyond fashion designers, WGSN was well 
positioned to launch WGSN InStock in 2013, targeting buyers 
and merchandisers, with data enabling price, colour, range 
architecture comparisons and tracking. Similarly, WGSN 
re-launched Lifestyle and Interiors (a trends product that helps 
customers design furniture, soft goods and consumer goods, 
and to position their brands appropriately) in 2015 and WGSN 
Insight, which provides consumer and market intelligence and 
trends, in 2016.
Ascential connects and informs its customers through 
Exhibitions & Festivals and Information Services. 
Customers come together at Ascential’s large-scale events  
to form business relationships, identify key market trends  
and transact. 
Exhibitions generate revenues primarily from stand space sales 
to suppliers, who see exhibitions as sales and marketing events 
which enable them to generate sales, introduce new products, 
generate leads, provide product information, build their brands, 
and educate and service new and existing buyers.
Festivals generate revenues primarily from delegate sales, 
award entry fees and sponsorship. They cater to industry 
participants who want to win accolades for their work (with a 
view to this validation driving additional future sales), identify 
new prospective suppliers or clients, be inspired, learn, 
network and celebrate on an international if not global level.
Business model
A scalable business of market-leading brands

Chief Executive’s Review
2016 was another year of strong organic growth as we grew 
both revenues and profits, driven by our focus on our top 
brands and customer retention as well as the innovative and 
creative nature of our organisation. The launch of new 
products such as WGSN Insight, Money20/20 Europe and 
Lions Entertainment made a significant contribution to our 
2016 success and we also made substantial progress in 
reshaping our portfolio of market-leading brands towards 
those with higher organic growth. 
Track record of growth, high margins and good cash 
generation
We delivered a strong operating performance in 2016 with  
a 9.5% Organic growth in revenue from continuing operations 
to £299.6m and an 11.5% Organic growth in Adjusted EBITDA 
from continuing operations to £95.9m with an expansion  
in margin from 29.9% in 2015 to 32.0% in 2016. 
We also continued to generate good cash flow with free  
cash flow of £90.9m (2015: £79.9m), representing free cash 
conversion of 85% (2015: 88%). This cash generation, in 
combination with the net proceeds of the IPO, has enabled  
us to invest in the business whilst also acquiring high quality 
growth companies, managing our balance sheet and returning 
capital to shareholders through dividends.
Clear organic growth strategy
We continue to deploy multiple initiatives for growth across 
our brands with the aim of firstly retaining existing customers, 
secondly increasing the number of new customers and thirdly 
growing the average revenue per customer. 
Our 2016 growth initiatives built on those deployed over 
recent years and included the launch of new digital products 
(such as WGSN Insight and a newly expanded and upgraded 
version of WGSN Instock), geographical expansion of our 
events (such as Bett Middle East and Money20/20 Europe)  
and show extensions (such as Lions Entertainment). 
Focused portfolio of market-leading brands underpinned by 
diversified and recurring revenue streams
Brand portfolio
Following our decision to separate and hold the Group’s  
13 Heritage Brands for sale and our acquisitions of One Click 
Retail and, after the year end, the acquisition of MediaLink,  
we will now operate a focused portfolio of 20 market-leading 
brands. 16 of these hold clear number one positions in their 
respective markets. We firmly believe that our focus of 
management time on a smaller group of market-leading brands 
is a key driver of our continued organic growth success. 
Our top five brands by Adjusted EBITDA are:
 
• in Information Services: WGSN and Groundsure; and
• in Exhibitions & Festivals: Cannes Lions, Spring and 
Autumn Fair and Money20/20

These top brands remain our primary focus for capital 
allocation. Through this focus, together they grow faster than 
our other brands and their contribution is an increasing 
proportion of the Group’s revenues and profits. In 2016, our 
top five brands represented 69% of the Group’s revenue from 
continuing operations (2015: 66%) and 81% of our Adjusted 
EBITDA (2015: 75%). 
Revenue by type
The Group benefits from diverse revenue streams, the majority 
of which have recurring characteristics. Following the 
treatment of the Heritage Brands as discontinued, the most 
significant change over the last year has been a reduction in 
print advertising, which now represents less than 1% of Group 
revenue (2015: 4%). 
Revenue by geography
Ascential is growing strongly in international markets.  
The majority of our brands serve a global customer base. 
Accelerated by our acquisition of One Click Retail and the 
treatment of the Heritage Brands as discontinued, our share of 
revenue from overseas markets increased again and now just 
38% of revenues come from customers based in the UK (2015: 
48%). The recently announced acquisition of MediaLink will 
further reduce the dependence on UK markets. 
The proportion of revenues from the Americas grew to 29% 
despite recessionary headwinds in Brazil, driven by the 
performance of Money20/20, WGSN and Cannes Lions and 
the acquisition of One Click Retail. Asia Pacific, Middle East 
and Africa and other Europe contributed 11%, 4% and  
18% respectively.
Disciplined operational approach
The foundation of our growth is, and will continue to be, our 
focus on customer retention. There is no better way to judge 
the quality of our products than to measure how many 
customers choose to renew their contracts with us each year 
and we spend considerable time reviewing those customers 
who do churn. Retention rates have again performed well 
across our top brands. We have also seen our broader Net 
Promoter Scores and product usage statistics increasing. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Chief Executive’s Review continued
Portfolio management
We regularly adjust and optimise our portfolio of brands.  
We continue to assess both a range of bolt-on acquisition 
opportunities as well as the potential disposal of certain  
lower growth or sub-scale elements of our portfolio. 
Joint venture in China
We were pleased to see WGSN’s long-anticipated Chinese joint 
venture with CTIC start trading in April 2016 and have now 
further solidified our relationship and funded the joint venture 
with an investment of £4.5m to develop a specific product for 
the Chinese domestic and international markets.
One Click Retail
In August 2016 we acquired One Click Retail, a fast growing 
US-based provider of analytics that helps major brands 
optimise their e-commerce activities. Customers include 
consumer products companies such as Procter & Gamble,  
HP, Unilever, Hamilton Beach, Nestle and Panasonic. Revenue 
is generated predominantly through recurring annual 
subscriptions to the company’s Dashboard product, which 
provides insights to help customers drive sales through 
Amazon and other e-commerce retailers – an increasingly 
important channel for many of them. The insights focus on 
product market share, its drivers, and the actions that can be 
taken to increase sales. We introduced analysts and investors 
to the product in detail during our November Capital Markets 
Day. One Click Retail more than doubled its revenues in 2016.
Heritage Brands
As part of our growth strategy to focus our resources and 
investment on our largest brands and those with the highest 
growth potential, after the year end, in January 2017, we 
announced that we had separated 13 Heritage Brands into a 
separate operating entity that is held for sale. The Heritage 
Brands are Health Service Journal, MEED, Drapers, Nursing 
Times, Local Government Chronicle, Construction News, New 
Civil Engineer, Ground Engineering, H&V News and RAC, Retail 
Jeweller, Materials Recycling World and the architecture titles 
including Architects’ Journal, The Architectural Review and the 
associated World Architecture Festival. Each provides essential 
content to the loyal subscribers and industries they serve 
across three platforms – digital, events and print. The Heritage 
Brands generated revenue of £57.9m in 2016 (2015: £62.5m) 
and £11.6m of Adjusted EBITDA (2015: £14.3m), constant 
currency declines of 10.2% and 19.7% respectively.
Consistent with the evolution of our internal management 
reporting structure during 2016, we have reported the 
Heritage Brands as a separate segment. As a result of ongoing 
discussions, the Board now considers a sale of the segment to 
be highly probable and has therefore classified it as a 
discontinued operation.
In January 2017, we were pleased to announce the sale  
of the first of the Heritage Brands, Health Service Journal,  
to Wilmington plc. This was the first key milestone in finding 
the right future home for these brands and highlighted their 
attractiveness to new owners. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

MediaLink
After the year end, in February 2017, we announced the 
acquisition of US-based MediaLink. MediaLink provides 
advisory and business services to media platforms and brands 
seeking to drive growth through better marketing. Serving the 
consumer goods and services segment, it has worked with 
Cannes Lions’ customers since 2011 where it hosts content 
and client-oriented meetings and events as part of the official 
Festival fringe. MediaLink fits Ascential’s strategy to own 
market-leading brands in selected complementary 
marketplaces that offer trusted information and valuable 
connections to businesses. 
Management
Effective 1 August 2016, the two operating companies in the 
Exhibitions & Festivals segment were combined under the 
leadership of Philip Thomas, formerly CEO of the Lions 
Festivals operating company. Mark Shashoua, formerly CEO  
of i2i Events, left the Company to pursue other opportunities 
with our sincere thanks for his achievements. We are delighted 
that Jose Papa, formerly CEO of WGSN, accepted the 
leadership of Cannes Lions and that Kevin Silk, formerly COO 
of WGSN, assumed the leadership of WGSN with Natasha 
Christie-Miller remaining as CEO of Plexus. 
Our former Strategy Director, Michael Lisowski, has taken on 
an expanded role as Chief Operating Officer for Ascential.  
His new position covers proposition development, customer 
insight and research and product management and is a critical 
investment in skills and capabilities to assist our brand teams  
to continue our growth and also to raise the bar on the quality 
and ambition of the products we create. 
We were also pleased to welcome Stephen Martincic to the 
Group as Chief Brand and Marketing Officer from FCB, the 
global, fully integrated marketing communications company, 
where he was responsible for building FCB’s brand across the 
globe. Stephen has taken on a critical new role for the Group  
to ensure we are truly focusing on the fast-changing needs of 
our customers and honing how we position and message our 
capabilities to maximise customer engagement and our organic 
growth objectives. 
These changes illustrate the strength and depth of our 
management team and we are delighted that our succession 
planning has allowed us to be able to promote from within the 
Company as well as attract exciting new talent.
Strategic priorities for 2017
Our strategy and priorities for 2017 are on track – we will 
continue to focus most of our efforts on organic growth 
opportunities underpinned by customer retention as well as 
leveraging the competencies of newly acquired companies. 
Throughout 2017 we expect to benefit from the increasing 
convergence of event products that connect our customers 
and information services that inform them. 
Outlook
The new financial year has started well. Since the year end, 
Spring Fair, Bett London and Pure Spring have taken place and 
performed overall in line with our expectations. While still 
early in 2017, we are encouraged by the current level of 
forward bookings and are confident of another good year  
of growth for the Group.
Our customers and our people
Our continued strong performance and results would simply 
not have been possible without the dedication and 
commitment of our teams across the business and their passion 
to serve our long, loyal and valued customers. 
I want to thank our customers and our teams for continuing  
to be at the heart of Ascential’s continued success.

Strategy summary
Accelerating growth
The Group is focused on five strategic priorities 
with a view to delivering superior, sustainable 
growth and shareholder returns.
Strategic priority 
Enhance the 
Group’s market 
positions
Extend the market-leading 
positions of the Group’s brands, 
and deepen our coverage 
of customer needs, through 
incremental and new product 
development based on detailed 
data analysis and customer input.
Strategic priority 
Drive organic 
growth
To further drive organic growth, 
we will seek to increase product 
penetration in our current markets, 
sell existing products to new 
customer types, extend sales and 
marketing of our products into 
new geographies and adjacent 
markets, and explore new channels 
to market. We intend to increase 
average revenue per customer 
further by upselling products to 
our existing customers, cross-
selling under-penetrated products 
into existing customer bases, 
selectively optimising pricing 
and developing new products.
Strategic priority 
Drive retention
We aim to further improve 
customer retention with 
improvements in customer service 
and further product development.
In Exhibitions & Festivals, we 
will continue to improve and 
deepen our content offerings 
with well-known, highly relevant, 
industry speakers our attendees 
want to access and additional 
knowledge we wrap around these 
key players. We will use new 
technologies to improve service 
and streamline rebooking.
In Information Services, we 
will constantly strengthen our 
products in response to customer 
feedback, and improve customer 
service and renewal approaches.
Strategic priority 
Increase 
margins
By focusing on our top brands 
and placing our attention on 
operational excellence, we 
intend to continue to improve 
our profitability and increase the 
Group’s Adjusted EBITDA margin.
Strategic priority 
Selectively 
manage 
portfolio 
We will continue to make selective 
acquisitions in high-growth areas 
while divesting non-core assets. 
The Group will evaluate bolt-on 
opportunities from time to time 
against specific acquisition criteria 
including suitability for international 
expansion and ability to add value 
to existing customer base.

Overview
These results for 2016 are the first for Ascential plc following 
its IPO in February. Immediately prior to the offering, the 
Group underwent a pre-IPO reorganisation as part of which 
Ascential plc was incorporated and acquired the Group. The 
basis of preparation note on page 128 describes how the 
pre-IPO reorganisation has been accounted for under the 
principles of “reverse acquisition accounting” such that these 
financial statements are presented as if the Company had 
always owned the Group.
In 2015 the Group had two reportable trading segments – 
Exhibitions & Festivals and Information Services. During 2016, 
and consistent with the evolution of its internal management 
reporting structures, the Group has reported the Heritage 
Brands referred to earlier as a separate, third trading segment. 
As a result of ongoing discussions, the Board now considers a 
sale of the segment to be highly probable and has therefore 
reclassified it as a discontinued operation. This means that the 
results of the Heritage Brands for both 2016 and 2015 are 
included as a single line item within profit after tax on the face 
of the income statement. This Financial Review therefore 
firstly addresses the key trends in continuing operations and 
then, as a separate section, discontinued operations.

Chief Financial Officer FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

The results for the year are set out in the consolidated profit and loss statement and show, for continuing operations, revenue of 
£299.6m (2015: £256.6m), an Organic growth of 9.5%, and reported operating profit of £32.1m (2015: £24.3m). Adjusted EBITDA 
was £95.9m (2015: £76.6m), an Organic growth of 11.5%. The Group also delivered strong cash flow in 2016 with free cash flow 
of £90.9m (2015: £79.9m), a conversion of 85% (2015: 88%). 
A core KPI and strategic goal of the Group is Organic revenue growth as this is the most efficient method of growth that measures 
the underlying health of the business and is a key driver of shareholder value creation. Organic revenue growth eliminates the 
distorting impact of acquisitions and disposals and that element of growth which is driven by changes in foreign exchange rates.  
It is an alternative performance measure and is discussed in more detail on page 25.
Adjusted EBITDA is also an alternative performance measure discussed in detail on page 24. It is used in the day-to-day 
management of the Group in order to aid comparisons with peer group companies, manage banking covenants and provide a 
reference point for assessing the operational cash generation of the Group. It eliminates items arising from portfolio investment 
and divestment decisions, and from changes to capital structure. Such items arise from events which are non-recurring or 
intermittent, and while they may generate substantial income statement amounts, do not relate to the ongoing operational 
performance that underpins long-term value generation. 
The Group monitors its operational balance sheet efficiency with reference to operational cash conversion, defined as Free Cash 
Flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. The section on alternative performance measures on page 27 also defines these terms.

Financial Review continued
Continuing operations
Revenue
Revenues from continuing operations in 2016 grew to £299.6m (2015: £256.6m), an increase of £43.0m. However, direct 
comparability was affected by the disposal of the MBI business in January 2015, the acquisition of RetailNet Group in June 2015, 
the establishment of WGSN’s 49% joint venture with CTIC – whereby revenue of the joint venture is no longer consolidated, the 
acquisition of One Click Retail in August 2016 and movements in exchange rates between the two years. 
Adjusting for these factors, Organic growth in revenue from continuing operations was as follows: 
Year-on-year Organic revenue growth 2016 2015
Exhibitions & Festivals +12.3% +13.1%
Information Services +5.4% +3.6%
Continuing operations +9.5% +9.0%
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased to £95.9m (2015: £76.6m), an increase of £19.3m on a reported basis  
and an expansion in Adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.1 percentage points to 32.0%. The reported growth in Adjusted EBITDA was 
impacted by the same factors described above. On an Organic basis, Group Adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.5%, with Exhibitions  
& Festivals growing at 17.5% and Information Services growing at 4.7%.
Foreign currency translation impact
Following the Group’s acquisition of One Click Retail and the growth of Cannes Lions and Money20/20, the Group’s reported 
performance is increasingly sensitive to movements in both the euro and US dollar against pounds sterling. In 2016, sterling 
weakened substantially against both the US dollar and euro compared to 2015, as can be seen in the table below:
Weighted average rate Closing rate
Currency 2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 Change
Euro 1.25 1.40 10% 1.17 1.36 14%
US dollar 1.30 1.53 14% 1.23 1.48 17%
When comparing 2016 and 2015, changes in currency exchange rates had a favourable impact of £13.7m on Group revenue and 
£7.7m on Group Adjusted EBITDA. On a segmental basis, the favourable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was 
as follows:
• Exhibitions & Festivals: £9.9m impact on revenue and £5.7m impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
• Information Services: £3.8m impact on revenue and £2.0m impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
In 2016, on a continuing basis, the Group:
• received approximately 29% of its revenue, incurred 9% of its costs and generated 70% of its Adjusted EBITDA in euros; and
• received approximately 22% of its revenue, incurred 14% of its costs and generated 37% of its Adjusted EBITDA in US dollars. 
The Group’s external borrowings are denominated 50% in euros with the balance split between US dollars and pounds sterling. 
Following the Group’s recent US acquisitions and planned disposal of the Heritage Brands, in 2017 the Group will review the 
denomination of the currency of its external borrowings. 
Amortisation and impairment
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations was £28.8m in 2016 (2015: £26.6m) with the increase 
of £2.2m due to the acquisition of One Click Retail as well as the impact of the strength of the US dollar against sterling in respect 
of the Group’s US intangibles. The Group undertakes a periodic review of the carrying value of its intangible assets and as a result 
of this review there was no impairment recognised in the current or prior year relating to intangible assets acquired through 
business combinations.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

Share-based payments
The charge for share-based payments of £1.4m for Continuing operations (2015: £0.5m) incorporates the Share Incentive Plan, 
the SAYE and the Performance Share Plan as well as a small charge for the pre-IPO Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Further 
details are set out in Note 10.
Exceptional items
The following table sets out the exceptional items incurred by the Group that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

financial results.

Exceptional items relating to continuing operations 20.7 9.4
The acquisition-related contingent employment costs relate to primarily deferred consideration on the acquisition of Money20/20 
and of One Click Retail which, absent the link to continued employment, would have been treated as consideration. Under the sale 
and purchase agreements, approximately half the deferred consideration is contingent on both (i) the results of the business in the 
post-acquisition period and (ii) the continued employment of the founders. In accordance with IFRS, this element of the deferred 
consideration is treated as an expense recognised over the contractual service periods. In 2016 this expense amounted to £9.7m 
(2015: £5.5m) and further exceptional expense is expected in 2017-2019 in respect of these two acquisitions. 
In addition, an adjustment to deferred consideration of $7.8m arose in respect of the initial recognition of the deferred 
consideration as capital as a result of the excellent performance of Money20/20 Europe in 2016, which was significantly better 
than original expectations. 
Net finance costs
The Group’s net finance expense (net finance cost less net finance income) for the year was £33.8m (2015: £72.7m) with the 
substantial reduction driven by the reduction in external leverage and borrowing costs and the repayment of shareholder debt  
on IPO. 
The non-recurring costs of the shareholder debt that existed prior to the IPO of £5.3m (2015: £43.9m) and the write-off of 
unamortised loan arrangement fees that occurred on refinancing of £10.7m (2015: £4.3m) have been treated as adjusting items. 
The adjusted net finance expense after eliminating these non-recurring items was as follows:
Adjusted net finance expense (£’m)
2016 2015
Interest payable on external debt (10.1) (28.3)
Interest receivable 0.1 0.1
Amortisation of loan arrangement fees (1.4) (2.4)
Other finance charges (2.9) (2.3)
Foreign exchange and derivatives (loss)/gain (3.5) 8.4
17.8 24.5
The interest expense on the Group’s borrowings was £10.1m (2015: £28.3m) with the reduction driven by the repayment of debt 
as well as the reduced rate of interest payable following the Group’s IPO in mid-February 2016. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Taxation
The Group’s tax charge on profit from continuing operations was a credit of £13.4m (2015: £11.3m) and was made up of a current 
tax charge of £4.1m (2015: £0.3m) and a deferred tax credit of £17.5m (2015: £11.6m). This comprised:
• an adjusted tax charge of £10.9m up from £4.6m in the prior year, being an effective tax rate of 17% (2015: 13%); and
• a tax credit of £24.3m (2015: £15.9m) on loss on adjusting items of £66.9m (2015: £79.9m), primarily relating to the credit  
on the unwind of the deferred tax liability relating to acquired intangibles.
The effective tax rate of 17% on adjusted profit before tax benefited from £8.3m (2015: £5.8m) of further recognition of US tax 
losses as a deferred asset following a later than expected change of control restriction and an increase in the value of the US 
group at the point of that change of control. Absent this further loss recognition, the effective tax rate on Adjusted profit before 
tax would have been 29%.
Cash tax paid was a small cash outflow of £3.5m (2015: £1.2m) as the Group continued to benefit by £8.7m (2015: £1.7m) from 
the utilisation of historic tax losses in the UK and US which are expected to benefit the Group’s cash flow over the medium term.
The Group has a total deferred tax asset of £54.9m (2015: £40.2m) relating to UK and US losses, accelerated capital allowances 
and US acquired intangibles and deferred consideration and this is expected to convert into cash savings over the next 15 years. 
Its deferred tax liability amounted to £30.3m (2015: £40.7m) and related to acquired intangibles. 
As described in detail on page 66, the recognition of deferred tax assets on US losses requires considerable judgements to be 
made including overall future trading performance of the US group, assessment of future earn-outs payable and valuation of the 
US group at the point of change of control. In total, a net deferred tax asset of £17.4m (2015: £11.5m has been recognised in 
respect of US taxes. It is notable that each 1% change in the US Federal Tax Rate by the US tax authorities would impact the 
balance sheet and tax charge by £0.7m.
Discontinued operations
Revenue from discontinued operations in 2016 was £57.9m (2015: £62.5m), a reduction of £4.6m or 10.2% on an Organic basis. 
The key driver of the reduction was the performance of the MEED brand where, despite a strong performance from its high  
value digital subscriptions product MEED Projects, revenue fell by £1.9m mainly attributable to the conferences line of revenue.  
In addition, print advertising revenue in the UK brands fell by £3.1m.
Adjusted EBITDA was £11.6m, down by £2.7m from the £14.3m in the prior year as the business was only able to partially 
mitigate the £4.6m revenue drop. In discontinued operations, the Group also incurred £1.9m of exceptional costs in preparing the 
Heritage Brands for sale including vendor diligence, legal fees, separation costs and write-off of leasehold improvements. In the 
prior year, the Group had incurred exceptional costs of £1.7m as a result of the creation of the Plexus operating company from the 
combination of EMAP, MEED, 4C Group and Planet Retail.
The Adjusted tax charge attributable to discontinued operations was £1.8m (2015: £2.1m), being an adjusted effective tax rate  
of 18.4% (2015: 16.7%). 
Capital structure and the IPO refinancing
On 12 February 2016, in order to achieve an opening leverage ratio of c.2.5x, the Group refinanced its borrowing facilities and 
entered into new post-IPO term loan facilities of £66m, €171m and $96m as well as a revolving credit facility of £95m. Together 
with the net proceeds of the IPO of £183m, the Group used the new term loan facilities to repay all amounts under the Group’s 
existing senior facilities and to cancel certain related hedging arrangements. 
The facilities mature in February 2021, have an initial rate of interest of 2.25% over LIBOR and are subject to a net leverage ratio 
covenant of 4.5x, which is measured at December 2016 and then semi-annually thereafter. The covenant ratio falls to 4.0x in 
December 2017. Arrangement fees of £5.3m were incurred and will be amortised over the term of the facility.
The Group’s strong operating cash flow was partially deployed on the acquisition of One Click Retail, and after accounting for 
adverse foreign exchange and derivative movements of £32.6m during the year, the Group’s leverage ratio reduced to 2.1x at 
31 December 2016 from 2.5x immediately following the IPO and 4.2x at the end of the prior year. The Group’s leverage target  
is 1.5-2.0x to allow a healthy mix of dividends and cash for investment in bolt-on acquisitions.

Acquisitions and disposals 
As part of the management of its focused portfolio of products, Ascential regularly assesses opportunities to acquire high-growth 
products operating in sectors with the potential for scale that may benefit from Ascential’s know-how and infrastructure. The 
Group actively managed its portfolio of product brands in 2016 and 2017 to date.
One Click Retail
In August 2016, the Group acquired 100% of US-based e-commerce analytics provider Oneclickretail.com LLC (“One Click Retail”) 
for initial cash consideration of $44m plus future earn outs expected to total $85m. The future earn outs are based on multiples  
of Adjusted EBITDA of the business for the four years 2016 to 2019 payable in cash or, for certain elements, shares at Ascential’s 
option. A portion of the earn-out payments is also subject to founders remaining in employment with the company. The total 
aggregate consideration, including initial consideration and earn out payments, is capped at $225m in the event that stretching 
profit targets are reached, and will be paid over the period to February 2020. The Group incurred £0.9m of professional fees on 
the acquisition which it recorded as an exceptional cost, and the business contributed £3.1m of revenue and £2.2m of Adjusted 
EBITDA to the Group’s 2016 results.
Heritage Brands 
As part of its growth strategy to focus its resources and investment on its largest brands and those with the highest growth 
potential, after the year end, in January 2017, the Group announced that it had separated 13 Heritage Brands into a separate 
operating entity that is held for sale. Consistent with the evolution of its internal management reporting structure during 2016, 
the Group has reported the Heritage Brands as a separate segment. As a result of ongoing discussions, the Board now considers  
a sale of the segment to be highly probable and has therefore reclassified it as a discontinued operation. The Heritage Brands 
generated revenue of £57.9m in 2016 (2015: £62.5m) and £11.6m of Adjusted EBITDA (2015: £14.3m).
 
Also in January 2017, the Group announced the sale of the first of the Heritage Brands, Health Services Journal to Wilmington plc 
for a consideration of £19m, payable in cash subject to normal working capital adjustments at completion. In 2016, HSJ generated 
revenue of £10m and EBITDA of £2.8m.
MediaLink
In February 2017 the Group announced that, subject to customary regulatory approvals, it had agreed to acquire 100% of 
US-based media advisory and business services provider MediaLink for an initial cash consideration of $69m plus future earnouts 
expected to total between $42m and $62m payable in cash or, for certain elements, shares at Ascential’s option. A portion of the 
earn-out payments is subject to founders remaining in employment with the company. MediaLink is growing rapidly and delivered 
unaudited revenue of $54m and Adjusted PBT of $14m in 2016, with year-on-year growth of 29% and 24% respectively. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Cash flow
The Group’s cash flow statement and net debt position can be summarised as follows:
£’m 2016 2015
Adjusted EBITDA 107.5 90.9
Working capital movements – 1.1
Adjusted cash generated from operations 107.5 92.0

Borrowings (290.3) (436.1)
Capitalised arrangement fees 4.3 10.5
Derivative financial instruments 0.4 (1.1)
Net debt (223.7) (382.3)
The Group generated Adjusted operating cash flow of £107.5m (2015: £92.0m), an increase of 17%, due to the strong operational 
performance of the business. 
A major feature of the Group’s cash flow in 2016 was the IPO, which generated proceeds of £200.0m or £188.5m net of 
expenses, which was used to reduce the Group’s indebtedness. Capex was slightly ahead of 2015 at £13.1m (2015: £10.9m) 
reflecting a fit out of the Group’s Paddington offices to accommodate the entire Exhibitions & Festivals business following the 
combination of the i2i and Lions operating companies under a single leadership. 
The Group therefore generated free cash flow of £90.9m (2015: £79.9m), an increase of 14%, which was used to fund interest 
payments, acquisition costs and exceptional items with the balance reducing net indebtedness.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share has been presented on both a statutory and Proforma basis. The Proforma basis is based on the 400.0m shares 
in issue upon IPO (as opposed to those in issue at part way through the IPO restructuring) and is therefore more relevant to 
ongoing shareholders of the Group.
Adjusted diluted Proforma EPS of 15.5p per share is 48% ahead of the 10.5p per share recorded for 2015 and total diluted 
Proforma EPS of 3.9p per share is substantially ahead of the prior year loss per share of 6.3p. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

Capital reduction
Ascential plc was incorporated in January 2016 and acquired the Group’s business operations in February 2016. As part of the 
IPO restructuring, the Company completed a reduction of its share capital, whereby:
(i) the entire amount standing to the credit of the Company’s share premium account was cancelled;
(ii) 876m deferred shares (which were issued by way of a bonus issue for the purpose of capitalising the Company’s capital 
reserve) were cancelled; and 
(iii)  the nominal value of each issued ordinary share in the capital of the Company was reduced from £0.10 to £0.01 each (the 
“Capital Reduction”).
Following the Capital Reduction, as at 8 June 2016, the issued share capital of the Company consisted of 400,542,500 ordinary 
shares of £0.01 each. The distributable reserves created by the Capital Reduction amount to £476.2m.
Dividends
Ascential plc was incorporated in January 2016 and, as indicated at the time of the IPO, the Board targets a dividend payout ratio 
of 30% of Adjusted profit after tax. Consequently, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 3.2p per share to holders on the 
register on 19 May 2017 which, together with the Company’s maiden interim dividend of 1.5p paid in November 2016, makes a 
total dividend for the 2016 financial year of 4.7p.

Alternative performance measures
The Group aims to maximise shareholder value by optimising potential for return on capital through strategic portfolio investment 
and divestment, by ensuring the Group’s capital structure is managed to support both strategic and operational requirements, and 
by delivering returns through a focus on organic growth and operational discipline. The Board considers that it is helpful to 
provide, where practicable, performance measures that distinguish between these different factors – these are also the measures 
that the Board uses to assess the performance of the Group. Accordingly, the Annual Report presents the following non-GAAP 
measures alongside standard accounting terms as prescribed by IFRS and the Companies Act, in order to provide this useful 
additional information.
Adjusted profit measures
The Group uses Adjusted profit measures to assist readers in understanding underlying operational performance. These measures 
exclude income statement items arising from portfolio investment and divestment decisions, and from changes to capital 
structure. Such items arise from events which are non-recurring or intermittent, and while they may generate substantial income 
statement amounts, do not relate to the ongoing operational performance that underpins long-term value generation. The income 
statement items that are excluded from Adjusted profit measures are referred to as Adjusting items. 
Both Adjusted profit measures and Adjusting items are presented together with statutory measures on the face of the income 
statement. In addition, the Group presents a non-GAAP profit measure, Adjusted EBITDA, in order to aid comparisons with peer 
group companies and provide a reference point for assessing the operational cash generation of the Group. Adjusted EBITDA is 
defined as Adjusted Operating Profit before depreciation. The Group measures operational profit margins with reference to 
Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusting items are not a defined term under IFRS, so may not be comparable to similar terminology used in other financial 
statements. Details of the charges and credits presented as Adjusting items are set out in Note 7 to the financial statements.  
The basis for treating these items as Adjusting is as follows:
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are recorded in accordance with the Group’s policy set out in Note 1 to the financial statements. They arise 
from both portfolio investment and divestment decisions, and from changes to the Group’s capital structure, and so do not reflect 
current operational performance. 
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations
Charges for amortisation of acquired intangibles arise from the purchase consideration of a number of separate acquisitions. 
These acquisitions are portfolio investment decisions that took place at different times over several years, and so the associated 
amortisation does not reflect current operational performance.
Share-based payments
As a result of the IPO a number of employee share schemes have been introduced, as set out in Note 10 to the financial 
statements. As a result, there is a lack of comparability between periods in respect of share scheme costs. As this arises from  
a change triggered by the IPO change in capital structure, these costs have been treated as Adjusting items.
Gains on disposal
Gains on disposal of businesses arise from divestment decisions that are part of strategic portfolio management, and do not 
reflect current operational performance.
Finance costs
Certain elements of finance costs incurred as a result of debt refinancing and are therefore a result of changes to the Group’s 
capital structure. In addition, as part of the IPO, shareholder debt was converted to equity, and as a result there is a lack of 
comparability between periods in respect of the interest previously incurred on this shareholder debt. As this arises from a change 
triggered by the IPO change in capital structure, these costs have been treated as Adjusting items.
Tax related to adjusting items
The elements of the overall Group tax charge relating to the above Adjusting items are also treated as Adjusting. These elements 
of the tax charge are calculated with reference to the specific tax treatment of each individual Adjusting item, taking into account 
its tax deductibility, the tax jurisdiction concerned and any previously recognised tax assets or liabilities. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Adjusted cash flow measures
The Group uses Adjusted cash flow measures for the same purpose as Adjusted profit measures, in order to assist readers of the 
accounts in understanding the ongoing operational performance of the Group. The two measures used are Adjusted Cash 
Generated from Operations, and Free Cash Flow. These are reconciled to IFRS measures as follows:
£’m 2016 2015
Cash generated from operations 95.9 79.9
Add back: acquisition-related contingent employment cash flow 4.0 –
Add back: other exceptional cash flow 7.6 12.1
Adjusted cash generated from operations 107.5 92.0
£’m 2016 2015
Net cash from operating activities 92.4 78.7
Add back: acquisition-related contingent employment cash flow 4.0 –
Add back: other exceptional cash flow 7.6 12.1
Less: capital expenditure (13.1) (10.9)
Free cash flow 90.9 79.9
The Group monitors its operational balance sheet efficiency with reference to operational cash conversion, defined as Free Cash 
Flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA.
Organic growth measures
In order to assess whether the Group is achieving its strategic goal of driving organic growth, it is helpful to compare like-for-like 
operational results between periods. Reported income statement measures, both Adjusted and statutory, can be significantly 
affected by the following factors which mask like-for-like comparability:
• acquisitions and disposals of businesses lead to a lack of comparability between periods due to consolidation of only part  
of a year’s results for these businesses; 
• changes in exchange rates used to record the results of non-sterling businesses results in a lack of comparability between 
periods as equivalent local currency amounts are recorded at different sterling amounts in different periods; and 
• event timing differences between periods. The Group has no significant biennial events, but when annual events are held  
at different times of year this can affect the comparability of half-year results.
The Group therefore defines Organic growth measures, which are calculated with the following adjustments:
• results of acquired and disposed businesses are excluded where the Group results include only part-year results in either 
current or prior periods;
• prior year consolidated results are restated at current year exchange rates for non-sterling businesses; and
• prior year results are adjusted such that comparative results of events that have been held at different times of year are 
included in the same period as the current year results. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Proforma EPS
Changes to the Group’s capital structure affecting the number of shares in issue will affect the comparability of earnings per share 
between periods. In order to present a consistent measure of earnings between periods, the Group presents Proforma measures 
of EPS in which major changes to the number of shares in issue are presented as if they had occurred on the first day of the 
comparative period. In presenting the 2016 financial statements, the IPO which completed on 12 February 2016 is treated as  
such a major change, and so accordingly Proforma EPS is calculated using a weighted average number of shares as if the IPO had 
occurred at the beginning of the 2015 financial year. Details are set out in Note 14 of the financial statements.

Risk factors and risk management 
Overview
In pursuing its strategic objectives the Group is inevitably 
exposed to risks that could prevent those goals being realised 
in part or whole. It is only by taking on the challenge of 
managing risk that the Group can expect to succeed. 
Accordingly, the Group’s policy in relation to risk does not  
seek to eliminate all risk, but to ensure risks are identified, 
assessed and their potential impacts managed in a cost-
effective way to achieve an acceptable level of risk by 
deploying appropriate controls.
Approach
The Board is responsible for ensuring risk management 
procedures across the Group are effective, for reviewing the 
major risks and emerging issues identified by the business, and 
for considering the potential impact of significant risks on the 
long term prospects and viability of the Group. Management 
are responsible for ensuring risk management procedures are 
followed, with clear roles, responsibilities and accountabilities 
for risk management throughout the business, risk registers 
kept up to date and prompt implementation of agreed tasks.  
To give effect to these responsibilities, the Group operates 
both bottom-up and top-down risk management processes. 
Bottom-up
Each operating division has a Risk Committee comprising 
divisional leaders and other functional heads, and risk registers 
that identify and prioritise risks identified by Committee 
members. Ascential’s Legal Director attends every Risk 
Committee to provoke discussion and share best practice 
across the Company. Each Risk Committee profiles the risk  
on impact and likelihood, devising appropriate controls and 
remedial plans to avoid or mitigate those risks based on the 
threat level. Actions to implement the remedial plans are 
allocated to a Committee member to implement, and progress 
is monitored with update reports back to the Committee.
Top-down
The Board monitors the bottom-up view, to identify emerging 
risks where Group-wide action is needed (e.g. cyber security, 
terrorism threat). The top risks and emerging trends are then 
combined with risks identified during strategic planning, and 
risks identified by considering external viewpoints on risks 
relevant to the business, to form a consolidated risk register. 
This is then critically appraised by senior management to 
ensure risks have been consistently rated and that proper 
attention has been given to different types of risk, classified  
as strategic, operational, technological, financial and  
regulatory risk. 
The Board conducts regular reviews of the consolidated risk 
register, and considers reports from management on the 
operation of the bottom-up processes, in order to form its 
assessment of the effectiveness of risk management 
procedures and the principal risks facing the Group.
Risk trends
While the risks faced by the Group are never static and 
continue to evolve in nature or in threat level, during the year 
management have devoted considerable time to deciding upon 
and implementing responses to the following risks where we 
consider the threat levels have increased:
Cyber security
In common with most businesses, we have seen an increase in 
the number of attempts to penetrate our IT security measures, 
or to attempt to initiate fraudulent activities by deception such 
as phishing. The business has intensified its cyber security 
programme reporting directly to the CEO to respond to this 
increased threat, driven by the IT team but involving all 
functions in the business in developing the programme and 
tracking progress, together with weekly reporting to senior 
management on current threat levels and incidents. 
Terrorism
Terrorist events and the perception of increased terrorist 
events have always received serious consideration and 
planning. The Group has a dedicated security function with 
relevant training and continues to engage highly qualified third 
party security advisory firms to conduct security reviews of 
events and our office locations throughout the world. Such 
work covers preventative measures, crisis management 
procedures and business continuity plans, and working with 
business teams to integrate these measures into regular 
operational practice. In addition we continue to work closely 
with venue providers, external security firms, local police and 
other security forces, to ensure close co-ordination between  
all parties in dealing with this threat. 
Brexit
The decision by the UK to leave the EU has created a range of 
uncertainty in and outside the UK. Most aspects of the Group 
are best served by keeping a watching brief and in preparation 
for quick response if a situation were to develop requiring 
action to best position the Company to defend or leverage the 
opportunity created on behalf of the Company’s multi-national 
customers. The main areas we monitor are impacts on the 
macro-economic environment, and regulatory and tax 
frameworks. The Group’s immediate priority is to support  
staff who may, in the future, be personally affected by

Principal risks
Principal risks
The Board considers the following to be the most significant of the risks facing the Group:
Risk and potential impact How we manage the risk
1
  Macro-economic and geopolitical conditions
Customer demand for the Group’s products is affected by economic 
and geopolitical conditions. Uncertainty about future developments 
may suppress customer confidence. Economic changes may reduce 
demand for services over an extended period, with time lags 
dependent on customer budgeting and procurement cycles. Political 
and regulatory changes (such as those that will arise from the UK’s 
exit from the EU and change in the US political landscape) may 
disrupt patterns of trade, reduce demand, impose operating 
inefficiencies, additional costs and compliance burdens, and may 
also significantly affect the Group’s tax position.
The Group’s brands hold market-leading positions in their 
respective markets and many are closely integrated into customers’ 
operational processes. We believe this makes the Group’s revenues 
more resilient in the face of reduced demand.
The Group regularly reviews political and economic conditions and 
outlook in the main market sectors and geographies it operates in, 
to assess whether it needs to change either product offerings or 
cost structures.
While many of the impacts of Brexit and the US election results  
are not yet known, the sense of uncertainty exists. The Group  
is being thoughtful about how to best position itself in evolving 
markets while concurrently engaged in active communication  
with employees.
2
  Acquisitions
Risks are inherent when undertaking acquisitions and disposals. 
Furthermore, execution risks must be considered when integrating 
acquired businesses into Company operations and corporate 
structure including retention of staff, preserving value of assets that 
provide competitive advantage and realising benefits expected from 
a transaction. 
The Group takes a disciplined approach to portfolio management 
decisions, with clear acquisition criteria, careful due diligence and 
pre-completion planning for integration.
3
  Geographic expansion
An element of the Group’s growth strategy is expanding in  
fast growing geographic markets. Rapid expansion presents 
management, logistical and compliance challenges. Inadequate  
plans or poor execution in addressing these challenges may  
damage the Group’s growth prospects and reputation.
The Group’s plans for expansion into new markets are developed  
as part of the annual strategic planning cycle. Implementation of 
these plans involves careful selection of local partners, support 
from professional advisers, and regular monitoring by senior 
management. In most major geographies we have through 2016 
appointed an Ascential leader to own the governance and 
operations for the Group across all brands operating within  
that region. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Principal risks continued
Risk and potential impact How we manage the risk
4
  Customer end-market development
The Group’s customers operate in a variety of end-markets, each 
with their own competitive pressures affecting customer 
preferences and spend. Changes in these end-markets could 
increase competition, reduce customer spend, make the Group’s 
products less relevant to customer needs, or otherwise affect the 
Group’s competitiveness and/or profitability.
The Group’s strategic focus on customer retention ensures we stay 
close to customer sentiment and have early indications of whether 
there is a change in the perceived value of our products. Customer 
satisfaction is measured regularly, and detailed usage is tracked to 
ensure continued relevance of product offerings.
The Group continues to invest in new product development, and 
enhancements to existing products, to respond to changing needs 
and ensure continuing value to the customer.
5
  Reputation and performance of top brands
The Group’s businesses enjoy a high degree of brand recognition in 
part attributable to the continued relevance of customer proposition 
to customer demand and reputation for quality and service. This 
underpins their ability to attract or retain customers. 
The Group generates a high proportion of revenues and EBITDA 
from its top brands. A meaningful diminution in reputation, 
relevance or performance of the Group’s top brands could materially 
and adversely affect the Group performance.
The Group’s senior management team devote substantial time to  
its major products, managing and advising the talented operating 
teams to ensure they are focused on priorities and delivering 
excellent customer experience. Each business is operated with a 
sharp focus on ensuring operational excellence across all brands.
The Group also allocates capital to products with the highest 
potential to grow both scale and returns, whilst carefully reviewing 
extensions into adjacent market spaces to ensure these do not 
dilute the brand value of the core offering.
6
  Venue availability and access
The Group’s events are held at specific locations on particular  
dates each year. These specific locations may be unavailable  
for use through damage, or may become available only on 
uneconomic terms. 
In addition, various factors may disrupt travel or pose a safety risk, 
preventing both customers and our own staff from reaching the 
event location, or leading to customers being unwilling to travel. 
Examples of such factors include natural disasters, risk of disease, 
civil disorder, political instability, and terrorism.
The Group maintains close relationships with major venue 
providers, and also maintains contingency plans to move events  
if necessary.
Business continuity plans are also in place to minimise disruption 
and financial impact. Our contractual terms provide some 
protection against the risk of late cancellation, and we maintain 
insurance cover in respect of certain event cancellation risks. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

Risk and potential impact How we manage the risk
7
  Physical safety and security
There are risks associated with the safety and welfare of staff and 
visitors, both in its operational premises and at the Group’s events. 
The most serious of these, such as fire, natural disasters, civil 
disorder and terrorism, have the potential to lead to serious injury 
and death.
The Group has appointed a Security Officer with responsibility  
for ensuring all our businesses are integrating safety and security 
management into their operations. The Group has enlisted the 
support of the top security firms and advisers to support the 
conduct security reviews of major events and offices resulting  
in the undertaking of preventative measures, crisis management 
procedures and business continuity plans. These reviews have 
been, and will be, refreshed regularly, on a Group-wide basis.
The Group also ensures the business adheres to health and safety 
legislation and Group policies which are reviewed regularly at 
divisional level. Divisional policies and procedures also incorporate 
factors specific to their business model and operating locations 
together with place of work evaluations that are integrated into 
business continuity plans.
8
  Technology security
The Group relies on electronic platforms and distribution systems  
to provide customer service. The Group also relies on IT systems to 
manage the Group’s business data, communications, and business 
processes. These systems are also heavily dependent on the 
internet, both as a means of distribution and for hosting services.
These systems could suffer damage or interruption from a variety  
of causes, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems 
failures, security breaches, cyber attacks and viruses. Such incidents 
could disrupt the Group’s business, requiring management time and 
incurring additional cost to resolve the issue. This could also result in 
transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales 
and customers.
In addition, breaches of data security systems or other unauthorised 
access to the Group’s data could damage its reputation and lead to  
a risk of loss of customers, liability for damages, litigation and more 
onerous compliance requirements from government regulators.
The Group’s IT function maintains and tests network security, 
network resilience and business continuity plans, and monitors 
emerging threats to ensure our preparations and responses are 
current. We also make use of industry-leading software and 
services in support of these activities.
The Group runs quarterly meetings with representation from all 
major products and central Group functions to review technology 
security issues and risks, and to ensure appropriate responses are 
put in place. 
Each business develops its own clearly defined security objectives 
in collaboration with the central Group IT function, which are 
reviewed and updated on a regular basis by the senior management 
of that business. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
32
Risk and potential impact How we manage the risk
9
  Technological change
The Group’s products depend on custom-designed IT platforms. 
These platforms require continual development to ensure the 
services remain competitive, by enhancing existing offerings and 
building new solutions to meet customer requirements. The Group 
also develops IT systems to support its own internal operations.
Such technological development carries the risks of poor quality 
implementation, delivery delays, and failure to deliver the expected 
benefits such as desired customer solutions, business improvements 
or cost efficiencies. In addition customer-facing platforms may be 
rendered obsolete by newer technologies offering faster, more 
flexible or more relevant solutions to customer needs.
The Group reviews all major technology development proposals  
at a senior level, and manages subsequent delivery through robust 
project management.
There are rigorous policies and processes in respect of maintenance 
and updates of hardware and software infrastructure to ensure 
systems are robust and up to date.
The Group maintains an awareness of emerging technology 
developments through a variety of sources including relationships 
with existing vendors and independent partners, market research, 
and involvement with peer networks.
10
  Currency fluctuations
The Group receives revenues and incurs costs in currencies other 
than pounds sterling. Material movements in exchange rates relative 
to pounds sterling could adversely affect the Group’s reported 
results and financial position.
The Group’s approach to management of foreign exchange risk  
is set out in Note 2 to the financial statements.
11
  Taxation
The Group has operations in 15 countries and multiple states in the 
United States and sells its products and services into around 150 
countries, and so is subject to many different forms of taxation in 
many different jurisdictions. 
Tax law and administration is complex, and tax authorities may 
challenge the Group’s application of tax law, potentially leading  
to lengthy and costly disputes and material tax charges. 
The Group maintains an experienced tax function, supported by 
external professional advisers, to ensure that the Group maintains a 
constructive relationship with tax authorities, and keeps up to date 
with changes in tax legislation and in the development of the 
Group’s operations.

Viability and Going Concern statements
Viability Statement
The Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the 
Group in accordance with Provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. This assessment has been based on a 
three-year timeframe, covering the period to 31 December 
2019, which is considered appropriate because it aligns with 
the Group’s strategic planning and financial forecasting 
horizon, and because, in relation to viability, it provides a 
sufficiently long period for stress testing scenarios to be 
modelled through at least one complete business cycle.
Prospects
The Group’s prospects have been assessed mainly with 
reference to the Group’s strategic planning and associated 
long-range financial forecast. This incorporates, as the first 
year, a detailed bottom-up budget for each part of the 
business. The budgeting and planning process is thorough and 
includes input from most operational line managers as well as 
senior management, and forms the basis for most variable 
compensation incentives. The Board also participates during 
the year in both strategic planning and reviewing the detailed 
bottom-up budgets. The outputs from this process include full 
financial forecasts of EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, cash flow, 
working capital and net debt. The Directors consider that the 
planning process and forecasts provide a sound underpinning 
to management’s expectations of the Group’s prospects.
The Directors carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that could threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. This 
assessment was made with reference to the Group’s current 
position and prospects, the Group’s strategy and the Group’s 
principal risks, including how these are managed, as detailed on 
page 28.
Stress testing
The Directors also assessed the potential impact on the 
Group’s prospects should certain risks to the business 
materialise. This was done by considering specific scenarios 
aligned to the principal risks identified above, applied to stress 
test the long-range financial forecast. Of these, the five 
scenarios considered to have the most serious impact on the 
financial viability of the Group were modelled in detail, and  
a sixth scenario was modelled that combined the two most 
serious individual scenarios. The specific scenarios were  
as follows:
• a global recession, designed to capture the impact of  
the most serious plausible manifestation of macro- 
economic risks;
• a major event venue being unavailable at short notice, with 
no equivalent alternative venue available;
• a serious safety and security incident at a major event; 
• a substantial breach of cyber security and associated loss  
of data; and
• the loss of a major customer.
For each scenario, the modelling captured the impact on key 
measures of profitability, cash flow, liquidity and debt covenant 
headroom. Scenarios included the effects of plausible 
mitigation plans where appropriate. In all cases modelled, the 
Group was able to continue to fund its operations and to 
comply with debt covenant requirements.
Confirmation of viability
Based on this assessment of prospects and stress test 
scenarios, together with its review of principal risks and the 
effectiveness of risk management procedures, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2019.
Going Concern Statement
The Group’s business activities, performance and position, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, are set out in the Strategic Report. The Board  
is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the 
principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives. The processes in place for assessment, 
management and monitoring of risks are described on page 28. 
Details of the financial risk management objectives and policies 
of the Group are given on pages 100 to 101 in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully. The Board’s assessment of 
prospects and stress test scenarios, together with its review  
of principal risks and the effectiveness of risk management 
procedures, show that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis for the preparation of the financial statements. In forming 
their view, the Directors have considered the Group’s 
prospects for a period exceeding 12 months from the date 
when the financial statements are approved. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

To ensure we are simple to do business with, Cannes Lions 
significantly overhauled its customer experience this year – 
including improvements to its accommodation services, signposting 
at the event itself and badge collection at the Palais. This included 
more desks, longer opening hours, new printers, instant scan 
barcode email and smart paper badges. As a result, peak waiting 
times at registration fell from 45 minutes in 2015 to 3 minutes  
in 2016. 
These and other changes resulted in positive shifts in customer 
satisfaction scores for key experience indicators including badge 
pick up (+27%), WiFi (+12% ), access to talks (+7%), app usability 
(+3%). Overall Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’) for the Festival was  
up 4% to 47%. 
Making us easier to do business with is a key driver of our business 
and progress with Cannes Lions shows where we are getting  
this right. 
WGSN launched “One WGSN” in March 2016. 
This is the new WGSN single subscription platform which unites all 
its services onto one platform thereby making it easier to access  
all WGSN products with a single sign on. This is the first time 
customers have been able to seamlessly navigate all products and 
instantly get access to fashion, lifestyle design, consultancy and 
other WGSN products in the range. 
This visibility has helped underpin an increase in average product 
holding from 1.13 in 2015 to 1.19 in 2016.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

The Exhibitions & Festivals segment comprises large-
scale exhibitions, congresses and festivals that bring 
communities together to connect and trade; to be 
inspired, to learn and to celebrate. In 2016, the Exhibitions 
& Festivals segment delivered revenues of £180.0m, 
(2015: £150.4m), up 19.7% or 12.3% on an Organic 
basis driven by the launch of Money20/20 Europe and 
continuing strong performance from Cannes Lions.
The division continued to invest in its key products, ensuring 
that content at each event is relevant and valuable to its 
customers and the quality of visitors remains high. The 
division also continued to benefit from initiatives introduced 
in prior years, including on-site rebooking for the following 
year’s event and location-based exhibition stand pricing. 
Ascential’s events are broadly divided into three product types:
 
1. Those of significant scale, which define the markets they 
serve and deliver multiple streams of revenue. At these 
high-growth events, which include Cannes Lions and 
Money20/20, content for the audience is critical and 
requires constant innovation and investment.
2. Global, market-leading, exhibition brands – such as 
CWIEME and Bett – which have both delivered several 
successful new editions in additional geographies over 
recent years. Content is becoming increasingly important  
at these events, and great care is taken to improve all 
elements of the shows to ensure the events remain valued 
and relevant to both visitors and exhibitors. 
3. UK-based exhibition brands, with loyal followings with 
many exhibitors returning year after year. This segment 
includes Spring and Autumn Fair, the UK’s largest trade fair. 
All products in this segment deliver large audiences and are 
trusted barometers of the industries they serve. All would 
be difficult to geo-clone internationally, but offer strong 
cash flow and a large repeat business. 
The top five events of this segment are Cannes Lions, 
Money20/20, Spring/Autumn Fair, Bett and CWIEME. These 
products contributed 83% of the segment’s revenue.
Cannes Lions
Cannes Lions serves the branded communications industry and 
is the largest creative community for networking, inspiration, 
learning and celebration. Each year, more agencies, media 
owners and clients attend the week-long Cannes Lions Festival 
of International Creativity as the centrepiece of a year-round 
campaign for creativity. In 2016, Cannes again received a 
record number of award entries, up 8% over 2015 to more 
than 43,000, and grew paying delegates by 5% to more than 
10,000. Overall, revenues for Cannes Lions increased to 
£55.5m in 2016 (2015: £42.5m), up 18% on an Organic basis.
Cannes Lions has taken steps to strengthen brand advocacy 
by both improving customer experience across both live 
and digital touch points, and by putting creativity first: 
• A key aim for 2016 was to improve the customer experience 
with the launch of online accommodation booking, a new 
VIP welcome experience, dramatically reduced waiting time 
for badge collection, improved event signposting and 
content navigation. The improvements made resulted in a 
net improvement of overall event NPS of 4% points to 47%.

• An ambitious content-led campaign, “Thank you Creativity”, 
was developed by the Cannes Lions in-house team which 
delivered 55,500 sessions on its own microsite, 291,000 
video views and 6.8m media impressions.
As a result of these and other initiatives, delegate 
engagement grew significantly. More than 16,000 
people attended 23 Official Fringe events, while the 
official app was downloaded 12,500 times and there 
were 762,000 swipes on the new networking app.
To maintain its relevance in its core sectors, and deepen 
the Festival’s appeal to new and associated industries, 
the Lions – the awards presented at the Festival – 
and the format of the event itself are under constant 
review. As a result, Cannes Lions has launched adjacent 
festival events, all of which have performed well: 
• Lions Health was launched in 2014, meeting the unique 
needs of the healthcare industry. In its third year, Lions 
Health grew 77% to deliver revenue of £2.5m. It received 
over 2,000 entries for the Pharma and Health & Wellness 
Lions, an increase of 40% compared to the previous year. 
• Now in its second year, Lions Innovation grew 19% to 
deliver revenues of £1.8m, attracted more than 1,000 
entries to the Creative Data and Innovation Lions, up 30% 
versus 2015.
• 2016 saw the launch of Cannes Lions’ third adjacent festival 
in as many years, which delivered first year revenues of 
£1.4m. Lions Entertainment brought together creative 
power-players from the music, film, gaming, sports and 
television industries. Across two days delegates enjoyed live 
content on four stages. From more than 600 entries, the 
inaugural Grand Prix in the new Entertainment Lions for 
Music went to the music video of “Formation” by Beyoncé, 
made by Prettybird Culver City. 
These events underpin the strategy of Cannes Lions, as it seeks 
to expand its customer base across the full spectrum of the 
branded communications industry, and retain its long-standing 
reputation as the barometer of excellence in creativity. 
“ Cannes rewards creativity that  
makes an impression, not just  
delivers impressions. For McDonald’s  
we’ve seen ROI 54% higher with 
creative that wins Lions than  
creative that doesn’t.”

Money20/20
Money20/20, the world’s leading FinTech event, is well 
positioned in a strong market. It delivered revenues of 
£34.7m in 2016 (2015: £18.7m), up 60% over a year earlier. 
Founded five years ago, Money20/20 has grown very 
strongly and the volume of paying delegates now stands 
at more than 13,000. Over the same period, volume 
of exhibitors rose from 77 in 2012 to 562 in 2016.

welcomed more than 10,700 attendees (2015: 10,400) at the 
most recent US edition, held in Las Vegas in October 2016. The 
event also continued to attract increasing numbers of CEOs 
and C-suite executives, with more than 1,700 attending. In 
total, more than 3,100 companies were represented, from 85 
countries around the world. The event ran four distinct content 
streams and welcomed over 500 speakers including Jack 
Dorsey of Twitter and Square and Douglas Feagin of Ant 
Financial Group, the financial services arm of Alibaba. 
Following discussions with customers, April 2016 saw the 
launch of Money20/20 Europe, created to specifically address 
the unique needs and challenge of the European markets. In its 
first year, the event welcomed 3,700 attendees, 420 industry-
leading speakers, 200 sponsors, 100 media partners and 
C-level executives from 75 countries. This was a significant 
2015 investment, and delivered revenues of £7.8m. It was 
Ascential’s biggest launch to date and a superb example of 
getting a launch right. 
Following the success of Money20/20 Europe, we further 
assessed the global FinTech market and announced the launch 
of Money20/20 Asia to be held in March 2018 in Singapore. 
This will provide the platform for pan-Asian and global 
companies to join forces and explore the unique opportunities 
fuelling the growth of the Asia Pacific payments landscape.

Spring and Autumn Fair
Spring Fair is the UK’s largest trade exhibition and is amongst 
Europe’s biggest home and gift events. Together with its 
Autumn edition, it is the gateway to UK retailing and attracts 
around 60,000 UK and international visitors from independent 
and major multiple retailers to e-commerce specialists and 
department stores. The show covers 13 key buying sections 
which are regularly evolved in line with the evolution of UK 
retail generally. Locations of each section are also reviewed to 
ensure each one is working to best effect for those attending 
the event and to allocate the most space to those sections with 
the highest demand.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
39
All revenue at Spring and Autumn Fairs is derived from 
exhibitors as the events are free to attend for visitors. 2016 
revenues were £34.3m, up 3% (2015: £33.1m). On-site 
rebooking, enabling customers to secure their stand location a 
year ahead, continues to be a major focus. In 2016, Spring and 
Autumn Fairs achieved contracted bookings of over 70% of 
stand revenue within three months of the previous year’s 
event. This feature gives good forward visibility and enables 
the sales team to focus on customer service and new  
business sales.
Location based pricing (differentiating stand price based on 
position in the hall and stand design) improved yield overall  
by 5%. It is important to deliver return on investment for 
exhibitors and visitors alike and operational excellence – 
driving retention through relevance and value – remains  
the overall focus at the event. 
Bett
Bett is the leading educational technology series of global 
events and leadership summits. Bett brings together people, 
ideas, practices and technologies so that educators and 
learners can fulfil their potential. Across the global series, Bett 
welcomed almost 50,000 visitors from 139 countries in 2016, 
including 80 Ministries of Education. It delivered revenues of 
£15.7m, up 9% on the prior year (despite challenging economic 
conditions for its Brazilian edition) and deepened its strategic 
partnerships with both Microsoft and TES.
Since 2012, Bett has expanded beyond the UK and now has a 
presence in five key geographies – Brazil, Mexico, Middle East, 
Malaysia and the UK. The main edition is held in London each 
January and attracts leading industry speakers, educationalists, 
major sponsorship partners, education bodies and Government 
Ministers who have chosen this platform to announce changes 
to Government education policy.
In 2016 Bett held its inaugural event in the Middle East in Abu 
Dhabi and successfully rolled out value based pricing in London 
across four pricing zones aligned to stand location. 
CWIEME 
CWIEME serves the automotive, consumer electronics and 
power generation sectors. In 2016, CWIEME delivered 
revenues of £8.8m (2015: £8.9m), up 2% in local currency. 
Berlin is the main CWIEME event connecting engineers with 
suppliers for electric motors and transformers. The event has 
also several regional editions: Istanbul in Europe; Chicago in 
the US and Shanghai, China. As Berlin continues to mature, 
CWIEME works closely with its customers worldwide to 
ensure all the shows remain relevant, with appropriate  
content at all events. This enables it to continually improve  
its proposition thereby driving retention. CWIEME is also 
evolving regional and trade partnerships, particularly in  
the US and China. 
Other Exhibitions & Festivals product performance
Beyond the top five products in this segment, revenues at our 
smaller products declined by 9% to £31.0m (2015: £32.8m). 
The main element of the £1.8m decline was a £2.2m decline  
in revenues from the service we supply to UK Trade and 
Investment following delays stemming from a departmental 
restructuring.
The other brands or products within the Exhibitions & Festivals 
segment are:
• Pure (trend-inspired fashion trade shows)
• Lions Regionals (Eurobest, Lynx, Spikes and Tanagrams)
• RWM (resource efficiency trade show)
• World Retail Congress (global retail congress held in Dubai)
• Glee (garden and outdoor living trade show)
• UKTI (exporter introduction services)
• Broadcast Video Expo (broadcast and video trade show)
• Naidex (disability aids trade show – sold in July 2016)
Industry awards
To be acknowledged by our peers is a great source of pride and 
industry awards are always hard-fought. At the recent AEO 
Excellence Awards we were delighted that Money20/20 won 
in three categories: the Innovation Award, Best Marketing 
Campaign and, for the second year in a row, Best Tradeshow 
Exhibition Overseas. At the Conference Awards in July, Bett 
topped the podium in the Best Conference Series category, 
and Money20/20 took the Best Marketing Award and 
Overseas Conference of the Year Award. At the Exhibition 
News Awards, CWIEME Istanbul was recognised as the best 
brand expansion and Giovanni Musio was awarded the Best 
Organiser Marketer Award. 
Looking ahead
Over recent years, the Exhibitions & Festivals segment has 
created a fast-growing business with market-leading, 
international products. It aims to deliver market-defining 
customer engagement and harness technology to further 
improve digital experiences around the events. This shift will 
deliver year round access to the event and its content, by 
bringing the digital space closer to the physical attendee 
experience. 
In 2017 Ascential’s Exhibitions & Festivals division aims to 
offer more customer-focused, data-led products that bring the 
membership communities of each event together year round.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

75% of Information Services' revenues are derived from 
subscriptions, with transactional revenues contributing 13%. 
The balance of revenues relate to advisory services (5%), 
conferences and awards (5%) and digital and other marketing 
solutions (2%). We have continued to migrate towards a 
digital-only business and, following the discontinuance of the 
Heritage Brands, print advertising revenue now represents  
less than 1% of Group revenue.

WGSN
WGSN is the clear global leader for market intelligence, insight 
and trend forecasts to the fashion industry and design-led 
companies around the world. It is Ascential’s largest product, 
representing 22% of the business. It delivered revenues of 
£67.4m in 2016 (2015: £60.5m), up 6% on an Organic basis. 
WGSN serves more than 6,000 customer organisations and 
enjoys a customer value retention rate of 92%. Many years 
ahead of a WGSN global trend forecast launch, WGSN filters 
global influences through its experts to determine trend 
direction. Insights are supplemented by big data analytics and 
WGSN produces reports in six languages, as well as an 
extensive images library. 
Its strategy is to deliver multiple products to help designers, 
buyers, merchandisers and marketers plan as well as trade their 
product lines more effectively.
In April 2016, WGSN launched its new single subscription 
platform, which unites all its services onto one platform. 
Customers can now access all WGSN products with a single 
sign on. This is the first time customers have been able to 
seamlessly navigate all products and instantly get access to 
fashion, lifestyle design, consultancy and other WGSN 
products. This visibility has helped deliver an increase in 
average product holding from 1.13 in 2015 to 1.19 in 2016. 
Also in April 2016, the first of WGSN’s joint ventures with 
CTIC, started trading which marked a major milestone  
towards growing and developing the Chinese market for 
WGSN’s products.
In today’s fast fashion marketplace, it is vital for retailers to 
understand trend adoption and offer the right product, at the 
right time, at the right price. Businesses cannot rely on intuition 
alone. To meet this need and mitigate pressure on margins, 
WGSN launched Instock in 2013 and today there are more 
than 200 retailers tracked in Instock every day. 
In October 2016, WGSN launched WGSN Insight, offering 
customers deeper insight into fast changing consumer 
behaviours to enable them to discover the future consumer 
with the best-in-class consumer, marketing and retail  
insights customers.
“ With WGSN’s retail 
analytics, what used 
to take weeks, now 
takes minutes.”

Groundsure 
Groundsure, a transactional business, is a market-leading 
provider of environmental risk data. It addresses the needs  
of conveyancers, architects, engineers and other participants  
in the UK residential and commercial property industry. 
Groundsure assesses risk related to flood, contaminated land, 
ground stability, planning and other environmental matters. 
Mainly operating through resellers, the business delivered 
£15.3m in 2016 (2015: £14.2m), up 8% year on year. Revenue 
was up 14% in the first half and up 3% in the second half, 
performing somewhat better than the overall market in which 
residential transactions in England and Wales in the first half 
grew by 11% and declined by 8% in the second half, driven in 
part by changes to the stamp duty regulations. 
One Click Retail
Ascential regularly assesses opportunities to acquire high-
growth products operating in sectors with the potential for 
scale that may benefit from its know-how and infrastructure. 
Information services to the e-commerce industry was 
identified as an attractive part of the retail vertical and,  
as a result, Ascential acquired One Click Retail, a leading 
e-commerce data analytics service provider, to help accelerate 
it globally through, for example, cross-selling their products to 
existing clients of Ascential. 
One Click Retail’s customers include Procter & Gamble, HP, 
Unilever, Hamilton Beach, Nestle and Panasonic. Revenue  
is generated predominantly through recurring annual 
subscriptions to the company’s Dashboard product which 
provides insights to help customers drive sales through 
e-commerce, including Amazon and Walmart, the two largest 
online retailers in the world. 
One Click Retail grew revenues to £7.4m in 2016, a growth  
of 103% with a 142% customer value retention rate. £3.1m  
of this revenue was delivered in the four months following  
its acquisition. 
As a high-growth, globally scalable subscription information 
service product, One Click Retail fits with Ascential’s strategy 
of owning scalable, global market-leading products with 
synergy potential with existing brands.

Retail Week Be Inspired is a campaign to address the challenge of 
gender diversity within the UK retail sector’s senior leadership. 
Retail Week believed that in order to make a difference it needed to 
elevate the debate about women in retail beyond just quotas and 
numbers to explore the career potential of women and provide 
practical inspiration and networking opportunities to encourage 
talented individuals to drive their own careers forward. Be Inspired 
was created to promote the careers of successful female retail 
leaders, highlight role models and inspire the next generation. In six 
months over 200 emerging female retail leaders have been given 
access to some of the most successful figures in the sector over a 
series of networking and story-telling breakfasts, evenings and a one 
day conference. The campaign was recognised with a "Men as 
Agents of Change" Award for Retail Week Managing Director, Chris 
Brook-Carter, from the Women’s Business Council, part of the UK 
Government Equalities Office. 
Bett is the leading education technology series of exhibitions and 
leadership summits. Since 2012, it has expanded beyond its UK hub 
to launch regional events around the world to serve local educators 
with strong content programmes tailored to their market and 
requirements. With the 2016 launch of Bett Middle East, it reached 
over 10,000 education leaders, and attracted around 50,000 visitors 
worldwide. It has a reputation as a very special and unique event and 
regularly welcomes government ministers to announce new 
education policies.
A core element of Bett is to deliver a plethora of inspiring speakers 
from within and outside the education technology industry invited 
to speak on its stage to inform and connect the thousands of people 
who attend. Bett believes that everyone has the potential to make  
a difference in education and is passionate about discovering, 
elevating and amplifying these game changers. Those delivering  
a standout experience in 2016 were 804 speakers, across 841 
sessions and included 10 ministerial speeches.

A leading approach to gender diversity
In 2016, the Company took part in the Hampton-Alexander 
review, which will see British business drive to improve further 
the number of women in senior leadership positions and on the 
Boards of FTSE 350 companies. The review had a stated aim 
that a third of all FTSE 100 leadership roles to be occupied by 
women by the end of 2020, up from 25% today. Ascential was 
highlighted in the November 2016 review as "leading the way" 
with 57.1% women on our plc Board, the highest in the entire 
FTSE 350. 
Share ownership
One of our business beliefs is that when the Company 
prospers, we want everyone who has contributed to prosper. 
When we floated the Company on the London Stock Exchange 
in February 2016, everyone employed by the business at that 
time was gifted 500 shares subject only to their continued 
employment in 2019. Later in the year, we launched the UK 
and International Sharesave and US Stock Purchase saving 
plans for employees wishing to invest in Ascential plc shares. 
These plans enable people who wish to enrol to save a set sum 
each month and in future years buy shares at a discounted 
purchase price. 33% of all eligible employees decided to 
participate, saving on average £203 per month. 
Benefits
As part of an attractive overall employment package, 
people are offered a range of benefits, which they have 
the opportunity to amend during the year. We seek to 
offer solutions that speak to our different generations, so 
benefits are constantly reviewed and introduced, extended 
or removed depending on demand and feedback. 
Valuing the diversity our people bring
Our business success is driven by difference and we value what 
everyone brings. We welcome all employees without unfair or 
unlawful discrimination and aim to inspire everyone to do their 
best work and build their careers with us.
Our people’s opinions matter
People’s opinions matter and we hold regular updates to both 
inform them on business progress and answer any questions 
they may have. 
We conduct and act upon annual employee opinion surveys 
which, along with face-to-face feedback, is key to help us 
understand what people think, and what they want to achieve 
in their careers with us. Each area of the business also regularly 
hosts face-to-face all-staff meetings (known as Town Halls), 
webinars and team briefings to share news and progress 
against priorities.
At the 2016 Company conference, our CEO and CFO hosted 
an open, live Q&A session, taking questions from the floor. 
Responses were recorded and posted to the Intranet for 
people unable to attend. The post-event survey recorded this 
as one of the most popular segments and it was repeated in 
January 2017. Early on the day we announced our half-year 
2016 results, the CEO and CFO again hosted a webinar for 
staff, before meeting external analysts, investors and members 
of the press. 
People and values 
Ascential brings together talented people and brilliant brands.  
We work hard to attract and retain the best people in the industry 
to work on our portfolio of leading products and aim to be a

Employee engagement and rewards
Ascential is a fast-paced, international business. We are a 
responsible destination employer and are determined to attract 
and retain the best in our industry by offering our people great 
opportunities to develop and grow their careers with us. We 
offer regular training and reward linked to performance.
Ascential Excellence Awards
Some of the most hotly contested awards each year are the 
Ascential Excellence Awards, which are open to all employees. 
Judged by senior leaders of the business and external industry 
experts, they are a fun and effective way for the achievements 
of individuals and teams to be recognised and celebrated at a 
gala dinner during the all-Company conference each January. 
Elite
This generous reward programme is open to every high-
performing employee across the Group. Sales league 
winners, content creators and business support individuals 
are recognised with rewards, including tickets to exclusive 
venues, dinners and sporting days out. The highlight of the 
Elite programme is during the annual Ascential conference 
when winners of the “Holidays of a Lifetime” – including 
for the top content and highest sales achievers in each 
business area – are announced. Elite enables a clear line 
of sight from personal performance to personal reward. 
Embedding industry leading standards
Ascential offers an annual sales academy, led by external 
sales experts, as well as a sales reward programme, sales 
performance programme and leadership Alumni programmes. 
Content First programme
To ensure we set ourselves up for future success, inspire 
world-class content and embed a content excellence culture, 
Ascential offers a Content First programme. Run by one of 
Ascential’s most respected and successful content leaders 
with an outstanding track record in driving exceptional 
content, the in-house Content First programme aims to 
further embolden our content talent across the whole 
business to deliver the content our customers need, when 
they need it and in a simple to find and digest format. 
The Ascential Content First programme will run for the 
next 24 months to ensure we develop our next generation 
of world-class content leaders. To achieve the overall aim 
of constantly improving content for our customers, we also 
offer additional opportunities for our content leaders to 
collaborate with other teams to assist them to drive content 
excellence within their own teams and brands. Armed with 
robust data around customer insight and market knowledge, 
these leaders will continue to raise the standard of Ascential’s 
content to be the best in each of the industries we serve. 
All-Ascential conference
We held our first all-Company conference in January 2016 
which enabled more than 1,000 individuals to network, 
share personal and team learnings and collaborate. Our 
annual conference and Gala Awards night has become 
an important part of our journey to a more informed and 
connected Ascential. The event is a large investment by 
the Company, but we believe is key to continuing to share, 
learn, connect with colleagues and celebrate the great 
work of individuals and teams across the business.
Journey ahead
People is a core capability at which we must excel. While 
we have made good progress towards putting in place the 
structure, learning and support to enable everyone to reach 
their goals and develop their careers with us, we also recognise 
that there is always more to do on the journey ahead.

Greenhouse gas emissions statement
Ascential is required to measure and report its direct and 
indirect greenhouse gas emissions by the Companies Act 
2006. We are required to disclose the Company’s emission 
of carbon dioxide (equivalence) as well as CO2 intensity 
value while stating the methodology used to calculate these 
emissions. The table below includes both combustion of fuel 
and purchased electricity and gas associated with our offices.

1  Scope 1 emissions are from fuel used in company-leased vehicles and are 
calculated using the distance-based calculation method (DEFRA GHG conversion 
factors 2016). Emissions from personal or privately-hired vehicles used for 
company business are considered to be Scope 3 (GHG protocol) and are not 
included following the “operational control” boundary approach (see 
Methodology and scope).
2  Scope 2 emissions are from the consumption of energy at Ascential offices and  
do not include approximately 40 home workers. CO2 figures are based upon the 
energy consumption of approx. 84% of Ascential’s operations (using office surface 
area) with estimates for the remainder. Where the consumption of energy other 
than electricity (eg natural gas) is supplied as part of a leased building’s SLA and  
is not available, this information has not been included in the data. 
3  Scope 3 does not include approximately 40 home workers.
Methodology and scope
Carbon dioxide equivalence emissions data has been collected, 
calculated, consolidated and analysed following the GHG 
Protocol (Corporate Accounting & Reporting Standard) and 
DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidelines (2013) following 
the ‘operational control’ approach. The boundary for reporting 
extends to include all entities and facilities that are owned or 
leased by Ascential and are also actively managed by Ascential.
Customers are at the heart of everything we do every day, 
and we constantly review what we produce and how we do it 
to ensure we remain ahead. We have continued to progress 
our Corporate and Social Responsibility aims, particularly 
around supporting our employees and giving back to the 
communities we serve. Over the past 12 months we have also 
further reduced our environmental impact, and introduced 
policies around labour standards, human rights and anti-
corruption policies throughout our business and supply chain. 
With these and other measures, we believe we are continuing 
to make a positive impact on our customers world-wide, 
the communities we live in and serve, and our people. 
Increasing energy efficiency and recycling
We have a policy across all existing and new buildings to work 
with our landlords to ensure installation of energy efficient low 
temperature hot water, low energy lighting and low power 
technology. As a business, Ascential encourages recycling  
in all its forms. 
Waste recycling
Ascential works closely with our facilities management 
company and landlords to highlight any and all initiatives.  
In 2016, the London-based business recycled 50 tonnes of 
material, including 16 tonnes of general waste and 34 tonnes 
of mixed paper. This is an increase over 2015 and 2014 and 
was recognised with a “most improved recycler” award in 2016 
from one of our building landlords.
Reducing print in line with customer need
The business constantly seeks to improve print run efficiency 
and generate less waste on paper stock. It purchases the 
lowest paper volume necessary and uses only one or two 
grades across all titles and supplements. It also follows a 
criteria of mill assessment rated on product grade, energy 
consumption per tonne and percentage of recycled fibre 
content from certified forestry sources and continues to 
consolidate collection of overseas copies and scale back  
usage of polywraps. 
The paper requirement of the Group has diminished in recent 
years with the sale of MBI in January 2015 and as many 
customers have increased consumption of content on mobile 
and other devices rather than print. This decline in paper 
requirements has continued in 2016 as several products have 
ceased print or reduced frequencies. Initiatives are in place to 
further reduce paper weight and volume in line with advances 
in paper technology and customer demand and a further 
significant drop in paper usage is expected in 2017 on the  
sale of the Heritage Brands.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
Wanting to make a difference to the industries we serve and 
communities we live in is a common goal at Ascential.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

Timeframe and future reporting
As this is the first year of reporting CO2e emissions following 
our IPO last year, only data for 2016 has been shown. In future, 
year over year emission figures will be given. Furthermore, 
Ascential intends to review its environmental data management 
process with a view to continuing to improve data accuracy and 
disclosure going forward. 
Business travel
Ascential’s air travel showed a slight dip over the year earlier, 
but remains something that the business watches and aims to 
reduce. The level of business travel by air is partly explained by 
the need to frequently visit the US, following the move of the 
WGSN headquarters to New York in 2014, and the acquisition 
of US brands – Money20/20 in 2014; RetailNet Group in 2015 
and One Click Retail in 2016. The Company continues to 
encourage the use of video conference facilities and webinars 
as much as possible so as to remove any unnecessary travel. 
Where possible, the business encourages business use of trains 
rather than cars. 
Whistleblowers’ policy
Ascential employees can report any malpractice without  
fear of reprisals. The Company has a robust whistleblower 
policy embedded in the employee handbook and available  
on the Intranet.
Business-wide training and zero tolerance to breaches of the 
Bribery Act
Following Company-wide training on the Bribery Act, people 
across the business continue to report no breaches of the 
Bribery Act. 
Behaving ethically throughout our supply chain
For Ascential, our suppliers, partners and other third parties 
involved in the provision of goods or services to us are 
important. They underpin our ability to serve our customers 
through market-leading exhibitions, festivals and information 
services. While delivering these valued and trusted products,  
it is important to us that we and our suppliers do business 
responsibly, ethically and lawfully and in accordance with our 
code of conduct:
Business integrity There is no tolerance of any form of corruption, bribery, fraud, extortion or embezzlement and business is conducted in a 
manner that avoids conflicts of interest.

Freedom of 
association

all forms or threats of physical and psychological abuse.
No child labour There are no workers under the age of 15, or where it is higher, the mandatory school leaving age in the local country.  
The use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programmes, which comply with all laws and regulations, is supported.
Fair competition Fair, business, advertising and competition is supported.
Intellectual 
property, privacy

and kept up-to-date and their operational and reporting requirements are followed.
Quality, health,

in the community who may be affected by their activities. Third parties act responsibly in relation to the environment, 
regularly assess health, safety and environmental risks and appropriate controls are put in place bearing in mind the 
prevailing knowledge of the industry and any specific hazards. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Q
A
Giving back
Ascential employees want to make a difference to the world 
they live in and the communities they serve. The business 
supports the pioneering children’s hospital, Great Ormond 
Street, raising funds to pay for specialised equipment. Offices 
around the world also support local causes and raise much 
needed funds for their communities. Ascential matches certain 
fundraising by staff and gives employees time off to volunteer 
for an organisation or charity they wish to support.
The Company is a Patron of The Prince’s Trust and employees 
give their time to help disadvantaged young people make a 
better start in life, and fundraise for this leading UK charity.  
For the third year in a row, an Ascential Million Makers team 
was awarded seed financing to support their efforts to raise 
significant levels of funds. Having raised almost £90,000 in 
2015, the team’s main focus was December’s Gala Dinner, and 
they smashed through the prior year fundraising total to raise 
more than £170,000 in 2016. 
Q.  How long has Ascential been a Patron of  
The Prince’s Trust?
A.  Ascential became a Patron of The Prince’s Trust in 
2012. Our partnership was borne out of my strong 
belief that team engagement, collaboration and 
leadership skills are intrinsic to both life and business 
success, and that the privileged should give back.
Q.  Why did Ascential choose The Prince’s Trust over 
other charities to support?
 
A.  The Prince’s Trust is a great fit for us. One of the core 
traits of our people is their determination to improve 
the world around us for our customers, our community 
and ourselves. This determination manifests itself 
in many ways – not just fundraising, but also getting 
involved in the work of the charity itself. Around the 
business, people feel passionate about giving a better 
start and work confidence skills to young people less 
fortunate than ourselves. They could be our future.
 
Q.  Why is it important to you that the business gives back?
A.  Our business exists to make a difference to our customers 
and industries we serve, and to the communities we live 
in. We constantly seek to improve and better the world 
around us. We are proud to have helped many young 
people get a better start in life and we are looking forward 
to continuing to partner the Trust in its great work.
 
Q.  How does Ascential raise money?
A.  Any and all ways! People have successfully run bake 
sales, raffles, cycle rides, cocktail mixing and auctions 
of a host of prizes, donated by suppliers, customers or 
people in the business. We have also run casino tables 
at several of our Award events as well hosting our own 
Prince’s Trust Gala Dinner which is our major annual 
fundraiser. This is attended by our customers, suppliers, 
our plc Board members as well as people from around 
the business, all keen to support the event. This has 
grown from strength to strength and I am so proud 
of the team that put it all together. Their hard work 
with our venue partners and persistence ensured the 
2016 event was again well sponsored, with a fantastic 
auction and raised a truly remarkable £170,000. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Q.  How else does Ascential support The Prince’s Trust?
A.  We have supported young people in our communities by 
both visiting our local Prince’s Trust centres to see their 
work first hand, and by hosting a variety of workshops 
and mentoring – teaching CV preparation, job application 
writing and business skills. In 2017 we are working with 
The Prince’s Trust to match 10 young people with an 
Ascential department – including marketing, IT, facilities, 
and PR, for a two week placement that complements 
their interests and skillset. Our talented people are keen 
and able to give their time and tutoring skills to mentor 
and bring alive the confidence and energy of the intern, 
while making a real difference to their future potential. 
Our aim is to offer more places by the end of the year.
 
Q.  Do you personally get involved in any of the challenges?
A.  I greatly admire those that have completed the major 
challenges of walking the Great Wall in China or the bike 
rides to Paris with some envy. I am looking forward to 
getting time this year to participate in some less arduous 
event and would love to find time in the next couple  
of years to do one of the bigger challenges. Right now,  
I believe I can add more personal value from the time and 
support I give to The Prince’s Trust Corporate Sponsors 
Committee to develop new ideas and have offered 
our internal media resources and teams to support its 
campaigns. We have also introduced the Trust’s great 
work to other corporate sponsors. A personal highlight 
each year is hosting a table at our fundraising dinner 
and encouraging audacious bids to drive the fundraising 
efforts of our annual Million Makers team. It’s also a great 
occasion to cement relationships with the customers that 
attend – they get to see us in a non-work environment, and 
we can have fun while raising money for a great cause.
 
Q.  How have you seen it contribute to the individuals within 
Ascential that have taken part in Million Makers?
A.  Everyone who teaches or mentors someone from The 
Prince’s Trust knows they are making a real difference to 
the life of a disadvantaged young person. Imparting life-
changing skills builds confidence and strong relationship 
skills which can then be applied to our own business 
and to further improve how we serve our customers. 
Collaborating and working with young people means you 
have to listen to make sure you really understand what 
they mean, rather than what they say – this is a great skill 
to have and an important lesson for anyone to learn.
 
Q.  What is your best personal memory of Ascential and 
The Prince’s Trust?
A.  There are many, but meeting the young people that The 
Prince’s Trust supports is always a delight. A great memory 
from last year was seeing our Million Makers team take to 
the stage at the gala dinner and announcing our fundraising 
total for the night. There is little that can beat that. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Corporate Governance Statement
Dear Shareholder, 
I am pleased to introduce our Corporate Governance Report for 2016, which explains the corporate governance arrangements 
Ascential has in place, and includes reports from each of our three Board Committees.
Introduction
Our Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and is responsible for ensuring that these standards, alongside 
the Company’s values and behaviours are consistently applied throughout the Group as they underpin the integrity of the Group’s 
operations, and deliver and preserve shareholder value. 
This statement includes matters required to be disclosed by the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (the “Code”). The Code is 
available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at frc.org.uk. A new version of the Code was introduced in September 2016, 
and the revised provisions will apply to the Company for the 2017 financial year. The Board will therefore report on its 
implementation of the new version of the Code in next year’s Annual Report.
Compliance with the Code 
As at the date of this Report, the Company is in full compliance with the provisions of the Code. 
At the time of Admission, the Company did not comply with all of the Code’s provisions. We did not comply with the provisions 
surrounding the composition of the Board and its Committees for the whole of the period under review, which is explained in 
more detail below. However, we committed to take the necessary steps to fully comply within 12 months of joining the FTSE 250 
Index, and we achieved that goal soon after Admission. 
The Board is satisfied that the non-compliance with two provisions for part of the period did not impede its effectiveness, nor  
did it create any risk to shareholders. No individual dominated its decision-taking, no undue reliance was placed on particular 
individuals and there was sufficient challenge of Executive Directors in Board or relevant Committee meetings. The Board and 
relevant Committees operated effectively throughout the whole period; sound governance procedures were observed during  
the period and business objectives were met. 
Code provision Detail Explanation of non-compliance
A.4.1 Until 12 May 2016, the Board did not 
appoint one of the Independent Non-
Executive Directors to be the Senior 
Independent Director.
The Company appointed its Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director on 12 May 2016, this being Rita Clifton, bringing the 
Board into full compliance with this provision from that date. 
B.1.2 Until 12 May 2016, less than half of the 
Board were Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. 
The Company became a member of the FTSE 250 Index during the 
reporting period. For FTSE 250 Index companies, at least half of 
the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise Independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
The Company appointed Rita Clifton on 12 May 2016, bringing 
the Board into full compliance with this provision from that 
date. Furthermore, the two Non-Executive Directors who were 
not considered to be independent (Tom Hall and David Pemsel) 
resigned on 5 September 2016.
Directors 
We appointed four new Independent Non-Executive Directors during the year. There was a rigorous process for the appointments 
as described in the report of the Nomination Committee on page 67. 
Each Director brings their particular perspective to a discussion, drawn from a range of backgrounds in different industries and 
roles over many years. They bring constructive challenge, scrutiny and analysis of the Board’s agenda with their significant 
financial and commercial experience. The Board share a common purpose of promoting the overall success of the Group, with a 
clear and unified vision of how it supports the executive team in their implementation of the Group’s strategy whilst discharging 
governance and supervisory responsibilities. 
All Directors will offer themselves for election by the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

Board evaluation 
As well as ensuring that the Board includes the appropriate balance between Executive and Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, we also recognise the need to be effective as a Board. Even though the Board was only constituted in 2016, the 
Directors strongly believed that a full evaluation process should be carried out in its first year to ensure the Board’s proper 
performance from the outset. To that end, a thorough, externally facilitated evaluation process was carried out by an independent 
consultancy during the year, which is described on page 59.
Board responsibilities 
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval and has delegated other specific responsibilities  
to its Committees. This schedule sets out key aspects of the affairs of the Company which the Board does not delegate and  
is reviewed on an annual basis. This includes:
• receiving regular reports from the Chief Executive Officer on the Group’s operations;
• reviewing regular financial information on the Group’s performance;
• reviewing the Group’s strategy and operating priorities, providing constructive challenge as necessary;
• agreeing the 2017 business plan and budget;
• evaluating the Group’s portfolio – acquisitions, divestitures and other corporate transactions;
• overseeing the Group’s governance and shareholder engagement;
• approving the dividend policy and capital structure;
• reviewing the full year and half year financial results;
• reviewing stakeholder engagement, and investor communications strategy;
• conducting a robust review of risks and agreeing a risk appetite;
• approving the Viability Statement; and
• completing the Board evaluation.
The management of the day-to-day running of the Group, including the development and implementation of strategy, monitoring 
the operating and financial performance and the prioritisation and allocation of resources, has been delegated to executive 
management.
Committees of the Board 
The Board has delegated authority to its Committees to carry out certain tasks on its behalf, allowing the Board to operate 
efficiently and to give the right level of attention and consideration to relevant matters. A summary of the terms of reference of 
each Committee is set out in the table below and the full terms of reference for each Committee are available on the Company’s 
website at ascential.com.

Board roles 
There is a clear division of roles and responsibilities between the Chairman, Scott Forbes, and the Chief Executive Officer,  
Duncan Painter, which have been agreed by the Board and are set out in writing.
Rita Clifton was appointed the Senior Independent Director on joining the Board on 12 May 2016. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, Louise Meads, who was appointed on 6 February 
2017. Prior to that, Mandy Gradden was the Company Secretary. 
Board composition 
At the date of this report, the Board consists of the Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and four Non-Executive 
Directors. Biographies of all members of the Board appear on pages 52 and 53.
The Davies Review on gender diversity, led by Lord Davies of Abersoch, recommended increasing the voluntary target for 
women’s representation on boards of FTSE 350 companies to a minimum of 33%. As the Board is currently constituted,  
the Company exceeds this recommendation at 57%.

Board balance and independence
From 12 May 2016 to the date of this report, the Company has 
been compliant with the Code provision that at least half the 
Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company became compliant

appointment to the Board. 
All of the current Non-Executive Directors (Paul Harrison, Judy 
Vezmar, Gillian Kent and Rita Clifton), are considered to be 
independent in character and judgement, and free of any 
business or other relationship which could materially influence 
their judgement. Scott Forbes was considered to be 
independent on appointment. 
The Chairman’s fees and the Non-Executive Directors’ fees are 
disclosed on page 77, and they received no additional 
remuneration from the Company since the date of IPO. 
The Company has a relationship agreement (the “Relationship 
Agreement”) in place with its former principal shareholders, 
funds advised by Apax (the ‘Apax Shareholders’) and Guardian 
Media Group (“GMG”). While the Relationship Agreement is in 
force, the Apax Shareholders and GMG were entitled to 
appoint a Non-Executive Director each, providing they (and 
any of their respective associates, when taken together) hold 
voting rights over 15% or more of the Company’s issued share 
capital; and information rights providing they (and any of their 
respective associates, when taken together) hold voting rights 
over 5% or more of the Company’s issued share capital. The 
two Non-Executive Directors appointed by, and representing, 
the Apax Shareholders and GMG respectively, were Tom Hall 
and David Pemsel, and they were therefore not considered 
independent. 
On 1 September 2016, the Apax Shareholders and GMG 
disposed of 80,000,000 ordinary shares in Ascential through a 
private placing. Tom Hall and David Pemsel resigned from the 
Board with effect from 5 September 2016.
Appointments to the Board 
Non-Executive appointments to the Board are for an initial 
term of up to three years. Non-Executive Directors are 
typically expected to serve two three-year terms, although the 
Board may invite the Director to serve for an additional period. 
Please refer to the Report of the Nomination Committee on 
page 67 for more information on the appointment process. 
External directorships
Any external appointments or other significant commitments 
of the Directors require the prior approval of the Board. 
Mandy Gradden is a non-executive director of SDL plc, a global 
content management and language translation software and 
services company, and Duncan Painter is a director of the 
Professional Publishers Association Limited, the publishing 
industry body which promotes companies involved in the 
production of media in the UK. During the year, Scott Forbes 
was appointed as a non-executive director of Travelport 
Worldwide Limited. Gillian Kent was appointed chairman  
of No Agent, and Duncan Painter was appointed a  
non-executive adviser to the Board of Investis Limited  
and ThoughtRiver Limited. 
The Board is comfortable that these appointments do not 
impact on the time that any Director devotes to the Company. 
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association,  
the Board has a process for Directors to declare conflicts  
of interests and for such conflicts to be considered  
for authorisation.
Letters of appointment 
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors have letters  
of appointment which are available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company during normal business hours 
and at the place of the AGM from at least 15 minutes before 
and until the end of the meeting.
Induction and development 
Each Non-Executive Director appointed to the Board was 
provided with information on the Group’s structure, business 
sectors and operations and policies to develop each Director’s 
understanding of the Group and key issues that the Group 
faces. They also met with senior executives in the Company. 
The Board is updated by the Group Legal Director on relevant 
material changes to laws and regulations. The Board also 
receives reports from the Company Secretary on current legal 
and governance issues. In addition, the Board meets once a 
year at one of the Group’s main events/operational sites so 
that it has the opportunity to meet employees across the 
Group’s global operations. In 2016 the Board met at Cannes 
Lions Festival and it received presentations from the senior 
Lions’ employees. The Board also attended events at the 
Festival and met with key customers. 
The Board held an offsite strategy day in September 2016 
where it met with the senior management team. It discussed 
and approved the evolution of the Group’s brands, the 
sustainability of the Group’s strategy and organisation,  
and governance. 
Information and support available to Directors
Full access to all relevant information is given to the Board. For 
Board meetings, this consists of an agenda, minutes of previous 
meetings and a comprehensive set of papers including regular 
business reports, provided to Directors in a timely manner in 
advance of meetings. 
All the Directors have the opportunity to contribute 
independent challenge and rigour by voicing their concerns. 
Board decisions are noted in the minutes. Directors are  
entitled to take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties,  
where considered necessary.
Election of Directors 
The Board can appoint any person to be a Director, either to fill 
a vacancy or as an addition to the existing Board. Any Director 
so appointed by the Board shall hold office only until the next 
AGM and shall then be eligible for election by the shareholders.

Board evaluation and effectiveness 
A formal external evaluation of the Board, its Committees and 
individual Directors has taken place during the year, which  
was facilitated by Echelon Compensation Partners, Inc. This 
included the completion of a detailed questionnaire by each of 
the Directors, covering the Board’s role, knowledge and skills, 
Board meetings and information flows, Board composition, 
succession planning, risk management, relations with 
shareholders and each of the Board Committees. The results 
were reviewed by the Board in December 2016. In addition, an 
assessment of the Chairman’s performance was carried out, 
and feedback was provided to him individually as well as  
the Board.
Risk management 
The Company does not have a separate Risk Committee; the 
Board is collectively responsible for determining the nature and 
extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. The processes in place for assessment, 
management and monitoring of risks are described in a 
separate section on page 28.
 
Internal control framework 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and it 
receives regular reports identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant risks within the business. The system of internal 
controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Audit Committee reviews the system of internal controls 
through reports received from management and external 
auditors. Details of the activities of the Audit Committee can 
be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 65 to 
66. The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, has carried 
out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls during the year ended 31 December 2016 and for the 
period up to the date of approval of the consolidated financial 
statements contained in the Annual Report. The Board 
confirms that no significant weaknesses or failings were 
identified as a result of the review of effectiveness. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Company recognises the importance of communicating 
with its shareholders. The Company gives formal presentations 
of the full year and interim results as well as meeting with 
individual investors. During the year, the Company has directly 
engaged with over 100 institutional investors either face-to-
face, via telephone, video-conferencing, or at investor 
conferences and roadshows in the UK and overseas. 
There is also an ongoing investor relations programme of 
meetings with institutional investors, fund managers and 
analysts and conferences, covering a wide range of issues 
within the constraints of publicly available information, 
including strategy, performance and governance. The Company 
holds an annual Capital Markets Day. In 2016, it was held in 
London in November, giving shareholders the opportunity to 
meet with the senior management team, and to gain a more 
in-depth understanding of one area of the Group’s business.
Institutional shareholders and analysts have regular contact 
with the Executive Directors. All shareholders are kept 
informed of significant developments by announcements  
and other publications on the Company’s website  
ascential.com/investors. Care is exercised to ensure that any 
price-sensitive information is released to all shareholders, 
institutional and private, at the same time, in accordance with 
the requirements of the Market Abuse Regulations. Questions 
from individual shareholders are generally dealt with by the 
Executive Directors. 
The Board receives regular reports on issues relating to share 
price, trading activity and movements in institutional investor 
shareholdings. The Board is also provided with current analyst 
opinions, forecasts and feedback from its joint corporate 
brokers, Goldman Sachs International and Numis Securities 
Limited, on the views of institutional investors on a non-
attributed and attributed basis. Any major shareholders’ 
concerns are communicated to the Board by the  
Executive Directors. 
The Senior Independent Director, Rita Clifton, and other 
Non-Executive Directors are available to meet with 
shareholders and are offered the opportunity to attend 
meetings with major shareholders. Arrangements can be made 
to meet with them through the Company Secretary.

The Independent Auditor’s Report is set out on pages 83 to 86.

at the AGM. 
All proxy votes received in respect of each resolution at the

all the proposed resolutions is conducted on a poll rather than 
a show of hands, in line with recommended best practice.

No amendments are proposed to be made to the existing Articles of Association at the forthcoming AGM.

the Company’s issued ordinary share capital) can only be allotted pursuant to a rights issue. The Directors have no present 
intention of exercising this authority which will expire at the conclusion of the AGM in 2018 or 11 August 2018 if earlier.

Capital reduction 
During the year, the Company completed a reduction of share 
capital whereby the entire amount standing to the credit of the 
Company’s share premium account was cancelled; 876,266,690 
deferred shares (which were issued by way of a bonus issue for 
the purpose of capitalising the Company’s capital reserve) were 
cancelled; and the nominal value of each issued ordinary share 
in the capital of the Company was reduced from £0.10 to £0.01 
(the “Capital Reduction”). The Capital Reduction was necessary 
in order to provide the Company with the distributable 
reserves required to support the dividend policy. 
The Capital Reduction was approved by a special resolution 
passed at a general meeting of the Company on 8 February 
2016, and was formally approved by the High Court of Justice, 
Chancery Division, on 8 June 2016. Following registration of 
the order of the High Court with Companies House, the

Following the Capital Reduction, as at 8 June 2016, the issued 
share capital of the Company consists of 400,542,500 ordinary 
shares of £0.01 each. The distributable reserves created by the 
Capital Reduction amount to £476.2m.
Rights attaching to shares 
All ordinary shares (this being the only share class of the 
Company) have the same rights (including voting and dividend 
rights and rights on a return of capital) and restrictions as set 
out in the Articles. 
Without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing shares 
and subject to relevant legislation, the Company may issue 
shares with such rights or restrictions as determined by either 
the Company by ordinary resolution or, if the Company passes 
a resolution to so authorise them, the Directors.
Subject to legislation, the Articles and any resolution of the 
Company, the Directors may offer, allot (with or without 
conferring a right of renunciation), grant options over or 
otherwise deal with or dispose of any shares to such persons, 
at such times and generally on such terms as the Directors may 
decide. The Company may issue any shares which are to be 
redeemed, or are liable to be redeemed, at the option of the 
Company or the holder, on such terms and in such manner as 
the Company may determine by ordinary resolution and the 
Directors may determine the terms, conditions and manner  
of redemption of any such shares. No such resolutions are 
currently in effect. 
Subject to recommendation of the Board, shareholders may 
receive a dividend. Shareholders may share in the assets of the 
Company on liquidation. 
Voting rights 
Each ordinary share entitles the holder to attend, speak and 
vote at general meetings of the Company. A resolution put to 
the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a poll rather than  
a show of hands in line with recommended best practice.
On a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy 
shall have one vote for every share of which they are a holder. 
The Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms 
of not than less than 48 hours before the time appointed for 
the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting. No member 
shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting either in person 
or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him, unless all 
amounts presently payable by him in respect of that share have 
been paid. Save as noted, there are no restrictions on voting 
rights nor any agreement that may result in such restrictions.

by the trustee; however, in accordance with best practice 
guidance, the trustee abstains from voting.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Restrictions on transfer of securities
The Articles do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than the restrictions imposed 
by laws and regulations.

shareholders, Merrill Lynch International, Goldman Sachs International (the “Joint Global Coordinators”), BNP Paribas, Deutsche

shareholders agreed not to dispose of any ordinary shares in Ascential for a period of 180 days following Admission; and each of 
the Executive Directors agreed not to dispose of any ordinary shares in Ascential for a period of 360 days following Admission.

Auditor
Each of the Directors has confirmed that:
 
a) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; 
and
b) the Director has taken all reasonable steps that he or she 
ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) was appointed as the auditor to the 
Company and the Group by the Board during the year. KPMG 
has expressed willingness to continue in office and a resolution 
to re-appoint KPMG will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 
Post balance sheet events 
The Group announced in January 2017 that it had separated 
13 Heritage Brands into a separate operating entity that is held 
for sale. As a result of ongoing discussions, the Board now 
considers a sale of this operating entity to be highly probable 
and has therefore reclassified it as a discontinued operation. 
Also in January 2017, the Group announced the sale of the first 
of the Heritage Brands, Health Services Journal, to Wilmington 
plc for a consideration of £19m, payable in cash subject to 
normal working capital adjustments on completion. 
In February 2017, the Group announced that it had agreed  
to acquire 100% of US-based media advisory and business 
services provider Media Link for an initial cash consideration  
of $69m plus future earnouts expected to total between  
$42m and $62m.

Berkshire SL5 7SE, United Kingdom. All shareholders have  
the opportunity to attend and vote, in person or by proxy,  
at the AGM. 
The Notice of the AGM can be found in a separate booklet 
which is being mailed out at the same time as this report. It is 
also available at ascential.com. The Notice sets out the 
resolutions to be proposed at the AGM and an explanation of 
each resolution. The Directors consider that all of the 
resolutions set out in the Notice of AGM are in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.  
To that end, the Directors unanimously recommend that 
shareholders vote in favour of each of them. 
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements in accordance with  
UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial 
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic  
of Ireland.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and  
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they  
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU; 
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
64
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement of the Directors in respect of the 
annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole; and

Report of the Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Report of the Audit Committee 
for 2016. 
Overview
The Audit Committee helps the Board ensure sound 
governance. It has specific responsibility for oversight of 
internal controls and financial management, review of financial 
reporting and especially the key judgements, estimates and 
issues involved, assessing the Group’s long term resilience, and 
oversight of the relationship with external auditor.
Responsibilities
The Committee’s full terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website at www.ascential.com. The main 
responsibilities are to:
• review the content of the Company’s Annual Report and 
Accounts and advise the Board on whether, taken as a 
whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy;
• review and assess accounting principles, policies, practices, 
and judgements and financial statement presentations, 
reviewing and challenging management where necessary;
• monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting 
process and the integrity of the financial statements of the 
Company, including its annual and half year reports, 
preliminary results announcement, dividend proposal and 
any other formal announcement relating to its financial 
performance;
• monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal financial controls and internal control and risk 
management systems, and the policies and overall process 
for identifying and assessing business risks and managing 
their impact on the Company and the Group;
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
audit function in the context of the Company’s overall risk 
management system; and
• oversee the relationship with the external auditor, to assess 
the independence of the external auditor, and to assess the 
effectiveness of the audit process.
Membership and meetings
Members of the Committee and their attendance at 
Committee meetings in the period are set out on page 56.
The Board is satisfied that Paul Harrison has recent and 
relevant financial experience and is well qualified to serve  
as the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Paul is a qualified 
accountant and is the current CFO of Just Eat plc. He was  
the former CFO of Wandisco plc and The Sage Group plc.  
Both Rita Clifton and Gillian Kent have also sat on several  
audit committees.
The Committee met on three occasions during the year. The 
Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. The CEO, 
CFO, and the Director of Financial Control regularly attend,  
as do representatives of the external auditor. Other staff 
members are invited to attend when the Committee considers 
topics on which they have specialist skills and knowledge, such 
as in relation to taxation or IT security. The Committee also has 
regular private meetings with the CFO and with the external 
auditor at which management are not present.
Annual Report and Accounts
The Committee has assessed the Annual Report and Accounts, 
to consider whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy, as required by the Code. In performing this 
assessment, it has taken into account the disclosure and 
prominence of items discussed during the year by the Board 
and by the Committee including, but not limited to, significant 
judgements and issues in relation to the financial statements, 
and also the processes by which management have gained 
assurance that Annual Report disclosures are appropriate. 
Based on this assessment, the Committee has advised the 
Board that, in its view, the Annual Report and Accounts meets 
the Code requirements.
Financial reporting
To meet its responsibilities for financial reporting, during the 
course of the year the Committee reviews reports from both 
management and the external auditor on the definition of, and 
compliance with, critical accounting policies, on developments 
in accounting standards and regulatory reporting requirements, 
and on key risks and matters of judgement in relation to 
financial reporting. The Committee routinely considers the 
appropriateness of accounting practices in respect of revenue 
recognition, capitalisation of development costs, and 
exceptional items. 
The Committee considers the following issues to be the most 
significant matters of judgement in relation to the Annual 
Report and Accounts:
Carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets
Goodwill and acquired intangible assets are material items  
in the Group’s balance sheet. The carrying value is initially 
assessed at the date of acquisition with reference to expected 
future performance of the acquired business. Assets held for 
continued use are subsequently reassessed at least annually, 
based on updated forecasts of business performance. Assets 
held for resale are assessed based on prudent forecasts of sale 
proceeds net of disposal costs. The Committee reviewed 
management’s analysis and underlying assumptions, and were 
satisfied with the conclusions which demonstrated that no 
impairment or revision to useful economic life is needed. 
However, if the results of operations in a future period are 
adverse to the forecasts used for impairment testing (or in the 
case of assets held for sale, actual sale proceeds are lower than 
forecast), an impairment may be triggered at that point, or a 
reduction in useful economic life may be required. 
Acquisition accounting
Acquired businesses give rise to material assets and liabilities  
at the point of acquisition, that are based on estimates and 
judgements about future performance. Goodwill and intangible 
assets are based on expected future cashflows discounted to 
net present value. Often, significant elements of consideration 
are deferred, contingent on future performance, and may be 
subject to other conditions such as continued employment of 
key management personnel. Significant judgement is involved 
in assessing the appropriate forecast, and selecting the 
appropriate discount rates. The Committee reviewed the 
acquisition accounting calculations and underlying 
management estimates and assumptions in the case of One 
Click Retail which was bought during the year, and in respect to 
acquisitions in the earlier years it reviewed the calculations in  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
66
respect of deferred consideration and acquisition-related 
deferred remuneration in light of changes in forecast, in order 
to ensure these were appropriate. 
However, if the future results of these businesses differ from 
the forecasts used for these calculations, there may be a 
material change in the value of these deferred liabilities.
Value of recoverable tax losses
The Group recognises £17.4m of tax losses expected to be 
utilised in respect of its US businesses. This valuation is highly 
sensitive to two assumptions: the future performance of the 
US businesses, and the amount of losses available to utilise. 
During the year, the Group has passed the threshold at which  
a change of control occurs, as defined by the US tax code. As  
a result, the historic losses of the Group’s US businesses will  
be subject to a restriction on utilisation. The amount of this 
restriction will not be known for certain until tax filings in 
respect of 2016 have been filed and not challenged by the US 
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Committee has reviewed 
the assumptions used by management to support the current 
carrying value, together with the findings of the external 
auditor, and is satisfied that these are a reasonable estimate. 
However, should either the future performance of the US 
business or the valuation restriction accepted by the IRS differ 
significantly from these assumptions, there may be a material 
change in the value of these tax losses. It should also be noted 
that, as with all deferred tax items, these assets are based on 
tax rates currently enacted and so assume no change in those 
rates, and if these rates change then there could be a material 
impact on the carrying value.
Adjusted performance measures
The Group uses certain non-GAAP measures of performance, 
as in the opinion of the Directors this provides a better 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business, 
and provides better comparability with other peer group 
companies. The use and definition of these measures is a 
matter of judgement. The Committee discussed these 
measures with both management and advisers, including the 
external auditor, to ensure that the measures were reasonable, 
and reviewed their use in the context of the overall Annual 
Report and Accounts to ensure that this was consistent with 
the Code requirement to be fair, balanced and understandable.
Internal controls
The Committee undertakes an annual review of controls 
effectiveness, and also reviews control issues as they arise 
during the year in relation to operational and compliance 
control matters as well as financial controls. During the year  
it has also supported management in the establishment of  
an internal audit function, to provide additional assurance  
in relation to control matters. The major components of  
the internal controls systems include:
• clearly defined operational structure, accountabilities  
and authority limits; 
• detailed operational planning and forecasting; 
• thorough monitoring of performance and changes  
in outlook; and
• established risk management processes.
Specific matters considered in relation to controls 
effectiveness included:
• cyber security procedures;
• legal regulatory compliance update covering Anti-Bribery, 
Modern Slavery Act, and General Data Protection 
Regulations;
• corporate Code of Conduct and Whistleblowing; 
• review of tax risks and compliance issues;
• treasury policy review; and
• the decision to establish an independent internal  
audit function. 
External audit
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the external 
auditor both provides an effective source of assurance for the 
Group’s financial reporting and controls, and maintains the 
necessary independence and objectivity. 
Independence
The current external auditor, KPMG, was appointed in 2010 
and so there is no requirement to tender the external audit 
engagement until 2020. The current lead audit partner, John 
Bennett, has been in post since 2013 and so will be obliged  
to step down after the 2017 audit. It is expected that, during 
2017, KPMG will nominate a successor as lead audit partner  
to ensure a smooth handover during the course of the year.
The auditor is generally only engaged for audit and related 
activities and the Committee is responsible for enforcing the 
Group’s policy on non-audit services provided by the external 
auditor. If there is a case to use the external auditor to provide 
non-audit services, prior permission is required from the 
Committee who will review the proposal to ensure that it will 
not impact the auditor’s objectivity and independence. The 
policy also requires all permissible services with a fee greater 
than £100,000 be pre-approved by the Committee. A 
breakdown of total audit and non-audit fees charged by the 
external auditor for the year under review is shown in Note 8 
to the financial statements. A summary of non-audit fees paid 
to the external auditor is provided to the Committee on a half 
yearly basis. During the year, KPMG were paid £0.8m in 
respect of services as reporting accountant on the listing of 
Ascential plc. These services were permissible under the FRC 
Ethical Standard and were authorised by the Board of the 
previous holding company of the Group prior to the formation 
and listing of Ascential plc. KPMG were also paid £44,000 in 
respect of tax services completed during 2016, and permitted 
by the Ethical Standard. From 1 January 2017, the Ethical 
Standard does not permit KPMG to provide certain services, 
including tax services.
Effectiveness
The Committee liaises directly with the external auditor 
throughout the year to review audit strategy and plans,  
to monitor progress and receive progress updates, and to 
review audit findings prior to announcement of the financial 
results. In addition, the Committee receives feedback  
from management and conducts a survey of finance staff 
throughout the Group. This regular involvement and feedback 
gives the Committee insight into the quality of work delivered 
and provides the basis for the Committee to conclude that  
is satisfied with the effectiveness of the external auditor. 
Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that KPMG  
be reappointed as auditor for the coming year.

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Report of the Nomination 
Committee for 2016.
Role of the Committee and independence
Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee is responsible for evaluating the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience and the size, 
structure and composition of the Board and Committees of the 
Board. It considers retirements and appointments of additional 
and replacement Directors and Committee members and will 
make appropriate recommendations to the Board on such 
matters falling within its competency. The Nomination 
Committee also assists the Board in the consideration and 
development of appropriate corporate governance principles. 
Independence
The Code recommends that a majority of the members of  
a FTSE 350 nomination committee should be independent 
non-executive directors and that the chairman of the board  
or an independent non-executive director should chair the 
committee. I am pleased to report that the Nomination 
Committee complies with these requirements and invite you  
to consider its terms of reference which can be found on our 
website: ascential.com/investors/corporate-governance. 
Progress during the year
In our first year as a listed company and a member of the  
FTSE 250, the Committee met twice. The key focuses were:
Board appointments
It successfully identified and nominated Rita Clifton as the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, meaning our 
Board composition and Committee membership is in full 
compliance with the provisions of the Code. 
An external executive recruitment consultant, Korn Ferry  
(with whom the Group has no other relationship), was engaged 
to assist with the identification of suitable candidates. A 
comprehensive candidate search brief was agreed, including 
the required industry and public company skills, knowledge 
and experience required for the appointment of the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director. The shortlisted 
candidates each met with members of the Board on a one-on-
one basis before the Committee made its recommendation of 
the preferred candidate to the Board.
Paul Harrison, Gillian Kent and Judy Vezmar were appointed 
Independent Non-Executive Directors prior to Admission and 
so the process for their appointment was led by the Chairman 
rather than the Nomination Committee. 
Organisation and succession planning
The Committee also carried out an extensive organisation and 
succession planning review, covering the Chairman, members 
of the Board, Executive Directors and the senior management 
team. Various actions are being taken to ensure that robust 
plans continue to be in place for the year ahead. To assist the 
Committee achieve its objectives, the Chief Executive Officer 
and the People Director were invited to give presentations to 
the Nomination Committee. 
Report of the Nomination Committee
Board effectiveness
The Nomination Committee oversaw a formal, externally led 
evaluation of the Board, Committees and individual Directors 
during the year. The results were very positive, especially when 
considered in the context of the Board’s relatively recent 
formation – and confirmed that the Board has broad skills and 
a mix of backgrounds and that its members challenge 
management constructively. 
The Committee’s policy towards Board appointments 
The most important priority of the Committee has been, and 
will continue to be, ensuring that members of the Board should 
collectively possess the broad range of skills, expertise and 
industry knowledge, and business and other experience, 
necessary for the effective oversight of the Group. The 
Committee takes account of a variety of factors before 
recommending any new appointments to the Board, including 
relevant skills to perform the role, experience, knowledge  
and diversity.
Ascential endeavours to achieve appropriate diversity, 
including gender diversity, throughout the Company and 
concurs with the recommendations of Lord Davies’ review.  
It brings me great pleasure to report that we have exceeded 
the recommended target of 25% female representation on our 
Board, as well as the higher target of one-third recommended 
by the Hampton-Alexander review in November 2016. Since 
four of our seven Board members are female, female 
representation is 57%. These appointments were made based 
on merit, against objective criteria, to ensure we appointed the 
best individual for each role. 
The Committee will build on the positive feedback and 
suggestions from the Board effectiveness review as it 
progresses with its objectives in 2017. It will also continue to 
focus on the Group’s succession plan and talent development 
to energise the senior management. 
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions on the 
work of the Committee.

Annual Statement from the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
As the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased  
to present, on behalf of the Board, our first Directors’ 
Remuneration Report as a listed company since Admission  
on 12 February 2016. This report sets out Ascential’s 
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, what we paid  
our Executive and Non-Executive Directors in the 10 month 
period since the IPO, and why.
This report is split into three sections: 
1. This Annual Statement, which summarises the key 
decisions made by the Committee during the year and 
forms part of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
2. Directors’ Remuneration Policy – this set outs the 
Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors, Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors. The Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 
forthcoming AGM (we will disclose their views and voting  
in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report) and is 
consistent with that set out in the Admission Prospectus. 
3. Annual Report on Remuneration – this sets out in detail 
how the Remuneration Policy has been applied in 2016, the 
remuneration received by Directors for the year and how 
the policy will be applied in 2017. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the AGM.
Performance and reward in 2016
2016 was an historic year for Ascential with our successful IPO 
occurring just after the start of the year. In celebration of this, 
in March 2016, we were pleased to offer an award of free 
shares worth £1,000 each to around 1,600 eligible employees 
at that time. In addition we established an employee Sharesave 
plan available to employees in all eligible countries.
2016 was also a year of strong business performance, as 
summarised on page 10. For the Group’s continuing operations, 
reported revenue grew by 16.8%, or 9.5% on an organic, 
constant currency basis and Adjusted EBITDA was up 25.2%, 
or 11.5% on an organic, constant currency basis. 
Annual bonuses of 25% of salary for the CEO and the CFO 
were earned in the financial year based on meeting key 
strategic performance goals relating to portfolio restructuring 
plans. Financial performance was strong and fully met 
expectations established with shareholders. Despite exceeding 
shareholder expectations and the stretching financial targets 
for Continuing Operations set by the Committee, the 98% 
threshold “gate” Group financial target was not met. The 
shortfall was attributable to under performance by our 
recently discontinued Heritage Brands. Notwithstanding  
the strong financial performance achieved for continuing 
operations, and rapid progress across organisation, Board, 
shareholder and portfolio objectives, the bonus attributable  
to revenue and profit performance is not payable unless the 
threshold profit gate has been achieved and no bonus was 
therefore awarded in relation to the financial performance 
conditions. Total bonus awarded to the Executive Directors in 
relation to the 2016 financial year is therefore 25% of salary. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
As set out in the Admission prospectus, the maximum annual 
award under the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) is 200% of 
salary (rising to 250% in exceptional circumstances). An initial 
PSP award was granted following the IPO of 175% of salary for 
the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO.
How the policy will be implemented for the 2017 financial year
Current salaries for Executive Directors were set prior to the 
IPO. No inflationary rises were awarded at the normal salary 
review date of 1 April 2016. The current Remuneration 
Committee has undertaken a review of their salaries taking 
into consideration the Executive Directors’ performance, rapid 
progress of the business against all aspects of our agreed 
strategy and proactive consultation with shareholders 
comprising a majority of our shares, we have decided to 
increase Duncan Painter’s salary to £525,000 and Mandy 
Gradden’s to £354,000 effective 1 April 2017. The Committee 
believes that these increases will ensure that our Executive 
Directors are appropriately and fairly rewarded going forward. 
The annual bonus plan will continue to be subject to a 
maximum of 125% of base salary and measured against 
stretching financial targets. 50% of the bonus will be based on 
Adjusted EBITA and 50% will be based on revenue. Half of any 
bonus earned will be deferred into shares, which vest after a 
three-year period. 
PSP awards will be made to Executive Directors at 200% of 
salary for the CEO and 175% of salary for the CFO. 75% of the 
award will be measured against growth in Adjusted EPS and 25% 
against relative TSR versus the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts). Shares normally vest after a three-year 
performance period, subject to a further two-year holding period 
whereby the Executive Directors will be restricted from selling 
the shares which vest other than to settle any associated tax. 
 
Key activities of the Committee
The Committee’s key activities during the 2016 financial  
year were:
• agreement of the Committee’s terms of reference;
• approving the 2015 bonus outcomes;
• agreeing remuneration packages and arrangements for 
senior employees;
• formulation of the Company’s first Remuneration Policy as a 
listed company;
• implementing and making awards under the Company’s new 
share plans;
• determining the level of bonus payments in respect of this 
financial year; 
• drafting the Company’s first Directors’ Remuneration 
Report as a listed company; and
• reviewing its performance assisted by an independent 
consultancy.
In addition, since the end of 2016, we have consulted with the 
Company’s major shareholders, the Investment Association 
and ISS on the major elements of our policy and the way in 
which we propose to implement it in 2017. The majority of 
those consulted were supportive of our proposals for 2017.
 
I hope that you find the information in this report helpful and  
I look forward to your support at the Company’s AGM.

The report has been prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended). The report has also been 
prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This part of the Remuneration Report sets out Ascential’s 
Remuneration Policy for its Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors. The policy has been developed taking into account 
the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and 
guidelines from major investors. The Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM in 
May 2017 and, subject to shareholder approval, will take 
formal effect from that date.
What is the role of the Remuneration Committee? 
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) has 
responsibility for determining the overall pay policy for 
Ascential. In particular, the Committee is responsible for:
• determining the framework or broad policy for the fair 
remuneration of Ascential’s Executive Directors and 
Chairman, and certain other senior executives;
• approving their remuneration packages and service 
contracts, giving due regard to the comments and 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
as well as the Financial Conduct Authority’s rules and 
associated guidance;
• ensuring that the remuneration policy is adequate and 
appropriate to attract, motivate and retain personnel of  
high calibre and provides, in a fair and responsible manner, 
reward for their individual contributions;
• reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of  
the Remuneration Policy;
• overseeing any major changes in remuneration and 
employee benefits structures throughout Ascential;
• approving the design of, and determining targets for, all 
performance-related pay schemes operated by Ascential 
and approving the total annual payments made under such 
schemes; and
• reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval 
by the Board and shareholders. For any such plans, the 
Committee determines each year whether awards will be 
made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the 
individual awards to Executive Directors and other senior 
management, and the performance targets to be used.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on  
Ascential’s website.
 
Policy overview
When setting the policy for Directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee takes into account the overall business strategy 
and risk tolerance, considering the long-term interests of  
the Company with a view to adequately attracting, retaining 
and rewarding skilled individuals and delivering rewards  
to shareholders.
Consistent with these principles, the Committee has agreed  
a Remuneration Policy which will:
• provide a simple remuneration structure which is easily 
understood by all stakeholders;
• attract, retain and motivate executives and senior 
management in order to deliver the Company’s strategic 
goals and business outputs;
• promote the long-term success of the business;
• provide an appropriate balance between fixed and 
performance-related, and immediate and deferred 
remuneration to support a high-performance culture;
• adhere to the principles of good corporate governance  
and best practice;
• align executives with the interests of shareholders and  
other external stakeholders; and
• consider the wider pay environment, both internally  
and externally.
How are wider employment conditions taken into account?
The Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles 
which form the basis for decisions on Executive Directors’ pay 
are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest  
of the workforce are taken. For example, the Committee takes 
into account the general salary increase for the broader 
employee population when conducting the salary review  
for the Executive Directors. 
All permanent employees are eligible for a performance-related 
annual bonus and the Company operates UK and International 
Sharesave and US Stock Purchase saving plans for employees 
wishing to invest in the Company’s shares. A formal employee 
consultation on remuneration is not operated; however, 
employees are able to provide feedback on the Company’s 
remuneration policies to their managers or the Human 
Resources department informally as well as through the 
employee engagement survey and annual performance review 
process. Fixed ratios between the total remuneration levels of 
different roles in Ascential are not applied, as this may prevent 
us from recruiting and retaining the necessary talent in 
competitive employment markets.
The Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy (as set out  
on pages 69 to 76) reflects differences compared to the 
broader employee base that are appropriate to leadership  
at an even higher standard of success to ensure alignment  
with shareholder interests. A greater weight is placed on 
performance-based pay through the quantum and  
participation levels in incentive schemes. 
Are the views of shareholders taken into account?
The Committee values and is committed to dialogue with 
shareholders. This is the first time that shareholders will vote 
on the Remuneration Policy and in preparing this policy we 
have sought feedback from our major shareholders, the 
Investment Association and ISS, and we will continue to 
carefully consider any shareholder feedback received in 
relation to the AGM this year and in future. In addition,  
the Committee will continue to engage proactively with 
shareholders and ensure that shareholders are consulted  
in advance, where any material changes to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy are proposed. Through the process of 
review this year, the Committee Chair has consulted with 
shareholders who in aggregate hold a majority of our shares.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

What are the elements of the Executive Directors’ pay?
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation (including framework used to assess performance) Opportunity
Base salary Provides a competitive 
and appropriate 
level of basic fixed 
pay appropriate to 
recruit, retain and 
reward Directors of 
a suitable calibre to 
deliver the Company’s 
strategic goals and 
business outputs.
Reflects an individual’s 
experience, performance 
and responsibilities 
within Ascential.
Set at a level which provides a fair reward for the role 
and which is competitive amongst relevant peers.
Normally reviewed annually with any changes 
taking effect from 1 April each year.
Set taking into consideration individual and Company 
performance, the responsibilities and accountabilities of each 
role, the experience of each individual, his or her marketability 
and Ascential’s key dependencies on the individual.
Reference is also made to salary levels amongst relevant peers 
and other companies of equivalent size and complexity.
The Committee considers the impact of any basic 
salary increase on the total remuneration package.
Increases will normally 
be in line with the 
general increase for 
the broader employee 
population, taking 
into account factors 
such as performance 
of the Company and 
external factors such 
as inflation. More 
significant increases 
than standard may be 
awarded from time to 
time to recognise, for 
example, development 
in role and change in 
position or responsibility, 
as are also considered 
for the wider workforce 
for the same reasons.
Current salary levels 
are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Benefits Provides market 
competitive and 
appropriate benefits 
package.
Benefits provided may include private medical insurance, 
life assurance and income protection insurance.
The benefits provided may be subject to minor 
amendment from time to time by the Committee within 
this policy. In addition, Executive Directors are eligible 
for other benefits which are introduced for the wider 
workforce on broadly similar terms. The Company may 
reimburse any reasonable business related expenses 
(including tax thereon) incurred in connection with their 
role if these are determined to be taxable benefits.
There is no overall 
maximum level of 
benefits provided to 
Executive Directors, 
and the level of some 
of these benefits is 
not pre-determined 
but may vary from 
year to year based on 
the overall cost to the 
Company. However, the 
Committee monitors 
annually the overall 
cost of the benefits 
provided to ensure that 
it remains appropriate.
Pension Provides a competitive 
and appropriate 
pension package.
Each Executive Director has the right to participate 
in the pension scheme operated by the Company 
either via a contribution into the Company’s defined 
contribution plan, or via a cash supplement (net of 
employer’s national insurance contributions).
Pension contributions 
and/or cash allowances 
are set at 9% of 
base salary.
All-employee share 
plans
Encourages employee 
share ownership and 
therefore increases 
alignment with

Ascential may from time to time operate tax-
approved share plans (such as HMRC-approved Save 
As You Earn Option Plan and Share Incentive Plan) 
for which Executive Directors could be eligible.

time to time. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation (including framework used to assess performance) Opportunity
Annual bonus Incentivises the 
execution of key annual 
goals by driving and 
rewarding performance 
against targets aligned 
to delivery of strategy.
Compulsory deferral of 
a proportion of bonus 
into Ascential shares 
provides alignment 
with shareholders.
Paid annually, bonuses will be subject to achievement 
of stretching financial performance measures. The 
Committee also has discretion to introduce non-
financial and/or strategic measures in future years. It is 
intended, however, that financial measures will determine 
the majority of the annual bonus opportunity.
50% of bonus earned will normally be deferred into awards 
over shares under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (“DABP”), 
with awards normally vesting after a three-year period.
Recovery and withholding provisions are in operation across 
the annual bonus and the DABP in certain circumstances, 
including where there has been a misstatement of accounts, 
an error in assessing any applicable performance conditions, 
or in the event of misconduct on the part of the participant.
The maximum bonus 
payable to Executive 
Directors is 125% of 
base salary with 50% of 
maximum payable for 
on-target performance 
(62.5% of salary). The 
minimum percentage 
of maximum that may 
be paid for threshold 
performance is 0%.
Dividends may accrue 
on DABP awards over 
the vesting period 
and be paid out 
either as cash or as 
shares on vesting.
Performance Share 
Plan (“PSP”)
Rewards the 
achievement of 
sustained long-
term performance 
that is aligned with 
shareholder interests.
Facilitates share 
ownership to provide 
further alignment 
with shareholders.
Annual awards of performance shares that normally vest after 
three years subject to performance conditions and continued 
service. Performance is normally tested over a period of at 
least three financial years but, in the case of the Initial PSP 
Awards, will be tested over the periods described below.
Vesting of the Initial PSP Awards is subject to the Company’s 
cumulative EBITA (75% of the award) measured over three 
years, starting with FY16, and TSR versus the FTSE 250 Index 
(excluding investment trusts but including the Company) 
measured from the date of Admission over a period to 
31 December 2018 (25% of the award). No portion of the 
Initial PSP Award will vest if cumulative EBITA is less than a 
threshold set by the Remuneration Committee. The maximum 
percentage that may vest for threshold performance is 25%.
For the awards granted in FY17, awards will be 
subject to targets based on growth in Adjusted EPS 
and relative TSR measured against the constituents 
of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts).
Different performance measures and/or weightings 
may be applied for future awards as appropriate. At 
least 50% of future awards will be subject to financial 
measures which will normally be a profit measure. The 
Committee will consult in advance with major shareholders 
prior to any significant changes being made.
Following vesting, a further two-year holding period will 
apply to the awards whereby Executive Directors will be 
restricted from selling the net of tax shares which vest.
Recovery and withholding provisions operate in certain 
circumstances, including where there has been a 
misstatement of accounts, an error in assessing any applicable 
performance conditions, or in the event of misconduct on 
the part of the participant. These provisions apply for at 
least three years from the date on which an award vests.
The normal maximum 
opportunity is 200% 
of base salary, in line 
with the policy set at 
IPO. In exceptional 
circumstances this 
may be increased to 
250% of salary.
Current award levels are 
200% of base salary for 
the CEO and 175% of 
base salary for the CFO. 
Dividends may accrue 
on PSP awards over 
the vesting period and 
be paid out either as 
cash or as shares on 
vesting in respect of 
the number of shares 
that have vested.
Shareholding guideline Encourages Executive 
Directors to build a 
meaningful shareholding 
in Ascential so as to 
further align interests 
with shareholders.
Each Executive Director must build up and maintain a 
shareholding in Ascential equivalent to 200% of base salary. 
If an Executive Director does not meet the guideline, they 
will be expected to retain at least half of the net shares 
vesting under the Company’s discretionary share-based 
employee incentive schemes until the guideline is met.

What discretions does the Committee retain in operating the incentive plans?
The Committee operates Ascential’s various incentive plans according to their respective rules. To ensure the efficient operation 
and administration of these plans, the Committee retains discretion in relation to a number of areas. Consistent with market 
practice, these include (but are not limited to) the following:
• selecting the participants;
• the timing of grant and/or payment;
• the size of grants and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table above);
• the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance;
• determination of a good leaver and, where relevant, the extent of vesting in the case of the share based plans;
• treatment in exceptional circumstances such as a change of control, in which the Committee would act in the best interests of 
Ascential and its shareholders;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, 
variation of capital and special dividends); 
• cash settling awards; and
• the annual review of performance measures, weightings and setting targets for the discretionary incentive plans from year to year.
Any performance conditions may be amended or substituted if one or more events occur which cause the Committee to 
reasonably consider that the performance conditions would not without alteration achieve its original purpose. Any varied 
performance condition would not be materially less difficult to satisfy in the circumstances.
How does the Committee choose performance measures and set targets?
The performance metrics used for the annual bonus plan and PSP have been selected to reflect Ascential’s key performance 
indicators. 
The annual bonus is based on performance against a stretching combination of financial and, in certain years, non-financial 
performance measures. The financial measures are set taking account of Ascential’s key operational objectives but will typically 
include a measure of profitability and/or revenue as these are key performance indicators. In 2017, the annual bonus will be 
measured solely on revenue (50%) and profit (50%) targets.
The performance conditions for the PSP are based on a profit measure and TSR performance. Relative TSR has been selected as it 
reflects comparative performance against a broad index of companies. It also aligns the rewards received by Executives with the 
returns received by shareholders. For the Initial PSP Awards and the 2017 awards, this is the FTSE 250 (excluding investment 
trusts) as the Company is a constituent of that index.
A sliding scale of challenging performance targets is set for both of these measures and further details of the targets applied are 
set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee will review the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets and TSR 
peer group prior to each PSP grant.
Different performance measures and/or weightings may be applied for future awards as appropriate. However, the Committee 
will consult in advance with major shareholders prior to any significant changes being made.
What about pre-existing arrangements?
In approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Remuneration Committee to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former Directors that pre-date the approval of the policy. Details of any payments to current or 
former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration if and when they arise.
How does the executive pay policy differ from that for other Ascential employees? 
The Remuneration Committee considers the Executive Directors’ remuneration in the context of the wider employee population. 
All of the Company’s employees participate in annual bonus arrangements and have the opportunity to participate in share-based 
rewards such as SAYE and SIP. The Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable 
pay than for other employees, to make a greater part of their pay conditional on the successful delivery of business strategy. This 
aims to create a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Executive Directors. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

How much could an Executive Director earn under the Remuneration Policy?
A significant proportion of total remuneration is linked to Company performance, particularly at maximum performance levels. 
The chart below illustrates how the Executive Directors’ potential reward opportunity varies under three different performance 
scenarios: fixed pay only, on-target and at maximum. Illustrations are intended to provide further information to shareholders 
regarding the pay for performance relationship. Actual pay delivered will be influenced by changes in share price and the vesting 
levels of awards. 
The Executive Directors can participate in the two all-employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees. The value 
that may be received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits. For simplicity, the value that may be received from 
participating in these schemes has been excluded from the below chart. 
Assumptions:
• Minimum: fixed pay only (base salary as at 1 April 2017, plus pension of 9% of salary and the estimated value of benefits).
• On-target: fixed pay (base salary as at 1 April 2017, plus pension of 9% of salary and the estimated value of benefits), plus 50% of the maximum annual bonus of 125%  
of base salary, plus vesting of PSP award at 62.5% of award granted at 200% for the CEO and 175% for the CFO (median vesting between threshold and full vesting).
• Maximum: fixed pay (base salary as at 1 April 2017, plus pension of 9% of salary and the estimated value of benefits), plus maximum annual bonus of 125% of base salary, 
plus full vesting of PSP award granted at 200% of base salary for CEO and 175% of base salary for the CFO).
What would a new Executive Director be paid?
The ongoing remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of Ascential’s 
shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment and the maximum limits set out therein. It is the 
Remuneration Committee’s policy that no ongoing special arrangements will be made, and in the event that any deviation from 
standard policy is required to recruit a new hire on an ongoing basis, approval would be sought at the Annual General Meeting.
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with Ascential’s Remuneration Policy, taking into account the experience and calibre  
of the individual. Salaries may be set at a below market level initially with a view to increasing them to the market rate subject to 
individual performance and developing into the role by making phased above inflation increases.
Benefits will be provided in line with those offered to the other Executive Directors, taking account of local market practice.
What would the ongoing incentive arrangements be for a newly-appointed Executive Director?
Currently, for an Executive Director, annual bonus payments will not exceed 125% of base salary and PSP payments will not 
normally exceed 200% of base salary (not including any arrangements to replace forfeited entitlements).
Where necessary, specific annual bonus and PSP targets and different vesting and/or holding periods may be used for an 
individual for the first year of appointment if it is appropriate to do so to reflect the individual’s responsibilities and the point in the 
year in which they joined the Board. A PSP award can be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the Company is not in 
a close period).

What payments could a newly appointed Executive Director 
receive beyond the policy?
The Committee retains flexibility to offer additional cash and/
or share based awards on appointment to take account of 
remuneration or benefit arrangements forfeited by an 
Executive on leaving a previous employer. If shares are used, 
such awards may be made under the terms of the PSP or as 
permitted under the Listing Rules.
Such payments would take into account the nature of awards 
forfeited and would reflect (as far as possible) performance 
conditions, the values foregone and the time over which they 
would have vested or been paid. Awards may be made in cash 
if the Company is in a prohibited period at the time an 
Executive joins the Company.
The Committee may also agree that the Company will meet 
certain relocation, legal, tax equalisation and any other 
incidental expenses as appropriate so as to enable the 
recruitment of the best people including those who need  
to relocate.
What about an internal appointment?
In the case of an internal Executive Director appointment, any 
variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may 
be allowed to pay out according to its terms, and adjusted as 
relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any 
other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to 
appointment may continue.
Are the Executive Directors allowed to hold external 
appointments?
Executive Directors are permitted to accept external 
appointments with the prior approval of the Board and where 
there is no impact on their role with Ascential. The Board will 
determine on a case-by-case basis whether the Executive 
Directors will be permitted to retain any fees arising from such 
appointments and, where any such fees are retained, they will 
be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
What are the Executive Directors’ terms of employment?
What are their notice periods?
The Executive Directors have entered into service agreements 
with an indefinite term that may be terminated by either party 
on 12 months’ written notice. Contracts for new appointments 
will be terminable by either party on a maximum of 12 months’ 
written notice.
What payments will an Executive Director receive when they 
leave the Company? 
An Executive Director’s service contract may be terminated 
summarily without notice and without any further payment  
or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date  
of termination, if they are deemed to be guilty of gross 
misconduct or for any other material breach of the obligations 
under their employment contract.
The Company may suspend the Executive Directors or put 
them on a period of garden leave during which they will be 
entitled to salary, benefits and pension only.
If the employment of an Executive Director is terminated in 
other circumstances, compensation may include base salary 
due for any unexpired notice period, pro-rata bonus (normally 
based on performance assessed after the year end) in respect 
of the proportion of the financial year worked and any amount 
assessed by the Committee as representing the value of other 
contractual benefits which would have been received during 
the period. The Company may choose to continue providing 
some benefits instead of paying a cash sum, representing their 
cost. Any annual bonus paid to a departing Executive Director 
would normally be paid in cash, at the normal payment date, 
and reduced pro-rata to reflect the actual period worked. 
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise 
claims in connection with a termination (including, at the 
discretion of the Committee, reimbursement for legal advice 
and provision of outplacement services) would be paid  
as necessary.
Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for 
inspection at Ascential’s registered office during normal 
business hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
How are outstanding share awards treated when an Executive 
Director leaves Ascential? 
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director 
under Ascential’s share plans will be treated in accordance with 
the relevant plan rules. Usually, any outstanding awards lapse 
on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, injury, disability, retirement with 
the consent of the Committee, the sale of the entity that 
employs him/her out of Ascential or any other circumstances 
at the discretion of the Committee, “good leaver” status may 
be applied.
For good leavers under the PSP, outstanding awards will 
normally vest at the original vesting date to the extent that the 
performance condition has been satisfied, and would normally 
be reduced on a pro-rata basis to reflect the period of time 
which has elapsed between the grant date and the date on 
which the participant ceases to be employed by the Company. 
The Committee retains the discretion to vest awards (and 
measure performance accordingly) on cessation and/or to 
disapply time pro-rating; however, it is envisaged that this 
would only be applied in exceptional circumstances. For good 
leavers under the DABP, unvested awards will vest at the 
original vesting date unless the Committee exercises its 
discretion and allows the award to vest in full on, or shortly 
following, the date of cessation.
 
In determining whether a departing Executive Director should 
be treated as a “good leaver”, the Committee will take into 
account the performance of the individual and the reasons  
for their departure.
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
75
What happens to their outstanding share awards if there is a takeover or other corporate event? 
Outstanding awards on a takeover or winding up of the Company will vest early to the extent that the performance condition has 
been satisfied, and would normally be reduced on a pro-rata basis to reflect the period of time which has elapsed between the 
grant date and the date on which the participant ceases to be employed by the Company, although the Committee would retain 
discretion to waive time pro-rating of an award if it regards it as appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
In the event of a demerger, special dividend or other event which, in the opinion of the Committee, may affect the current or 
future value of shares, the Committee may decide that awards will vest on a basis which would apply in the case of a takeover. In 
the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding 
company, unless the Committee decides that awards should vest on a basis which would apply in the case of a takeover.
How are the Non-Executive Directors paid?
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation (including framework used to assess performance) Opportunity
Non-Executive 
Director fees
To attract and retain a 
high-calibre Chairman 
and Non-Executive 
Directors by offering 
market competitive 
fee levels.
The Company Chairman is paid an annual fee. The Non-
Executives (including the Senior Independent Director) 
are paid a basic fee with the Chairmen of the main Board 
Committees and the Senior Independent Director paid 
additional fees to reflect their extra responsibilities and 
time commitments. If there is a temporary yet material 
increase in the time commitments for Non-Executive 
Directors, the Board may pay extra fees on a pro-rata 
basis to recognise the additional workload.
The level of fees is reviewed periodically by the 
Committee and Chief Executive for the Company 
Chairman and by the Company Chairman and Executive 
Directors for the Non-Executive Directors and set 
taking into consideration market levels in comparably 
sized FTSE companies, the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the role and to reflect the experience 
and expertise required.
The Company Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors are not eligible to participate in incentive 
arrangements or to receive benefits save that they 
are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business 
expenses and tax thereon. They may also receive limited 
travel or accommodation related benefits in connection 
with their role as a Director.
The fees are subject 
to maximum aggregate 
limits as set out 
in the Company’s 
Articles of Association 
(£2,000,000).
The Committee is 
guided by the general 
increase for the 
broader employee 
population, but on 
occasions may need 
to recognise, for 
example, changes in 
responsibility, and/or 
time commitments
Current fee levels 
are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
What would a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director be paid?
For a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved Remuneration 
Policy in force at that time.
What are the terms of appointment for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors?
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years (save for the 
Chairman who is appointed for a nine-year term) subject to annual re-election by the Company at a general meeting.
The appointment of each Chairman and Non-Executive Director may be terminated by either party with three months’ notice.  
The appointment of each may also be terminated at any time if he or she is removed as a Director by resolution at a general 
meeting or pursuant to the Articles, provided that in such circumstances the Company will (except where the removal is by  
reason of his misconduct) pay the Chairman or Non-Executive an amount in lieu of his or her fees for the unexpired portion  
of his or her notice period.

Financial metrics for the annual bonus plan are measured at constant currency and the targets have been increased from budget 
rates of Euro 1.43 and USD 1.56 to reflect the actual exchange rates that were in force during 2016. 
Strategic objectives (20% of award, maximum of 25% of salary1 )
The bonus objectives set for the year included the requirement that payout for achievement of strategic objectives was 
dependent on meeting at least 95% of target profit performance. Actual profit of £89.3m exceeded the profit threshold of 95%  
of target. 
The strategic objective set for the Executive Directors for 2016 was to complete all of the necessary preparations to allow for a 
strategic transaction in 2017 for the Heritage Brands. These preparations were completed successfully during the year, evidenced 
by the announcement on 5 January 2017 that 13 Heritage Brands had been separated into a discrete operating entity whilst new 
owners were being sought. The sale of Health Services Journal, one of the identified Heritage Brands, was executed on 
19 January 2017.
The Executive Directors were awarded a bonus of 25% of salary out of the maximum of 25% available for this element.
 
The Committee therefore determined that in respect of the year to 31 December 2016, the resulting annual bonus awards were 
as follows:

PSP awards take the form of nil cost options. The face value for the initial PSP awards was based on the IPO price of 200p  
and was set at 175% of salary for Duncan Painter and 150% of salary for Mandy Gradden. The share price at the date of grant  
was 232p. 
75% of the Initial PSP Awards will be subject to the Company’s cumulative Adjusted EBITA over a measurement period comprising 
three consecutive financial years of the Company, starting FY16. No portion of such part of the award will vest if cumulative 
Adjusted EBITA is less than a threshold level of £262.4m and maximum vesting will occur at £296.3m with straight line vesting  
in between these points. 
25% of the award will be based on relative total shareholder return (“RTSR”) performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 
250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over the measurement period running from Admission to 31 December 2018. Vesting of 
25% of such part of the award will occur for median ranking and the award will vest in full for upper quartile or above ranking, 
with straight line vesting in between these points based on ranking. No awards will vest if RTSR ranks below the median.
Free shares under the SIP were granted at a share price of 200p, being the IPO Offer Price. The share price at the date of grant 
was 236.25p.
Both Executive Directors participated in the Ascential Sharesave scheme saving a monthly amount of £500, as a result of which, 
on 30 September 2016, they were each granted options over ordinary shares in Ascential plc under the Company’s Employee 
Savings Related Share Option Plan. Options are ordinarily exercisable for a period of six months following the end of a three year 
savings contract and subject to the payment of an exercise price per share under option of 204p, a 20% discount on the share 
price at the date of offer.

To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, each Executive Director must build up and maintain a 
shareholding in Ascential equivalent to 200% of base salary. Until the guideline is met, Executive Directors are required to retain 
50% of any PSP and DABP share awards that vest (or are exercised), net of tax.

How does the CEO’s pay compare to past performance?
As the Company listed during 2016, there is no disclosure of 
remuneration relating to prior years. Accordingly, this Report 
does not set out the percentage pay compared to past 
performance.
A summary of the remuneration of the CEO for 2016 is shown

How does the change in the CEO’s pay compare to that for 
Ascential employees? 
As the Company listed during 2016, there is no disclosure of 
remuneration relating to prior years. Accordingly, this report 
does not set out the percentage change in remuneration 
between 2015 and 2016.
How much does Ascential spend on pay? 
Ascential’s actual spend on pay for all employees in 2015 was 
£105.3m, and in 2016 was £111.1m, a change of 6%. This 
represented 34.7% of the Group’s operating expenses.
As the Company listed during 2016, there is no disclosure 
relating to the percentage change in dividend distributions 
between 2015 and 2016. This will be included in the 2017  
Report on Remuneration. 
Who are the members of the Remuneration Committee?
The Committee is made up exclusively of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee is chaired by Judy 
Vezmar and its other members are Paul Harrison and Gillian 
Kent. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee may 
invite the Chairman of the Board to attend Committee 
meetings and has invited the Chairman of the Board to all 
meetings throughout 2016.
What advice did the Committee receive?
New Bridge Street (“NBS”), a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd, 
part of Aon plc, is retained as the independent adviser to the 
Remuneration Committee.
NBS has been appointed by the Committee to provide advice 
and information. NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Code of Conduct, which requires that its advice 
be objective and impartial. Aon also provides insurance broking 
services to the Company.
The total fees paid to NBS for providing advice and information 
related to remuneration and employee share plans to the 
Committee during the year were £140,870, which included 
detailed advice on the implementation of the global SAYE plan. 
The Chief Executive and other senior management were 
invited to attend meetings as the Committee considered 
appropriate, but did not take part in discussions directly 
regarding their own remuneration.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on Ascential’s 
website or are available in hard copy on request from the 
Company Secretary.
How will the Directors’ Remuneration Policy be used in the 
2017 financial year?
Base salary
Salaries at IPO were £460,000 for Duncan Painter and 
£315,000 for Mandy Gradden and no inflationary rises were 
awarded at the normal salary review date of 1 April 2016. The 
current Remuneration Committee has undertaken a review of 
their salaries taking into consideration the Executive Directors’ 
performance, rapid progress of the business against all aspects 
of our agreed strategy, and following proactive consultation 
with shareholders comprising a majority of our shares, we have 
decided to increase Duncan Painter’s salary to £525,000 (an 
increase of 14%) and Mandy Gradden’s to £354,000 (an 
increase of 12%) effective 1 April 2017. The Committee 
believes that these increases will ensure that our Executive 
Directors are appropriately and fairly rewarded going forward. 
How will the annual bonus operate in 2017?
The annual bonus plan will continue to be subject to a 
maximum of 125% of base salary and measured against 
stretching financial targets. 50% of the bonus will be based on 
Adjusted EBITA and 50% will be based on revenue and half of 
any bonus earned will be deferred into shares which vest after 
a three-year period. 
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the 
performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include 
items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. 
An explanation of bonus payouts and performance achieved 
will be provided in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

How will the PSP operate in 2017?
The Committee intends to grant PSP awards to the Executive Directors in 2017 at 200% of salary for Duncan Painter and 175%  
of salary for Mandy Gradden. 
75% of the award will be measured against growth in Adjusted EPS and 25% against relative TSR versus the FTSE 250 Index 
(excluding investment trusts). Each element will be assessed independently of the other. 
The Committee considered a number of factors when setting the range of targets for 2017 awards, including internal planning, 
market expectations for the future performance of the Company and market practice. The conditions that will be applied to the 
PSP awards to be granted in March 2017 are:

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Ascential plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 which comprise the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the parent company statement of financial position and 
the related notes. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2016 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards 
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Valuation of deferred tax 
assets in respect of losses
(£32.2m)
Refer to page 65 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
92 (accounting policy) 
and page 110 (financial 
disclosures).
Subjective valuation
During the year, the Group passed the threshold 
at which a change of control occurs, as defined 
by the US tax code. As a result, the historic losses 
of the Group’s US businesses will be subject 
to a restriction on utilisation; this stems from 
uncertainty in forecasting future profits generated 
before losses expire and the valuation of the US tax 
group at the time the change of control occurred. 
The amount of this restriction will not be known for 
certain until tax filings in respect of 2016 have been 
accepted by the US Internal Revenue Service and 
this requires the Group to make an estimate at the 
current year-end.
Our procedures included: 
Own tax expertise: Our own international tax 
specialists evaluated the directors’ interpretation 
of key aspects of the tax legislation. This included 
critically assessing the Group’s interpretation of 
the US tax code in determining the date at which 
the change of control was met. We also critically 
assessed the associated assumptions made in relation 
to the valuation of the US tax group’s deferred tax 
assets, including the valuation of the US tax group.
Assessing transparency: We considered the 
appropriateness of the related disclosures provided 
in note 13 of the Group financial statements and 
the adequacy of the disclosure of judgements and 
estimates made in note 2 and note 12. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

The risk Our response
Revenue recognition
(£299.6m)
Refer to page 65 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
92 (accounting policy) 
and page 101 (financial 
disclosures).
The specific nature of the risk of material 
misstatement in revenue recognition varies across 
the Group’s four operating segments.
Data capture and processing error
Where the process for recognising revenue is 
system-automated, there are additional risks that 
contract data is not accurately captured and/or 
processed in the system.
2016/ 2017 sales
In respect of the Exhibitions & Festivals operating 
segment customers are often billed in advance and 
the key risk in revenue recognition is that revenue 
from exhibitions and festivals is recognised in the 
wrong period, particularly for events held close to 
year end.
In respect of both the Information Services, Plexus 
and discontinued operations operating segments 
we identified the risk that the deferral and release 
of subscription revenues did not appropriately 
match the underlying terms of customer contracts.
Our procedures included: 
Control design: We confirmed our understanding of 
the design and implementation of controls and traced 
an example transaction from initiation to recording to 
confirm our understanding of the revenue recording 
process from order processing to the raising of 
invoices and receipt of cash. 
For revenue transactions where the recognition is 
automated within systems based on key attributes 
of contracts entered by the Group our procedures 
included:
Data comparison: We validated the data inputs 
by agreeing a sample of inputs to original source 
documents.
Control design and operation: We tested the 
controls around the integrity of the data held in the 
system and the completeness and accuracy of the 
reports from this system with assistance from our 
own IT specialists.
Expectation vs outcome: Having performed the 
above procedures over the data in the system, we 
used the data to calculate an expectation of the 
revenue in the period and compared this to the 
actual revenue recorded by the Group.
For all other revenue our procedures included:
Tests of details: For a sample of exhibitions and 
festivals revenue we obtained evidence of invoices, 
payments, contracts and event occurrence to 
determine whether revenue was recognised at 
the appropriate time. For a sample of subscription 
transactions we obtained and reviewed relevant 
order confirmations and contracts to assess whether 
revenue was properly allocated across the term 
of the contract in the correct accounting period.
Recognition and valuation 
of deferred and contingent 
payments for the One 
Click Retail acquisition
(£28.0m)
Refer to pages 65 – 66 
(Audit Committee Report), 
page 92 (accounting policy) 
and pages 112 – 114 
(financial disclosures).
Accounting treatment
Judgement is required in determining the split 
of the performance-related payments between 
acquisition consideration and post-acquisition 
remuneration of the vendors who continue to work 
for the Group.
Forecast-based valuation
The group has recognised a significant contingent 
consideration liability in respect of the One Click 
Retail acquisition. There is inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting future performance of the 
acquired business, which determines the fair value 
of the liability.
Our procedures included: 
Accounting analysis: Having inspected the contract, 
we compared our own application of the relevant 
accounting standard to the terms of the contract, 
with particular reference to the split between 
acquisition consideration and post-acquisition 
remuneration.
Assessing forecasts: We compared the forecast 
revenue and profit growth, used as the basis for 
the contingent consideration calculation, against 
the external due diligence report obtained prior to 
acquisition. We challenged the adjustments made to 
these forecasts by the directors in reaching their final 
estimate of the fair value of the liability at the date of 
acquisition.
Assessing valuer’s credentials: We assessed the 
competence and objectivity of the external experts 
who prepared the due diligence report, obtained 
by the directors prior to acquisition, which were 
referenced by the group in preparing its forecasts.
Assessing transparency: We assessed the adequacy 
of the group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of 
the fair value of contingent consideration to changes 
in key assumptions, in particular the estimates and 
judgements made by the Group in this regard.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £1.8m, determined with reference to a benchmark of 
profit before tax normalised as set out opposite, of £38.3m,  
of which it represents 4.7%. (2015: £2.5m on a revenue 
benchmark, previously applicable due to the effect on profit  
of the previous financial gearing. After listing and refinancing  
in 2016 a profit benchmark has been used.)
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £90,000,  
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s 69 reporting components, we subjected 8 to 
audits for group purposes and three to specified risk-focused 
audit procedures. The latter were not individually significant 
enough to require a full scope audit for group reporting 
purposes but were included in the scope of our group audit 
work in order to provide further coverage over the identified 
risks and the Group’s results. 
The group operates one shared service centre in India, the 
outputs of which are included in the financial information of 
the reporting components it services and therefore it is not a 
separate reporting component. The service centre is subject  
to specified risk-focused audit procedures, predominantly the 
testing of transaction processing and review controls. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for 
the percentages illustrated opposite.
The remaining 10% of total group revenue, 15% of total profits 
and losses that made up group profit before tax and 15% of 
total group assets is represented by 58 reporting components, 
none of which individually represented more than 4% of any of 
total group revenue, group profit before tax or total group 
assets. For these remaining components, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these.
The group audit team was responsible for all audit work 
including the assessment of significant areas to be covered at 
each component, including the relevant risks detailed above, 
and the information to be reported. The component 
materialities, which ranged from £0.7m to £1.4m, were 
calculated by the Group team having regard to the mix of size 
and risk profile of the Group across the components. The 
group audit also performed work at the group-level over 
deferred tax asset valuation and the accounting for the 
acquisition of One Click Retail and on the items excluded from 
the Profit benchmark.

4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
• we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and 
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures  
of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ Statement of Viability on page 33 concerning 
the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, 
the Directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s 
continuing in operation over the three years to 
31 December 2019; or
• the disclosures in Note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the Annual Report that contains 
a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the 
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that  
is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statements, set out on page 33, in relation  
to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 
54 relating to the Company’s compliance with the eleven 
provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities. 
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 60, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

a restructure of the Group took place. Refer to Note 1 for further details. 
2 The £0.2 million issue of shares relates to shares issued under management incentive plans in the year ended 31 December 2015. 
3 The restructure of the Group between 8 and 12 February 2016 resulted in the Company issuing 300,000,000 ordinary £0.10 shares to become the ultimate Parent of  
the Group, and to convert existing shareholder debt to equity. This resulted in the recognition of £252.9 million in share premium, £8.8 million in the capital reserve and 
£157.9 million in a Group restructure reserve. Refer to Note 1 for further details. 
4 At IPO 100,000,000 additional ordinary £0.10 shares were allotted and issued at a price of £2.00 per share, representing a premium of £1.90 per share. £11.6 million of 
share issue costs were incurred. The premium was recorded in the Company’s share premium account.
5 On 8 March 2016, 542,500 ordinary £0.10 shares were issued to employees under the Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”). Refer to Note 10 for further details.
6 On 8 June 2016, the Company completed a reduction of its share capital, whereby its nominal share capital was reduced to approximately £4.0 million, the amount standing 
to the share premium account was cancelled, and 876,266,690 deferred shares of £0.01 each which were issued by way of a bonus issue on 7 June 2016 for the purpose of 
capitalising the Company’s capital reserve were cancelled. These steps resulted in distributable reserves of approximately £476.2 million. Refer to Note 1 for further details. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2016
1. Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
Reporting entity
Ascential plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and its registered office is The Prow, 1 Wilder 
Walk, London W1B 5AP. These consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2016 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”). Information relating to the financial years ended 31 December 
2015 and 2016 have been prepared and presented in accordance with the reverse acquisition principles discussed below.
On 12 February 2016, the Company’s 400,000,000 ordinary shares were admitted to unconditional trading on the London Stock 
Exchange and to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority (the “IPO”). In preparation for 
the IPO, the Group was restructured between 8 and 12 February 2016. The restructure has impacted a number of the primary 
financial statements and notes for the periods presented in these financial statements.
The steps to restructure the Group had the effect of the Company being inserted above Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A., which was the 
ultimate parent of Ascential Holdings Limited, head of the Operating Group presented in the prospectus dated 12 February 2016. 
For the consolidated financial statements of the Group, prepared under IFRS, the principles of reverse acquisition accounting 
under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” have been applied. 
In applying the principles of reverse acquisition accounting, the consolidated financial statements have been presented as a 
continuation of the Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. business and the Group is presented as if the Company had always owned the Group.  
The consolidated reserves of the Group reflect the statutory share capital and share premium of the Company as if it had  
always existed, adjusted for movements in the underlying Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. share capital and reserves until the share for  
share exchange.
The Company was formed on 4 January 2016 and, as such, these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 are 
its first full set of statutory accounts. The Company has not, therefore, prepared statutory accounts for the year ended 
31 December 2015. Neither Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. nor the Company have previously prepared financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). In preparing those consolidated financial statements, the Company 
measures the assets and liabilities of Ascential Holdings Limited on the same basis as in the prospectus dated 12 February 2016, 
as well as measuring the assets and liabilities of Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. on an IFRS basis.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (“EU”), 
IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRS IC”), certain interpretations as adopted by the EU, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS.
The IPO restructure
The key steps in the restructure were:
• On 8 February 2016, the Company became the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group by acquiring the entire issued share 
capital and voting beneficiary certificates in Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A., via a share for share exchange. All the ordinary shares in Eden 
2 & Cie S.C.A. were exchanged for 77,215,918 ordinary £0.10 shares and 1,824,766 F ordinary £0.10 shares issued by the 
Company. The Company also acquired preference shares held by management and other shareholders in exchange for £175.5 
million of new preference shares issued by the Company. Preferred Equity Certificates (“PECs”) held by shareholders were also 
exchanged for £100.4 million of new PECs issued by the Company.
• On 9 February 2016, a shareholder transferred its shareholder loan receivable to the Company in exchange for £165.5 million 
of new PECs issued by the Company.
• On 12 February 2016, the Company’s F ordinary shares and new preference shares were converted into 89,665,977 ordinary 
£0.10 shares and the new PECs were capitalised through the issue of 133,118,105 ordinary £0.10 shares, thereby retiring all 
Shareholder debt. 
• On 12 February 2016, the Company issued 100,000,000 ordinary £0.10 shares at an offer price of £2.00, generating proceeds 
of £200 million and bringing the total number of ordinary shares to 400,000,000. 50,000 of these ordinary £0.10 shares were 
issued outside of the underwriting agreements in place for the IPO, but for the purpose of these financial statements these 
shares and their proceeds are presented as part of the IPO.
The impact on the comparatives in the primary consolidated financial statements is as follows:
• Share capital and share premium reflect the capital structure of the Company on 8 February 2016, being the date, part way 
through the restructure, on which the Company became the ultimate holding company of the Group. Preference shares and 
PECs in issue at that date are classified as debt instruments and so are not included in equity.
• A merger reserve is recognised, reflecting the difference between the share capital and share premium of the Company  
on 8 February 2016, and the share capital, share premium and non-distributable reserves of Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. as at the  
same date.
The acquisition of preference shares in Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. was accounted for under the provisions of CA s615 whereby the 
shares issued by Ascential plc were recorded at nominal value of £17.5 million. The preference shares in Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. were 
a financial asset recorded at their fair value of £175.4 million. This exchange gives rise to an unrealised gain of £157.9 million which 
is recorded as a separate “Group restructure” reserve within total equity. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
93
1. Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued
On 8 June 2016, the Company completed a reduction of its share capital, as contemplated in the IPO prospectus, whereby (i)  
the entire amount standing to the credit of the Company’s share premium account was cancelled, (ii) 876,266,690 deferred shares 
(which were issued by way of a bonus issue for the purpose of capitalising the Company’s capital reserve) were cancelled, and  
(iii) the nominal value of each issued ordinary share in the capital of the Company was reduced from £0.10 to £0.01 each.  
The distributable reserves created by the reduction of capital amount to approximately £476.2 million.
Basis of measurement
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of items that are 
required by IFRS to be measured at fair value, principally certain financial instruments. Accounting policies have been applied 
consistently to both periods presented. 
Going concern basis of accounting
On 8 February 2016, the Company became the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group. On 12 February 2016, the Company’s 
400,000,000 ordinary shares were admitted to unconditional trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and to 
the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority. The gross proceeds raised by the IPO were £200 million. 
On 12 February 2016, the Company used the proceeds of the IPO, the new bank facilities under the New Facilities Agreement  
(as defined below) and existing available cash to repay all amounts outstanding under the Group’s existing senior facilities 
agreement and cancel certain hedging arrangements. In addition, the Company used the proceeds of the IPO to redeem in  
full certain instruments held on behalf of certain current and former employees (all instruments were cancelled).
On 12 February 2016, the Company entered into new term loan facilities of £66 million, €171 million and $96 million and a 
revolving credit facility of £95 million (“New Facilities Agreement”), which were made available to the Company and certain  
of its subsidiaries. 
The Group’s forecasts, impact assessment of various downside scenarios, and the dates of senior debt and interest payments 
falling due, show that the Group is expected to be able to operate within the level of its current facilities and meet its covenant 
requirements for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
After reviewing the above, taking into account current and future developments and principal risks and uncertainties, and making 
appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they are satisfied that the consolidated financial statements should 
be prepared on a going concern basis.
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency, 
and have been rounded to the nearest one decimal place except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the accounts of Ascential plc and its subsidiary undertakings. A subsidiary is an 
entity (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and there is a link between power and returns. The results of each 
subsidiary are included from the date that control transferred to the Group and are adjusted to align accounting policies with the 
Group’s accounting policies. Subsidiaries are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases. All intercompany balances 
and transactions are eliminated in full.
Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which they operate. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency 
rate applicable at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the functional currency rate of exchange in force at the reporting date. 
All differences are taken to the consolidated profit and loss statement except for those on foreign currency borrowings that 
provide a hedge against an investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the investment,  
at which time they are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange 
differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a  
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate in force at the date of the initial transaction.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
1. Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at the rate of 
exchange applicable at the reporting date and their consolidated profit and loss statements are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of foreign operations are taken directly to a separate 
component of equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is 
recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing 
rate at the reporting date.
Standards issued but not yet effective
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective. 
An initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 indicates the impact of adopting this standard will have limited effect. The Group 
has commenced an assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 which was issued on 13 January 2016. None of the other standards are 
expected to materially impact the consolidated statements upon adoption.
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Amendment)
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
• IFRS 16 Leases
Principal accounting policies
The following summarises the principal accounting policies adopted by the Directors, which have been adopted consistently:
a) Revenue
 Revenue for goods sold is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third 
party. Revenue for services provided is recognised at the point when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the 
Group and when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. 
 Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes. Revenue 
is only recognised for barter transactions which are considered dissimilar to each other in nature, and a corresponding amount 
is included in operating costs. 
 The following recognition criteria also apply in specific cases:
 Events revenue is recognised when the event takes place. Data and online subscription revenues are recognised in the 
consolidated profit and loss statement evenly over the life of the subscription. Magazine subscriptions and advertising 
revenues are recognised according to the dispatch date of the publication. Pre-paid subscription and event revenues are 
shown as deferred income and released to the consolidated profit and loss statement in accordance with the revenue 
recognition  
criteria above. 
b) Employee benefits
i. Short-term employee benefits
 Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under cash bonus schemes if the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
ii. Termination benefits
 Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility 
of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide 
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary 
redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the 
offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 
months after the reporting date, then they are discounted to their present value. 
iii. Share-based payments
 Equity-settled awards are valued at the grant date, and the fair value is charged as an expense in the consolidated profit and 
loss statement spread over the vesting period. The credit side of the entry is recorded in equity. Cash-settled awards are 
revalued at each reporting date with the change in fair value of the award charged to the profit and loss account and the 
credit side of the entry recognised as a liability.
iv. Pension and other post-employment benefits
 The Group operates defined contribution pension scheme in certain countries. Contributions payable are charged to the 
consolidated profit and loss statement and included in staff costs as an operating expense as incurred.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
95
1. Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued
c) Adjusted EBITDA and exceptional items
 The consolidated financial statements include Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of profitability in order to provide a better 
understanding of the trading performance of the Group. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, defined as the Group’s 
operating profit before expensing depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortisation of software, exceptional items, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets, impairment of tangible fixed assets and software intangibles and share-based 
payments. Refer to pages 24 to 27 for further details on alternative performance measures.
 The Group defines exceptional items as costs incurred by the Group in acquisitions and disposals, integration, non-recurring 
 business restructuring and capital restructuring. These are disclosed separately to provide additional useful information to the 
 users of the financial statements. 
d) Finance costs and income
 Finance costs are recognised on an effective yield basis. Finance income is recognised on the accruals basis.
e) Income tax
 The Group is primarily subject to corporation tax in the UK, the US, Brazil and China, and judgement and estimates of future 
profitability are required to determine the Group’s deferred tax position. If the final tax outcome is different to that assumed, 
resulting changes will be reflected in the consolidated profit and loss statement, unless the tax relates to an item charged to 
equity, in which case the changes in tax estimates on those items will be reflected in equity.
 Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the 
consolidated profit and loss statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case  
it is recognised in equity.
 Current tax is tax payable based on taxable profits for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date along with any adjustment relating to tax payable in previous years. Taxable profit differs from 
net profit in the consolidated profit and loss statement in that income or expense items that are taxable or deductible in other 
years are excluded, as are items that are never taxable or deductible. Current tax assets relate to payments on account not yet 
allocated against current tax liabilities or to refunds due from tax authorities on overpayments in respect of prior years.
 Using the liability method, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases  
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except for the following temporary 
differences:
• goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes; and
• the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and which will affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit.
 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date. 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year in which the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.  
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they relate to the same taxing authority and the Group has a legal 
right to offset.
f) Assets held for sale
 Where the Group expects to recover the carrying amount of a group of assets through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use, and a sale is considered to be highly probable at the reporting date, the assets are classified as held for sale and 
measured at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell. No depreciation or amortisation is charged in respect of non-
current assets classified as held for sale.
g) Discontinued operations
 A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly 
distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:
• represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations;
• is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
• is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
 Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be 
classified as held for sale.
 When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit and loss is re-presented  
as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

h) Business combinations and intangible assets
 Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is the cash paid together 
with the fair value of other assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed. 
 Any deferred contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value 
of the contingent consideration, which is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognised either in the profit and loss account 
or in other comprehensive income, in accordance with IAS 39. Any amounts payable by the Group directly contingent on the 
continuing employment of the vendors are treated as remuneration and recognised as an expense in the profit and loss 
account. Deferred and contingent consideration amounts payable after more than 12 months are discounted to present value. 
 Costs directly attributable to acquisitions are expensed as exceptional items. The acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, irrespective of the extent of any non-
controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of net assets assumed is recorded as goodwill.
 Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment either annually or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in the carrying value. Impairment is 
determined by comparing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) or group of cash-generating units which 
are expected to benefit from the acquisition in which the goodwill arose, to the carrying value of the CGU. The recoverable 
amount is the greater of an asset’s value-in-use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the 
future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or group of assets in a CGU at the Group’s cost of capital, adjusted for 
risk in a specific market if relevant. The discount and growth rates used in the value-in-use calculations are disclosed in Note 17 
of the consolidated financial statements. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, the goodwill is 
considered impaired and is written down through the consolidated profit and loss statement to its recoverable amount. The 
carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on the disposal of the 
unit or operation within it.
 Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible 
assets purchased separately are capitalised at cost. After initial recognition, all intangible fixed assets are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible fixed assets which have been assigned a finite life 
are amortised and tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may have 
declined. This is done on a similar basis to the testing of goodwill, either for individual assets or at the level of a CGU. Useful lives 
are examined every year and adjustments are made, where applicable, on a prospective basis. Amortisation is charged on assets 
with finite lives on a systematic basis over the asset’s useful life, which in all cases is a maximum period of 30 years. 
 Where an intangible asset has been assigned an indefinite useful life, it is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment either 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in the carrying value.
 Purchases of software or direct costs relating to internal development of software are capitalised and amortised over their 
anticipated useful lives. Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the software is substantially 
complete and ready for its intended use. The useful life of software ranges from two to five years. 
 Website development costs relating to websites which are revenue generating are capitalised and amortised over three to five 
years. Development costs relating to websites which are not revenue generating are taken immediately to the consolidated 
profit and loss statement.
i) Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is 
calculated to write-off the cost of an asset, less its residual value, on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life as 
follows:
• short leasehold property – over the period of the lease; and
• office equipment – two to five years.
 Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date. The carrying values of property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate these values may not be 
recoverable. If there is an indication that impairment does exist the carrying values are compared to the estimated recoverable 
amounts of the assets concerned. The recoverable amount is the greater of an asset’s value-in-use and its fair value less the 
cost of selling it. Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where 
the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement.
 An item of property, plant or equipment is written off either on disposal or when there is no expected future economic benefit 
from its continued use. Any gain or loss on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the consolidated profit and loss statement in the year the item  
is derecognised. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
97
1. Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued
j) Leases
 Assets held by the Group under leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of the ownership 
are classified as finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair 
value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in 
accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. 
 Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group’s consolidated statement 
of financial position. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated profit and loss statement on  
a straight-line basis over the lease term. The benefit of any lease incentives is recognised as a reduction in rental expense on  
a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
k) Investments
 Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment. Initial recognition of investments is at the fair value of the assets 
given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed.
 Investments in associates and joint ventures
 An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. A joint venture is an entity over which the Group 
exercises joint control, usually through a contractual arrangement. The Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures 
are recognised using the equity method of accounting.
 Investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and thereafter are carried in the consolidated 
statement of financial position at cost less any impairment in value. The consolidated profit and loss statement reflects the 
Group’s share of an associate or joint venture’s profit after tax. Where the Group’s share of losses in an associate or joint 
venture exceeds its investment, the Group ceases to recognise further losses unless an obligation exists for the Group to fund 
the losses. Where a change in net assets has been recognised directly in the associate or joint venture’s equity, the Group 
recognises its share of those changes in the statement of changes in equity when applicable.
 Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate or joint venture with the Group’s and to eliminate  
the Group’s share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.
l) Inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents purchase cost, including attributable 
overheads, and is determined using a first-in, first-out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. 
 Costs relating to future exhibitions, festivals and congresses are deferred within inventories at the lower of cost or net 
realisable value. These costs are charged to the consolidated profit and loss statement when the exhibition takes place.
m) Trade and other receivables
 Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for 
impairment. Specific provisions are made and charged to the consolidated profit and loss statement when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms. Collective provisions are 
made based on estimated losses inherent within receivables, based on the overall level of receivables past due. These 
provisions are developed over time based on the review of aged debt, the type of debt and experience. 
 The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised 
in the consolidated profit and loss statement. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance 
account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the consolidated profit 
and loss statement.
n) Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original 
maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as 
defined, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
o) Borrowings 
 Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
consolidated profit and loss statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method, with the 
exception of debt repurchases which are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement in the year of the 
repurchase. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

p) Derivatives and other financial instruments 
 Derivatives, including currency options and swaps, forward exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps and caps, are initially 
recognised and subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are classified as a separate asset or liability. The fair value is determined by using market data and the use of 
established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models. The method of recognising the 
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item 
being hedged as described below. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement as they arise. 
 A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more 
than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current 
assets or current liabilities. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 25.
q) Hedging activities 
 The Group’s operations and funding give rise to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. The Group may structure its 
borrowings or utilise derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of these risks. The Group does not use 
derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
 The Group may also formally designate certain derivatives or borrowings as hedging instruments and will at the point of 
inception document the relationship between the hedge instrument and hedged item, together with the risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. In addition, at inception and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged 
item. 
 Hedge instruments are accounted for as either: 
• hedges of a change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedges); 
• hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow 
hedge); or
• hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). 
i. Fair value hedges
 Changes in the fair value of fair value hedge instruments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, 
immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, 
with these changes in fair value being recognised in the line of the consolidated profit and loss statement relating to the 
hedged item. 
ii. Cash flow hedges
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The 
gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the consolidated profit and loss statement. 
The cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the consolidated profit and loss 
statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement in the same line 
of the consolidated profit and loss statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is 
hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the cumulative amount recognised in 
other comprehensive income is transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-
financial asset or non-financial liability.
iii. Hedges of net investment in foreign operations 
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedges of net investment in foreign operations is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gains or losses relating to the 
ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the consolidated profit and loss statement. Gains and losses on the 
hedging instrument accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to the consolidated profit and 
loss statement when the hedged item is disposed of. 
 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained 
in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the consolidated profit and loss statement in the period.
r) Provisions
 Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of  
the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is 
recognised only when it is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated profit and 
loss statement net of any reimbursement. If the time value of money has a material effect on quantifying the provision, the  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016
99
1. Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued
 provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance charge.
 
 A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for.
s) Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust
 The Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) provides for the issue of shares to Group employees under share incentive schemes.  
The Company has control of the EBT and accounts for the EBT as an extension to the Company in the consolidated financial 
statements. Accordingly, shares in the Company held by the EBT are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction  
from equity.
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Critical accounting judgements
Preparation of these financial statements requires the Directors to exercise judgement and to make estimates about uncertain 
future events in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The actual future outcomes may differ from these 
estimates and give rise to material adjustments to the reported results and financial position of the Group. The areas requiring a 
higher degree of judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, 
are discussed below.
Acquisition accounting – initial recognition of goodwill and intangible assets
Accounting for a business on acquisition requires an assessment of the existence, fair value and expected useful economic lives  
of separable intangible assets such as brands, customer relationships and technology assets at the date of acquisition. The value 
attributed to these separable assets affects the amount of goodwill recognised, and the value together with the assessment of 
useful economic lives determines future amortisation charges. 
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group assesses the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets annually, or whenever there is an indication of 
impairment. Identifying indicators of impairment requires judgements to be made as to the prospects and value drivers of the 
individual assets. Goodwill is assessed at the level of the CGU that benefits from the related acquisition. Changes in management 
structures and business operations requires judgement in determining whether such changes require a change in the identification 
of CGUs to be used in the assessment of carrying value.
Alternative performance measures
The Group uses certain non-GAAP measures of performance, as in the opinion of the Directors this provides a better 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business, and provides better comparability with other peer group 
companies. The use and definition of these measures is a matter of judgement. Refer to pages 24 to 27 for further details  
on alternative performance measures.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets (Note 17)
The Group uses long-term forecasts of cash flow and estimates of future growth to both value acquired intangible assets and 
goodwill and to assess whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired, and to determine the useful economic lives of its 
intangible assets. If the results of operations in a future period are adverse to the estimates used, an impairment may be triggered 
at that point, or a reduction in useful economic life may be required.
Acquisition accounting – valuation of deferred consideration and acquisition-related remuneration (Note 15)
Accounting for deferred contingent acquisition consideration, and for acquisition-related deferred contingent remuneration, is 
based on estimates of future performance of the acquired business over the contractual earn-out period, as measured against  
the contractually agreed performance targets. If the future results of these businesses differs from the forecasts used for these 
calculations, there may be a material change in the value of these deferred liabilities which would be recorded in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. 
Income taxes (Note 12)
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, estimates have to be made of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on 
transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. In recognising deferred tax assets in respect of unused tax 
losses, estimates are made of the expected availability of losses and the likely timing and level of future taxable profits over the 
period in which tax losses are available.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

3. Financial risk management
This note presents information about the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, the Group’s 
exposure to the risks arising from financial instruments, and the Group’s management of capital.
Market risk
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the US dollar and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets 
and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign currency movements impact on the Group’s profit and loss account together with its cash flow profile and leverage ratio 
position. The impact depends on whether there is a surplus or deficit in each currency from operating activities together with the 
interest and finance charge in those currencies. The Group’s policy has been to protect its cash flow and leverage ratio position by 
maintaining a proportion of currency debt in proportion to its currency earnings to obtain natural offsets. 
The Group’s net investment hedge in overseas subsidiaries may be hedged where the currency exposure is considered to be 
material. In 2015 and 2016, the Group designated its US dollar borrowings as a net investment hedge against its US dollar 
denominated assets. The net investment hedge was cancelled when US dollar borrowings were repaid as part of entering  
into the New Facilities Agreement at IPO.
(b) Cash flow and interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from medium and long-term borrowings to the extent that the underlying debt instruments are not at fixed 
rates of interest. The Group has entered into interest rate caps to convert a portion of its bank borrowings from fully floating to 
capped rates to mitigate this risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and 
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and 
committed transactions. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the financial assets in the 
consolidated statement of financial position as disclosed in Note 25.
(a) Treasury-related credit risk
The Group has treasury policies in place which manage the concentration of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow 
significant treasury exposures with counterparties. Each counterparty has an individual limit which comprises of their long-term 
and short-term ratings by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s as well as their individual five year Credit Default Swap price. As at 
31 December 2016, cash and cash equivalents totalled £61.9 million (2015: £44.4 million), of which 87% (2015: 88%) was held 
with banks or financial institutions with long-term ratings of A-/A3 or better or short-term ratings of A-1/P-1.
In accordance with the Group’s treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are 
continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity. 
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties. 
(b) Trading risk
Risk arises principally from payment default by customers. The general policy of the Group is not to risk assess all new customers 
and so retail credit risk information has not been included in these consolidated financial statements. Management does not, 
however, expect any significant losses in respect of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in Note 21.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach  
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity in the form of sufficient cash or 
funding from adequate credit facilities to meet such liabilities under both normal and stressed conditions.

Subsequent to refinancing on 12 February 2016, the Group is required to adhere to a net leverage ratio covenant of 4.5x which is 
measured at December 2016 and then semi-annually thereafter. The covenant ratio falls to 4.0x in December 2017. The Group 
operated within this covenant limit during the period to 31 December 2016.
Capital risk management
The Treasurer of the Group is responsible for managing compliance with bank covenants. Reports on both actual and projected 
bank covenant ratios are provided to the Board on a regular basis. 
Sensitivity analysis
a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group receives approximately 25% (2015: 20%) of its revenues and incurs approximately 8% (2015: 9%) of its costs in euros. 
The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the euro against the pound sterling. Each 1% movement in the euro to pounds 
sterling exchange rate has a circa £0.9 million (2015: £0.6 million) impact on annual revenue, a circa £0.7 million (2015: £0.4 
million) impact on annual Adjusted EBITDA and annual operating profit. Offsetting this will be reductions to the euro interest and 
euro tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
The Group receives approximately 22% (2015: 20%) of its revenues and incurs approximately 17% (2015: 17%) of its costs (before 
depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items) in US dollars or currencies pegged to US dollars. The Group is therefore sensitive 
to movements in the US dollar against pounds sterling. Each 1% movement in the US dollar to pound sterling exchange rate has a 
circa £0.8 million (2015: £0.7 million) impact on annual revenue, a circa £0.4 million (2015: £0.3 million) impact on annual Adjusted 
EBITDA and a circa £0.2 million (2015: £0.2 million) impact on annual operating profit. Offsetting this will be reductions to the US 
dollar interest and US dollar tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
b) Interest rate risk
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 would have decreased or increased by £1.3 million (2015: £0.4 million). 
4. Revenue
The revenue analysis for the continuing operations in the table below is based on the location of customers or, in the case of 
Exhibitions & Festivals, the location of business operations. Refer to Note 6 for discontinued operations disclosures required

5. Operating segments
The Group has three reportable segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments. In addition, there is a Group corporate function 
providing central services including finance, management and IT services to the Group’s reportable segments. The reportable 
segments offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different capabilities, 
technology and marketing strategies. For each of the reportable segments, the Board (the chief operating decision maker) reviews 
internal management reports on a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s 
reportable segments:
• Exhibitions & Festivals: organiser of market-leading exhibitions, congresses and festivals.
• Information Services: produces intelligence, analysis and forecasting tools, subscription content including real-time online 
resources, live events and awards, across a number of industry sectors including fashion, retail, property, construction and politics.
• Discontinued operation: the disposal group of 13 Heritage Brands previously formed part of the Information Services segment 
before it was separately classified as held for sale and a discontinued operation. Given the different growth trajectories and risks 
of the Heritage Brands and the change in internal management reporting presented to the Board, the disposal group is separated 
into a third reportable segment. Refer to Note 6 for further details on the discontinued operation.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Reportable segment profits are measured at  
an adjusted operating profit level, representing reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation costs and amortisation  
in respect of software intangibles, without allocation of central Group costs. This is the measure included in the internal 
management reports that are reviewed by the Board. Reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA and reportable segment Adjusted 
operating profit are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in 
evaluating the results of certain reportable segments relative to other comparable entities. Total assets and liabilities for each 
reportable segment are not disclosed because they are not provided to the Board on a regular basis. Total assets and liabilities  
are internally reviewed on a Group basis.

other financial statements. The Board believes that reporting adjusted results and adjusted earnings per share (Note 14) provides 
additional useful information to the users of the financial statements, refer to pages 24 to 27 for further details on adjusted 
performance measures. The following charges/(credits) were presented as adjusting items of the continuing operations:

The principal adjustments made are in respect of:
• Revaluation of contingent consideration – relates primarily to the acquisition of Money20/20 in 2014. Certain of the Group’s 
business combinations include, under their respective sale and purchase agreements, an element of deferred consideration 
which is contingent on the results of the business in future years, refer also to Note 15 and Note 25. In 2016, Money20/20’s 
actual results and the forecast result for 2017 lead to an increase in the estimated capital element of the deferred consideration 
payable in 2017 and 2018. The total expense resulting from the revaluation amounted to £6.2 million (2015: £nil).
• Acquisition-related contingent employment costs – relate to the acquisitions of OCR in 2016 and Money20/20 in 2014. Under 
the sale and purchase agreements for both acquisitions, an element of the deferred consideration is contingent on both (i) the 
results of the business in future years and (ii) the continued employment of certain of the vendors. In accordance with IFRS,  
this element of the deferred consideration is treated as an expense and expensed over the contractual period. In 2016, the 
total expense amounted to £5.3 million and £4.4 million (2015: £nil and £5.5 million) for OCR and Money20/20 respectively. 
Refer also to Note 15. 
• Expenses related to acquisitions and disposals – the Group recognised an exceptional expense related to acquisition and 
disposal activities of £1.6 million in 2016 (2015: £0.9 million). A further charge of £0.1 million (2015: £0.9 million) was incurred 
relating to post-acquisition integration costs. These principally related to the acquisition of Oneclickretail.com in 2016 and 
RetailNet Group (“RNG”) in 2015. 
• IPO expenditure – exceptional items relating to the IPO of £3.6 million were expensed in 2016 (2015: £1.7 million).
• Business restructuring – exceptional costs of £1.7 million were incurred during the second half of 2015 as a result of the 
creation of the Plexus operating company from the combination of EMAP, MEED, 4C Group and Planet Retail.
• Share-based payments – refer to Note 10 for further details.
• Finance costs – the Group incurred interest on the shareholder debt that was subsequently converted into equity as part of the 
restructure. In 2016, this amounted to £5.3 million (2015: £43.9 million). The Group also refinanced its external debt as part of 
the IPO process incurring £10.7 million in 2016 relating to the accelerated amortisation of debt fees. A previous refinancing of 
external debt led to a charge of £4.3 million in accelerated amortisation of debt fees and break costs in 2015. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

10. Share-based payments
(a) Description of share-based payment arrangements
i. Share Incentive Plan
In 2016, the Group established the Employee Share Incentive Plan and International Employee Free Share Plan (collectively known 
as the “SIP”) which enables employees to acquire shares of the Company, subject to service conditions. On 10 March 2016, the 
Group made an award of 542,500 free shares, a conditional award of 211,500 shares and the cash equivalent of a conditional 
award of 10,000 shares to qualifying UK and international employees. The awarded free shares are held by an Employee Benefit 
Trust (“EBT”) on behalf of UK employees for a holding period of three years, while the conditional award and cash equivalent will 
vest with international employees after three years.
ii. Performance Share Plan
In 2016, the Group established the Executive Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), under which key management personnel and other 
senior employees are granted options to acquire shares or a cash alternative, subject to service and performance conditions. 
Executive Directors are further subject to a holding period for their shares upon vesting. On 21 March 2016, the Group made a 
grant of 2,095,790 options under the PSP. 25% of the options are subject to a Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) market 
performance condition and the remaining 75% is subject to an Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Tax and Amortisation (“EBITA ”) 
non-market performance condition.
iii. Sharesave scheme
In 2016, the Group established the Employee Savings Related Share Option Plan, the International Savings Related Share Option 
Plan and the US Stock Purchase Plan (collectively known as the “Sharesave”) under which employees enter into a savings contract 
and are granted options to acquire shares of the Company, subject to service conditions. On 30 September 2016, the Group made 
a grant of 1,638,082 options under the Sharesave to qualifying UK and international employees. Under the UK and International 
plans, the options vest after three years and are exercisable within a six-month period. Under the US plan, they vest after two 
years and are exercisable for a three-month period.
iv. Long-Term Incentive Plan
A number of the Group’s senior managers became shareholders of the previous ultimate parent undertaking, Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A., 
during 2014 and early 2015 under a Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The continued ownership of these shares was subject to 
certain “good” and “bad” leaver provisions, which was linked to their continued employment by the Group. As such, the shares 
were deemed to constitute an equity-settled share-based payment scheme. The shares were exchanged for ordinary £0.10 shares 
in the Company as part of the IPO restructure (see Note 1). For legal and administrative reasons, certain participants outside the 
UK and the US received their LTIP in cash-settled phantom awards.
(b) Measurement of fair values
The fair values of the SIP and Sharesave have been measured using the Black-Scholes model, while the PSP has been measured 
using a stochastic model. A Chaffe model (an at-market put option variance of the Black-Scholes model) has been used for the PSP 
awards subjective to a holding period. Non-market performance conditions were not taken into account in measuring fair values. 
The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date were as follows:

period) Sharesave Sharesave (US)

Expected volatility is usually calculated over the period of time commensurate with the remainder of the performance period 
immediately prior to the date of the grant. Since the Company has only recently listed in February 2016, a proxy volatility figure 
has been applied. The expected terms represent the term until vesting of the shares and options, as well as the holding period 
from the date of vesting.
The weighted average exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual lives of shares and options outstanding at 
31 December 2016 for each scheme are the same as the exercise prices and expected lives disclosed in the table above. 
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value of cash-settled awards at 31 December 2016 are materially the same 
as those applied at the grant date.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

10. Share-based payments continued
(c) Expense recognised in profit and loss
A £0.2 million, £1.0 million and £0.1 million share-based payment expense have been recognised in the continuing operations’ 
profit and loss for the SIP, PSP and Sharesave respectively in the year ended 31 December 2016. A £0.1 million expense has been 
recognised for the discontinued operation. For cash-settled phantom awards under the LTIP, £0.1 million (2015: 0.5 million) charge 
has been recognised in the continuing operations profit and loss in the year to 31 December 2015. All of these charges are 
disclosed as Adjusting items (Note 6 and Note 7).
No expense has been recognised for shares granted under the LTIP as the consideration received for the shares by Eden 2 &  
Cie S.C.A. was equal to, or greater than, the fair value of the shares at the vesting date.
(d) Employee Benefit Trust
The EBT purchases shares to fund the SIP for UK employees. During the year the EBT purchased 542,500 ordinary shares of  
the Company at a nominal cost of £0.1 million (2015: £nil) representing 0.1% of issued share capital. At 31 December 2016, the 
542,500 shares relating to the SIP remain in the EBT with a historical cost of £0.1 million (2015: £nil). The market value of these 
shares as at 31 December 2016 was £1.5 million (2015: £nil).

Difference (13.0) (2.5)
Total tax credit for the year (13.4) (11.3)
The Group’s effective tax rate is lower than the UK’s statutory tax rate in the main due to the recognition of previously unrecognised 
tax US losses as a result of increasing certainty over future taxable profits against which these tax assets can be recovered. 
The Group is subject to many different forms of taxation, including, but not limited to, income and corporation tax, withholding 
tax and value added and sales taxes. The Group has operations in 15 countries and multiple states in the US and sells its products 
and services into around 150 countries. Furthermore, the Group renders and receives cross-border supplies and services in 
respect of affiliated entities. Due to these factors the Group is exposed to tax risk and, in particular, with regard to transfer pricing 
rules that apply in many jurisdictions.
Tax law and administration is complex and often requires subjective determinations. In addition, tax audits, by their nature, can 
take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities. Therefore, management is required to apply judgement to 
determine the level of provisions required in respect of its tax liabilities. The Directors’ estimates of the level of risk arising from 
tax audit may change in the next year as a result of changes in legislation or tax authority practice or correspondence with tax 
authorities during specific tax audits. It is not possible to quantify the impact that such future developments may have on the 
Group’s tax positions. Actual outcomes and settlements may differ from the estimates recorded in these consolidated financial 
statements. The Group currently anticipates that the outcome of these uncertainties will only be resolved in greater than  
one year. 
Other factors that may affect future tax charges:
The 2016 Budget announcement included a proposal to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020. As the 
reduction was substantively enacted by the consolidated statement of financial position date, the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
have been measured at the reduced rates applicable when the assets and liabilities are forecast to reverse. The rate of writing down 
allowances on the main pool of plant and machinery and on the special rate pool remain unchanged at 18% and 8% respectively.
On 24 June 2016, the US House of Congress Republicans released a “Blueprint” on tax reform which is currently being debated 
through the US legislative system. The Blueprint proposes a number of changes to the US tax system. The proposal which would 
have the most significant impact on the Group’s tax position is the reduction of the Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. 
President Trump’s announced tax plan suggested this rate could become as low as 15%. In addition to reducing the rate at which 
the Group pays tax on its future US profits, each 1% change in the US Federal Tax Rate would reduce the Group’s net deferred tax 
asset on US tax items by £0.7 million.  Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

Deferred tax assets – non-current 54.9 40.2 
Deferred tax liabilities – non-current (30.3) (40.7)
Total 24.6 (0.5)
In presenting its deferred tax balances, the Group does not offset assets and liabilities as the Group has no legally enforceable 
right to set off the arising current tax liabilities and assets when those deferred tax balances reverse.
Other temporary differences include the impact of the difference in timing between tax and book amortisation for certain 
acquired intangible assets in the US as well as expected deferred consideration payments on US acquisitions.
At 31 December 2016, the Group has net deferred tax assets provided across the categories set out above totalling £24.6 million 
(2015: £0.5 million liability), of which £1.2 million is payable by the Group (2015: £2.3 million receivable by the Group) within one 
year and £23.4 million (2015: £1.8 million) payable by the Group after more than one year. The increase in the net asset position in 
the year arises from the increased level of recognition of tax assets in respect of tax losses as well as the continued amortisation 
of intangible assets and the associated deferred tax liability. 
The Group has tax losses in the US totalling £209.9 million carried forward at 31 December 2016 (2015: £193.9 million). It has 
been agreed with the US tax authorities that these losses are available for offset against taxable profits. However, these losses  
are subject to change of ownership restrictions following the listing of Ascential plc described in Note 1. A deferred tax asset of 
£17.4 million (2015: £11.5 million) has been recognised in respect of £49.7 million (2015: £28.9 million) of losses which represents 
the expected recoverable value of losses taking into account the expected impact of these restrictions. The restriction of losses is 
dependent on the valuation of the US business which will need to be agreed with the US tax authorities and, as such, is uncertain. 
The deferred tax asset recognised is based on management’s best estimate of the valuation.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on the remaining US tax losses at 31 December 2016 totalling £160.2 million 
(2015: £165.0 million) which have varying expiry dates from 2017 to 2025 and are expected to expire before they can be utilised.
The Group has non-trading tax losses in the UK totalling £59.7 million carried forward at 31 December 2016 (2015: £68.3 million) 
which are likely to be fully utilised. Therefore a deferred tax asset of £11.2 million (2015: £13.1 million) has been recognised in 
respect of the full amount of these losses.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on UK capital losses at 31 December 2016 totalling £127.8 million (2015: 
£146.3 million) which can be carried forward indefinitely. Following the disposal of Health Services Journal in January 2017, refer 
to Note 40, the Group expects to utilise £18.5 million of capital losses in 2017. Therefore the Group has recognised a deferred tax 
asset of £3.6 million in respect of the capital losses expected to be utilised. 
Deferred tax is not recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is able to control the timing 
of the remittance and it is probable that there will be no remittance in the foreseeable future which will give rise to a tax liability. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

14. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit 
for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year 
plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary 
shares into ordinary shares. 
For the purpose of proforma earnings per share for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares is stated as if the IPO completed on 12 February 2016 had occurred at the beginning of the 
2015 financial year. For the purpose of statutory earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is stated as 
if only the Group restructure steps completed on 8 February 2016 had occurred at the beginning of 2015. Refer to Note 1 for 
further details.
Both proforma and statutory earnings per share have been calculated with respect to the net profit for the year for the Group, the 
continuing operations and the discontinued operation (Note 6).

2016 – acquisition of One Click Retail
On 31 August 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Oneclickretail.com LLC (“OCR”), an unlisted company based in the 
United States whose primary activity is the provision of e-commerce data analytics. The company forms part of the Information 
Services segment. 
The purchase price is expected to total £61.8 million, which comprises:
• £33.7 million (net of cash acquired) paid in 2016; 
• £0.3 million working capital adjustment receivable in future years; and
•  consideration contingent on the results of the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years payable in 2017 to 2020 and 
estimated to total £34.0 million which has been discounted to present value of £28.0 million using a discount rate relevant to 
the acquired business.
In addition to the contingent consideration described above, and subject to continued employment, certain vendors also receive 
employment income contingent on the results of the 2017 and 2018 financial years payable in 2018 to 2019, estimated to total 
£32.1 million. To determine the contingent consideration, the Directors are required to make a judgement regarding the current 
and future results. 
This acquisition-related contingent employment cost is being accrued over a contractually defined period and £5.3 million was 
recorded as an exceptional cost in the year ended 31 December 2016.
There is a maximum limit of $225.0 million on the total consideration payable including acquisition-related employment costs; 
there is no minimum limit.

The goodwill is attributable mainly to the workforce and anticipated future growth in the customer base of the acquired business. 
All goodwill recognised for the acquisition of OCR is deductible for tax purposes.
Additional information needs to be compiled in order to refine the calculations of the intangible assets, this includes revenue 
forecasts by customer and similar information. As a consequence, the intangible assets noted above are provisionally valued until 
this information has been obtained. 
(b) Acquisition-related costs
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £0.9 million related to external legal fees and due diligence costs. These costs 
have been included within exceptional items in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
(c) Results contribution in the year ended 31 December 2016
From the date of acquisition, OCR contributed £3.1 million revenue and a profit before tax of £2.2 million to the Group in the year 
ended 31 December 2016. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 2016, revenue from continuing operations would 
have been £7.4 million and the profit before tax from continuing operations for the Group would have been £5.2 million. In 
determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition 
would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2016. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

15. Business combinations continued 
Reconciliation of movement in deferred and contingent consideration
The Group has liabilities in respect of deferred consideration payments under various business acquisition contracts. These 
earn-out payments are generally contingent on the post-acquisition performance of the acquired business. Where that is the only 
dependency, the liability is initially recorded at acquisition, based on the expected payments discounted by a pre-tax discount rate 
specific to the business. Subsequently, the discount unwinds by way of a charge to finance costs, and any subsequent change in 
estimated payout is recorded in exceptional items. Where payments are also contingent on continued employment, the estimated 
payments are accrued over the period of related service, as a charge to exceptional items. 
The contracted terms of the earn-outs in respect of acquisitions in the current and comparative periods are outlined above.  
The other material earn-out liabilities are in respect of Money20/20 LLC (“Money20/20”), acquired in 2014. 
On 29 August 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Money20/20, an unlisted company based in the US whose primary 
activity is the organisation of global events on payments and financial services innovation.
The purchase price included deferred consideration contingent on the results of 2015, 2016 and 2017 financial years payable  
in 2016 to 2018, recorded initially as a liability on acquisition, discounted to present value. In addition, and subject to continued 
employment, certain vendors are also entitled to payments contingent on the results of 2015, 2016 and 2017 financial years  
and payable in 2016 to 2018, recorded as acquisition-related contingent employment cost accrued over the relevant contractual 
service period. There is no maximum or minimum limit on the combined total of the contingent consideration element and the 
acquisition-related contingent employment cost element of the contractual earn-out liabilities payable, however there is a cap  
on the total amount paid as employment cost.
To determine the contingent consideration, the Board is required to make a judgement regarding the current and future results. 
For the year ended 31 December 2015 the earn-out was expected to give rise to payments of £28.2 million. During 2016, 
Money20/20 outperformed expectations for the year, in particular due to the successful launch of Money20/20 Europe. As a 
result, total payments under the earn-out provisions are now expected to total £41.1 million. As a result, the liability for deferred 
consideration was revalued giving rise to a £6.2 million charge as set out in Note 7.
The amounts recorded as a liability, and the movements during the year, are as follows:

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets
For reporting purposes, the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) have been aggregated into reportable segments. The goodwill in CGUs 
are individually assessed for impairment each year as follows:

At 31 December 2015 181.9 145.5 37.8 – 18.5 383.7
The Group tests goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications  
of impairment. The CGUs used in testing for impairment are defined as parts of the organisation, which the Directors judge to 
have largely independently managed cash flows. During the year, the creation of the disposal group and associated operational 
separation meant that the disposal group met the criteria for treatment as a separate CGU. While the Exhibitions & Festivals 
segment and the discontinued operations segment in the segmental note disclosure (Note 5) each represents one CGU, the 
Information Services segment consists of three CGUs. When testing for impairment, recoverable amounts for all of the Group’s 
CGUs are measured at their value-in-use by discounting the future expected cash flows from the assets in the CGUs. These 
calculations use cash flow projections based on Board-approved budgets and plans.
Brand value includes £70.8 million (2015: £70.8 million) with an indefinite life which is not being amortised. This intangible asset is 
included within the Exhibitions & Festivals segment. This relates to Cannes Lions and was identified on acquisition in 2008. This 
brand has an indefinite life due to the strength of its recognition and revenue stream and is tested annually for impairment. It was 
tested for impairment using the value-in-use inputs for the Exhibitions & Festivals disclosed below.
The key assumptions and estimates used for value-in-use calculations are as follows:
Future expected cash flows
The Group uses cash flow forecasts for each CGU, based on the latest three – year plan. For years four and five, specific growth 
assumptions are used before a long-term growth rate is applied to years six and beyond. In the case of OCR, the acquisition case 
cash flows have been used; these reflect the expected high-growth characteristics of this business and are discussed in Note 15.
The long-term growth rate assumptions, and the discount rates applied to the risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts, are set out below.

Pre-tax discount rate 9.2% 9.8% 9.8% N/A 9.8%
The measurement of value-in-use is sensitive to changes in these key assumptions and in the assumptions about economic growth 
and market penetration that underpin the cash flow projections. 
The Directors have sensitised the key assumptions, including the discount rate, and under both base case and sensitised case no 
indicators of impairment exist. The Directors believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the 
recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Directors have also considered the likely proceeds that may be generated on disposal of the discontinued operations. In the 
view of the Directors these are likely to exceed the carrying value of the net assets associated with the disposal group. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

22. Financial assets
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, financial derivative assets and trade and other receivables.  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables (see Note 21). The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative 
financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit 
rating agencies. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties 
and customers.
23. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2016 of £61.9 million (2015: £44.4 million) relate to bank balances, including 
short-term deposits with an original maturity date of less than three months, and cash held by the Group. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

2 Other receivables that are not financial assets (namely prepayments and accrued income) are not included. Refer to Note 21.
3  Included in trade and other payables is £13.2 million (2015: £5.5 million) and within non-current deferred and contingent consideration is £37.8 million (2015: £9.8 million) 
classified as level 3 fair value.
The fair value of each category of the Group’s financial instruments approximates their carrying value in the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position.
Where financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair values, their measurement is classified into the following hierarchy:
• Level 1—quoted prices in active markets from identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2—inputs other than quoted market prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
• Level 3—inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
There were no movements between different levels of the fair value hierarchy in the year.
The Group had interest rate caps (level 2) at 31 December 2016 of £0.1 million (2015: £1.0 million) of which £0.1 million 
(2015: £0.6 million) is included within non-current assets, and cross-currency swaps (level 2) at 31 December 2016 of £nil 
(2015: £2.1 million) of which £1.7 million was included within non-current liabilities.
These derivative instruments were not traded in an active market and the fair value is determined by using third party valuations 
based on forward yield curves. This technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and relies as little 
as possible on entity specific estimates. All significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

25. Financial instruments continued
The interest rate caps are used to cap an element of the Group’s external borrowings which all bear interest at floating rate. 
As at 31 December 2016, the total notional amount of outstanding interest rate caps to which the Group is committed is 
£182.9 million (2015: £231.2 million). The fair value of the interest rate caps as at 31 December 2016 was a £0.1 million asset 
(2015: £1.0 million asset).
In 2015, the cross-currency swaps were used to maintain an appropriate currency mix of the Group’s borrowings reflecting the 
Group’s mix of underlying cash flows.

The financial and derivative liabilities are shown in the time period in which they are due to be repaid. The interest payments on 
borrowings due in less than one month represents the actual interest due, while the interest due greater than one month is an 
estimate based on current interest rates and exchange rates. Cash flows in respect of borrowings represent contractual payments 
under the Group’s lending facilities in place as at December 2016. Borrowings as disclosed in Note 26 are stated net of 
unamortised arrangement fees of £4.3 million as at 31 December 2016 (2015: £10.5 million). FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

26. Borrowings
The maturity profile of the Group’s borrowings, all of which are secured loans, was as follows:
(£ million) 2016 2015
Current – within one year – 2.4
Non-current:
– In the second year – 2.4
– Two to five years 286.0 7.2
– After more than five years – 413.6
286.0 423.2
Total borrowings 286.0 425.6
On 12 February 2016, the Company raised gross proceeds of £200 million as a result of the IPO. It also entered into the New 
Facilities Agreement at IPO, which comprise new term loan facilities of £66 million, €171 million and $96 million which mature in 
February 2021 and a revolving credit facility of £95 million. The New Facilities Agreement is available to the Company and certain 
of its subsidiaries. The Company used the proceeds of the IPO, the funds from the New Facilities Agreement and existing available 
cash to repay all amounts outstanding under the Group’s previous senior facilities agreement, consisting of a $321 million and a 
€299 million term loan maturing in April 2022 and to cancel certain hedging arrangements.
£5.3 million issue costs for the new loan and credit facilities were capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2016 and are 
being amortised over the term of the respective loans.
The Group’s borrowings at 31 December 2016 were in pounds sterling: £66 million, US dollars: $96 million and euros: €171 million 
(2015: US dollars: $321 million and euros: €299 million) and are shown net of unamortised issue costs of £4.3 million (2015: £10.5 
million). The carrying amounts of borrowings approximate their fair value. The carrying value of the Group’s borrowing facilities at 
31 December 2016 is detailed in Note 3.
Each 1% movement in the euro to pounds sterling exchange rate has a circa £1.5 million (2015: £2.2 million) impact on the 
carrying value of borrowings. Each 1% movement in the US dollar to pounds sterling exchange rate has a circa £0.8 million impact 
on the carrying value of borrowings (2015: £2.2 million, offset by a circa £1.1 million impact on the carrying value of derivative 
financial instruments in respect of cross-currency swaps).
The effective annual interest rate at 31 December 2016 was 2.3% (2015: 6.0%).

Since 31 December 2016 the following events have taken place:
On 5 January 2017, the Company announced that it had separated 13 Heritage Brands into a separate operating entity. The 
Heritage Brands will develop an independent business strategy while new owners are sought. These brands are reported as  
a separate segment in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. As a result of ongoing 
discussions, the Board considered a sale of the segment to be highly probable and has therefore classified it as a 
discontinued operation.
Following on from this, the Company announced on 19 January 2017 that it has agreed the sale of Health Service Journal to 
Wilmington plc for a consideration of £19.0 million. This marks the first sale in the Heritage Brand sale process.
On 7 February 2017, the Company announced it had agreed to acquire 100% of US-based media advisory and business services 
provider MediaLink for an initial cash consideration of $69.0 million plus future earn-outs. The transaction is expected to 
complete, subject to customary US regulatory clearance, in March 2017.
After the reporting date, the Board of Directors proposed a final dividend of 3.2p per ordinary share for the year ended 
31 December 2016, refer to Note 34.

For the period ended 31 December 2016

Basis of preparation
The Company
Ascential plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2016 and its registered office is  
The Prow, 1 Wilder Walk, London W1B 5AP. On 12 February 2016, the Company listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange. 
In preparation for the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) the Ascential plc Group (“the Group”) was restructured between 8 and 
12 February 2016. The restructure has impacted a number of the primary financial statements and notes presented in these 
Company financial statements.
The steps to restructure the Group had the effect of the Company being inserted above Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A., (which was 
previously the ultimate Parent undertaking of the Group). The key steps in the restructure were:
• On 8 February 2016, the Company became the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group by acquiring the entire issued share 
capital of, and voting beneficiary certificates in, Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A., via a share for share exchange. All the ordinary shares in 
Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. were exchanged for 77,215,918 ordinary £0.10 shares and 1,824,766 F ordinary £0.10 shares issued by the 
Company. The Company also acquired preference shares held by management and other shareholders in exchange for £175.5 
million of new preference shares issued by the Company. Preferred Equity Certificates (“PECs”) held by shareholders were also 
exchanged for £100.4 million of new PECs issued by the Company.
• On 9 February 2016, a shareholder transferred its shareholder loan receivable to the Company in exchange for £165.5 million 
of new PECs issued by the Company.
• On 12 February 2016, the Company’s F ordinary shares and new preference shares were converted into 89,665,977 ordinary 
£0.10 shares and the new PECs were capitalised through the issue of 133,118,105 ordinary £0.10 shares, thereby retiring all 
shareholder debt. 
• On 12 February 2016, the Company issued 100,000,000 ordinary £0.10 shares at an offer price of £2.00, generating proceeds 
of £200 million and bringing the total number of ordinary shares to 400,000,000. 50,000 ordinary £0.10 shares were issued 
outside of the underwriting agreements in place for the IPO but for the purpose of these financial statements these shares and 
their proceeds are presented as part of the IPO.
The acquisition of preference shares in Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. was accounted for under the provisions of CA s615 whereby the 
shares issued by Ascential plc were recorded at nominal value of £17.5 million. The preference shares in Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. were 
a financial asset recorded at their fair value of £175.4 million. This exchange gives rise to an unrealised gain of £157.9 million which 
is recorded as a separate “Group restructure” reserve within total equity.
On 8 June 2016, the Company completed a reduction of its share capital, as contemplated in the IPO prospectus, whereby (i) the 
entire amount standing to the credit of the Company’s share premium account was cancelled, (ii) 876,266,690 deferred shares 
(which were issued by way of a bonus issue for the purpose of capitalising the Company’s capital reserve) were cancelled, and (iii) 
the nominal value of each issued ordinary share in the capital of the Company was reduced from £0.10 to £0.01 each. The 
distributable reserves created by the reduction of capital amount to approximately £476.2 million.
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by the 
Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United 
Kingdom. These financial statements have been prepared for the period from incorporation on 4 January 2016 to 31 December 
2016. These were prepared in accordance with FRS 102 and on the historical cost basis. 
Disclosure exemptions
The Group includes the Company in its consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements of Ascential plc 
are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and are available to the public 
and may be obtained from The Prow, 1 Wilder Walk, London W1B 5AP. In these financial statements, the Company is considered 
to be a qualifying entity (for the purposes of this FRS) and has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the 
following disclosures:
• reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding from the beginning to end of the period; 
• cash flow statement and related notes; and
• key management personnel compensation
As the consolidated financial statements of Ascential plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the 
exemptions under FRS 102 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• certain disclosures required by FRS 102.26 share based payments; and,
• the disclosures required by FRS 102.11 basic financial instruments and FRS 102.12 other financial instrument issues in respect 
of financial instruments not falling within the fair value accounting rules of Paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 1.
Going concern
The Company is in a net assets position and has sufficient resources to pay its financial liabilities as and when they fall due.  
The Company is the ultimate parent undertaking of the Ascential plc Group (“the Group”). On 12 February 2016, the Company FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

1. Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued
became a guarantor to the new term loan facilities (“New Facilities Agreement”) held by Ascential Financing Ltd, a 100% owned 
subsidiary of the Company. The Group has prepared trading forecasts which indicate that there is sufficient liquidity headroom 
against all financial covenants for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements, and 
the Group will be able to meet the mandatory repayment terms of the banking facilities held in Ascential Financing Ltd, fully 
owned subsidiary of the Company. 
After reviewing the above, taking into account current and future developments and principal risks and uncertainties, and making 
appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and are satisfied that the Company financial statements should be 
prepared on a going concern basis.
Principal accounting policies
A summary of the most important accounting policies is set out below.
a) Investments in subsidiary
 Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment. Carrying values are reviewed for 
impairment either annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in carrying 
values. 
b) Amounts due from Group undertakings
 Amounts due from Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are 
measured at amortised cost, less any impairment losses. Amounts due from Group undertakings are reviewed for impairment 
either annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. 
c) Creditors
 Creditors are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
d) Taxation
 Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised 
directly in equity or other comprehensive income. 
 Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
 Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in 
periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. Timing differences are not provided for 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and the reporting entity is able to control the reversal of the timing difference. Deferred tax is not recognised on 
permanent differences arising because certain types of income or expense are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or 
because certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense. 
 Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
 Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will be 
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
e)  Share-based payments 
 Certain employees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares. The cost of equity-settled transactions with 
employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share awards with market-related 
vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The estimate of the number 
of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is 
adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting 
date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
 
 Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase  
in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in the 
subsidiary’s financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. In cases where a subsidiary 
is recharged for the share-based payment expense, no such increase in investment is recognised. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

1. Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued
f) Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust
 The Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) provides for the issue of shares to Group employees under share incentive schemes.  
The Company has control of the EBT and accounts for the EBT as an extension to the Company in the financial statements. 
Accordingly, shares in the Company held by the EBT are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction from 
shareholders’ funds.
2. Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements under FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions, and requires 
management to exercise its judgement and to make estimates in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies.  
The areas requiring a higher degree of judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial 
statements, are discussed below.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect  
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and 
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, 
events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates, particularly for share-based payments.
Investments
The Company uses forecast cash flow information and estimates of future growth to assess whether investments are impaired.  
If the results of operations in a future period are adverse to the estimates used for impairment testing, an impairment may be 
triggered at that point.
3. Profit and loss account
Ascential plc has taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its profit 
and loss account. The loss for the period to 31 December 2016 was £0.9 million. 
Fees paid to the auditor during the period for the audit of the Company accounts were £20,000. Fees paid to the auditor for other 
services was £nil. Refer to Note 8 in the Group accounts for the other services disclosed.
4. Directors’ emoluments
The Company has no employees other than the Directors. Full details of the Directors’ remuneration and interests are set out  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 82.

For the period ended 31 December 2016, an interim dividend of 1.5p per ordinary share was declared and paid by the Company.
After the reporting date, the Board of Directors proposed a final dividend of 3.2p per ordinary share from distributable reserves, 
resulting in a total dividend of 4.7p per ordinary share for the period ended 31 December 2016. The final dividend is subject to 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and hence has not been recognised as a liability in the financial 
statements at 31 December 2016.
10. Related party transactions
During the period, a management charge of £2.3 million was received from subsidiary undertakings in respect of services rendered.
At 31 December 2016, balances outstanding with other Group undertakings were £594.6 million and £13.8 million respectively 
for debtors and creditors as set out in Notes 6 and 7. Ascential plc  Annual Report 2016

11. Commitments and contingencies
On 12 February 2016, the Group entered into a New Facilities Agreement of £66 million, €171 million and $96 million and  
a revolving credit facility of £95 million. The Company was identified as a guarantor to the New Facilities Agreement.
During the period the Company was a member of the Group cash pooling arrangement. This allows the Group to combine the 
liquidity of companies within the Group in order to distribute such cash centrally as required.
The Company is registered with H.M. Revenue & Customs as a member of the Ascential Limited Group for value added tax and 
Pay As You Earn purposes and is therefore jointly and severally liable on a continuing basis for amounts owing by other members 
of the Group in respect of their value added tax, income tax and national insurance contributions liabilities. 
12. Events after the reporting date
Since 31 December 2016 the following events have taken place:
After the reporting date, the Board of Directors proposed a final dividend of 3.2p per ordinary share for the period ended 
31 December 2016, refer to Note 9.
There were no other reportable events after 31 December 2016.

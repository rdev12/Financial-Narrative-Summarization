Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 1
Highlights Microsaic Systems plc develops
microengineered analytical instruments
that are based on the scientific technique
of mass spectrometry (MS). MS is widely
accepted as one of the most reliable
methods for identifying the chemical
make-up of substances and Microsaic is
the first and only company to have
commercialised and patented chip-based
MS technology using silicon
microengineering (MEMS).
The analysis method of choice
Mass spectrometry is an established analytical technique
used in many laboratories which enables the accurate
identification and quantification of trace levels of chemical
or biological compounds by recording their unique
molecular weight. Today, MS is the standard means of
measuring the composition of samples in pharmaceuticals
and biotechnology, but is also widely used in a variety of
other industries including healthcare, environmental, food
and drink, security, petrochemicals and mining. By
miniaturising MS to desk-top size, Microsaic has made it
practical for a much wider range of users and applications
within these fields and opens up new opportunities for the
growing $3 billion MS market.
A step change in laboratory capability
The Company’s first product, the Microsaic 3500 MiD
®
,
was launched in January 2011 and became the world’s
smallest MS system. Users are particularly impressed by
the self-contained nature of the system – no other mass
spectrometer for liquid analysis has eliminated external
pumps and computers – and this gives the MiD
®
a
revolutionary advantage in deployability, ease of use and
cost of ownership. These advantages have been recognised
within the wider industry too. The 3500 MiD
®
gained the
New Product Award from the US Society of Laboratory
Automation and Screening in 2011 and a prestigious
R&D 100 award in 2012 as one of the most technologically
significant products to enter the marketplace globally.
Several articles have been published in scientific journals
citing new discoveries made using the MiD
®
.
Continuing evolution
The Microsaic 4000 MiD
®
has an even smaller footprint
than the 3500 MiD
®
and fits even more comfortably into
a standard laboratory fume hood. Its ‘Plug & Play’
components also enable users to maintain the system
themselves, resulting in less down-time and greater flexibility
within the laboratory. The 4000 MiD
®
was launched in
March at Pittcon 2013, the world’s largest annual
conference and exposition on laboratory science and
scientific instrumentation. 
We have an on-going R&D programme building on the
achievements already made and focused on increasing
the reach of our core Ionchip
®
technology, which underpins
the MiD
®
. Our product pipeline includes more complex MS
systems which will allow us to address more technically
demanding market areas, such as food and drink, and
environmental safety. 
2 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Company profile Tapping into established sales channels through
value-added partnerships
The Company’s strategy is to generate revenue streams by
introducing compact, deployable MS products, based on
its patented chip technologies, into a series of markets and
applications by selling through partnerships with existing
sales channels. Typically these sales channels will be
international suppliers of complementary equipment. 
In 2012 one such partnership was formed with Biotage AB,
a well established supplier in the areas of analytical and
medicinal chemistry. Microsaic is providing its 4000 MiD
®
as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) as part of
an integrated solution for mass-directed flash purification
that will enable a leap forward in chemists’ work flow and
productivity.
Further similar relationships are planned with other leading
suppliers of scientific equipment, which will enable the
Company to build up volume sales. Direct sales to end
users in niche application areas will also continue in
parallel.
Quality innovation moving forward
Microsaic Systems was established in 2001 from the highly
regarded Optical and Semiconductor Devices Group at
Imperial College London. It has been based at
headquarters in Woking, UK since September 2004 and
was admitted to AIM, a market of the London Stock
Exchange, in April 2011 (ticker: MSYS).
Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 3 Eric Yeatman
Chairman
2012 was a year of good progress for the
Company. We signed an OEM (Original
Equipment Manufacturer) agreement with
Biotage AB, and developed our first
integrated product with them, which has
been introduced to the market at trade
fairs and is being very well received by
customers.
We also welcomed Colin Jump as our new Chief Executive
to lead the Company in capturing the opportunities that lie
ahead. Colin brings many years’ experience with him from
the scientific instrument sector. He joined us from Shimadzu
UK where he was Managing Director and we are delighted
to have him on board. In his first months he has already
brought his expert knowledge of the industry to bear in our
external relationships and our planning for the future.
Colin’s first statement as Chief Executive outlines the
achievements of the Company over the past year and the
strategy for delivering value to our shareholders over the
coming year and beyond.
Peter Selway, a Non-executive Director of Microsaic for ten
years, retired at the 2012 Annual General Meeting having
reached the age of 70. We owe Peter a debt of gratitude for
his contribution and wise counsel over that time and wish
him a long and happy retirement.
On a personal note, I would like to take the opportunity to
thank the Board and staff for their support whilst I was
Acting CEO, and particularly to Colin Nicholl who took on
the role of Chairman for that period. Following Colin
Jump’s appointment, I have resumed the role of Chairman
and Colin Nicholl has reverted to Deputy Chairman.
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their support
during 2012 and I look forward with confidence to 2013 as
the Company, led by Colin Jump, advances towards
achieving our business goals.

Chairman’s statement
for the year ended 31 December 2012 Colin Jump
Chief Executive Officer
It is with great pleasure that I provide my
first report as Chief Executive of Microsaic
Systems. Since joining in November 2012,
I have had the opportunity to better
understand the business, its technology, its
people, its customers and the markets in
which it operates. I am very excited about
the opportunities that are opened up by the
Company’s technology in the field of
chemical analysis, and the high level of
market interest.
I would like to report on last year’s achievements, including
those before my appointment, and also provide a summary
of ongoing activities and our intended direction for the
business. 
Microsaic’s chip-based technology has allowed us to
miniaturise the mass spectrometer (MS) – the gold
standard for chemical analysis – far beyond any other
product on the market. This miniaturisation greatly
simplifies deployment, drastically cuts power consumption
and other running costs, and makes MS practical for a
wide range of new users and applications. 2012 saw the
first regular shipments of our breakthrough compact MS
product, the 3500 MiD
®
, following its launch in 2011.
This is the only MS on the market for liquid analysis
that requires no external pumps, being completely
self-contained within the size of a desktop computer. 
Our main route to market for the MiD
®
is to partner with
companies that have established sales channels and
complementary products, with an initial focus on the areas
of pharma and biotechnology. A key milestone in this
strategy was reached in May 2012 with the signing of an
OEM arrangement with Biotage AB. Biotage, listed on the
NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, is a well-established supplier
in the areas of analytical and medicinal chemistry, with a
global sales and service capability. Biotage is a leader in
the supply of flash chromatography, a widely used
separation and purification method in chemical synthesis.
In collaboration with Microsaic, Biotage is introducing a
fully integrated system incorporating the MiD
®
with its flash
systems, which will greatly increase the power and
effectiveness of flash, allowing, for example, automated
mass-directed separation. This will be the first such
product on the market, and early feedback from customers
has been positive.
Since signing of the agreement, the ‘Isolera Dalton’
integrated system has been developed by Biotage in
collaboration with Microsaic, and initial marketing has
begun, with presentations having been given at
international trade shows of the American Chemical
Society in the USA and JASIS in Japan. Interest in this new
Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 5
Chief Executive’s statement
for the year ended 31 December 2012 integrated system has been extremely encouraging and
has exceeded our initial expectations.
A key technical milestone in 2012 was our development of
an enhanced version of the 3500 MiD
®
, namely the 4000
MiD
®
. To ensure that MiD
®
s and the integrated Biotage
systems can fit comfortably within fume hoods – an
important capability for flash as well as other applications –
the 4000 has a significantly reduced footprint compared to
the 3500. Other enhancements were also incorporated,
and the first system was shipped to Biotage to support the
development programme in Q3 2012. Since then we have
taken the 4000 through final development stages, including
outsourcing of major sub-components, and continue to
prepare the system for volume manufacture so we can
benefit from economies of scale. Regular shipments of the
4000 MiD
®
have been made, and in March 2013 we
launched the 4000 MiD
®
officially at Pittcon, the major
international trade fair focused on scientific and laboratory
equipment, which took place in Philadelphia, USA. 
In addition to Biotage, we have been continuing to
develop our relationships with a range of other potential
commercial partners in the pharma, biotech and related
sectors. Two major analytical instrument suppliers have
conducted evaluations of 3500 systems; these led to
proposed enhancements in hardware and software which
have recently been implemented. Two other major
scientific instrument suppliers contracted with us to
develop versions of the MiD
®
with extended measurement
capability to meet the requirements of their specific
applications, and in both cases key technical targets have
been met. These partner discussions and collaborations
continue to advance towards the goal of OEM agreements
to supply the MiD
®
in combined products. We are also
pursuing funded development opportunities in other
industry sectors. For example, our interest in security
applications continues, where we have recently been
awarded a grant to develop advanced MS instruments
for on-site analysis of explosives and narcotics.
Our strategy for direct sales is to focus on new application
areas and to ensure we have direct contact with users, so as
to inform our product development and R&D programmes.
To further build this channel in 2013 we are enhancing our
business development and customer support functions with
a number of key hires in these areas.
Technical progress continued in 2012 including significant
enhancements to our production capability. Production of
the key chip-based components is retained in-house and
our productivity levels have been significantly increased.
Sub-systems have been transferred to external suppliers
and full system assembly will also be out-sourced later this
year. Further enhancements have also been made to the
user-replaceable components to make handling of these
increasingly simple, as part of our ‘Plug & Play’ approach. 
A further major technical milestone for the Company was
the first demonstration of a working prototype of a triple
quadrupole MS system that can analyse more complex
materials such as medical samples, for example, blood or
saliva. This system will give us the capability needed for our
next generation of MS products and further broaden the
range of applications that our miniaturised MS instruments
can address.
The importance of our products and their breakthrough
capabilities were acknowledged by several external agencies
in 2012. In June, the 3500 MiD
®
received a prestigious
R&D 100 award, given to the most significant technological
advances of the year across all sectors. We also published
results in collaboration with a prestigious laboratory at
Cambridge University in a leading peer-reviewed journal
(Browne, D.L. et al., Rapid Communications in Mass
Spectrometry 26, pp 1999-2010, 2012) on new capabilities
in continuous reaction monitoring facilitated by the 3500
MiD
®
.
6 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Chief Executive’s statement (continued) Financial results
Revenues in 2012 rose to £606,281 (2011: £267,999)
having benefited from sales of our MiD
®
products on top of
grant income streams funding future product development.
We expect sales volumes to significantly grow in 2013 as
our joint product with Biotage is rolled out internationally
and market interest in our product increases.
Research and development expenditure in the year amounted
to £1,298,129 (2011: £1,314,851) reflecting continuing
investment in product development including enhancements
to our existing products and future products.
The Company’s manufacturing, sales and after-sales
capabilities are being steadily built up. Operating
expenses reported for the year increased to £1,179,516
(2011: £1,090,718), however this includes a one-off write
back of £81,901 of prior year share-based payment
charges following the lapsing of unexercised share
options.
In June the Company placed 3,867,248 ordinary shares
with existing and new shareholders. This represented a 10%
increase in the Company’s issued share capital and we
gratefully acknowledge the on-going support shown by our
investors. The net proceeds raised from the issue amounted
to £1.45 million. These funds have enabled us to enhance
our capability in several areas, particularly software
development, production and applications development.
We have made hires in each of these areas and these new
employees are already adding to our capability to address
market requirements and opportunities.
The loss for the year after tax was £1,867,069 (2011:
£1,899,253) and the cash position at 31 December 2012
of £1,788,579 was at a similar level to a year previous
(2011: £1,818,319), as the net cash used in operating
activities was offset by that raised through the share issue.
As with previous years, the going concern basis has
continued to be adopted in preparing the financial
statements. Following the progress made by the Company
to date and the progress anticipated in the near term, the
Directors have a reasonable expectation of securing
suitable additional funding as may be required to continue
operations and provide for future expansion.
Outlook 
Since the end of the financial year we have signed a
second OEM agreement to provide the Microsaic 4000
MiD
®
as a stand-alone instrument on a non-exclusive
basis. This agreement resulted directly from expressions of
interest from customers and represents the first of what we
anticipate will be a number of sales channels of this type,
which will add significantly to our overall sales.
This new agreement together with good progress across
other areas of our business and a growing profile within the
scientific analytical instrumentation market, gives us
confidence as we address three distinct business strategies
that underpin our ambitions for 2013 and beyond:
• Developing OEM partnerships with synergistic
companies, which can provide Microsaic with access
to enhanced sales distribution channels alongside our
own direct sales channel.
• Stepping up our marketing communications and the
promotion of the core brand values of Microsaic.
• Outsourcing the manufacture of the main product
ensuring high quality build, reliability and high
volume capacity.
We will continue discussions with interested OEM partners
who have established global sales distribution channels, in
order to advance those relationships towards commercial
agreements. 
Further innovations around the concept of ‘Plug & Play’
components are planned. Within the MS market, our ‘Plug
& Play’ designs are unique and will largely dispense with the
need for highly technical operators or support/service staff,
therefore increasing the operational use of system (reducing
system down-time) and reducing cost to the user. This
concept will provide a clearer differentiator between us and
any other current vendors of MS instrumentation.
The Company has a wealth of committed expertise in its
people. They have built a solid platform for growth and
gained invaluable experience introducing new technology
within an established, naturally conservative market. It is my
and my fellow Directors’ belief that these strengths and our
shared vision can make Microsaic Systems a highly
successful company moving forward.

Principal activity, business review and business risks
The principal activity of the Company continued to be the research, development and commercialisation of scientific
instruments. A review of the business and its prospects is contained within the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s
statements. 
In common with other small companies developing new technologies, the Company is subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, which principally include:
Risk area Key risks
Company development — The early stage development of the business and its evolution into a successful
trading Company with all the operational requirements that this entails
— Current operating losses depleting the Company’s capital and cash 
— The availability and terms of capital needed for continued business development and
expansion
— Recruitment and retention of personnel and requisite skills to run and build the
business
Customer markets — Market acceptance of the Company’s revolutionary products
— Competing products emerging from other companies
— The ability of the Company to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of its
products
— The economic environment and recessionary effects that may restrict customer
spending on capital equipment 
Technical — The product’s technical performance and specification meeting customer
requirements
— The reproducibility of the Company’s products as production volumes increase
— The ability to protect Company intellectual property and defend infringement claims
by others
Financial — Sufficient cash flow liquidity
— Credit risk attributable to trade receivables and cash deposits
— Exchange rate risk on currency exposures
There is further explanation of the financial risks in note 23 to the financial statements.
The ongoing performance of the Company is managed and monitored using a number of key performance indicators,
both financial and qualitative. In terms of financial performance, the Company does not currently generate profits and
utilises cash for its operational activities. The forecasting and monitoring of the Company’s cash resources is therefore
critical in terms of the efficient allocation of those resources and in predicting future cash requirements. A key feature of
the Company’s internal management reporting is therefore the emphasis placed on operational cash spend by category
and against forecast, which is monitored at both management and Board level on a monthly basis. The Company’s net
cash used in operating activities for the year ended 31 December 2012 was £1,373,092 (2011: £2,033,144) and the
loss for the year after tax was £1,867,069 (2011: £1,899,253). Forecasts are updated on a regular basis to take account
of changing circumstances in the business.

Remuneration Committee
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors, determination of their individual remuneration packages and their
performance appraisals have been delegated to the Board’s Remuneration Committee comprising three Non-executive
Directors.
In setting the remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors including:
— the basic salaries and benefits available to Executive Directors of comparable companies;
— the need to attract and retain Directors of an appropriate calibre;

schemes; and

Remuneration of the Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is agreed by the Board following recommendation by the Remuneration
Committee, having a view to rates paid in comparable organisations and appointments. The Non-executive Directors did
not receive any pension or other benefits from the Company, nor did they participate in any bonus or incentive schemes
other than share options. 
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The Company’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors is to:
— have regard to the Directors’ experience and the nature and complexity of their work in order to pay a competitive salary
that attracts and retains management of the quality required to serve the business;
— link individual remuneration packages to the Company’s performance through the award of discretionary bonus
schemes; and
— provide employment-related benefits including life assurance and insurance relating to the Directors’ duties.

14 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Directors’ remuneration report (continued) As an AIM listed company, Microsaic Systems plc is not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code, a
set of recommended corporate governance principles for UK public companies issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
However, the Board recognises the value of good governance and complies with the provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code and the QCA Guidelines so far as is practicable for a company of its size, stage of development and
nature.
The Board
During the year the composition of the Board changed with the appointment of Colin Jump (Chief Executive Officer) and
the retirement of Peter Selway (Non-executive Director). Following the appointment of Mr Jump, Eric Yeatman and Colin
Nicholl relinquished their positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman respectively, and Prof Yeatman resumed the
role of Chairman and Mr Nicholl, Deputy Chairman.
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible, inter alia, for strategy, budget, performance, approval of major capital expenditure and the
framework of internal controls.
Board processes
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee with formally delegated responsibilities to
assist with the execution of its responsibilities.
The full Board holds regular meetings on a monthly basis and additional meetings at any other times as may be necessary
to deal with any urgent matters that arise. The agenda for Board meetings is prepared in conjunction with the Chairman
and submissions are circulated in advance. The Company management team prepares regular reports which allow the
Board to assess the Company’s activities and review its performance and the Board has clearly specified the levels of
authority delegated to management. Members of the Company’s management team are regularly involved in Board
discussions and Directors are able to have discussions with other employees where appropriate.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. This
includes financial, operational and compliance controls and risk-management systems. Internal control systems are
designed to meet the Company’s particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed. The internal control systems are
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and by their nature can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss.
Composition of the Board
The Board currently comprises seven Directors. 
The role of the Chairman is filled by a Non-executive Director.
Directors appointed by the Board are subject to re-election by shareholders at the following Annual General Meeting and
thereafter Directors are subject to re-election at least every three years.
Conflicts of interest
Directors must keep the Board advised of any interest that could potentially conflict with those of the Company. Where a
conflict exists, the Director concerned is not present at the meeting whilst the relevant matter is considered.

Audit Committee
The role of the Audit Committee is documented in its terms of reference which were adopted by the Board of Directors on
31 March 2011.
The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for corporate
governance, financial reporting, corporate control and risk management. The Audit Committee normally meets at least
twice a year and, amongst other things, reviews the annual report and accounts and interim statements with the external
auditors. The Committee also approves external auditors’ fees and ensures auditors’ independence as well as focusing on
compliance with legal requirements and accounting standards. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the
annual financial statements and interim statements remains with the Board.
The members of the Audit Committee for 2011 were C J Nicholl (Chairman), J C Ramage, P R Selway (until 30 May 2012)
and A S Holmes (from 30 May 2012). The external auditors, the Chief Executive Officer, Finance Director and other
executives may be invited to the Audit Committee meetings at the discretion of the Committee. 
The Audit Committee met 4 times in 2012.
Remuneration Committee
The role of the Remuneration Committee is documented in its terms of reference which were adopted by the Board of
Directors on 31 March 2011.
The Remuneration Committee meets as required and at least once a year. Its responsibilities include reviewing the
performance of the Executive Directors, setting their remuneration levels, determining the payment of bonuses and other
benefits and considering the grant of options under the Company share option schemes.
The members of the Remuneration Committee for 2012 were J C Ramage (Chairman), C J Nicholl, P R Selway (until
30 May 2012) and A S Holmes (from 30 May 2012). 
The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2012.
Board nominations
The appointment of replacement or additional Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole. 
At this stage, it is not considered appropriate for the Company to have a formally constituted Nominations Committee,
however this will be kept under review.
16 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Corporate governance report (continued) Communications with shareholders

and on the Company’s website.
— The annual report and financial statements are sent to all registered shareholders.
— Notices of all meetings of shareholders also sent to all registered shareholders.
Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 17 We have audited the financial statements of Microsaic Systems plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 on pages 20
to 39. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of
the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 10, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to
audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
— give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 December 2012 and of its loss for year then
ended; and 
— have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
— have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial period for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – going concern
In forming our opinion, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 3 to the financial statements
concerning the Company’s ability to meet its future working capital needs. In view of the significance of this uncertainty
we consider that it should be drawn to your attention but our opinion is not modified in this respect. 
18 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Independent auditors’ report to the members of
Microsaic Systems plc Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if in our opinion:
— adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
— the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
— certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1. Accounting policies
The following principal accounting policies have been used consistently in the preparation of these financial
statements. 
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) as adopted by the
European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis except where financial instruments are
required to be carried at fair value under IFRS. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable from the sale of goods and services and from development contracts, net of
value added tax and trade discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods passes to the
customer, which is normally upon delivery.
Revenue from rendering services is recognised in the period in which the service is provided. 
Revenue from development contracts is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method.
Income receivable in respect of government grants is included within revenue and is recognised in the same period as
the related costs.
Segmental reporting
The Company currently has one business segment, being the research, development and commercialisation of
scientific instruments. This is undertaken wholly within the United Kingdom and therefore a segmental analysis of
turnover, profits/losses on ordinary activities before tax and net assets has not been presented. The Company is
managed on the basis of its performance as a whole and not by any segments.
Intangible assets
Trademarks and patents are stated at historic cost of registration less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost in equal annual instalments over five years, which is
considered to be a prudent estimate of their useful economic lives.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or production costs less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis to write-off the carrying
value of each asset to residual value over its estimated useful economic life as follows:
Plant and equipment – 20% to 33.3% on a straight line basis
Fixtures and fittings – 33.3% on a straight line basis
Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for its employees. Contributions are charged
to the statement of comprehensive income in the period they are payable.
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2012 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 25
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them into their present locations and
condition. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour and other direct
costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable selling
expenses.
Taxation
Current taxes are based on the results of the Company and are calculated according to local tax rules, using the tax
rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Tax receivable in respect of research and development tax credits is recognised when the decision has been taken to
claim such amounts in cash. Until such a decision is made, the potential tax benefit arising from research and
development expenditure is included in tax losses carried forward.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method for all taxable temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax is
measured using currently enacted or substantially enacted tax rates. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and that
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of
transaction, or forward contract rate, if applicable. All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive
income.
Government grants
Grants towards revenue expenditure are released to the statement of comprehensive income as the related
expenditure is incurred.
Financial instruments
The Company has adopted both IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s statement of financial position when the
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to be their carrying amount due to their short term maturity.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Financial liability and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after
deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an
accrual basis to the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method and are added to the
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 26 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments (continued)
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the value of the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Leases
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their useful
lives. Obligations under such agreements are included in liabilities net of the finance charges allocated to future
periods.
All other leases are considered operating leases, and the costs of which are expensed on a straight line basis over the
lease term. Rent free periods and other incentives are spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Research and development
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
— completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
— the Company intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
— the Company has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
— the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there is
a market for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the
asset will be used in generating such benefits;
— there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
intangible asset; and
— the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Costs incurred which do not meet the above criteria are expensed as incurred. No development costs have been
capitalised to date.
Share based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payments”, the Company reflects the economic cost of awarding shares and
share options to directors, employees and advisors by recording an expense in the statement of comprehensive
income equal to the fair value of the benefit awarded, fair value being determined by reference to option pricing
models. The expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period of the award. Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 27

3. Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that sufficient funds will be
available for the Company to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months.
The Company’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and
position are set out in the business review sections within the annual report. 
The Company has been developing its technologies for the market place and as such has been absorbing funds.
The Company is now in the early commercialisation phase of its development, and the financing of operations in
the future will be from employment of existing cash reserves, revenue from product sales and new funding. 
Although there remain uncertainties associated with both the amount of sales revenue and the availability of
additional funding, after considering these and assessing the business’s prospects, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company will have access to adequate resources to be able to continue in operational existence
for at least 12 months from the signing of this report, and consequently they continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Accounting estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on past experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates could, by
definition, differ from the actual outcome. 
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are summarised below:
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that sufficient funds will be
available for the Company to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months. More details are provided in
note 3.
Revenue recognition 
The revenue recognised from development contracts reflects management’s best estimate about the contract’s
outcome and stage of completion. The Company’s management assesses the contracts at each balance sheet date,
including the costs to completion, which are subject to estimation uncertainty. 
Amortisation of trademarks and patents 
Capitalised costs relating to trademarks and patents are amortised over their estimated useful lives. As the product
development programme is still ongoing and the lifetime of the Company’s intellectual property is difficult to
determine, the Directors have applied a prudent estimate of five years. This assumption is reviewed at each balance
sheet date and amended if required.
Share based payments 
The calculation of the share based payments expense utilises assumptions and estimates (for example volatility, future
exercise rates) which may differ from actual results. Details of the assumptions are set out in note 22.
Research and development tax credits
The Company recognises research and development tax credits receivable in cash as a current asset under the
heading corporation tax receivable. These credits are subject to acceptance by HM Revenue & Customs and the
resulting cash receipt from HM Revenue & Customs may be greater or less than this amount. 30 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
5. Revenue
Throughout 2012 the Company operated in one business segment, that of research, development and
commercialisation of scientific instruments. All of the Company’s assets are held in the UK and all of its capital
expenditure arises in the UK. The revenue of the Company for the year has been derived from its principal activity
undertaken in the United Kingdom. Although the Company’s operations are solely in the United Kingdom, some of
the Company’s revenues sourced from other geographic markets and are analysed as follows:

Programme as part of a consortium for a research project. Revenue of £315,645 has been recognised to date as the
Company believes it has fulfilled its practical and administrative obligations under this project. Final project sign-off by
the European Commission was completed in early 2013. 
In 2010 the Company was awarded a grant of up to €964,000 under the European Commission’s 7th Framework
Programme as part of a consortium for a research project. Revenue of £575,087 has been recognised to date as the

oversees the management of these risks, which are summarised below.
Liquidity risk
Until the Company becomes cash generative, it is financing its operations by raising equity funding and investing the
proceeds on a short term basis. The Company seeks to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet
foreseeable requirements and to invest cash profitably and at low risk. 
The Company holds investments in bank deposits as a liquid resource to fund its operations. The Company’s strategy
for managing cash is to maximise interest income whilst ensuring availability to match the profile of the Company’s
expenditure.
Interest rate risk
The Company does not face any significant interest rate risk as it has no borrowings.
Surplus funds are invested to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return whilst
investing funds safely.
Credit risk
The Company manages its credit risk in cash and cash equivalents by spreading surplus funds between creditworthy
financial institutions. 
The Company’s is also exposed to credit risk attributable to trade and other receivables. The maximum credit risk in
respect of the financial assets at each period end is represented by the balance outstanding on trade and other
receivables. The Company has limited exposure to credit risk, as the majority of its trade and other receivables are
due from national governmental bodies and major international corporations. 
Foreign currency risk
The Company is based in the United Kingdom and the majority of its costs are denominated in pounds sterling.
The Company has no long term commitments to purchase goods or services in foreign currencies. Purchases
denominated in foreign currency are expensed at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction, and
comprise an immaterial proportion of the Company’s total expenditure. 
The only assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies relate to trade receivables and trade payables with
overseas counterparties together with small balances of US dollar and Euro currencies to settle these liabilities. The
risks and sums involved are considered to be immaterial.
Where a significant transaction in a foreign currency is anticipated with a high degree of certainty, the Company
takes out a forward exchange contract to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuation. No such instruments were held at
31 December 2012.
Fair values
The Directors consider that there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the financial
instruments at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.
Capital management
The Company’s capital base comprises equity attributable to shareholders, particularly as represented by cash. As the
Company’s focus has been on establishing itself as a supplier of scientific instruments, the primary objective in
managing cash spend has been to achieve progress on product development and commercialisation in a cost
efficient manner and in managing liquidity risk to ensure the Company continues as a going concern.

Entitlement to attend and vote
3. Only those holders of ordinary shares of £0.0025 each in the capital of the Company (“Shares”) registered on the
Company’s register of members at 11 a.m. on 13 May 2013 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting.
Appointment of proxies
4. Members entitled to attend, speak and vote at the meeting (in accordance with Note 3 above) are entitled to appoint
one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote in their place. If you wish to appoint a proxy please use the form of
proxy enclosed with this document (the “Form of Proxy”). In the case of joint members, only one need sign the Form of
Proxy. The vote of the senior joint member will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint members.
For this purpose, seniority will be determined by the order in which the names of the members appear in the register
of members in respect of the joint shareholding. The completion and return of the Form of Proxy will not stop you
attending and voting in person at the meeting should you wish to do so. A proxy need not be a member of the
Company. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to
a different share or shares held by you. If you choose to appoint multiple proxies use a separate copy of this form
(which you may photocopy) for each proxy, and indicate after the proxy’s name the number of shares in relation to
which they are authorised to act (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of Shares held by you). Please
also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and returned
in the same envelope.
5. You can appoint the Chairman of the meeting, or any other person, as your proxy. If you wish to appoint someone
other than the Chairman, cross out the words “the Chairman of the meeting” on the Form of Proxy and insert the full
name of your appointee.
6. You can instruct your proxy how to vote on each resolution by ticking the “For” and “Against” boxes as appropriate
(or entering the number of shares which you are entitled to vote). If you wish to abstain from voting on any resolution
please tick the box which is marked “Vote Withheld”. It should be noted that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and
will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “For” and “Against” a resolution. 
If you do not indicate on the Form of Proxy how your proxy should vote, he/she can exercise his/her discretion as to
whether, and if how so how, he/she votes on each resolution, as he/she will do in respect of any other business
(including amendments to resolutions) which may properly be conducted at the meeting.
A company incorporated in England and Wales or Northern Ireland should execute the Form of Proxy under its
common seal or otherwise in accordance with Section 44 of the Companies Act 2006 or by signature on its behalf by
a duly authorised officer or attorney whose power of attorney or other authority should be enclosed with the Form of
Proxy.
Appointment of proxy using hard copy form
7. The Form of Proxy and any power of attorney (or a notarially certified copy or office copy thereof) under which it is
executed must be received by Capita Registrars at PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU, United
Kingdom at 11 a.m. on 13 May 2013 in respect of the meeting. Any Forms of Proxy received before such time will be

clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Capita Registrars at PXS, 34 Beckenham Road,
Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU, United Kingdom.
In the case of a member which is a company incorporated in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the revocation
notice must be executed under its common seal or otherwise in accordance with section 44 of the Companies Act
2006 or by signature on its behalf by an officer or attorney whose power of attorney or other authority should be
included with the revocation notice. 
If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time of the meeting or the
taking of the vote at which the proxy is used, then, subject to the paragraph directly below, your proxy will remain
valid.
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of the same Shares, the appointment received last
before the latest time for receipt of proxies will take precedence.
Completion of a Form of Proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person. If you have
appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment will be automatically terminated.

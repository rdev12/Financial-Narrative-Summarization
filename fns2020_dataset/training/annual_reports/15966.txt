Trafficmaster made very good progress in 2004, increasing revenues by 19.7% to
£36.6 million and significantly increased pre-tax profits from £0.5 million to £4.8
million. This strong financial performance was spread across the group, with over
125,000 customers now subscribing to our broad range of telematics services.
Each of our four operating divisions made good progress during 2004 with the
group achieving significant new contracts during the year . Specifically, we have
important new deals with Honda Motor Europe Limited and Transport for London
(TFL) in our traffic division, standard fit deals with Mitsubishi and Peugeot for
Smartnav and two large National account deals for our USA fleet-tracking
business, Teletrac.
Trafficmaster’s key markets have developed well in 2004. In particular, the in-car
navigation market has accelerated its growth with various new products stimulating
the development of the market. We believe that the outlook looks encouraging as
both motorists and motor manufacturers seek to make satellite navigation systems
commonplace within the car . 
2005 has brought new challenges and new prospects, however, I believe the
existing management team is well positioned to exploit the opportunities now
emerging in the various business divisions.

TRAFFICMASTER ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
Overall 2004 was a good year for Trafficmaster with strong growth in
the sales of Smartnav, our satellite navigation product, and of Fleet
Director, our USA fleet management product. We tripled the unit sales
of Smartnav and grew Fleet Director unit sales by 50%.
Our Subscription business continued to increase and recurring
subscriptions now form an important part of our business with
numbers increasing to 125,000 by the end of 2004. Recurring
subscriptions now form 31% of our revenues.  NEW CHALLENGES_NEW DIRECTIONS

Chief Executive’s Statement
Financial Results
The strategy of concentrating on
our four core areas - satellite
navigation, fleet management,
traffic information, and stolen
vehicle tracking, has resulted in
substantially improved results for
the period.
Revenues grew to £36.6 million
during the year representing an
increase of 19.7% over the 2003
figure of £30.6 million. This was
based on strong growth in
Smartnav revenues up 159%, and
Teletrac revenues up 27.6% in USA
dollars and 14.2% on a Sterling
basis. Revenues in the second half
of the year grew to £19.6 million
from £17.0 million in the first half.
Group operating profit from
continuing operations for the year
was £2.4 million, as compared with
a like for like profit of £0.5 million in
2003, after adjusting for the net
exceptional credits of £2.1m. Better
than anticipated trading in Q4
resulted in the operating profit
being ahead of the £2.2 million
referred to in our trading statement
of 17 December 2004. The supply
problem concerning Touchscreens
referred to in that statement was
resolved in December and we have
been able to meet customer
demand for this product since then. 
Profit before tax, which includes
£2.3 million relating to the discount
achieved on early settlement of the
Teletrac bonds, grew to £4.8 million
(2003: £550,000).
During the year we pre-purchased
£2.5 million of key components for
the new low cost in-vehicle unit to
secure economies of scale, as well
as investing £3.5 million in capital
expenditure and repaid the legacy
Teletrac bonds, which carried a
coupon rate of 9% at a cost of £3.5
million net of the share placing. As
a result, cash balances and short
term deposits fell to £1.4 million
from £7.3 million at December
2003. This level of investment will
not be repeated in 2005, during
which we expect to be cash
generative. 
At our forthcoming AGM we will ask
shareholders to consider
resolutions to apply for permission
to create distributable reserves by
writing off accumulated deficit
against the share premium account. Operational Results
Smartnav – 
Satellite Navigation Business
Smartnav sales tripled in 2004 to 27,600
and we ended the year with 22
manufacturers recommending the
product to their customers. Smartnav has
been fitted as standard on 11 models; this
is an important factor driving further
growth in the coming year . The Rover 75
standard fitment, whilst originally a
landmark deal for Trafficmaster, will not
now produce the results originally
envisaged in 2005 due to the
administrators being called into MG
Rover . As announced, the debt to
Trafficmaster was circa £540,000 at the
commencement of the administration.
The successful launch of the Touchscreen
product, which allows users to enter
routes via a small dashboard fitted
screen, was a significant factor in our
sales growth.
The increase in unit sales has led to an
increase in Smartnav operations and in
January we delivered over 350,000 routes
to our customers, nearly three times the
volume delivered in January 2004.
The satellite navigation market itself
developed substantially in the second half
of last year . Whilst we saw increasing
competition from hand held and PDA
based units, the growth of car based
navigation systems continued. We believe
Smartnav took a market share of over
20% of new units from a standing start
just 18 months earlier . 
We have continued to enhance the
product with numerous additional
features – Smartnav can now assist
motorists in dealing with new challenges
such as toll roads, congestion charges
and speed cameras, as well as the more
established problems like avoiding the
effects of increasing road congestion and
vehicle security. 
We continue to develop new services that
can be delivered using our platform. Over
the past six months we have been
working with Norwich Union on the
feasibility of a “Pay as You Drive”
insurance service based on the
Trafficmaster platform. This would not
only provide Trafficmaster’s Smartnav,
Trackstar and Fleetstar customers with
an attractive insurance option, but it will
also allow Norwich Union to take
advantage of the versatile Trafficmaster
platform in their “Pay as you Drive”
programme. 
During 2005, we will deliver a GPRS
version of the Smartnav product which
will enable users to get their routes more
quickly and economically, as well as
improving services to customers.
Trafficmaster also expects to benefit from
the lower data transfer costs. 
In 2005, we are aiming to add some of the
remaining car manufacturers to the list of
companies providing Smartnav to its
customers. We also expect to continue to
refine and enhance the product to provide
greater service and value to the customer . 
In order to maximise our position in the
rapidly developing navigation market we
have started to market Smartnav more
aggressively using the most cost-effective
and targeted media. In March and April,
for example, we will be advertising in
motorway service areas and car
magazines and will broadcast a
nationwide radio campaign on 
Classic FM. 
We are confident in Smartnav’s continued
growth potential. The product is well
positioned being highly differentiated from
competing navigation systems. Being an
off-board solution, its single button ease
of use and superior routing performance
provide a compelling reason to buy in
many segments of the user community
whilst the additional services that we
provide on the platform are simply not
possible using on-board systems. In
particular, we find that customers value
Trafficmaster’s speed camera warnings,
partial address searches, concierge
services, and stolen vehicle tracking
capability. 
Teletrac Inc – 
USA fleet management business
The revenue growth we saw in the first
half of 2004 continued throughout the
second half giving year on year growth 
of 27.6% in USA dollars and 14.2% 
on a sterling basis. Teletrac is now a
sizable operation with around 45,000
vehicles being monitored and over 10
million vehicle communications 
handled each day. 
The growth in revenues and profits has
occurred in all three of our operational
regions in the USA. During 2004 we
entered five new metros including Atlanta,
Las Vegas and Boston and will enter
another eleven in 2005. As well as
geographical expansion we have
increased the effectiveness of our sales
operation with our existing sales team
PAGE EIGHT
TRAFFICMASTER ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 NEW CHALLENGES_NEW DIRECTIONS
PAGE NINE
improving productivity by 30% over
2003. In addition we have also started
to see significant revenue from our
National accounts team with 350 units
at Stuart Stevenson and another for
190 units in Builder First Source.
Teletrac is positioned at the high
feature, high service end of the market.
This has enabled it to continue its sales
growth with unit sales up 50% on 2003.
At the same time, average revenue per
unit has remained steady, particularly
for the key Fleet Director product,
despite the entry of lower cost units
into the market.
As well as the improvement in sales
effectiveness, a 38% reduction in churn
and the introduction of the new
Trafficmaster “black box” into the
Teletrac market also contributed
significantly to the improvement in
margins.
Other product improvements
introduced this year include a new
customer control centre, live in-vehicle
diagnostics and a number of integrated
solutions for larger customers. 
UK Traffic Information Business
Our high quality UK traffic data
continues to be one of the cornerstones
of our business providing traffic
warnings for phone based, speech
based and car based traffic services. It
is also a unique and important part of
our Smartnav service allowing us to
provide accurate traffic impacted
routing which is superior to other
products in the market. 
Last year we began to deliver our high
quality traffic information over
RDS/TMC. This technology provides the
ability to deliver traffic information over
FM radio into conventional on-board
navigation systems. We are pleased to
announce that we will shortly be
providing a service for a premium
brand manufacturer through a contract
with Siemens VDO, and we are in the
final stages of concluding a contractual
agreement with Honda Motor Europe
Limited. We will begin delivering traffic
information to customers of these
companies in 2005 and more contracts
of this type are expected to follow 
this year . 
We continue to invest in the
development and maintenance of our
UK traffic information network, with a
view to improving the quality and scope
of the underlying data, during 2004 we
extended coverage to include the new
M6 toll road.
We have signed a deal with Transport
for London (TFL), allowing us to extend
the network extensively into London
using the data from their Congestion
Zone cameras. This will provide
Trafficmaster with improved inner
London traffic data and will provide 
TFL with Trafficmaster journey time
information for better management 
of the road network in London.
RAC Trackstar Limited – 
stolen vehicle tracking business 
RAC Trackstar continued to gain
market share during the period, with
the Trackstar Plus product. Trackstar
Plus is offered at a competitive price
and offers a “Safe Speed” speed
camera warning feature as an option
for users. This has proved attractive to
the market, with unit sales increased
by 35% over the same period last year
and gross profit up 34% on last year .
This year, Thatcham has specified a
new type of tracking device on behalf
of the motor insurance industry
designated Category 5. Trackstar will
deliver a new Category 5 product that
will start shipping in the second half of
the year . So far Category 5 devices have
not yet made an impact on the market
but as insurance companies adopt the
new standard this is likely to change in
the latter part of 2005. Trackstar is well
positioned to take advantage of the
opportunity that this industry change
may bring to the market.
Outlook
The UK navigation market and the USA
fleet tracking market continue to grow
rapidly and our new unified telematics
“black box” is now shipping in volume
in all our businesses. With the recent
contract wins across our operating
divisions, and despite the
administration of MG Rover, the
company is well positioned to continue
to deliver growth in 2005.

Directors’ Report continued
Substantial Shareholdings
As at 21 April 2005 the register maintained by the company under Section 211 of the Companies Act 1985 contains a notification to the
company that the following shareholders hold 3% or more of the issued ordinary share capital of the company:
Number of Percentage
ordinary of issued 
Shareholder shares share capital
Oppenheimer Funds Inc 10,000,000 7.42
Legal & General Group Plc 6,518,064 4.83
Standard Life Group Plc 4,857,979 3.60
Market Value of Land and Buildings
In the opinion of the directors, the market value of land and buildings in the group is not materially different to the net book value as
shown in the financial statements. Details of fixed assets are shown in note 12.
Payment of Creditors
The group does not follow any code or standard on payment practice. Its policy in relation to all its suppliers is to settle the terms of
payment at the outset of a transaction and to abide by these terms provided that it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods
or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The number of days’ billings from suppliers outstanding for the
company at 31 December 2004 was 45 (2003: 50).
Employees
The group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued its previous practice of keeping them
informed on matters affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the group. This is achieved
through formal and informal meetings.
Disabled Employees
The group recognises its social and statutory duties to employ disabled persons and pursues a policy of providing, wherever possible,
the same employment and training opportunities to disabled persons as to other employees.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the group’s policy wherever practicable to provide continuing employment under
normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career development and promotion to disabled employees wherever
appropriate.
Corporate social responsibility ("CSR")
Trafficmaster recognises its responsibilities to the environment and believes that social, ethical and environmental issues are integral
and important components of best practice in business management.  The board has identified the following risks as the most
significant in the context of CSR:
  Climate change 
  Health and safety 
  Business Ethics 
The Government’s strategy on climate change recognises that precautionary action to reduce pollution from vehicles is necessary and
has implemented a number of measures to reduce congestion with the objective, in part, of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Trafficmaster shares this objective which is at the heart of the benefits that Smartnav delivers, reducing journey times and journey
miles of our customers.
Our health and safety record continues to be good with no serious reported incidents during the year.  All our staff have received health
and safety training and we have an established structure in place for dealing with health and safety matters. PAGE FIFTEEN
The board believes that our business should be operated only through ethical policies and practices.  Our code of conduct establishes
the ethical standards that our employees are required to follow and we have established a structure to follow up any breaches in these
ethical policies.  
The board is committed to managing these risks as well as others that it has identified on an ongoing basis and developing policies to
promote best working practices in these areas
Donations
The group made no political or charitable donations during the year (2003: £nil). 
Directors’ Authority to Issue Shares
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 June 2005, the directors will seek to renew their existing authority to allot all the
unissued ordinary share capital of £1,256,981 at that time. They will also seek to renew their existing authority to allot for cash up to 5%
or £337,150 of the issued share capital otherwise than pro rata to existing shareholders.
Auditors
KPMG Audit Plc have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and in accordance with Section 385 of the Companies
Act 1985 a resolution for their reappointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The directors present their remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Remuneration Committee
The policy for directors’ remuneration is set by the board as a whole. The Remuneration Committee operates within this policy to advise
on levels of remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee of the board is responsible for ensuring that the remuneration packages provided to executive directors
are appropriate to individual levels of experience, responsibility and performance, are consistent with the company’s remuneration
policy, and are in line with the principles of good corporate governance.
The Remuneration Committee is composed entirely of the non-executive directors who have no financial interest in the group (other
than as shareholders), no personal interest in the Committee’s deliberations or decisions, and no involvement in the day-to-day
management of the group’s operations. The members of the Committee during the year were: Bill McIntosh, Sir James McKinnon
(resigned 14 June 2004), Colin Walsh (who was Chairman of the Committee), Ian Coomber and Ian Williams.
The Committee usually meets twice a year. The Chief Executive is normally invited to attend its meetings in order to make
recommendations concerning remuneration (other than his own). The Finance Director and Secretary provide secretarial support to the
Committee and external advice is obtained when necessary. The Chief Executive is not present when his own remuneration is being
discussed. During the year the Committee received material assistance on remuneration decisions from the Chief Executive.
Remuneration Policy
The company’s policy on directors’ remuneration is that its remuneration packages should be capable of attracting, rewarding and
retaining both executive and non-executive directors who have the skills, experience and expertise that will enable the company to
deliver superior levels of shareholder return.
Account is taken of the salary and total remuneration levels prevailing in comparable jobs in similar size organisations, together with
the individual performance and contribution of each of the executive directors.
The remuneration of executive directors consists of base salary, performance related bonus, benefits in kind (a car or car allowance,
medical expenses insurance, life assurance), share options and pension provision. 
All executive directors participate in a bonus scheme that is related to consolidated group revenues and profitability, however no
payments were made under this scheme during 2004. On target earnings under this scheme would have resulted in bonus payments of
approximately 10% of salary for directors other than the Chief Executive who would have received approximately 25% of salary. In
addition, directors other than the Chief Executive, had individual bonus schemes based on achieving goals specifically related to their
areas of expertise. 
Remuneration details of each director are given on page 18.
Service Contracts
Executive directors are all employed under agreements which set out their responsibilities and obligations to the company, and the
terms of their employment. All those service contracts have a twelve-month rolling notice period. Two of the executive directors are
finalising the terms of their service contracts which when completed will meet all the requirements of the Combined Code.
None of the service contracts contains any specific termination provisions.
The board notes and has reviewed the provisions of the Combined Code concerning notice periods and the ABI/NAPF joint guidelines on
service contracts. In agreeing these contracts, account has been taken of the board’s wish to retain people of high calibre.
Unless the interests of the company require otherwise (which it is anticipated will only be in exceptional circumstances), it is the board’s
intention that any future executive appointments to the board will be on the basis that notice periods will not exceed twelve months, or
if they do this will only be for a short initial term.
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will take careful account of the prevailing circumstances in awarding
compensation and will take appropriate professional advice to ensure that best practice is consistent with the parties’ contractual
rights. 
The Committee would look favourably on a request by an executive director to take up a non-executive appointment at a non-competing
company having regard to the time commitment that this would entail compared to the benefits that it could bring the company. PAGE SEVENTEEN
Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services. The executive directors determine the remuneration of the non-executive
directors.
The non-executive directors have letters of appointment, with rolling notice periods of twelve months or shorter. They are not eligible
for pension scheme membership or for contributions to their own individual pension schemes, receive no benefits in kind, and do not
participate in any profit sharing, share option or other incentive scheme with the exception of Bill McIntosh who held 300,000 share
options throughout the year.
Directors Seeking Re-election
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Ian Williams, Colin Walsh and Tony Eales are required to seek re-election at the next
annual general meeting.
Pensions
The company pays 10% of basic salary into personal pension funds set up by each of the executive directors.
Directors’ Interests in Contracts and Other Transactions with Group Companies
No director has a material interest in any contracts with any group companies other than a service contract.
Share options
The Company has operated two share option schemes for several years: an Inland Revenue approved and an unapproved scheme.
Awards under both of these schemes are made at ruling market prices at the date of grant. Awards can only be exercised if either the
growth in earnings in each of three consecutive financial years exceeds the rate of increase in the UK retail prices index by at least 1%,
or, in the case of the unapproved scheme only, the average of the growth in earnings in the second and third financial years exceeds the
earnings in the first year by a percentage which is no less than the rate of increase in the UK retail prices index plus 10%. This latter
test has been introduced by the Remuneration Committee to operate alongside the original test to take account of the fact that,
although the Company may have achieved sustained average underlying growth, this might not necessarily have satisfied the year on
year growth required by the original test. The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the adjustment produces a fairer result. 
In addition, the shareholders approved a 1998 Share Option Plan, restricted to David Martell and Bill McIntosh, at an extraordinary
general meeting of the company on 21 September 1998. Under this long-term scheme, options over 4 million ordinary shares were
granted at the ruling market price. Predetermined percentages of the options vest in years 3 through to 8 only if the share price at
those times has grown at a rate of 10% compound per annum from the date of grant. Thereafter, a predetermined percentage of vested
options can be exercised between years 6 and 10. 
All schemes are operated under the auspices of the Remuneration Committee and a total of 8,973,600 (2003: 8,055,600) options have
been awarded to a total of forty seven staff and five directors. Share option movements during the year are shown in note 19 on
page 39.

Corporate Governance
Principles of Good Governance
The group accepts the principles of good governance embodied in the Combined Code and seeks to apply them in practice, taking into
account the size of the group and its stage of development. Except as reported below, the group has complied with section 1 of the
Combined Code since its introduction. The Company is aware of the revisions made to the Combined Code for companies with years
beginning on or after 1 November 2003 and is taking steps to comply in some of those areas where it does not already do so. The group
has a small board which meets monthly, negating the need for a separate nominations committee. The appointment of any new
directors requires the prior approval of the full board on terms recommended by the Remuneration Committee. The roles of Chairman
and Chief Executive are fully split. The Chairman, Colin Walsh, is an independent non-executive director. The board has three
independent members whose interaction inside and outside the group provides a suitable forum to protect the interests of shareholders
without the need for the additional appointment of a senior independent director. 
Constitution of the Board of Directors
The board comprises 4 executive and 4 non-executive directors. It meets monthly and has a formal schedule of matters specifically
reserved to it for decision.
The board includes non-executive directors who bring strong independent judgement and considerable knowledge and experience to
the board’s deliberations. Ian Williams is a co-founder of the company and a shareholder. The remaining non-executive directors are
free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. All
directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment and to re-election at intervals of no
more than three years thereafter. All directors have direct access to the Company Secretary and are able to take independent
professional advice at the company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties.
Board Committees
The board has two main committees:
Audit Committee
This committee is chaired by Bill McIntosh, who replaced Sir James McKinnon on 16 June 2004, and comprises all non-executive
directors. It meets not less than twice a year and operates to formal terms of reference, which include the review of the annual
accounts and interim statement, compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and the adequacy of the group’s audit and
control systems.
Remuneration Committee
This committee is chaired by Colin Walsh and also comprises all non-executive directors of the company. It operates under formal
terms of reference and recommends the remuneration and amendments to the remuneration of new and existing executive directors.
Internal Control
The board is ultimately responsible for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, such a
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Following publication of guidance for directors on internal control, “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code”
(the “Turnbull” guidance), the board confirms that it has put in place an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the group, that this process was in place throughout the year and at the date of approval of the annual report
and accounts, and that this process is regularly reviewed by the board and accords with the guidance.
The group’s internal control environment is designed to accommodate the group’s dynamic nature within a young, but rapidly expanding
industry. The group’s organizational structure facilitates a regular dialogue between executive management and the group’s employees,
such that commercial challenges and potential risks are addressed at the earliest opportunity. The board is committed to a strong and
focused internal control environment, and will maintain its close monitoring of the appropriateness of its organizational structure and
its internal controls going forward. PAGE TWENTY-ONE
Review of the Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control
The board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control during the year. In particular, it has reviewed and updated the
process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks
are managed.
The review process has comprised essentially three stages:
1 Confirmation of the group’s business objectives, its strategies and the key business risks threatening the group’s objectives.
2 Identification of the key controls managing those key business risks, and an assessment of how effective those controls are.
3 Evaluation of actions required to ensure control breakdowns have been adequately addressed and the drafting of this disclosure
note. No corrective action is required at the date of approval of the accounts.
The board has clarified its objectives, including targets and financial budgets, and communicated these to line management and
functional departments. The board has considered its key risks in terms of market, financial, legal, regulatory, health and safety,
environmental and reputational categories and has assigned responsibilities for the ongoing management of these categories.
Strategies and objectives which may significantly change the risk profile of the group have full involvement of the board on
decisions taken.
Performance reward schemes aim to compensate employees in line with industry practices and to motivate and encourage high
performance. 
The integrity of financial information used for decision making is assured through a comprehensive set of controls, and the board
formally considers operational performance and forecasts on a monthly basis. Operational management groups meet weekly with
executive board members to ensure close control over performance and associated risks.
The group has embedded processes within its core operations, technological infrastructure, finance function and product development
operations to ensure risks are monitored and responded to. Weekly status reports are received by members of the executive board to
ensure risks are re-evaluated and the group can effectively respond to changes in its external environment and internal operations.
Planned corrective actions are monitored for completion.
The board has considered establishing an internal audit function and has decided that this would not be appropriate at this stage of the
group’s development. The board considers that it currently receives sufficient assurance from external advisers and regulatory bodies
on relevant areas of its risks. The board is committed to reviewing the need for internal audit on a regular basis.
Shareholder Relationships and AGM
The company takes positive steps to keep its shareholders informed of developments within the business. It arranges formal
presentations to institutional investors at least twice a year, at the time of its interim and annual results. In addition, it holds one
shareholder open day each year specifically for private investors. The company also welcomes less formal contact with shareholders at
other times of the year. The company also presents a report on the state of the business at the AGM, takes questions and answers and
complies in full with the other requirements of the code as to the use of the AGM.
Going Concern
Having reviewed the company’s existing resources and its projected budgets for year 2005, the directors are confident that the company
has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and the group at the end of the year and the profit or loss for the year then ended. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements.
The directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities. PAGE TWENTY THREE
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Trafficmaster Plc 
We have audited the financial statements on pages 24 to 44. We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report
that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the company, and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 22, this
includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices
Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and by our profession’s ethical guidance. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance statement on pages 20 and 21 reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions
of the 2003 FRC code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether
the board’s statement on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s Corporate
Governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the Corporate Governance statement and the unaudited part 
of the directors’ remuneration report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in
the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and part of
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at 31 December 2004 and
of the profit of the group for the year then ended, and 
  the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to
the group’s financial statements:
Basis of Preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost
accounting rules.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to
31 December each year. Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the
results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from
the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. 
An associate is an undertaking in which the group has a long-term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting rights,
and over which it exercises significant influence. The group’s share of the profits less losses is included in the group profit and loss
account and its interest in their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet. 
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control. The group’s
share of the profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net
assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Where a group company is party to a joint arrangement that it is not an entity, that company accounts directly for its part of the
income and expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows. Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial
statements on the same basis. 
Under Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss
account. The amount of profit or loss dealt with in the company accounts is disclosed in note 20.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill (both positive and negative) arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when FRS
10 ‘Goodwill and intangible assets’ was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition. When a subsequent disposal
occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit
or loss on disposal. 
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration and associated costs given over the fair value of
the separable net assets acquired) arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised. Positive
goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life of up to 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or
termination is calculated after charging/(crediting) the unamortised amount of any related goodwill (negative goodwill).
Licences
Acquired licences and other intangible assets which are controlled through custody or legal rights and which could be sold
separately from the rest of the business are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful
economic lives not exceeding 20 years. 
Investments
In the company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less
any impairment in value.  PAGE TWENTY-NINE
Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Depreciation is provided by the company to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal
instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Leases and leasehold improvements — Over the period of the lease 
Fixtures, fittings and computer equipment — 5 years
Motor vehicles — 4 years
Infrastructure — 7 years
Freehold buildings — 50 years
No depreciation is provided on long leasehold land. 
Infrastructure relates to a network of nationwide sensors and transmitters that gather and distribute traffic data.
Operating Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Research and Development Expenditure
Development costs on clearly defined projects, the outcome of which has been assessed with reasonable certainty, are capitalised
to the extent that their recovery can reasonably be regarded as assured and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the expected life of the product and five years. Other research and development expenditure is written off in the profit and loss
account in the year in which it is incurred.
Pension Costs
The group does not operate a pension scheme for its employees. It does, however, make contributions to the private pension
arrangements of certain employees. These arrangements are of the money purchase type, and the amount charged to profit and
loss account represents the contributions payable by the group during the financial year.
Turnover and Deferred Revenue
Turnover represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the provision of goods and services to third party
customers. The group sells certain products bundled with software upgrades and maintenance delivered over periods of up to three
years for consideration in the form of a monthly or annual subscription. Turnover reflects the fair value of the services to its
reporting date as a proportion of the total fair value of the contract. Deferred revenue represents non-refundable amounts received
in advance of the recognition of revenue in the profit and loss account. It is taken to the profit and loss account over the period of
the subscription or contract period as appropriate. 
Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Differences on
exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening investment in subsidiary companies are taken to reserves. All other foreign
exchange differences are taken to the Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for
taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by
FRS 19. Net debit balances are recognised as assets only to the extent that they are expected to be recovered.
Cash and Short-Term Deposits
Cash comprises, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts
payable on demand.

Discontinued operations in 2003 relate to the closure of the group’s operations in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. 
The companies acquired during the year did not trade since acquisition and therefore have had no impact on the post-acquisition
results. The trade of these companies was transferred into Trafficmaster Plc from the date of acquisition. PAGE THIRTY-ONE
4. Group Operating Exceptional Items
Total Total
2004 2003
(as restated)
£000 £000
Operating exceptional items:
Net release of goodwill impairment provisions (i) — (1,214)
Profit on sale of current asset investments (ii) — (1,262)
Net change in provisions against current assets and liabilities (iii) — 374
— (2,102)
All exceptional items in 2003 relate to continuing operations.
(i) During 2003 goodwill of £305,000 arising on the acquisition of the remaining 49% share of Trafficmaster Passo GmbH has been
impaired by reducing the carrying value of goodwill to nil based upon estimated net realisable value. This has been offset by a
partial release totalling £1,519,000 of the goodwill impairment charged in 2002 relating to a USA subsidiary, Teletrac Inc. This
is following an upturn in the USA market and improved funding arrangements available to this company not foreseen in the
assumptions underlying the original impairment charge, which give management greater confidence in the continuing viability
of this business.
(ii) A profit of £1,262,000 arose on the sale of listed current asset investments.
(iii) The remaining exceptional operating cost of £374,000 relates to impairments against aged current assets and legacy products
of £679,000, offset by the release of a provision of £305,000 held in relation to Trafficmaster Passo GmbH prior to the
acquisition of the remaining interest noted (i) above.
A charge of £339,000 has been recognised in cost of sales and a credit of £2,441,000 in administrative expenses.
Exceptional items in relation to joint ventures and associates
Goodwill of £928,000 relating to the group’s associate Mediamobile SA was impaired in full during 2003. The loss has been
recognised within the group’s goodwill charge relating to its share of operating loss in associate.
The group’s share of the operating losses of its joint venture, Targa Trafficmaster SpA was reduced in 2003 by £208,000 following a
renegotiation of the joint venture agreement.
5. Profit on Ordinary Activities Before Taxation
2004 2003

Tax losses totalling approximately £33,000,000 are available to carry forward against future taxable profits. The deferred tax asset of
£1,148,000 relates to trading losses which have been recognised on the basis that they are expected to be used against future
trading profits in the next twelve months.
10. Earnings Per Ordinary Share
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit attributable to the shareholders of Trafficmaster Plc for the
year ended 31 December 2004 of £5,921,000 (2003: £844,000) and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue
during the year of 133,664,735 (2003: 125,882,737).
In both, 2004 and 2003, the calculation of diluted earnings per share has been based upon the profit attributable to the
shareholders of Trafficmaster Plc, and the weighted average number of shares in issue in each year adjusted for the dilutive effect
of shares held under unexercised share options. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that all associated
performance criteria are achieved in full.

During the year the company acquired the whole of the issued share capital of Yeoman Group Plc and its subsidiaries. Details are
given in note 24.
During the year, the company’s investments in Mediamobile SA and Targa Trafficmaster SpA ceased to be accounted for as an
associate and joint venture respectively in accordance with FRS 9 “Associates and Joint Ventures” on the basis that Trafficmaster Plc
no longer exercises significant influence nor participates in the management and operating decisions of these companies. The
investments have subsequently been accounted for as trade investments. This has had no material impact on the results for the year . PAGE THIRTY-SEVEN

Deferred income relates to subscriptions received from customers in respect of future journey management services.

In 2003, the group and company did not recognise any deferred tax assets on the basis that the future economic benefit was
uncertain. The amounts unprovided in 2004 have not been recognised for the same reason. 
The deferred tax asset relating to trading losses has been recognised on the basis that the losses are expected to be used against future
trading profits in the next twelve months, the economic benefit of which will be derived after more than one year from the balance sheet
date.

24. Purchase of Subsidiary Undertaking
On 22 April 2004 the group acquired Yeoman Group Plc and its subsidiaries for a consideration, including costs, of £2,334,000. The
resultant goodwill of £1,670,000 was capitalised and will be amortised over 10 years. This represents the expected lifetime of
Yeoman Group Plc current technology. Details of the acquisition are set out below:

In the twelve months prior to acquisition, provisions of £160,000 were made for reorganisation and restructuring costs and these
are included within creditors above. 
Since acquisition, the subsidiaries have ceased to trade and consequently have had no significant impact on group cash flows.

28. Financial Instruments
The group’s principal financial instruments are borrowings for the purposes of funding operating activities. Other financial
instruments include cash at bank and short-term deposits.
The group’s policy is to finance its operations through a mixture of secured loan note borrowings, bank borrowings and cash at bank
and short-term deposits. The group does not trade in financial instruments. The main risks to arise from the group’s borrowings are
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The policies which have been applied throughout the year are set out below: PAGE FORTY-THREE
28. Financial Instruments continued
a) Interest rate risk
The group achieves efficient use of its cash balances by placing term deposits with money market institutions. Typically, such
deposits are for periods not exceeding three months and carry a fixed rate of interest. The interest rates ranged between 2.78% and
4.53% during the year.
The group had a fixed interest rate 9% secured loan note denominated in US dollars due for repayment in October 2004. This was
redeemed in January 2004 (see note 17).
The group also has a total bank facility of £5,000,000 in sterling incorporating a bank overdraft, letter of credit facility and revolving credit
facility. This facility has not been used during the year and is in place until August 2009 and is subject to prevailing variable interest rates.
b) Foreign exchange risk
Approximately 26% of the group’s net assets are in currencies linked with US dollars and are generated by a trading subsidiary in
the USA.
Exposure to foreign currency exchange risks on normal sales and purchases is minimised by trading in the foreign subsidiaries’
local currencies wherever possible. The group does not hedge its foreign currency denominated trading cash flows. The group is
exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates on the translation of profits earned by its subsidiary in the USA. These profits are
translated at average exchange rates for the year which has a smoothing effect on short-term currency movements. Exchange
differences arising from the retranslation of the group’s investment in overseas subsidiaries are dealt with as a movement on
reserves and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
29. Related Party Transactions
The group has interests in Travel News Limited and RAC Trafficmaster Telematics Limited, which are joint ventures, and Tango
Mike Limited which is a joint arrangement that is not an entity.

group entities that have been eliminated on consolidation are not reported. 
Amounts due from RAC Trafficmaster Telematics Ltd include a long-term interest free loan of £550,000 which has no fixed
repayment date. This is included within investments.
Trafficmaster Plc owns 50% of the shares in Targa Trafficmaster SpA. During the year, sales of £139,000 and purchases of £76,000
were made to and from this company. At 31 December 2004, amounts owed to Targa Trafficmaster SpA were £30,000 and this is
included within trade creditors. 
Under the terms of a consultancy agreement, former director David Martell was paid a salary totalling £23,384 from the date of his
retirement as a director on 16 September 2004 until 31 December 2004.
30. Prior Year Adjustments
The 2003 comparative financial information has been restated to correct the treatment of certain items within the profit and loss
account and cash flow statement for the year. There has been no overall impact on the total operating profit of £1,349,000 or profit
before taxation of £549,000 as reported in 2003.
Profit and loss account
The profit and loss account for 2003 has been restated to increase group operating profit by £720,000 following the reclassification
of (i) a goodwill impairment charge of £928,000 relating to an associate (see note 3) and (ii) a credit totalling £208,000 relating to
the group’s share of operating losses in joint ventures (see note 3). The adjustments were necessary to ensure that the profit and
loss account is reported in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 9, “Associates and Joint Ventures”.

PAGE FORTY-FOUR
Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements continued
30. Prior Year Adjustments continued
The reconciliation of group operating profit to net cash inflow from operating activities for 2003 has been restated to reflect the
above increase in group operating profit, to reduce the impairment of fixed assets by £928,000 and to increase the increase in
creditors by £208,000.
The above restatements have had no impact on the balance sheet or the cash flow statement.
The profit and loss account for 2003 has also been restated to reclassify sales and marketing salaries within administrative
expenses of £411,000 to selling and distribution costs. This has resulted in an increase in selling and distribution costs in 2003 of
£411,000 and a corresponding reduction in administrative expenses.
This restatement has had no impact upon the overall profit for the year, nor the balance sheet or the cash flow statement.
Balance sheet
The group balance sheet has been restated in 2003 to disclose deferred income previously recorded separately on the face of the
balance sheet to within accruals as part of creditors due within and after more than one year in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. This has resulted in an increase in creditors due within one year and a reduction in net current assets of £1,721,000, an
increase in creditors due after more than one year of £811,000 and a corresponding reduction in total deferred income of
£2,532,000. There has been no overall impact on total net assets, nor the profit and loss account or cash flow statement.
For the same reasons, the company balance sheet has been restated resulting in an increase in creditors due within one year of
£562,000 and creditors due after more than one year of £112,000, and a corresponding reduction in deferred income on the face of
the balance sheet of £674,000.
Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement has been restated to correct misstatements made in the 2003 financial statements. The original
statement showed an increase in cash in the year of £3,584,000 whereas a decrease in cash in the year of £386,000 should have
been reported. The misstatement arose from the incorrect treatment of a cash deposit of £2,000,000 made shortly before the year
end which was reported in error as an increase in cash from the management of liquid resources in the cash flow statement,
rather than as a decrease in cash due to the increase in liquid resources in the year. This resulted in a £4,000,000 overstatement of
the change in cash in the year.
In addition, the cash outflow in respect of financing reported in the cash flow statement had incorrectly included both the foreign
exchange effect of repaying loans within creditors and the movement of the bank overdraft. The cash flow has been restated to
change the £200,000 cash outflow in respect of financing in both the cash flow statement and the reconciliation of net cash flow to
movement in net debt to £170,000. This corrected a £30,000 misstatement in the movement in cash in the year.
There is no effect to the 2003 profit and loss account or balance sheet due to these misstatements. The analysis of net debt was
correctly shown in the 2003 financial statements.
The summary of changes is given in the table below.

Summary of Chairman’s statement
  MASS performed ahead of expectations
  SCS continued to grow strongly
I am pleased to announce the ﬁrst full year of results for Cohort plc 
since listing on AIM in March 2006. Cohort acquired MASS Consultants 
Limited (MASS) in August 2006 and the new business has settled in well 
and performed ahead of expectations in its ﬁrst nine months within 
the Group. Systems Consultants Services Limited (SCS) continued to 
grow strongly. Overall, Cohort has progressed well and achieved its 
ﬁnancial and strategic objectives for the year.
Key ﬁnancials
In the year ended 30 April 2007, Cohort achieved Group turnover 
of £34.4m (2006: £17.8m) representing a 93% increase on 2006. 
This included turnover of £22.1m (2006: £17.8m) from SCS representing 
organic growth of 24% and an initial contribution from MASS of £12.3m.
Group operating proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and share-based 
payments was £3.0m (2006: £1.8m). This included operating proﬁt of 
£2.3m (2006: £1.9m) from SCS representing organic growth of 19% and 
an initial contribution of £1.3m from MASS. Cohort Group overheads 
were £0.6m (2006: £0.1m). 
Proﬁt before goodwill amortisation, share-based payments, interest 
and tax was £2.9m (2006: £1.3m) after accounting for the Group’s 
share of joint venture losses and exceptional items in relation to 
venture capital activities of £128,000 (2006: £467,000).
Proﬁt after interest and before tax was £2.5m (2006: £1.4m) and proﬁt 
after tax was £2.0m (2006: £0.9m).
Basic earnings per share were 7.26p (2006: 5.47p). Normalised earnings 
per share were 8.97p (2006: 6.77p). The normalised earnings per share 
were based upon proﬁt after tax, excluding goodwill amortisation, 
share-based payments and exceptional items.
The Cohort cash balance at year end was £5.0m (2006: £5.6m), 
reﬂecting the good operating performance, net of the cash invested 
in the acquisition of MASS.

Dividends
The Group plans to pay a ﬁnal dividend of 0.9p per ordinary share 
(2006: 0.4p), making the full year dividend in respect of the year 
ended 30 April 2007 1.3p per ordinary share (2006: 0.4p). This will 
be payable on 5 September 2007 to shareholders on the register 
at 10 August 2007 subject to approval at the annual general meeting 
on 30 August 2007.
Board and personnel
On 1 May 2007, the beginning of the new ﬁnancial year, we made 
two new appointments. Rick Bounsall was appointed as Managing 
Director of SCS. Rick was formerly a senior ofﬁcer in the British Army, 
with much experience of managing complex equipment projects. 
I am pleased to welcome Rick to the Group. 
Andy Thomis, formerly Group Corporate Development Director, was 
appointed Managing Director of MASS, an appointment which had been 
vacant since the acquisition of the company. As a consequence of taking 
up this role Andy stepped down from the Cohort plc Board on 9 July 2007. 
Both he and Rick Bounsall sit on the Group Executive Committee.
Since ﬂotation Stanley Carter had fulﬁlled the role of Managing Director 
at SCS as well as being Chief Executive of Cohort and supervising the 
integration of MASS. The appointments of Rick Bounsall and Andy Thomis 
have freed Stanley to spend more time on the development of the Group, 
including by acquisition. I am also closely involved in this process.
I would like to add a warm welcome to all the employees of MASS who 
have joined the Cohort Group. It is a cliché that all businesses are people 
businesses, but one that is true in our case. I would like to thank all 
the Cohort employees for the efforts which have helped to make the 
ﬁrst full year of the Group as a listed Company a successful one.
Outlook
The Group order book at 1 May 2007 stood at £38.3m including an export 
order at MASS of £5.8m received in April 2007. SCS continues to expand 
its business, building on the demand from MOD and industry for technical 
advice which is informed by both theory and military experience.
We continue to look for acquisitions to complement the organic 
development of the business. We are also taking steps to restructure 
our remaining joint venture investments, neither of which is core 
to the Group.
Overall the Board is positive about the outlook for the continued 
progress of the Group.
Nick Prest CBE
Chairman
Overall, Cohort has progressed well and achieved its ﬁnancial and strategic 
objectives for the year.

Summary of Chief Executive’s review
  Acquisition of MASS
  Continued strong growth from SCS
  Senior appointments to subsidiary Boards
  Further investment in infrastructure
I am pleased to report that Cohort’s ﬁrst full year of trading has continued 
the successful trend of last year. The Group has been significantly 
expanded and strengthened with the acquisition of MASS and continued 
strong growth from SCS. In the year ended 30 April 2007, Cohort achieved 
Group turnover of £34.4m (2006: £17.8m) and operating proﬁt before 
goodwill amortisation and share-based payments of £3.0m (2006: £1.8m). 
MASS
Based in Cambridgeshire with an electronic warfare facility in 
Lincolnshire, MASS was founded in 1983. It is well known in the ﬁeld 
of electronic warfare, secure communications and associated specialist 
managed services. In the nine months since acquisition, MASS exceeded 
our expectations turning over £12.3m with an operating proﬁt of £1.3m, 
a very good performance. Andy Thomis was appointed as Managing 
Director of MASS on 1 May 2007. The previous post holder had retired 
on acquisition by mutual agreement; the other three executive directors 
remain in post. Employee response to the change in status of MASS and 
to the staff changes has been very positive and augurs well for the 
continuing organic growth of MASS.
A particularly important achievement during the year was the award 
to MASS of a £5.8m contract for electronic warfare operational support 
(EWOS) services to an export customer. This conﬁrms MASS’s position 
as a leading international EWOS provider and the Company continues 
to pursue further major prospects in this area. MASS continues to invest 
in the next generation of electronic warfare databases. This is a strategic 
decision by the Group to ensure its continuing critical role in support of 
the UK’s electronic warfare capability and its expanding role in overseas 
EWOS support and development work.
Good progress was made on SCA, a £9m contract to design and 
manufacture a number of airborne secure communication systems 
for the RAF . After the year-end an amendment was received increasing 
the value of the SCA contract by approximately £0.9m, extending the 
duration to 2009.
MASS continues to support OFCOM to assess radio spectrum quality in the 
UK, using our unique digital signal processing techniques and measuring 
equipment. Opportunities are being pursued to provide similar services 
to other users in the UK and overseas. 
MASS continued to perform well on its managed service contracts 
with the MOD’s Strategic Systems Integrated Project Team (IPT) and 
the Air Warfare Centre. A number of possible paths have been identiﬁed 
to grow these activities in future.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 05
SCS
SCS continued to grow strongly: turnover £22.1m, 24% above 2006, 
operating proﬁt £2.3m, 19% above 2006. Further investment has been 
made in SCS’s infrastructure to support the continued top line growth. 
This investment will continue into 2008 with an improved management 
information system for SCS. Rick Bounsall took over as Managing Director 
of SCS from me on 1 May 2007. Rick, a Royal Artillery brigadier , has held 
senior appointments in the MOD involving major equipment programmes 
for the past six years and, most recently, has led the £2.5 billion Bowman 
communications programme. 
James Campbell, formerly Head of Capability and Support Division, 
has been appointed Operations Director . The two non-executive directors, 
John Tydeman and Michael Russell have resigned in accordance with Group 
policy not to have non-executive directors on subsidiary boards. I take 
this opportunity to thank both of them for their invaluable support over 
many years. Further management changes have been made by grouping 
the former six business areas and one division into four divisions, each 
with a divisional head.
Notable contract awards won in competition during the year include: 
  Support to the Defence Infrastructure IPT and the ATLAS Consortium; 
  A key Defence Logistics IS project (JAMES) and the MOD’s 
experimental workshop NITEworks; and
  the Integration Authority and signiﬁcant training tasks for 
the Permanent Joint Headquarters as part of our ongoing 
ﬁve year contract. 
SCS has worked throughout the year with UK Land Command on numerous 
tasks as well as assisting Defence Estates and the Defence Logistic 
Organisation. Contributions to new equipment capabilities include: work 
on the Army’s proposed new medium weight armoured vehicle project 
(FRES) and follow-up work for the RAF’s Joint Combat Aircraft. 
SCS is a key member of Lockheed Martin’s Team Athena for the provision 
of the Land Environment Air Picture Programme (LEAPP), and Raytheon’s 
team on the Joint Effects Tactical Targeting System (JETTS) and is heavily 
involved in the Network Enabled Air Defence System (NEADS). 
Beyond the UK, SCS has continued to lead an industrial consortium 
contracted to NATO’s NC3 Agency and has established a growing 
reputation with the World Lottery Association as a Security and Risk 
Advisor. This includes winning a contract from a Chinese lottery for 
audit work and teaming with Sugal & Damani in their bid for the next 
UK Lottery Licence.
Organisation
The demands on Cohort’s senior management grew following ﬂotation 
and the acquisition of MASS. The appointment of new Managing Directors 
at MASS and SCS has freed me to focus more on Group matters and 
acquisitions. Organisationally, the Cohort Board will remain tight, 
overseeing a Group Executive Committee which I will chair . This comprises 
the Executive members of the Cohort Board and the Managing Directors of 
the subsidiaries.
Market
The factors in the wider defence market have changed little from those 
I reported last year , with continuing trends to integrate and consolidate. 
The demand from the MOD for impartial and independent technical 
advice remains strong. The high level of operational commitment of HM 
Forces, coupled with a natural “front-line ﬁrst” policy, continues to leave 
gaps in military technical posts in the MOD, which is already having to 
cope with reduced technical support arising from the signiﬁcant reduction 
of the scientiﬁc civil service brought about by privatisation. These factors 
have beneﬁted the Group and are expected to continue in the future.
I am conﬁdent that the wide ranging and complementary expertise 
we are building into the Cohort Group make it well positioned to 
continue to grow, both organically and through acquisition to meet 
the increasing need for independent technical advice and support.
A E Stanley Carter
Chief Executive
The wide ranging and complementary expertise we are building into 
the Cohort Group make it well positioned to continue to grow, both 
organically and through acquisition.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 06
I am pleased to include for the ﬁrst time a ﬁnancial review of the Group. 
The review is in two sections, further expanding upon the ﬁnancial results 
of the Group and explaining the ﬁnancial and operational risks faced by 
the Company and its subsidiaries.
Financial statements
The following expands upon the ﬁnancial statements and notes 
thereto, highlighting in particular signiﬁcant changes and estimates 
within the ﬁnancial statements.
Acquisition of MASS (note 25)
Completed 1 August 2006, MASS contributed nine months of results to 
the Cohort Group. The goodwill arising on the acquisition of £13.7m 
will be amortised over 20 years under UK GAAP . A charge of £515,000 was 
included in the administrative expenses of the Group for the year 
ended 30 April 2007 (2006: £nil).
The goodwill includes deferred consideration of £0.5m, provided for 
by the Group on acquisition and outstanding at 30 April 2007 (note 18). 
The deferred consideration is payable to the vendors of MASS on the 
securing of certain overseas contracts on or before 31 July 2008.
Share-based payments (note 19)
The Group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 20, share-based 
payments for the year ended 30 April 2007, for which a charge of £71,000 
(2006: £nil) was included within administrative expenses. The share-based 
payment has been calculated using the Quoted Companies Alliance 
share-based payment model, a Black-Scholes based binomial model.
The charge to the accounts was based upon a number of factors, 
two of which were subjective estimates:
i. Volatility
A rate of 20% has been used based upon the daily share price variation 
over the last 14 months since listing. The charge for the year ended 
30 April 2007 would have been £54,000 at 10% volatility and £90,000 
at 30% volatility.
ii. Leavers rate
The rate of 6.5% was based upon the experience of the Group for the 
year ended 30 April 2007.
The charge in future years will be higher due to current share options 
being in issue for a full year.
Joint ventures
The share of joint venture operating losses in the year ended 30 April 2007 
arises from the Group’s 50% share in Advanced Geospatial Solutions Ltd 
(AGS) for the whole year and 25% share in Digital Millennium Map LLP 
(DMM) for the six months ended 31 October 2006.
Looking forward, the Group will only account for its 50% share of AGS.
The reclassiﬁcation of the Group’s interest in DMM from a joint venture 
to an investment resulted in the partial write back of the Group’s share 
of accumulated losses of DMM up to 31 October 2006 as an exceptional 
gain of £113,000.
Taxation (note 8)
The Group’s tax charge for the year ended 30 April 2007 of £454,000 
(2006: £440,000) was at an effective rate of 18.5% (2006: 32.4%) of 
proﬁt before tax. This included a current year corporation tax charge 
of £449,000 (2006: £406,000), a rate of 18.3% (2006: 29.9%).
The Group’s overall tax rate was signiﬁcantly below the standard 
corporation tax rate of 30%, the majority of the rate reduction was due 
to the recognition of research and development (R&D) credits at MASS 
for the nine months ended 30 April 2007.
MASS has retained its smaller and medium sized enterprise (SME) status 
for the year to 30 April 2007, thus beneﬁting from a higher R&D tax credit 
rate. This SME status will be retained in the year ended 30 April 2008.
Group turnover
Further analysis is as follows:
 2007 2006
Turnover by customer:
Direct to UK MOD 69% 78%
Indirect to UK MOD 21% 20%
Commercial 9% 1%
NATO 1% 1%
The change in turnover mix is due to the acquisition of MASS, which 
provides IT and communications services to non-military customers, 
including OFCOM and the police.
Debtors
Group debtors, expressed as days of sales at 30 April 2007 were 
71 (2006: 87 days). This was due to a small reduction in the SCS 
debtor days from 84 to 79 and the inclusion of MASS (56 days), 
lowering the overall Group debtor days.
At SCS, the investment in a new information system during the coming 
year is expected to reduce debtor days.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 07
Approach to risk
The business risks of the Group can be summarised as follows:
i. Revenue
ii. Treasury
iii. Operations
iv. Acquisitions
i. Revenue
The Group takes a prudent approach to revenue risk, and any work done 
at risk is minimal, authorised at the appropriate level and reviewed 
on a monthly basis. The calibre of the Group’s customers and the control 
processes in respect of revenue capture and invoicing, ensures minimal 
bad debts. The 2007 bad debt charge was £nil (2006: £6,000) on a 
Group turnover of £34.4m (2006: £17.8m).
The Group also uses letters of credit and other methods of payment 
guarantee, including customer advances, especially in respect of overseas 
customers, to ensure any export debt risk is minimised. T o date, export debt 
has been mainly receivable in sterling with immaterial levels of foreign 
currency receivable.
ii. Treasury
The Group takes a very prudent approach to the management of 
its ﬁnancial instruments which are described in note 17. The Group’s cash 
is held with at least AA rated institutions and on deposits not exceeding 
one month. This ensures a very low risk to capital and a reasonable balance 
of liquidity against interest earned on cash deposits.
During the year , the Group put in place a working capital facility with 
RBS NatWest for £1.0m. This facility is available to all of the Group’s 
entities through an offset arrangement.
The Group did not utilise this facility during the year ended 30 April 2007 
with an average net funds balance of £4.4m, net funds ranging from a low 
of £2.4m to a high of £5.0m since the acquisition of MASS in August 2006.
The Group is currently considering further debt, of a structured nature, 
to potentially constitute a part of any future acquisition consideration 
in accordance with the Group’s strategy .
iii. Operations
The Group’s operational risk is primarily through its two subsidiaries. 
The individual subsidiary trading or business risks are as follows:
MASS
MASS’s primary risks are:
i.   Fixed price contracts – these are usually of a long term nature 
(greater than 12 months) and typically include delivery of hardware 
and software. These projects are managed by dedicated project 
management, monthly review by the MASS Board and regular 
interaction with the customer and key suppliers. Margin is prudently 
recognised taking account of risk and cost to complete.
ii.   Because of the nature of its niche technical skills requirement, 
MASS has a ﬁxed level of core engineering. This cost base is carefully 
monitored at budget time and by a rolling monthly forecast to identify 
any potential risk of low utilisation and thus under recovery of cost. 
  The risk is mitigated, in the short term, to a certain extent by 
the use of a small number of sub-contractor staff. In the long 
term, a programme of skills assessment and training is in place 
to ensure continued ﬂexibility of the engineering resource.
SCS
The primary cost risk is in respect of staff utilisation. This risk is 
managed by retaining a minimal core staff, essential for business support, 
development and delivering key skills to customers. The majority of 
deliverable service is provided by non-core staff (associates) where 
cost is only incurred when the associates are on task earning revenue.
SCS has a small number of ﬁxed price contracts which are managed 
by speciﬁcally tasked project management and reviewed on a monthly 
basis for ﬁnancial performance and risk to recognised margin. The 
recognised margins are prudently traded taking account of risks and 
costs to completion.
The Group (through SCS and MASS) operates a number of off-site managed 
service contracts. These contracts are long term in nature (typically ﬁve 
years at commencement) and are managed through dedicated site project 
managers. The contracts are ﬁxed price in terms of revenue and cost with 
opportunities for additional tasks enhancing volume and return. The Group 
carefully manages the partnership with its customer and supplier base in 
all these cases to ensure the customer receives value for money and skilled 
Group staff providing a dedicated, ﬂexible and responsive approach. 
The primary risk to these managed service contracts is termination which 
is mitigated by the partnering approach adopted by the Group and our close 
engagement with the customer to ensure customer requirements remain 
paramount at all times.
iv . Acquisitions
The Group’s acquisition risk is mitigated as far as practicable by 
the acquisition process being managed at the Cohort Board level, 
making use of appropriate external expertise and resources 
as and when required.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 10
The Directors submit their report and the audited ﬁnancial statements of Cohort plc for the year ended 30 April 2007.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activities of the Group are as follows: 
  Through SCS: provider of independent technical consultancy support and services, primarily, although not exclusively to the defence sector; and
  Through MASS: provider of niche secure communications hardware and software, electronic warfare software and support services 
and management of secure IT facilities and services, again primarily, although not exclusively to the defence sector.
Share capital of the Company and transactions with shareholders
The Company issued 7,337,778 ordinary shares on 1 August 2006 at £1.35 per share as part of the consideration for the acquisition of MASS. 
Of the shares issued, 6,597,037 were issued for cash and 740,741 shares were issued to the vendors of MASS.
On 25 January 2007, Nick Prest paid £750,000 to the Company in ﬁnal settlement of shares originally issued to him on 15 February 2006. This payment 
was made in accordance with the agreement made at the time of that share issue.
During the year, the Company issued 17,886 shares in order to satisfy various employee share option plans that were exercised.
Business review of the year ended 30 April 2007
On 1 August 2006, the Group completed the acquisition of MASS by acquiring 100% of MASS’s issued share capital. The Group has accounted for MASS 
as a 100% subsidiary from that date. Further details of the acquisition, including consideration are included in note 25 on page 33.
The Group’s performance was in line with expectations. The Group’s performance and future developments, including acquisition strategy 
are further explained in the Chairman’s statement (pages 2 and 3) and the Chief Executive’s review (pages 4 and 5).
Further details of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and risks, including operational risks, are included in the Finance Director’s review 
(pages 6 and 7).
The retained proﬁt of the Group after dividends charged and paid of £236,000 (2006: £159,000) was £1,770,000 (2006: £760,000). The retained 
proﬁt of the Company after dividends charged and paid of £236,000 (2006: £nil) was £733,000 (2006: loss of £5,000).
The trading performance of the Group represents the trading result of the Group’s 100% subsidiary SCS for the whole year, and its 100% 
subsidiary, MASS from 1 August 2006 less the corporate costs of the Company.
The operating result includes the Group’s share of the losses of its joint venture undertakings, 50% of Advanced Geospatial Solutions Ltd (AGS), 
(formerly SCS Mothership Ltd) for the year and 25% of Digital Millennium Map LLP (DMM) for the six months from 1 May 2006 to 31 October 2006.
On 26 November 2006, the Group, via its 100% subsidiary SCS, completed its committed investment in DMM. The additional investment of £220,000, 
bringing the total investment in DMM to £400,000 was paid as follows:
i.  £22,865 of cash
ii.  £197,135 through the transfer of the ﬁnance lease asset in respect of the camera operated by DMM.
From 1 November 2006, the Group has accounted for DMM as an investment. The Group no longer has an active participation in this partnership.
Other relationships with related parties exist and are explained in detail in note 26. The actual and committed investment in these related 
parties is fully provided for at 30 April 2007. During the year , Stanley Carter disposed of his equity interest in the Centre for Defence and 
International Security Studies. 
Going concern
On the basis of current ﬁnancial projections and facilities available to the Group, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements.

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Group is undertaking an assessment of the impact of switching from United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practise (UK GAAP) to IFRS. 
The ﬁnal conclusions will be reported in the near future.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK GAAP .
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view, in accordance with 
UK GAAP , of the state of affairs of the Group and the parent company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those 
ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the ﬁnancial statements; and
  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
They are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report includes information required by the AIM Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Cohort plc website.
The work carried out by the auditor does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditor accepts no responsibility for 
any changes that may have occurred to the information contained in the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially presented on the website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.

Payment policy
In respect of all of its suppliers, the Group’s policy is:
 to agree the terms of payment when contracting with suppliers;
 to ensure suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment; and 
 to abide by the terms of payment.
All suppliers are treated alike in terms of payment with no preference to any one supplier.
At 30 April 2007, the trade creditors of the Group represented 42 days (2006: 29 days) of purchases.
Employee involvement
The Group organises staff communications locally through its subsidiary undertakings. The media used for organised communications includes 
local intranets, in-house magazines, staff bulletins, presentations and copies of press releases. In addition, regular staff meetings are held 
and notices are published containing information about matters of interest within the Group and its subsidiaries.
Disabled people
The policy of the Group is to offer the same opportunity to disabled people as to all others in respect of recruitment and career advancement, 
provided their disability does not prevent them from carrying out their required duties. Employees who become disabled will, wherever possible, 
be retained, rehabilitated and where necessary retrained.
Donations
During the year ended 30 April 2007 the Group made charitable donations of £2,900 (2006: £1,200), mainly in respect of military and local 
charities. The Group made no political donations during the year (2006: £nil).
Auditor
The Directors, having been notiﬁed of the cessation of the partnership known as Baker Tilly, resolved that Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP be appointed 
as successor with effect from 1 April 2007, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1989, Section 26(5). Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP 
has indicated its willingness to continue in ofﬁce.
A resolution to re-appoint Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP as auditor will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. The Directors who were in ofﬁce 
on the date of approval of these ﬁnancial statements have conﬁrmed, as far as they are aware, that there is no relevant audit information of 
which the auditors are unaware. Each of the Directors have conﬁrmed that they have taken all the steps they ought to have taken as Directors 
in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that it has been communicated to the auditor.
Approved by the Board of Directors on 9 July 2007 and signed on its behalf by:

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 13
Introduction
Cohort plc is listed on AIM. The Group is neither required to comply with the 2003 FRC Combined Code (the Code) nor issue a statement of compliance 
with it. Nevertheless, the Board fully supports the principles set out in the Code and is in the process of complying wherever possible, having regard 
to the size of the Company and the resources available to it. Details are provided below of how the Company applies the Code.
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises two Executive Directors and two independent Non-executive Directors, one of whom is the Chairman. 
The Chairman (Nick Prest) has a consultancy agreement with the Company (see Remuneration Committee report) to provide services, primarily 
in respect of strategic business development and acquisition activity. This agreement allows for a minimum of 20 days’ service in any one year.
The Board considers Sir Robert Walmsley to be the senior independent Director.
The Board usually meets each month and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the Executive Directors together 
with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the Board’s responsibility for formulating, reviewing 
and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
All Directors retire by rotation and are subject to election by shareholders at intervals of no more than three years.
Board Committees
The Board has established two Committees: Audit and Remuneration, each having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Chairman and the Non-executive Director and is scheduled to meet at least twice a year. It is the Audit 
Committee’s role to provide formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the ﬁnancial reporting and internal control requirements 
of the Code, whilst maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditor of the Group. In order to comply with the requirement 
of the Code that at least one member has relevant ﬁnancial experience, the Chairman of the Board sits on the Audit Committee. 
The independent auditor liaises with the Audit Committee regarding work to be undertaken and complies with the Ethical Standards for Auditors 
issued by the Auditing Practice Board. Each year, prior to commencing its audit work, the independent auditor conﬁrms in writing the nature of 
its non-audit work on behalf of the Group and the safeguards in place to ensure its independence and objectivity.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Chairman and the Non-executive Director, and is scheduled to meet at least once a year. 
It is the Remuneration Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages 
for individual Directors.
Sir Robert Walmsley is Chairman of both the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The attendance of the Directors at Board and Committee meetings for the year ended 30 April 2007 was as follows:
      Board Audit Remuneration
Nick Prest (Chairman)      9/9 4/4 2/2
Sir Robert Walmsley (Non-executive Director)      9/9 4/4 2/2
Stanley Carter (Chief Executive)      9/9 — —
Simon Walther (Finance Director and Company Secretary)      9/9 — —
Andrew Thomis (Corporate Development Director)      9/9 — —
The Board has not established a Nominations Committee. This is not considered necessary due to the small size of the Cohort Board. The role 
of the Nominations Committee is undertaken by the Remuneration Committee and the Chief Executive.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 14
Management of the Group and its subsidiary undertakings
The management of each subsidiary undertaking and the Group has been reviewed since the acquisition of MASS. As a result of this review, new 
Managing Directors were appointed to each of SCS and MASS as referred to in the Chairman’s statement (page 3). At the same time the management 
of the Group and subsidiary undertakings was conﬁrmed as follows:
Group management
 Cohort plc Board meeting at least eight times per year.
 Group Executive Committee meeting at least four times per year , comprising Cohort plc Executive Directors and subsidiary Managing Directors.
Subsidiary management
 Monthly Executive management meetings involving subsidiary Board and senior management.
 Quarterly subsidiary Board meetings, chaired by the Cohort Chief Executive.
Cohort Executive Directors have the right to attend all subsidiary executive management and Board meetings.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and will use the Annual General Meeting to encourage 
communication with private shareholders. In addition, the Company uses the Annual Report and Accounts, interim statement and website 
(www.cohortplc.com) to provide further information to shareholders.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Each year, on behalf of the 
Board, the Audit Committee will review the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily by considering the risks potentially affecting 
the Group and from discussions with the external auditors. 
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function and the high level of Director 
review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year, reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s results, as compared against 
budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 17
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the Group proﬁt and loss account, the Group and parent company balance sheets, 
the Group cash ﬂow statement and the related notes. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and whether the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information 
given in the Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and Finance 
Director’s review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Director’s Report. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the 
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. 
This other information comprises the Corporate statement, Highlights, Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, Finance Director’s review, 
Board of Directors, Corporate governance report, Remuneration Committee report and the Notice of the Annual General Meeting. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the Group’s and parent company’s affairs as at 30 April 2007 and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended and have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
  the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 22
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. 
Accounting period
The Company has drawn up its accounts for the year ended 30 April 2007. The comparative period is from incorporation on 23 January 2006 
to 30 April 2006. The Group has likewise drawn up its accounts for the year ended 30 April 2007 with the comparatives, following adoption 
of merger accounting, drawn up for the year ended 30 April 2006.
Consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate those of Cohort plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings for the year. Subsidiaries acquired 
during the year are consolidated from the date of acquisition, using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the results of MASS are consolidated 
from 1 August 2006.
The joint ventures of the Group have been accounted for using the gross equity method.
Advanced Geospatial Solutions Ltd (AGS) has been accounted for as a joint venture for the entire year.
Digital Millennium Map LLP (DMM) has been accounted for as a joint venture for the period from 1 May 2006 to 31 October 2006. 
From 1 November 2006, DMM has been accounted for as an investment by the Group, the Group no longer having an active participation 
in the undertaking. 
The Company adopted merger accounting and presented Group results for the year ended 30 April 2006.
The Company has not presented its own proﬁt and loss account, as permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable for the provision of services, excluding Value Added Tax. In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force 40 
(Revenue recognition and service contracts), the Group recognises contract revenue as the activity progresses to reﬂect the partial performance 
of contractual obligations. In the case of long term contracts, turnover is recognised appropriate to the stage of completion when the outcome 
of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Research and development
Development expenditure is carried forward when its future recoverability can be foreseen with reasonable assurance and is amortised in line 
with sales from the related product. All research and other development costs are written off as incurred.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the beneﬁts and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against 
proﬁts on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Pension contributions
Payments are made to the Company’s stakeholder pension schemes, both deﬁned contribution schemes. Amounts are charged to the proﬁt 
and loss account as incurred.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. 
Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable proﬁts and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements that arise from the 
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a 
non-discounted basis.
Accounting policies
_0_COH_ar07_back.indd   13 23/07/2007   10:39:25 Cohort plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 23
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of FRS 20, Share-based payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 May 2006.
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expended on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Quoted Companies Alliance binomial model. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods and services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date 
for cash-settled share-based payments.
The application of FRS 20 represents a change of accounting policy. Included in the current year charge is £5,000 which relates to prior periods. 
No prior year adjustment has been made and comparative information has not been restated in respect of that amount. 
Purchased goodwill
Goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price compared with the fair value of net assets acquired is capitalised and written off evenly 
over 20 years, as in the opinion of the Directors, this represents the period over which the goodwill is effective.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Depreciation is provided on cost in annual instalments over the estimated useful life of assets which are reviewed annually. The rate of depreciation 
for equipment, ﬁxtures and ﬁttings is 20% to 50% per annum of cost on a straight line basis. 
Stock and work in progress
Stock and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of ﬁnished goods and work in progress includes overheads 
appropriate to the stage of manufacture. Net realisable value is based upon estimated selling price less further cost expected to be incurred 
to completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving items.
Long term contracts are assessed on a contract by contract basis and reﬂected in the proﬁt and loss account by recording turnover and related 
costs as contract activity progresses. Turnover is ascertained in a manner appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract, and credit taken 
for proﬁt earned to date when the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty. The amount by which turnover exceeds 
payments on account is classiﬁed as “amounts recoverable on contracts” and included in debtors; to the extent that payments on account exceed 
relevant turnover, the excess is included as a creditor. The amount of long term contracts, at cost net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, 
less provision for foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with turnover, is included within stock.
Finance lease
The Group had a ﬁnance lease asset receivable from its 25% joint venture undertaking, DMM. In this instance, where the Group acted as a lessor 
and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the related assets were transferred to the lessee, the net present value of the future 
lease payments were recognised as a debtor and the interest value was recognised over the period in which it was earned on an actuarial basis. 
The lease was settled in full during the year ended 30 April 2007 as part of the Group’s completion of its investment commitment to DMM.
Warranty provisions
Provision is made for liabilities arising in respect of expected warranty claims.
Financial instruments
Income and expenditure arising on ﬁnancial instruments are recognised on an accruals basis and credited or charged to the proﬁt and loss account 
in the ﬁnancial period to which they relate. 
The Group currently has only cash and cash equivalent ﬁnancial instruments with a maturity of less than one month. These are disclosed as cash 
at bank in the balance sheet.

The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise cash. During the year ended 30 April 2007 the ﬁnance lease asset previously held with the 25% 
owned investment of the Group, DMM was settled in full as part of the Group’s remaining commitment to its investment in DMM. The purpose

The main risk arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments is interest rate risk.

Share-based payments
The Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant. The vesting period 
is generally three years, ﬁve years in the case of some SAYE schemes. If options under the Cohort plc 2006 Share option scheme remain unexercised 
after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group 
before the options vest.

The inputs into the Quoted Companies Alliance model, a Black-Scholes based binominal model, are as follows:
        2007
Weighted average share price        £1.58
Weighted average exercise price        £1.40
Expected volatility        20%
Risk free rate        5.75%
Leavers rate        6.5% per annum
Dividend yield        0.26%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous 14 months. The leaver 
rate used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, 
and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised within administrative expenses (note 2) a cost of £71,000 (2006: £nil) relating to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions, an equivalent amount being transferred to the share option reserve (see note 20).

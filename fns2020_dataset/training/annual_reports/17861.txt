Our Vision & Strategy 
Atrium’s vision is to become the leading owner, operator and developer of food anchored shopping 
centres in Central & Eastern Europe and for the Atrium brand to become a hallmark of high quality retail 
for consumers and retailers alike.
Our portfolio is, and will continue to be, weighted towards income generating shopping centres that 
produce long term stable cash flows and are located in our core markets of Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia and Russia. Organic growth will be delivered by pro-active hands-on asset management, 
ensuring we uphold our “retail is detail” approach. Further growth will be achieved through the 
acquisition of high quality assets in our core countries and through a selected number of development 
projects, either of new shopping centres or extensions of existing properties. Our balance sheet will be 
efficient and conservatively managed with modest leverage.
Our Profile  Atrium owns a €2.2 billion portfolio of 156 primarily food anchored 
retail properties and shopping centres which produced €193.5 million of annual rental income in 2012 
from 1.2 million sqm of gross lettable area. These properties, which are located predominantly in Poland, 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia, are managed by Atrium’s internal team of retail real estate 
professionals. In addition, Atrium owns a €538.4 million development and land portfolio that offers the 
potential to create value by progressing development.
Atrium is based in Jersey, Channel Islands and is dual listed on the Vienna and NYSE Euronext Amsterdam 
Stock Exchanges under the ticker ATRS. 
Our Objectives for 2013
•	 Continue to drive the financial and operational performance of our assets while striving to constantly 
improve our offering for retailers and consumers
•	 Maintain our pursuit of appropriate investment opportunities in our core markets of Poland, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia
•	 Further improve the capital structure and efficiency of the Group’s balance sheet
•	 Continue to establish the Atrium brand and strengthen our relationships with key clients while seeking 
to work with new retailers as they expand into and across the region.  Annual Financial Report 2012

Chairman’s Statement
“Another 
year of strong 
performance”
2012 was another year of strong performance for Atrium, building on 
the momentum from 2011 to record robust growth across all of our 
key performance indicators, as well as delivering against the corporate 
objectives we identified in last year’s Annual Report.
During the year, Atrium’s management teams continued to work 
hard to maximise the income and value potential of the 156 assets 
in our income producing portfolio. There is no better illustration 
of their success than the fact that we are able to report market 
leading increases in like-for-like net rental income, which increased 
an impressive 7.3% over 2011, together with growth in operating 
margin, net cash from operating activities, portfolio valuation and 
dividend for the third year in succession. 
The consistency of our results reinforces our confidence in Atrium’s 
strategy of targeting retail centres which people visit daily for essential 
purchases and in the value of hands-on internal asset management. 
We are able to leverage our local teams’ knowledge of the market 
dynamics in their respective countries and the strength of our 
relationships with the major international and local occupiers across 
our portfolio. In many cases, these relationships have allowed us to 
grow rental income from major retail brands by working with them 
across multiple assets within our existing portfolio, as well as at our 
developments and newly acquired shopping centres.
The prevailing economic conditions have resulted in a distinct lack 
of supply of quality stock, with the result that opportunities to make 
further acquisitions of established shopping malls in our target 
markets have been scarce and thus our transaction volumes were 
lower than we would had initially hoped. However, a pick-up in 
general market activity towards the end of the year indicates the 
possibility of an increase in market liquidity and transaction volumes in 
the year ahead. During the year we were able to successfully conclude 
a number of smaller transactions by buying the outstanding stakes of 
several projects which we part owned, and we continue to actively 
seek out opportunities to grow our portfolio through acquisition 
where we identify high quality, well positioned and sensibly priced 
assets in our core markets. 
In 2012 we have also commenced our first major new development 
project, the Atrium Felicity shopping centre in Lublin, Poland, which is 
scheduled to deliver 75,000 sqm of modern retail space in early 2014. 
The project is now substantially pre-let at 84%, following strong 
leasing activity throughout the year. 
A particularly pleasing success during the year was the achievement 
of our long term goal of receiving an upgrade to an investment grade 
credit rating by both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. This is strategically 
important as it opens up potential new options for the future 
financing of growth initiatives and the further optimisation of our 
balance sheet structure. Additionally, it represents a very positive third 
party endorsement of the Company, our strategy and the consistently 
strong results delivered by the management team.
In light of the Group’s performance and as a result of the Board’s 
confidence in its ability to continue to deliver strong levels of recurring 
income, we increased our annual dividend payment from € 0.17 to 
at least € 0.20 per ordinary share, payable quarterly and commencing 
at the end of March 2013 (subject to any legal and regulatory 
requirements and restrictions of commercial viability). This increase is   Annual Financial Report 2012 7
in line with the Board’s long standing policy of sharing the Group’s 
success with our shareholders whilst maintaining a prudent ratio of 
dividend to recurring income.
In summary, in spite of the ongoing challenges facing the broader 
property and retail sectors in Europe, 2012 was another very 
successful year for Atrium. Whilst the broad macroeconomic 
environment will remain challenging, we are confident that our 
geographical focus on the stronger Central and Eastern European 
economies, our strategic approach to our portfolio and our detailed 
hands-on asset management will continue to set Atrium apart and 
yield strong results and value creation for all our shareholders.
I would like to thank all our management and employees, right across 
our business, for their hard work and dedication throughout the year; 
these excellent results would not be possible without them.
Finally, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your 
confidence in us. We do not take our responsibility to you lightly and 
will keep doing our utmost to justify your trust in the years to come.
Sincerely,
Chaim Katzman
Chairman’s Statement 8
Chief Executive’s Statement
“We are well 
placed to achieve 
our aims”
Following a very positive and transformational year in 2011, I am 
pleased to report that 2012 proved to be yet another successful year 
for Atrium.  Strong macro fundamentals in our core markets, asset 
management initiatives across our portfolio and an improved capital 
structure facilitated our ability to, once again, generate value for our 
shareholders.
Our portfolio today, which grew 5% to € 2.2 billion during 2012, is 
optimally concentrated in the most mature, stable and more centrally 
located economies in the region. Our core markets of Poland, the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia all hold A credit ratings and currently 
represent 74% of the total portfolio value. Poland, which is the 
strongest economy of the region, now accounts for 47% of portfolio 
value alone, while Russia, one of our key growth drivers, presently 
comprises 18% of our portfolio in value. The attractiveness of these 
key markets, and particularly the tier one markets and their capital 
cities, is illustrated by the fact that during 2012 yields for prime 
shopping centres hardened in Warsaw and Moscow to around 6% 
and 9%, respectively, notwithstanding that they remained flat in the 
vast majority of our other markets during that year. This once again 
underlines the appeal of these markets to investors, as does the 
proven interest of international retailers to expand within the region, 
and especially in Poland.
During 2012 Atrium maintained its market leading growth and 
excellent operational performance, which includes substantial 
improvements across all of our key performance indicators, 
notwithstanding that the year was marked by uncertain and often 
deteriorating global market conditions. One of the key drivers of this 
performance has been our ability to strengthen our relationships with 
key retail brands by leveraging the size and quality of our portfolio. 
During the year we successfully signed almost 1,000 leases, of which 
more than half were new leases. This activity resulted in our achieving 
a record 98.0% EPRA occupancy rate at year end, with an average 
lease length of 5.6 years, up from 5.0 years at the end of 2011.  
This is a real testament to the strength of our team and the 
operational platform we have created. It also gives credence to 
our strategy of building a portfolio of shopping centers which are 
anchored by retailers focusing on the everyday needs of customers.  
Our 2012 results show, once again, double digit gross and net rental 
income growth across our 156 income producing investments, 
with increases of 12.4% to € 193.5 million and 17.1% to € 181.3 
million from the previous year.  However, the most compelling and 
definitive illustration of the Group’s progress is the market leading 
like-for-like net rental income performance, which increased 7.3% 
to € 148.8 million. In simple terms, this means that Atrium has 
successfully generated an additional € 10.2 million of net rental 
income from the same properties, in spite of adverse economic 
conditions across Europe. Our operating margin improved, for the 
fourth consecutive year, to 93.7% which is a noteworthy improvement 
and one that was ahead of our internal expectations. EBITDA for 
the year, excluding the impact of valuation changes and disposals, 
increased 29.8% to € 146.0 million, whilst company adjusted EPRA 
earnings per share increasing 14% from € 0.28 to € 0.32 per share.
In 2012 there was a distinct lack of supply of quality product available 
for acquisition in the market, with potential vendors generally 
preferring to hold on to the type of income producing assets which 
Atrium typically seeks to acquire, due principally to the low interest 
rate environment and the difficulty in identifying suitable alternative   Annual Financial Report 2012 9
assets in which to reinvest the proceeds. Transaction volumes in the 
region decreased significantly year-on–year, and were largely limited 
to Poland and Russia, while even in these two markets only a limited 
number of transactions were completed. Looking ahead, we anticipate 
that Poland and Russia are likely to continue to account for the lion’s 
share of investment activity in the CEE region. Growth through the 
acquisition of established, income producing shopping centres in our 
core markets remains an important goal for the Group and will also 
allow us to further improve our weighting towards these more stable 
and mature economies referred to above.  
However, we did remain active and were able to complete a number 
of smaller acquisitions of outstanding stakes in assets that we either 
co-owned or had developed with project partners. The first such 
acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2012 when we acquired 
the remaining 23% stake held by our joint venture partner in certain 
group subsidiaries in Russia. Thereafter in June, we acquired from a 
cinema operator its share of the premises owned by it in our Russian 
shopping centres at Volgograd, Togliatti and Yekaterinburg. These two 
transactions totalled € 18.3 million.
In July, we completed the acquisition of the land plot adjacent to 
our Atrium Copernicus shopping centre in Torun, Poland, and are 
currently working on our plans for a 20,000 square meter extension 
of the centre. The first stage of this process has already begun with 
work commencing on an expansion of the car parking space in early 
2013. We will maintain our strategy of acquiring land adjacent to our 
existing assets, where available, as this will allow us to achieve growth 
by extending and improving the centres in our three core markets and 
in Russia.
Over the course of 2012, we also made significant progress in the 
construction and pre-letting of our green-field development in Lublin, 
Poland, and we are now very well placed to deliver a new modern 
75,000 sqm regional shopping centre in early 2014. In June 2012, we 
finalised the forward sale of the 19,700 sqm hypermarket premises 
to Auchan. Additionally, we have made significant progress with 
pre-leasing the remaining 55,000 sqm and, at the date of issue of this 
report, the centre is 84% pre-let following agreements signed with 
Leroy Merlin, H&M, C&A, Media Markt and others.
During the final quarter of the year, we completed the construction 
of our 5,000 sqm stand-alone retail box development at Gdynia and 
handed it over to the tenant, Media Markt, which commenced trading 
in November. We also completed the second floor of our Atrium 
Mosty shopping centre.
Going forward, we intend to remain prudent with our development 
activities, keeping it proportionate to our balance sheet and our 
appetite for risk.
During 2012, we also successfully completed the rebranding of all 
of our Polish shopping centres under the Atrium brand, providing 
both increased awareness of the Group and a highly visible mark of 
quality for customers and retailers alike.  Our medium term goal is to 
complete this exercise for our larger shopping centres and we have 
already begun this process in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia. 
Improved capital structure & achievment of investment grade 
credit rating
Having had both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch reiterate Atrium’s BB+ 
corporate credit rating during the first six months of 2012, we were 
exceptionally pleased during the second half of the year to achieve 
our long term goal of regaining an investment grade credit rating. 
This had been a strategic priority for the group executive management 
team since our first involvement with the company and it was 
especially gratifying  to see our hard work result in an upgrade to BBB- 
from Standard & Poor’s in September, followed by Fitch in October.
As I already mentioned in our third quarter 2012 report, these 
upgrades provide Atrium with the potential to have far greater access 
to the unsecured debt markets. However, the reasons cited by the 
agencies for awarding the upgrades were particularly pleasing, since 
both agencies clearly recognised the strategies that we have put in 
place in order to improve operational income, increase exposure to the 
most stable CEE economies and create a solid platform for growth.
Other notable actions taken during the year to improve our capital 
structure were the early repayment of two loans totalling € 10.6 
million, which were due to mature in October 2012.  We then made 
further progress in reducing our more expensive short term debt 
when, in May 2012, we launched a tender offer for our € 100 million 
Notes due to mature in 2013 and which bear a partly variable interest 
cost of more than 5.5% on average. The tender offer resulted in 
Atrium holding all but € 40 million of the outstanding bond. Finally, 
in November, we prepaid two additional loans totalling € 5.8 million, 
which were due to mature in 2015 and 2016. These actions were 
mildly accretive to earnings over the year. 
Atrium retains an enviable cash balance, of over € 200 million as at 
31 December 2012, and continues to have very low leverage with 
a net loan-to-value ratio of 12.1%.  Over time we do intend to 
improve our balance sheet efficiency and increase our leverage to 
between 30% and 35%. In the interim, our conservative balance 
sheet positioning affords significant competitive advantages in our 
ability to finance the Group’s growth through further acquisitions and 
development plans.
Dividend
Four quarterly dividend payments of € 0.0425 per share were paid, 
bringing the total for the year to € 0.17 per share.  Our strong trading 
fundamentals have also enabled the Board to increase the annual 
dividend in 2013 by 17.6% to at least € 0.20 per share, subject to 
any legal and regulatory requirements and restrictions of commercial 
viability.  The dividend payment is comfortably covered by earnings, 
yet still provides the Group with the necessary resources to grow.
This is the third consecutive year that the dividend has been increased 
since first being introduced in 2009.  The first payment of € 0.05 will 
be paid as a capital repayment on 28 March 2013, to the registered 
Chief Executive’s Statement 10
shareholders on the register at 22 March with an ex-date of 20 March 
2013.
Awards & community
Over the course of the year we were pleased to receive a number 
of awards both for our work as an investor in the CEE region and 
in recognition of the high quality and excellent management of our 
shopping centres. These awards underscore the considerable progress 
Atrium has made over the last three years in the region and provide 
further evidence that our efforts to position Atrium as a market 
leading retail real estate brand are gaining real traction.
Atrium was honoured to receive the “Investor of the Year” award 
at the 2011 Europa Property CEE Retail Awards for the second year 
running, as well as the Central and Eastern European Real Estate 
Quality Award (in cooperation with the Financial Times).  Most 
recently we were delighted to be named “Company of the Year” at 
the 2012 Europa Property CEE Retail Awards.
During 2012, we were proud to be a key supporter of a nationwide 
breast cancer awareness campaign in Poland, in conjunction with 
Estée Lauder which included displaying the highly symbolic Pink 
Ribbon sign across our Polish shopping centres, hosting fundraising 
events and temporarily accommodating mobile breast screening units 
at 10 of our Polish centres.
Outlook & objectives for 2013
Taking into account our strong presence in the most mature and 
stable CEE economies and encouraged by the IMF projections for the 
region, together with very positive forecasts for Russia, we remain 
confident in our ability to continue to deliver a strong performance 
going forward. We are very encouraged by the Group’s results for the 
year under review, as evidenced by the Board’s decision to increase the 
dividend once more. With that in mind we remain acutely aware of 
the current market conditions and the low growth environment that 
we must all adjust to.
Our targets for the coming year will be to continue to drive the 
financial and operational performance of our assets while striving 
to constantly improve our offering for retailers and consumers. We 
will maintain our pursuit of appropriate investment opportunities in 
our core markets of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia whilst 
further improving the capital structure and efficiency of the Group’s 
balance sheet. Finally, we will continue to establish the Atrium brand 
and strengthen our relationships with key clients while seeking to 
work with new retailers as they expand into and across the region.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that our strategy of focusing on food 
and ‘necessity goods’ anchored retail centres in the region’s strongest 
economies, coupled with our own ability to intensively manage our 
assets in order to extrapolate the maximum value whilst improving the 
offering for our tenants and the experience for consumers, will allow 
us to continue to deliver sound results.  We are well placed to achieve 
our aims and I therefore look forward to the future with a cautious 
degree of confidence and optimism.
I would also like to reiterate the Chairman’s thanks to all our staff for 
the valuable contribution they have made over the past year.
Sincerely,
 Rachel Lavine

Our Markets
Macroeconomically, 2012 was a challenging year across Europe and 
Central & Eastern Europe (“CEE”) was no exception. However, and 
despite significant differences between the performance of each country, 
CEE continued to outperform Western Europe in terms of economic 
resilience, driven, to a large extent, by strong domestic demand.
The outperformance of CEE is a testament to its macroeconomic 
fundamentals. Among the specific factors benefitting the growth of 
the region, analysts include fairly good progress on structural issues, 
higher per capita wealth levels, stronger growth in productivity and 
lower labour costs. More generally, markets have recently started 
to react positively to the commitment shown by political leaders as 
well as the European Central Bank to the Euro, and, consequently, 
investors’ confidence has started to show some improvement at the 
beginning of the year.
Our core markets – Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia- 
representing almost three quarters of  Atrium’s total portfolio value, 
all hold an “A” credit rating. Over the past three years, improving 
investor confidence in our core markets is reflected in the contraction 
of their sovereign bonds’ yields. For example, the rate for Czech 
sovereign 10-year bonds has reached 2.12% in December 2012, on 
par with Belgium’s rate of 2.10%, and both the Polish and Slovak 
rates have decreased below 4%.
Looking specifically, Poland, Slovakia and Russia are expected to 
outperform both the CEE region as a whole and the Eurozone, albeit 
even their growth has slowed compared to previous expectations. The 
Czech Republic, which is most reliant on exports to the Eurozone, is 
expected to slightly underperform the CEE average showing that even 
the most mature and traditionally strongest economies of the region 
are not immune from the impact of the Eurozone crisis coupled with a 
reduction in consumer spending.
Provisional 2012 GDP figures which were released in February by 
Eurostat showed that average GDP growth across the CEE was 1.4%, 
with Poland and Slovakia both coming in ahead of this at 2.0% 
growth and well ahead of the Eurozone which contracted by -0.6%. 
Capital Economics reported Russia’s 2012 GDP growth at 3.4% 
which, when combined with Poland at Slovakia, means that 71% 
of the Group’s gross rental income is derived from those economies 
which are the strongest in the region and are outperforming both the 
CEE and the Eurozone. Looking forward, according to the IMF, CEE 
GDP growth is expected to reach +2.4% in 2013 and +3.1% in 2014. 
More specifically to the Group, the IMF is forecasting that all three 
of our core markets- Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, will 
continue to outperform with GDP growth of 2.1%, 2.8% and 0.8% 
respectively expected in 2013, while similarly, Russia’s economy is also 
anticipated to expand by +3.8% in 2013. This optimistic outlook is in 
contrast to the Euro Area, where progress in battling the debt crisis 
is taking longer to produce an economic recovery. The IMF forecasts 
that the Eurozone GDP will contract by -0.2% in 2013 and then 
subsequently expand by +1.0% in 2014.
Another positive outcome with respect to CEE was the relatively low 
level of deleveraging of Western parent banks, who did not altogether 
withdraw their presence from the region but rather delevered on a 
general level in order to meet stricter European capital requirements. 
While credit conditions did tighten across CEE during last year, liquidity 
did not dry completely and financial stability was not threatened 
on a national level, as some had feared. Nonetheless, the external 
pressures of the weaker international economy in general and the 
downturn in Europe in particular are taking a toll on the performance 
of CEE. Our markets are affected not only by the cyclical downturn 
in core Europe (via decreasing net exports), but also by the desired 
return to budget deficits below 3% - creating a significant drag 
on domestic value added for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland 
and Slovakia. In addition, many countries were quick to implement 
tough austerity programs in response to the general downturn across 
Europe, including raising VAT (implemented in 2011-2013 in the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia). Needless to 
say, consumers’ real disposable incomes were negatively impacted as a 
result of these measures.
Although retail sales in the CEE might show milder growth this year, 
they are still expected to continue expanding, fuelling retailers’ strong 
appetite for increasing their presence in the region. In November last 
year, Colliers International reported that, despite a general stagnation 
in European retail property, international brands, discount chains and 
luxury retailers are nevertheless growing, with many looking to expand 
into CEE. Similarly CBRE‘s retailers report also indicated that Atrium’s 
core markets in terms of exposure are now ranked very high in global 
retailers‘ EMEA target list – Poland ranks 5th, Russia 10th and the 
Czech Republic in 13th position. Poland was the only country in CEE 
to make it into the top 5 and this reflects the country‘s continued 
optimistic outlook and resilient economy. Over 22% of the leading 
retailers surveyed for the report declared an intention to expand 
their store network in the Polish market in 2013, although they are 
becoming increasingly selective in their choice of locations and are 
impacted by the lack of suitable new stock coming on to the market. 
We believe that this latter point plays to our strengths both in terms of 
the relationships we have with the retailers but also with regard to the 
large range of well-tailored product we can offer them.
Income producing portfolio
At 31 December 2012 Atrium’s income producing portfolio 
comprised 156 standing investment properties with a market value of 
€ 2.2 billion. The portfolio is located in seven countries across CEE. 
Our assets have a total gross lettable area (“GLA”) of 1.2 million sqm 
and in 2012 produced a gross rental income of € 193.5 million (2011: 
€ 172.2 million). 
Operating Activities   Annual Financial Report 2012 13
Twenty eight of our assets are shopping centres, twelve of which offer 
over 30,000 sqm of GLA, while the other 16 offer between 10,000 
sqm and 30,000 sqm of GLA. The 128 remaining assets are leased 
to a variety of retailers ranging from food anchors to do-it-yourself 
(“DIY”) stores and electronics shops. The Group’s operating assets are 
anchored by supermarkets, hypermarkets or local convenience stores, 
demonstrating the resilient nature of the portfolio and its focus on 
meeting the every-day needs of consumers.
Our focus on, and dedication to, the proactive asset management 
of our investment properties is a key driver of income generation 
and value creation. The Group employs a network of experienced 
local internal management teams to ensure we maintain close and 
positive relationships with our tenants as well as to provide a vital 
insight into the local requirements and market dynamics at each of 
our assets. The benefit of this approach is reflected in the Group’s 
strong performance for the year, with market leading growth in like-
for-like rental income and was also recognized by the company being 
awarded in February 2013 the “Company of the Year” award at the 
2012 Europa Property CEE Retail Awards.
The market value of the Group’s 156 standing investments increased 
by 5.2%, or € 108 million, to € 2,185 million at year end 2012 versus 
€ 2,077 million at the same time last year. The increase comprised a 
2.8%, or € 58.5 million revaluation uplift, € 37.4 million of additions, 
€ 6.8 million of completions and € 5.3 million of currency translation 
differences due to the strengthening of the Czech Krona. The 
€ 37.4 million of additions includes € 9.3 million associated with the 
acquisition from Russian Cinema Holdings (“RCH”) of premises in the 
Group’s Volgograd, Togliatti and Yekaterinburg shopping centres in 
Russia, € 7.7 million other additions in Russia, € 11.7 million in Poland 
and € 5.2 million in the Czech Republic.

Investment activity in the Central & Eastern European retail real 
estate markets remained muted in 2012, primarily as a result of 
the economic uncertainty originating from the Euro Zone crisis. 
Nonetheless, investor demand for prime income producing assets in 
the region’s most stable countries and thus a lack of quality stock 
being brought to market remains strong and this led to modest yield 
compression, most notably in the major cities of the Group’s key 
countries of operation. Our Polish portfolio increased in value by 
2.6%, or € 25.7 million in 2012, resulting from a combination of the 
recognition of the impact of our significant value driving efforts at 
Promenada since its acquisition in May 2011, together with a slight 
yield compression and further improvements in the performance of 
our Warsaw assets. Our Russian portfolio was revalued upwards by 
11.0%, or € 37.5 million, driven largely by the higher level of rental 
income achieved as well as the impact of our restructuring activities 
at our Togliatti, Kazan and Yekaterinburg centres. Additionally the 
revaluation reflects the positive impact of the RCH transaction and 
some mild yield compression in our Moscow assets. In Slovakia, the 
portfolio was positively revalued by € 6.6 million primarily arising from 
the extension at our Atrium Optima centre in Kosice. In Hungary, the 
€ 9.6 million devaluation was primarily attributable to the weakening 
economic environment in that country, with consequential reductions 
is estimated rental values and a widening of yields.
Over the course of 2012 there was a total revaluation gain of € 58.5 
million across the entire portfolio. The primary drivers behind this 
increase in value were increased rental income (c. 60.7%) and modest 
yield compression (c. 39.3%). 
Of the total portfolio, 96.2% or € 2.1 billion by market value and 
95.6% or € 184.9 million by GRI is situated in investment grade rated 
countries.

Acquisitions and Completions
Current market conditions have resulted in a very constrained 
investment market. Our strategy remains firmly to grow through the 
acquisition of income producing shopping centres, particularly where 
we believe we can leverage our asset management expertise to create 
value, and we continue to review and actively seek opportunities in 
our core markets. Although the Group did not undertake any major 
acquisitions in 2012, we continued to acquire smaller stakes in our 
own assets and subsidiaries. These transactions have allowed the 
Group to gain increased ownership of the buildings and land. As such, 
during the third quarter we completed the acquisition from cinema 
operator RCH of its holding in three of our shopping centres in Russia 
at Volgograd, Togliatti and Yekaterinburg for a total consideration of 
€ 9.3 million. RCH has also now signed new lease agreements and will 
remain a tenant of the Group at these locations. 
During 2012 we completed and transferred to the standing 
investments portfolio phase II of Atrium Galeria Mosty in Plock and 
the construction of a 5,000 sqm retail box at Gdynia, both of which 
are in Poland. For more details please see Development activity below. 
In addition, during the year, we bought the non-controlling interests in 
development companies owning land in both Russia and Georgia. In 
Russia we bought the outstanding 23% stake for a total consideration 
of € 9.0 million and in Georgia we bought the outstanding 15% stake 
and split the land with our former venture partner.

In 2012 the 959 lease signings represent over € 40 million of annual 
rental income with an average rent of € 13.30 per square metre per 
month. These lease transactions contributed to a further improvement 
in the portfolio occupancy level and an increase in the average lease 
duration.
Lease expiries 
The percentage of lease agreements with a remaining contract term of 
more than five years is 41.4% (2011: 41.2%). These percentages are 
calculated using annualised rental income (“ARI”) which is contracted 
base rent including discounts and turnover rent as at year end 2012. 
Additionally, the lease maturities between 2013 and 2017 are very 
evenly spread. This provides the Group with a high degree of visibility 
as to likely future cash flows over the coming years.
The average lease length of the portfolio as at the end of 2012 was 
5.6 years (2011: 5.0 years).
On the basis of 2012’s ARI the expiry schedule of existing lease 
agreements are as detailed in the following table:  
Lease expiry schedule % of ARI

The Group’s lease agreements are mainly Euro denominated, which 
limits the Group’s rental income exposure to local currency fluctua-
tions. 78% of GRI in 2012 was denominated in Euros, with 11% 
denominated in Czech Kronas, 4% in US dollars, 5% in Polish Zlotys 
and 2% in other currencies. 
Tenant mix
Our management teams continually review our centres to ensure that 
they have a healthy and diversified tenant mix. Improvements are 
implemented at natural points or breaks in the leasing cycle or where 
we see an opportunity or situation arise that allows us to improve 
the tenant mix. While all of the Group’s larger shopping centres are 
anchored by a number of strong international hyper/supermarket 
brands, we also understand the importance of partnering with well 
known, fashion anchors. These partnerships drive further footfall, 
whilst meeting the needs of the end-consumer and complementing 
the other tenants in order to add long term value to an asset. Hyper/
supermarket anchors represent the largest percentage of GLA at 30% 
and fashion and apparel tenants represented 36% of annualised 
rental income in 2012.

Rental income
In 2012, GRI grew by 12.4% to € 193.5 million. Significant 
contributions to this growth came from Poland and the Czech 
Republic, principally from the acquisitions of the Atrium Promenada, 
Atrium Molo and Atrium Flóra shopping centres in 2011. In Russia 
year on year GRI grew 17.1% as a result of the higher turnover rents 
stemming from our asset management initiatives, together with rental 
indexation, the benefit of additional rental income from the RCH 
transactions, and the continued reduction in the level of temporary 
discounts previously granted to tenants. The restructuring of certain 
of our Russian centres continues and demonstrates the appetite 
of international retailers for space at the best centres and, in this 
regard, we were particularly pleased to welcome Auchan as the new 
hypermarket operator in our St. Petersburg asset during the fourth 
quarter of 2012. In Slovakia, the 4.1% increase in GRI reflects the late 
2011 opening of the 1,100 sqm extension to the Optima centre in 
Kosice and uplifts from rental indexation. Higher occupancies drove 
GRI growth in Hungary and Latvia, while in Romania rental indexation 
was the key driver behind the increase. The GRI result also takes into

Like-for-like GRI provides the clearest indication of the performance 
of the underlying portfolio and the organic growth achieved. On 
this basis, the Group delivered very strong results in 2012 with a 
5.2% increase to € 161.5 million of which the majority (76% or 
€ 6.2 million) came from Russia. Given the current market uncertainty 
and the macroeconomic slowdown referred to earlier, we are 
particularly pleased to once again report like-for-like GRI growth 
across all our territories. This is a real endorsement of both the 
portfolio’s ability to produce stable rental income returns and our 
team’s retail asset management expertise.

* To enhance comparability of NRI, prior period values for like-for-like properties have been recalculated using the 2012 exchange rates.
Like-for-like NRI followed a similar pattern as GRI but with some slight 
further uplift coming from improved service charge income and rental 
collection, reflecting good credit control.
A substantial part of the increase in like-for-like NRI came from the 
improvements in Russia and Poland in line with the higher GRI. In 
addition, Russia benefitted from improved operational efficiencies 
and more effective rental collection, which resulted in an increase of 
19.9% in like-for-like NRI.

Development and Land Portfolio
At 31 December 2012 the Atrium’s development and land portfolio was valued at € 538.4 million across 36 projects. Over 90% of the portfolio 
by value, and over 80% by size, is concentrated in Poland, Russia and Turkey. We believe that this portfolio includes significant long term future 
value creation opportunities and will continue to actively manage these projects. 
The country diversification of the Group’s development and land portfolio is presented below:
  No. of projects  Market value  Size of land
2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011

Others 7 6 40,664 56,924 54 58
Total 36 37 538,395 587,351 307 389
Over the course of the year we have continued to assess how best to 
create and realise value from the portfolio. The decision to develop a 
project is depending on its location, its size, the economic situation in 
the relevant city and country, competition and the overall risk profile. 
The decision process also involves a number of broad considerations 
such as the demand and prices realised for land sales achieved to 
date, our preference to acquire income producing properties, together 
with a cautious approach to undertaking and financing large scale 
new developments in the current economic environment. Accordingly, 
in addition to new projects, we will also seek to create value by 
developing extensions to our existing and proven assets. Finally, our 
focus is oriented towards growing our portfolio in the largest and 
strongest cities and domestic economies of our core countries.
We will continue to actively manage all of our development and land 
projects in order to build and maximise the value of the portfolio, 
whilst at the same time progressively reducing the relative proportion 
of non-income producing assets. Whilst it may take a number of years, 
our long term target is for the development pipeline to not exceed 
10% to 15% of total real estate assets. Central to achieving this goal 
will be a positive, yet cautious, approach to applying our skills in new 
development activities.
Development activity
As outlined above, our aim is to build a pipeline of future 
development projects that is proportionate to our balance sheet 
and risk appetite. The pipeline will be sourced from our existing 
development projects and land bank, as well as through the creation 
of new project opportunities, in particular extensions to our existing 
and proven assets. Presently we have eight identified priority projects, 
either with a secured building permit or for which the required 
administrative decisions might be obtained in the relatively near term; 
one of which is under active development. These developments are 
primarily focused in Poland and Russia and include a number of lower 
risk extensions to existing assets. In each case, initial feasibility studies 
have been completed and the Board has given preliminary “green 
light” approval to invest and to take the project to the next stage of 
readiness prior to definitive commitment. Such additional investment 
may include, for instance, costs associated with amending building 
permits and confirming interest from potential tenants by securing 
pre-leasing agreements. Indicatively, in the event that all eight projects 
(and no others) progressed to full development, we estimate total net 
incremental development spend of approximately € 180 million over 
the next three to five years.
Within these eight priority projects, Atrium Felicity shopping centre 
in Lublin, Poland, our first major greenfield project, with 75,000 
sqm GLA, is currently under development. Atrium Felicity has been 
the main focus of our development team’s efforts during the year. 
Construction of this new, state-of-the-art shopping centre has now 
commenced and was celebrated officially at a successful and well-
attended cornerstone ceremony on 4 October 2012.
More importantly, we have made significant and very encouraging 
progress in attracting leading international and domestic retailers 
to the centre. Having announced the forward sale of the 19,700 
sqm hypermarket premises to Auchan in the first half of the year, 
we secured a further major anchor tenant in September when we 
concluded a 12,500 sqm pre-let to international DIY chain, Leroy 
Merlin. During the second half of the year and in early 2013 we 
have attracted a number of further significant tenants that have in 
aggregate taken the average lease length to approximately six years 
and aggregate occupancy to 84%. 
These strong pre-leasing results and the compelling line-up of retail 
domestic brands, demonstrate the quality of the retail destination 
on offer and gives us real confidence that we are on track to deliver 
the dominant shopping centre in this region. The total market value 
of Atrium Felicity at 31 December 2012 was € 49.9 million and the 
incremental costs to completion are now assessed at approximately 
€ 59.6 million. 
The remaining seven identified priority projects are all extensions to 
existing income producing assets; four are located in Poland, and 
include our Atrium Copernicus and Promenada assets, while three are 
in Russia.
Development and Land Portfolio 20
During the third quarter the 6,450 sqm GLA Phase II of Atrium Galeria 
Mosty in Plock, Poland was completed, and opened in late September 
2012. Also during the second half of 2012 we finished construction 
on our stand-alone retail box in Gdynia, Poland and handed it over to 
the tenant, Media Market. Both completions were transferred to our 
standing investments portfolio during the second half of 2012.
In July, we took vacant possession of the 3.8 hectare parcel of land 
next to our Atrium Copernicus shopping centre in Torun ´, Poland. 
The demolition works were completed by the previous owner and, 
with building permits in place, we are now working on our plans for 
a 20,000 sqm extension. Our first priority at the site is to increase 
the size of the car park, which is not currently sufficient to satisfy 
existing demand for the centre, and for which the incremental costs to 
complete are assessed at € 4.0 million. By undertaking this task first, 
as well as putting in the other infrastructure required, we will be able 
to minimise disruption to shoppers and tenants at the main centre 
during the subsequent construction of the extension.

In addition to being the capital of the Czech Republic, Prague is 
also its largest city and the fourteenth-largest city in the European 
Union. The city is home to around 1.3 million people, while its greater 
metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. 
The city’s economy is highly developed, being driven by its service 
and manufacturing export sector and is widely considered as one of 
the premier business destinations in CEE. As an economic hub for the 
region, Prague’s economy accounts for more than 26 % of Czech 
GDP .
Atrium Flora was designed by Petr Franta architects and opened in 
2003. It was acquired by Atrium in 2011 for € 191 million and is 
located less than 2km from Prague’s historic city centre. Atrium Flora 
is situated in a prominent and accessible location in Vinohrady, one of 
Prague’s most desirable and affluent residential areas, which contains a 
high concentration of young professionals and international residents. 
The centre has a catchment area of approx. 590,000 inhabitants within 
a 15 minute car journey and offers ample underground parking and 
superb public transport links. Trams and bus lines stop directly in front 
of the property and it is also served by the “Flora” metro station which 
includes an entrance offering direct access to the mall. 
Atrium Flora comprises more than 120 retail units and offers 
a diversified tenant mix of fashion brands, consumer services, 
restaurants and entertainment including a seven screen Cinema City 
complex that contains the only IMAX 3D facility in the Czech Republic. 
The centre focuses on middle and higher-income customers, who are 
typical for its catchment area, and offers a wide spectrum of brands 
such as Intersport, Reserved, Bat’a, Mothercare, Esprit and Promod, 
together with more exclusive brands including Gant, Ecco, Geox, Gas, 
Guess, Max Mara, Lacoste and Alqvimia. The food anchor is Albert, a 
well-known and leading food operator in the Czech market and part 
of the Ahold Group.
Above the retail centre is 17,800 sqm GLA of Grade A office premises 
with high quality tenants including Exxon Mobile, Xerox, Danone and 
Reckitt-Benckiser.

Shopping Centre Flora  Annual Financial Report 2012 23
Since acquiring Flora in 2011, Atrium has commenced a number 
of value enhancing asset management activities. This has primarily 
focused on improving the quality of the offer within the centre by 
moving away from convenience-type retailers to more premium 
brands. As such, Atrium Flora now provides a mix of goods and 
personal services that better reflects the socio-economic make up and 
requirements of its customers and the population of its catchment 
area. The success of this strategy is evidenced by the signing of 15 
new and high quality tenants during 2012 including GAS, Geox, 
Parfois, Chantall, Butlers, and Gabor shoes. 
Atrium has also improved the customer facilities and lay-out of the 
shopping centre by introducing new concepts such as rest-zones for 
customers and through refurbishing the food-court area, both of 
which help to improve dwell times. In addition, improvements were 
made to internal signage to assist with customer navigation as well 
as the installation of new escalators which help improve customer 
circulation and drive footfall to all parts of the centre. Furthermore, 
Atrium has been able to successfully leverage the benefits of its 
retail expertise together with the economies of scale available from 
its wider portfolio and achieved a 6% reduction in the centre’s 
operational costs for 2012 as compared to the prior year. All of these 
improvements have helped to create value for shareholders.
Shopper´s opinion
(Marie, Economist)
“There are a few reasons why Atrium Flora is my favorite shopping 
centre. The mix of shops in Flora suits my wishes and needs. I 
care about having an original fashion style and Flora has never 
disappointed me in this. There are plenty of shops with high quality 
and designer clothes, many of which I can’t find anywhere else. The 
atmosphere is also very comfortable and the style of the boutiques 
and shops give it a feeling of luxury.”
Shopper´s opinion
(Michal, Sales Manager)
“I choose Flora because of its very nice cafes and restaurants, where 
I can be hold business meetings. In my free time I´m also able to buy 
my favorite wine, cheese or other specialties which are hard to find 
elsewhere and, because of the mix of brands, I´m always able to buy 
great gifts for my wife. Occasionally, I also visit the IMAX cinema with 
my family.”
Interview with Jan Suchánek
(Co-owner of the Butlers franchise)
“The Butlers store at Atrium Flora is our first in the Czech Republic. 
We picked this particular centre based on our market research and 
Atrium Flora, due to its location, size and purchasing power has 
turned out to be the right location for our pilot store. We are very 
pleased with the ongoing changes within the mall, starting with the 
brand new parking system, upgraded tenant mix and refurbished 
common areas. Our first store has fulfilled all our expectations, which 
confirms that choosing Atrium Flora was the right decision for us.”
Interview with Oldrich Spurek 
(Chief Executive Officer, Atrium Czech Republic)
“Atrium Flora is one of the most popular and fashionable 
shopping centres in Prague. Despite a number of new malls 
which have opened since Atrium Flora was completed, it still 
retains this leading position. We are proud to be able to say 
that Flora is still one of the most natural choices for new brands 
looking to break into the Prague market. The improvements 
we have made to the tenant mix demonstrate the centre’s 
potential and by reducing its operating costs, we have further 
demonstrated the value-add that Atrium’s retail expertise brings. 
The old Flora centre has now been reborn as “Atrium Flora” and 
has quickly become the jewel in the crown of Atrium’s portfolio 
in the Czech Republic.”

A store at Atrium Flora is present from the opening

in Flora due to the potential that we believe it has. We see the 
positive changes in the tenant mix and also the refurbishment 
which was highly needed.”

out rules and regulations for responsible management and guidance 
of companies listed in Austria. The Austrian Code primarily applies 
to Austrian stock market-listed companies that voluntarily undertake 
to adhere to its principles. Atrium has voluntarily submitted to the 
Austrian Code (as amended in July 2012). The Austrian Code is 
available on the website of the Austrian Working Group for Corporate 
Governance (www.corporate-governance.at) and obliges Atrium 
to either comply or explain any deviations from its applicable rules. 
Explanations for deviations are provided on page 37.
Jersey law does not contain a mandatory code of corporate 
governance but does impose general fiduciary duties and duties 
of care, diligence and skill on the Directors, who are also under a 
statutory obligation to act in good faith and in the best interest of 
Atrium. Save to the extent agreed with the Jersey Financial Services 
Commission (“JFSC”), Atrium must remain materially compliant with 
the UK Combined Code, the corporate governance code adopted by 
the UK Financial Services Authority. 
Board and management structure 
The management structure of Atrium is a one-tier Board of Directors. 
The Rules of the Austrian Code applying to the supervisory board will 
be applied to the Board of Directors, and the Rules therein applying to 
the management board will be applied to delegates of the Board of 
Directors.
Pursuant to the Atrium’s articles of association (“Articles”), at least 
half of the Directors are required to be independent in accordance 
with, and as defined in, the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 
At present, six of the ten directors are independent in accordance 
with those rules, namely Mr. Ben-Ozer, Mr. Linneman, Mr. Radford, 
Mr. Rastogi (notwithstanding his nomination to the Board by CPI CEE 
Management LLC (“Apollo”) pursuant to the Articles), Mr. Wernink 
and Mr. Wignall. 
The business of Atrium is managed by the Directors, who may exercise 
all powers of Atrium that are not required by applicable corporate 
law or the Articles to be exercised by Atrium in a general meeting 
of shareholders. The power and authority to represent Atrium in all 
transactions relating to real and personal property and all other legal 
or judicial transactions, acts and matters before all courts of law is 
vested in the Directors. 
The Directors may delegate their powers to any officers or persons 
they deem fit, for example to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) or 
the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), or to committees consisting of 
one or more Directors or to any other persons. Any such person or 
committee shall in the exercise of the delegated powers conform to 
any regulations or restrictions that may be imposed by the Directors 
from time to time. Currently, the only executive on the Board of 
Directors of Atrium is the CEO, Rachel Lavine. 
In the year ended 31 December 2012, the Board of Directors and the 
Audit Committee each met on five occasions. The Compensation and 
Nominating Committee and Special Standing Committee met on four 
and three occasions repectively.

Group executive management compensation
Under the general compensation policy of Atrium, senior management 
executives are entitled to a base salary; a performance based annual 
cash bonus and participation in Atrium’s Employee Share Option Plan 
(“ESOP”).
The ESOP provides for the grant of options to employees and Directors 
of Atrium and its subsidiaries. The Directors may amend the ESOP as 
they consider appropriate but shall not make any amendment that 
would materially prejudice the interests of existing option holders, 
except with the consent in writing of 75% of all such option holders.
The aggregate remuneration paid or payable to each member of 
the Group Executive Management team, including base salary, 
annual guaranteed bonus, allowances and benefits was: Rachel 
Lavine € 1,122,221; David Doyle € 597,288; Nils-Christian Hakert 
€ 442,710; Thomas Schoutens € 358,696 and Ewoud van Gellicum 
€ 276,800. The discretionary aspect of annual bonus awards will 
be determined by the Board in due course. In addition, David Doyle 
received a sign on bonus of € 245,000 and Nils-Christian Hakert 
received a three year retention bonus of € 250,000 in the reporting 
period. 
Corporate Governance Report  Annual Financial Report 2012 37
Atrium does not operate a pension scheme. Unless provided 
otherwise, base salaries include compensation for the waiver of 
participation in a pension scheme. 
Mrs. Lavine’s compensation as CEO consists of a fixed and variable 
component. For 2012, the fixed compensation of Mrs. Lavine was 
€ 625,000. The discretionary aspect of Mrs. Lavine’s bonus will be 
determined by the Board in due course. However, the CEO is entitled 
to an annual minimum guaranteed bonus of € 375,000. The minimum 
guaranteed bonus is included in, and is not payable in addition to, 
any annual bonus and is payable irrespective of the amount of the 
annual profits or revenues reflected in the annual financial statements 
of Atrium in any calendar year. The bonus of the CEO for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2011 was € 729,167 which was settled 
partially by the guaranteed payment of € 375,000 in cash and partially 
via the issuance of 63,274 shares at € 3.63 per share, net of tax. The 
new shares were issued on 5 April 2012 and are subject to a lock-up 
period through to 31 July 2013. Mrs. Lavine’s employment agreement 
is indefinite subject to termination by the parties.
Atrium has in place Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance in respect of the 
members of the Board of Directors, the costs of which are borne by 
Atrium.
Deviations from the Austrian corporate governance code
Where a company is subject to the company law of a country that 
is not a member of the EU or EEA and is listed on the Vienna Stock 
Exchange, as is the case with Atrium (a Jersey registered company 
with its shares listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange), the Austrian 
Code provides that the L-rules of the Austrian Code are interpreted as 
C-rules (“Comply or Explain” Rules). The following explanations are 
given in respect of deviations from L- and C-rules.
L-rule 1:  Atrium is party to a relationship agreement which grants 
certain rights (including rights to appoint Directors) to 
its substantial shareholders, Gazit and Apollo. For a 
description of these special rights please refer to part III of 
the shareholder circular of 17 September 2009 published 
on Atrium’s website www.aere.com. 
  Apollo and Gazit are granted certain rights under the 
Articles. These rights are set out in Articles 24, 25 and 29 
of the Articles, which are published on Atrium’s website 
www.aere.com. 
L-rule 3:  Pursuant to an official statement of the Austrian Takeover 
Commission of 31 March 2009, the Austrian Takeover Act 
is not applicable to Atrium as of the date of the official 
statement. Accordingly, and in particular, the pricing rules 
regarding a mandatory offer as set forth under section 26 
of the Austrian Takeover Act do not apply to Atrium.
  There are no mandatory takeover offer provisions under 
Jersey or Dutch law applicable to Atrium. 
  Finally, pursuant to the Articles, a mandatory cash offer 
is required to be made to all Atrium shareholders if any 
person other than Apollo and Gazit (or any person with 
whom either of those parties act in concert) acquires 30% 
or more of the voting rights or, if already holding between 
30% and 50% of the voting rights, acquires additional 
voting rights. Any such offer must be conditional only 
upon the offeror having received such acceptances as will 
give him 50% of the voting rights. The offer must be in 
cash (or accompanied by a cash alternative) at not less 
than the highest price paid by the offeror during the offer 
period and within 12 months prior to its commencement. 
See Article 42 of the Articles, which are published on 
Atrium’s website www.aere.com. 
L-rule 4:  The Articles provide for a notice period of at least 14 
clear days regarding all general meetings, as permitted by 
Jersey law.
L-rule 8:  Atrium is required to comply with Jersey law. Under Jersey 
law there is no limit on the number of shares that can 
be repurchased so long as at least one share remains in 
issue. Shareholders’ approval is required by way of special 
resolution (66% majority of those voting) to sanction such 
repurchases. Where shares are purchased off market, 
they must be purchased pursuant to a contract approved 
in advance by an ordinary resolution of shareholders 
(in relation to which the holders of the shares to be 
purchased do not have the right to vote those shares). 
Where shares are bought on market, authority can be 
granted by the shareholders to Atrium to permit it to 
purchase shares for a period of 18 months from the 
giving of the authority.
C-rule 12:   In 2012, the materials and documents required for Board 
of Directors meetings were in all circumstances distributed 
at least 4 days before the respective meetings.
C-rule 27:  We refer to the explanation given in respect of C-rule 30 
below. The arrangement with the CEO does not contain a 
provision whereby Atrium can reclaim bonuses paid, nor 
does it contain a maximum limit (either as an amount or 
as a percentage of the fixed remuneration component).
C-rule 27a:  In the case of termination by Atrium (other than for 
cause), the CEO is entitled to receive and benefit from the 
salary, bonuses and vesting of options from the effective 
date of termination of her employment until the expiry 
of her employment agreement. This applies irrespective 
of whether there are two or more years until the expiry 
of the relevant employment agreement. Note that CEO’s 
current employment agreement is indefinite.
Corporate Governance Report
010_c107857.indd   37 12/03/2013   23:11 38
C-rule 43:  In 2012, the Chairman of the Compensation and 
Nominating Committee was not the same person as the 
Chairman of the Board of Directors. 
L-rule 52:  Rachel Lavine has been Chief Executive Officer and 
a member of the Board of Directors since August 
2008. Additionally, a number of women hold senior 
management positions in the Group. Atrium does not, 
however, currently take any specific measures to promote 
women to the Board of Directors and to top management 
positions.
C-rule 53:  In accordance with the Articles and as stated in the 
prospectus for the listing of Atrium’s shares on the Official 
Market of the Vienna Stock Exchange and on Euronext 
Amsterdam dated 10 August 2009, at least half of the 
Directors are independent in accordance with, and as 
defined in, the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 
L-rule 56:  Atrium applies this rule to its independent Directors only. 
Atrium believes that non-independent Directors should 
be allowed to assume more than eight mandates because 
they may be required by their employers or principals to 
serve on multiple boards. 
C-rule 58:  Atrium has not appointed a vice-Chairman, as it is not 
required to do so pursuant to Jersey law.
C-rule 28:  In 2009, Atrium established the ESOP , under which 
the Board of Directors can grant share options to key 
employees and directors. The ESOP was approved by the 
shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held 
on 6 April 2009. Options under the ESOP are granted 
unconditionally; no performance criteria apply at grant 
or at exercise. Generally, one-third of the options granted 
vest after one year following the grant date, another 
one-third vest after two years following the grant date 
and the final one-third vest after three years following 
the grant date. Subject to the terms of the ESOP , option 
holders are entitled to exercise their options upon 
vesting. Details of share option awards to executive 
management are provided on page 36. Whilst there is 
no specific predetermined level set as to the appropriate 
volume of shares each Group executive management 
member should hold as a personal investment, the 
Board of Directors considers that the Group executive 
managements’ share options do provide adequate equity 
incentivisation and alignment of interest with other 
shareholders. The Directors may amend the ESOP as they 
consider appropriate, provided that they shall not make 
any amendment that would materially prejudice the 
interests of existing option holders, other than with the 
consent in writing of a majority of 75% of all such option 
holders. 
C-rule 30:  The Board of Directors has determined, for the purposes 
of approving the remuneration of the CEO, that individual 
and selective performance criteria were inappropriate 
to measuring her performance in the year under review. 
The Board of Directors considers that the overall CEO’s 
performance and achievements in the context of the 
challenges faced in carrying out her role justify payment 
of the bonus component of the CEO’s compensation 
package. 
 C-rule 39:  As set out in the Articles, Atrium has adopted the 
test of independence set out in the rules of the New 
York Stock Exchange for the purposes of assessing the 
independence of its Directors. In accordance with those 
rules and irrespective of his nomination by Apollo, the 
Board of Directors has determined that Dipak Rastogi 
is an independent director. Accordingly, a majority of 
the members of the Compensation and Nominating 
Committee are independent, as defined in the rules 
of the New York Stock Exchange. Those individuals 
appointed to the Compensation and Nominating 
Committee are those Directors who are regarded by 
the Board of Directors as best equipped (including as 
a consequence of prior experience and/or expertise) to 
contribute to the deliberations of the Compensation and 
Nominating Committee and, accordingly, Atrium believes 
that the current composition of the Compensation and 
Nominating Committee is in the best interests of Atrium.

Directors’ Report 
The Directors submit their report and the audited consolidated 
financial statements of Atrium European Real Estate Limited 
(“Atrium”) and its subsidiaries (together with Atrium, the “Group”) 
for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Incorporation
Atrium was incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands, on 8 December 
1997.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group is the ownership, management and 
development of commercial real estate in the retail sector. The Group 
primarily operates in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, 
Hungary and Romania. 
Results
The results for the year are shown in the consolidated income 
statement on page 44. 
Dividend
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the directors had approved a 
dividend policy of €  0.17 per ordinary share amounting to a total of 
€  63.4 million, declared and paid quarterly (2011: €  52.2 million). 
In November 2012, the Board approved an increase in the dividend 
policy from €  0.17 to at least €  0.20 per ordinary share per annum 
(subject to any legal regulatory requirements and restrictions of 
commercial viability), to be declared and paid quarterly. 
Directors
Atrium’s directors who served during the year under review and as of 
the date of approving these financial statements are listed on page 31 
in the Corporate Governance Report.
Company secretary
Aztec Financial Services (Jersey) Limited is the Secretary and 
Administrator of Atrium. Atrium has not concluded any agreements 
with Aztec Financial Services (Jersey) Limited except for the 
agreements in connection with the above mentioned services, use 
of their address for the registered office of Atrium and agreements 
with Simon Radford, director of both Aztec Financial Services (Jersey) 
Limited and of Atrium. Aztec Financial Services (Jersey) Limited held 
one share of Atrium as at 31 December 2012, see note 2.16 of the 
financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards. The Directors have decided to use International Financial 
Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU. Company law requires 
the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year 
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Atrium and 
of the profit or loss of Atrium for that year. During the preparation of 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
•	prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that Atrium will continue as a going 
concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of Atrium and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of Atrium and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.

The consolidated financial statements of Atrium as at and for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 comprise Atrium and its subsidiaries (the 
“Group”) and its interest in associates.
The principal activity of the Group is the ownership, management and 
development of commercial real estate in the retail sector. 
The Group primarily operates in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Russia, Hungary and Romania.
2.2 Basis of preparation 
Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(“IASB”), as endorsed by the European Union (“EU”). 
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the following material items in the statement of 
financial position: 
•	Standing investments and developments and land (“investment 
property”) are measured at fair value; and
•	Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Functional and presentation currency
These financial statements are presented in euro (“€”), which is 
considered by the Group’s management to be the appropriate 
presentation currency due to the fact that the majority of the 
transactions of the Group are denominated in or based on this 
currency. All financial information presented in euro has been rounded 
to the nearest thousand, unless stated otherwise.
The individual financial statements of each of the Group entities use 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates as its functional currency. The currency in which the entity 
generates rental income is the primary driver for determining the 
functional currency of that entity, but other cash flows are also taken 
into account.
The euro has been determined to be the functional currency for the 
Group companies in Jersey, Poland, the Czech Republic (except certain 
subsidiaries, which have CZK as their functional currency), Slovakia, 
Russia, Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Georgia and 
Ukraine and also for the intermediate holding companies in Cyprus, 
Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden and The Netherlands. 
Certain subsidiaries in Cyprus have USD as their functional currency. 
As of 1 January 2011, the functional currency for the Russian entities 
owning developments and land, an entity in Georgia as well as all 
the Ukrainian entities was determined to be the euro. The main 
triggers which were applied to determine the euro as the functional 
currency were the financing currency, the functional currency of the 
parent company, the dependency of those entities on the parent 
company and the assessment of whether cash flows from the activities 
of those entities are sufficient to service existing and anticipated 
debt obligations without funds being made available by the parent 
company. 
Once the investment properties are rented out, the functional currency 
of the entity may be changed based on the currency in which rents are 
determined or to which rents are bound and taking into account other 
cash flows. 
Amendments to and interpretations of existing standards 
effective in the current period
The Group has adopted the following amended IFRSs during 2012:
•	IAS 12 (Amendments, December 2010) Deferred Tax: Recovery of 
Underlying Assets. In December 2010 the IASB issued the 
Amendments to IAS 12 with an effective date of 1 January 2012. 
The amendment provides an exception to the measurement 
principle in respect of investment property measured using the fair 
value model. Under the exception, the measurement of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities is based on a rebuttable presumption that the 
carrying amount of the investment property will be recovered 
entirely through sale. The amendment did not have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
•	IAS 1 (Amendments, June 2011) Presentation of Items of Other 
Comprehensive Income requires items that will never be recognised 
in income statement to be presented separately in other 
comprehensive income from those that are subject to subsequent 
reclassification. The amendments only affected disclosure and did 
not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
Atrium has early adopted these amendments, as the amendments 
are effective for the periods beginning after 1 July 2012. 
New standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing 
standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted 
by the Group early
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have 
been published and are mandatory for the annual accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
•	IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements which replaces SIC-12 
Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities and the consolidation 
elements of the existing IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements. The new standard adopts a single definition of control: 
a reporting entity controls another entity when the reporting entity 
Notes to the Financial Statements 48
has the power to direct the activities of that other entity to generate 
returns for the reporting entity. The standard will not have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
•	IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements which supersedes IAS 31 Interests in 
Joint Ventures (2011). IFRS 11 distinguishes between joint 
operations and joint ventures. A joint operation is a joint 
arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the 
liabilities, relating to the arrangement. An entity holding a joint 
operation will recognise its share in the assets, the liabilities, 
revenues and costs. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby 
the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to 
the net assets of the arrangement. An entity holding a joint venture 
will represent its investment in it using the equity method in 
accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
(2011). The standard will not have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
•	IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities covers disclosures for 
entities reporting under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replacing those in IAS 28 
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) and IAS 27 
Separate Financial Statements (2011). Entities are required to 
disclose information that helps financial statement readers evaluate 
the nature, risks and financial effects associated with an entity’s 
interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements and in 
unconsolidated structured entities. The standard only affects 
disclosure and will not have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
•	IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement which sets out a single IFRS 
framework for defining and measuring fair value and requiring 
disclosures about fair value measurements. IFRS 13 defines fair value 
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. IFRS 13 determines that an 
entity shall use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the 
circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure 
fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs. It does not require fair 
value measurements in addition to those already required or 
permitted by other IFRSs and is not intended to establish valuation 
standards or affect valuation practices outside financial reporting. 
The standard only affects disclosure and will not have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
•	IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011) comprises those parts 
of the existing IAS 27 (2008) that dealt with separate financial 
statements. IAS 27 (2011) supersedes IAS 27 (2008). IAS 27 (2011) 
carries forward the existing accounting and disclosure requirements 
for separate financial statements, with some minor clarification. The 
standard will not have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements.
•	IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) covers 
joint ventures as well as associates; both must be accounted for 
using the equity method. The mechanics of the equity method are 
unchanged. The standard will not have a material impact on the 
Group’s financial statements.
•	IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IFRS 12 (Amendments, June 2012) Transition 
Guidance. The amendments explain that the date of initial 
application in IFRS 10 means the beginning of the annual reporting 
period in which IFRS 10 is applied for the first time. Consequently, 
an entity is not required to make adjustments to the previous 
accounting for its involvement with entities if the consolidation 
conclusion reached at the date of initial application is the same 
when applying IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements and SIC-12 Consolidation-Special Purpose Entities and 
when applying IFRS 10. The amendments also provide transition 
relief by limiting the requirement to present adjusted comparative 
information to the period immediately preceding the date of initial 
application (the immediately preceding period) if the consolidation 
conclusion is different. Presentation of adjusted comparatives for 
earlier periods is permitted but not required. The Board has also 
amended IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of 
Interests in Other Entities to provide similar relief from the 
presentation or adjustment of comparative information for periods 
prior to the immediately preceding period. IFRS 12 is further 
amended to provide additional transition relief by eliminating the 
requirement to present comparatives for the disclosures relating to 
unconsolidated structured entities for any period before the first 
annual period for which IFRS 12 is applied. The amendments will 
not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
•	Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011(May 2012), addressed 
the following amendments: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial 
Statements – clarification of the requirements for comparative 
information, IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – tax effect 
on distributions to holders of equity instruments and IAS 34 Interim 
Financial Reporting – interim financial reporting and segment 
information for total assets and liabilities. Entities are required to 
apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013. The amendments will not have a material impact 
on the Group’s financial statements.
•	IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. In November 2009, the IASB issued 
IFRS 9, as a first step in its project to replace IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (the standard is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 
but may be applied earlier). IFRS 9 (2009) retains but simplifies the 
mixed measurement model and establishes two primary 
measurement categories for financial assets: amortised at cost and 
fair value. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business 
model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial 
asset. The guidance in IAS 39 on impairment of financial assets and 
hedge accounting continues to apply. The Group is currently 
reviewing the standard to determine its effect on the Group’s 
financial reporting.
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Financial Report 2012 49
•	IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Amendments, October 2010) adds the 
requirements related to classification and measurement of financial 
liabilities, and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities to the 
version issued in November 2009. It also includes those paragraphs 
of IAS 39 dealing with how to measure fair value and accounting 
for derivatives embedded in a contract that contains a host that is 
not a financial asset, as well as the requirements of IFRIC 9 
Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives. Entities are required to 
apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2015. The Group is currently reviewing the standard to 
determine its effect on the Group’s financial reporting.
•	IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets 
and Financial Liabilities (Amendments, December 2011), amends the 
required disclosures to include information that will enable users of 
an entity’s financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential 
effect of netting arrangements, including rights of set-off associated 
with the entity’s recognised financial assets and recognised financial 
liabilities, on the entity’s financial position. Entities are required to 
apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2015. The Group is currently reviewing the standard to 
determine its effect on the Group’s financial reporting. 
•	IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation-Offsetting Financial 
Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments, December 2011), 
deleted paragraph AG38 and added paragraphs AG38A–AG38F. An 
entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2014. An entity shall apply those amendments 
retrospectively. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies 
those amendments from an earlier date, it shall disclose that fact 
and shall also make the disclosures required by Disclosures-
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to 
IFRS 7) issued in December 2011. The Group is currently reviewing 
the standard to determine its effect on the Group’s financial 
reporting.
Use of judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and associated assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. 
In particular, significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and 
critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements relate to standing investments (note 2.4), developments 
and land (note 2.5), goodwill (note 2.7), deferred taxes ( notes 2.9 
and note 2.20), derivatives (note 2.19) and contingencies (note 2.41). 
2.3 Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently 
for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, 
except for newly effective standards as described above and have 
been applied consistently by entities within the Group.
Certain comparative amounts in the consolidated statement of 
financial position have been reclassified to conform with the current 
year’s presentation (see note 2.7 Intangible assets and goodwill).
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all those entities controlled by Atrium. Control exists 
when Atrium has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to 
bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the Group. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Full consolidation requires a combination of the financial statements 
of Atrium and its subsidiaries line by line by adding together like 
items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Further steps 
in accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statement are performed in order that the consolidated financial 
statements present financial information about the Group as that of a 
single economic entity.
Loss of control
On the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and 
liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other 
components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit 
arising on the loss of control is recognised in the income statement. 
If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then 
such interest is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. 
Subsequently that retained interest is accounted for using the equity 
method if significant influence is retained.

Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant 
influence but not control, generally through a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates 
are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised 
at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The 
Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. The cumulative 
post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount 
of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate 
equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other 
unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless it has incurred obligations to or made payments on behalf of 
the associate. 
Non-controlling interest
Non-controlling interest consists of the amount of those interests at 
the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling 
share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. 
Non-controlling interests at initial recognition are measured at their 
proportionate interest in all net assets of the subsidiary including 
recognised goodwill. 
Non-controlling interest is presented in the consolidated statement 
of financial position within equity, separately from the equity of 
the owners of the parent. In accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated 
and Separate Financial Statements total comprehensive income is 
attributed to the owners of the parent company and to the non-
controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interest 
having a deficit balance. 
Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not 
result in the loss of control are accounted for within equity. When 
an entity loses control of a subsidiary, any gain or loss is recognised 
in the income statement. Transaction costs in respect of transactions 
with non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. Cash flows 
from transactions with non-controlling interests are classified in 
the consolidated cash flow statement as cash flows from financing 
activities.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and any realised and unrealised gains and losses 
arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. The majority of intra-group 
transactions consist of management and consultancy services, interest 
income and expenses arising from loans provided within the Group.

Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective 
functional currency of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated 
into the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing 
at that date. Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction. Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into 
the functional currency at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the 
dates the fair values are determined. 
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of foreign currency transactions and balances and from the 
translation at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income 
statement.
Foreign operations
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
entities with a functional currency different from the presentation 
currency are translated into euro at exchange rates prevailing on 
the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period. 
The exchange differences that arise from the translation of the 
statement of financial position and the income statement from 
the functional to the presentation currency are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented as a separate component of 
equity until the disposal of the foreign entity, when the cumulative 
amount in equity is reclassified to the income statement as part of 
the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part 
of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while 
retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount 
is reattributed to non-controlling interest. When the Group disposes 
of only part of its investment in an associate that includes a foreign 
operation while retaining significant influence, the relevant proportion 
of the cumulative amount is reclassified to the income statement. 
If the foreign operation is a non-wholly owned subsidiary then the 
Notes to the Financial Statements 54
relevant proportion of the translation difference is allocated to non-
controlling interests. Exchange differences arising on items, which 
in substance form part of the net investment in a foreign entity, are 
also presented in the statement of comprehensive income and as a 
separate component of equity until the disposal of the net investment.
Standing investments
Standing investments comprise properties held to earn rental income 
and land related to those properties. Standing investments are 
recognised at cost on initial recognition and subsequently at fair 
value. The fair values of all standing investments were determined 
by Group executive management based on the valuations received 
from Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle. Both are 
external independent international valuation companies and real 
estate consultants, having an appropriately recognised professional 
qualification and recent experience in the respective locations and 
categories of properties being valued. The valuations were prepared in 
accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation 
Standards published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
(the “Red Book”). 
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated 
amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of 
the valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s 
length transaction after proper marketing and the parties having each 
acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. 
Each property has been valued individually and not as part of a 
portfolio. The valuations are prepared by considering the aggregate 
of the net annual rental income receivable from the properties and, 
where relevant, associated costs. A yield which reflects the risks 
inherent in the net cash flows is then applied to the net annual rental 
income to arrive at the property valuation. The yield used for the 
valuation depends on the country and the risk assessment of the 
asset.
Valuations of standing investments reflect, where appropriate: the 
type of tenants actually in occupation or responsible for meeting 
lease commitments or likely to be in occupation after letting of 
vacant accommodation and the market’s general perception of 
their creditworthiness; the allocation of maintenance and insurance 
responsibilities between lessor and lessee; and the remaining 
economic life of the property. The calculations are based on recently 
observable market data to the extent that it is available.
When technical improvements or extensions are constructed or added 
to an existing standing investment, the property will continue to be 
classified as a standing investment, which is measured at fair value. 
Any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value of standing 
investments is recognised in the consolidated income statement 
under the caption revaluation of investment properties. In the case 
of entities whose functional currency is the local currency (i.e. not 
the euro) the revaluation gain/loss in the local currency is converted 
into euro using the average foreign exchange rate for the period. The 
remaining foreign exchange difference (being the difference arising 
from the conversion of the standing investments in the statement of 
financial position at the period end rates and the conversion of the 
revaluation gain/loss using the average period rate) is recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income and in equity as a foreign 
exchange difference. 
Developments and land
Developments and land comprise capitalised development costs and 
land, except for the land on which standing investments are situated. 
Developments and land are recognised at cost on initial recognition 
and subsequently at fair value with any change therein recognised in 
the income statement.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and development of 
a property, and all subsequent capital expenditure that qualify as 
acquisition costs, are capitalised. The Group capitalises borrowing 
costs if they are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction 
of a qualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences 
when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use 
have started and expenditure and borrowing costs are incurred. 
Capitalisation of borrowing costs may continue until the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use. Capitalisation ceases when 
the project has been stopped. The capitalisation rate is determined by 
reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for the respective 
development or by the Group’s average rate.
The commencement of development with a plan or prior agreement 
to sale represents a change in use and accordingly the project is 
transferred from developments to inventories. Inventory is measured 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The amount of any write-
down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses associated 
with inventories shall be recognised as an expense in the income 
statement in the period the write-down or loss occurs. Developing for 
sale is not Atrium’s core business. At the completion of the transaction 
the fair value of the proceeds from sale less the cost of the inventory 
will be presented as net profit or loss in other income/ (expenses). 
The fair value of most of the developments and land as at 
31 December 2012 was determined by Group executive management 
based on valuations received from Cushman & Wakefield and Jones 
Lang LaSalle, external independent international valuation companies. 
Approximately 11% (2011: 80%) was valued internally by Group 
executive management. The yields used in 2011 for this purpose 
ranged from 8.3% to 18.3% depending on the geographical area 
and the project type. Furthermore, in addition to the yields mentioned 
above, an additional risk premium was applied for discounting during 
the construction period. This risk premium ranged from 1.0% to 
4.8%, depending on the status of the developments.
The determination of the fair value of the land plots was based on the 
value for which the land could be sold in the market using different 
methods of calculation. Approximately 21% of the fair value of 
development and land was determined using the comparable method, 
while the remaining part was determined to be the gross development 
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Financial Report 2012 55
value of the completed project less cost to complete (including 
financing costs) and an appropriate developer’s profit (“residual 
value”).
The comparable method uses the sales (offering and listing) prices 
of similar properties that have recently been transacted in the open 
market. Sales prices are analysed by applying appropriate units of 
comparison and are adjusted for differences with the valued property 
on the basis of elements of comparison as location, size of the plot, 
zoning and etc. 
The gross development value is defined as the present value of future 
rents which are expected to be achieved from the standing investment 
once it is developed. The rental levels are set at the current market 
levels discounted at the pre-tax yield. 
The pre-tax yield reflects the current market assessment of observable 
market yields for comparable assets as provided by the external 
independent international valuations companies, the time value of 
money and the risk specific to the asset. 
Any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value of development 
and land is recognised in the consolidated income statement under 
the caption revaluation of investment properties. In the case of entities 
whose functional currency is the local currency (i.e. not the euro) the 
revaluation gain/loss in the local currency is converted into euro using 
the average foreign exchange rate for the period. The remaining 
foreign exchange difference (being the difference arising from the 
conversion of the development and land in the statement of financial 
position at the period end rates and the conversion of the revaluation 
gain/loss using the average period rate) is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income and in equity as a foreign exchange 
difference. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
The useful life of the assets is usually between five and ten years.
Depreciation is charged on the asset from the date that is available 
for use, for the entire useful life of the asset or until the date of its 
disposal. Depreciation is provided in equal monthly instalments over 
the estimated useful life of the assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill initially represents the excess of the aggregate of the cost of 
the acquisition and any non-controlling interests over the fair value of 
the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or 
whenever there is an indication that assets may be impaired. 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation 
of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated. The Group’s cash-generating units are 
located in the countries in which the Group operates. The recoverable 
amount is the higher amount of the fair value less the cost to sell 
or the value in use of the cash generating unit. Determination of 
the value in use requires the Group to estimate the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value. 
Future cash flows of real estate companies are mainly derived from 
the cash flows of the standing investment properties and future 
standing investment properties and are therefore reflected in the fair 
values of investment properties. Goodwill itself mainly arises due to 
the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in the course of the purchase 
price allocation. Therefore, goodwill impairment testing is carried 
out by comparing the goodwill recognised to the carrying value 
of deferred tax liabilities per country. Any excess of goodwill over 
deferred tax liabilities is considered as a goodwill impairment loss. 
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are defined as identifiable, non monetary assets 
without physical substance, which are expected to generate future 
economic benefits. Intangible assets include assets with an estimated 
useful life greater than one year and for the Group comprise primarily 
software.
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of intangible assets is recorded on a straight line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives of the assets are 
usually between four and ten years.
Amortisation is charged on an asset from the date it is available for 
use to the date of its disposal. 
Financial instruments 
Classes
Financial instruments of the Group are broken down into the 
following classes according to the characteristics of the financial 
instruments. For more details see also note 2.38.
Financial assets:
•	Loans; 
•	Receivables from tenants;
•	Other receivables;
•	Cash and cash equivalents.
Financial liabilities:
•	Borrowings; 
•	Derivatives;
•	Liabilities from leases;
•	Other long term liabilities;
•	Trade and other payables;
Notes to the Financial Statements 56
•	Payables related to acquisitions; 
•	Accrued expenditure.
Non-derivative financial assets 
Non-derivative financial assets of the Group are classified in the 
category loans and receivables.
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date that 
they are originated. The Group derecognises loans and receivables 
when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, 
or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in 
a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the loans and receivables are transferred.
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets 
are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and 
receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
method, less impairment.
Loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, receivables 
from tenants, loans and other receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits on 
demand, and other short term highly liquid assets that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of change in value. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other 
financial liabilities category. Such financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting
The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest 
rate risk exposure. 
On initial designation of the derivative as the hedging instrument, 
the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item, including the risk management 
objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the 
hedged risk, together with the methods that will be used to assess 
the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well 
as on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments are 
expected to be “highly effective” in offsetting the changes in the fair 
value or cash flows of the respective hedged items attributable to the 
hedged risk, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within 
a range of 80% – 125%. 
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; any attributable 
transaction costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair 
value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below.
Cash flow hedges
When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a 
hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable 
forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in 
other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve 
in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the 
derivative is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the 
hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is 
revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance 
in equity is reclassified to the income statement.
Impairment
At each reporting date, Group executive management reviews 
the carrying amount of the Group’s assets, other than investment 
properties measured at fair value, goodwill and deferred tax assets, to 
determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. 
An asset is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a 
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset, and that loss event(s) had an impact on the estimated 
future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
Objective evidence that assets are impaired includes default or 
delinquency by a debtor, indications that a debtor will enter 
bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or 
economic conditions that correlate with defaults. An impairment loss 
is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement immediately.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised. 
Other non-current assets 
Other non-current assets are stated at their cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
Other current assets 
Other current assets comprise of prepayments and income tax 
receivable and are stated at their cost less accumulated impairment 
losses.
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Financial Report 2012 57
Stated capital
The stated capital account consists of the proceeds received and 
receivable by Atrium from the issue of its ordinary shares, net of direct 
issue costs. 
Dividends
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the period 
in which they are declared. Dividends declared during the period have 
been presented as a reduction in the stated capital of Atrium. 
Other reserves
Other reserves comprise equity settled share based payments.
Share based payments
Atrium operates an Employee Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) under 
which the Group receives services from key employees selected by the 
Board in consideration for equity instruments settled in shares. The 
costs of these transactions are measured at the fair value of options 
granted at the date of grant.
The cost of the ESOP is recognised in the income statement, together 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which 
the service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (“the vesting 
period”). The cumulative expense, recognised for equity settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately be 
vested. The charge or credit to the income statement represents the 
movement in cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and at 
the end of that reported period.
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct 
issuance costs, and are amortised to the settlement amount using 
the effective interest method. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the 
effective interest method.
Short term borrowings represent borrowings that are due within 12 
months. Long term borrowings represent borrowings due after more 
than 12 months.
When an element of bonds issued by the Group is repurchased before 
maturity, the carrying amount of the bond is allocated between the 
element that continues to be recognised and the element that is 
derecognised based on the relative fair values of such element on the 
date of repurchase. The difference between (a) the carrying amount 
allocated to the element derecognised and (b) the consideration paid 
is recognised as profit or loss on repurchase of bonds in the income 
statement.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position if, as 
a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or otherwise 
binding obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it probable (i.e. 
more likely than not) that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. 
Liabilities from leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
At the inception of the lease, assets held under a finance lease are 
recognised at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Subsequently such assets are measured in 
analogy to other assets held under the relevant caption (e.g. standing 
investments and developments and land – at fair value; property, 
plant and equipment – costs less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses). The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance 
lease obligation. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The 
finance charge shall be allocated to each period during the lease term 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against 
income, within the caption other financial income and expenses. 
Other non-financial long term and current liabilities 
Other non-financial long term and current liabilities are measured 
at cost. They comprise primarily VAT payable, other taxes and fees 
payables, deferred revenue and other advance payments from tenants.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable and represents amounts receivable for services and goods 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, value 
added tax (“VAT”) and other sales related taxes.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease. Utility costs incurred by 
the Group on properties that are leased to third parties are largely 
reinvoiced to the lessees, and the subsequent income and expense is 
recognised on an accrual basis. 
Service charge income 
Service charge income includes payments received by the Group for 
utilities and other services provided to tenants. Generally, reinvoiceable 
utilities are a pass through item for the Group recorded on a gross 
basis. The rental agreements normally specify which cost items are 
reinvoiceable by the Group and can be charged to tenants. There are 
two different categories of reinvoiceable income and expenses:
•	Utilities such as gas, water, electricity or telephone services which 
can be measured individually for each tenant; 
Notes to the Financial Statements 58
•	Fixed cost items such as centre management, marketing, cleaning or 
security services which cannot be directly measured individually for 
each tenant. These costs are normally calculated on a pro-rata basis 
per square metre occupied by each tenant. 
Tenants are normally required to make a security deposit and monthly 
prepayments for the reinvoiceable service charges. Once a year, the 
prepayments are netted against the actual cost and the difference is, 
if contractually agreed, settled between the Group’s company and 
the tenants. To the extent that there are vacancies in a property, the 
Group has to bear the cost of covering the allocated and pro-rata 
reinvoiceable service charges.
Other income and expenses
All other significant operating income or expenses are recognised on 
an accrual basis.
The net results on acquisition or disposal of properties is determined 
as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value 
of the property and is recognised in the income statement when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to 
the buyer.
Interest income and expenses, other financial income and 
expenses
Interest income and expenses are accounted for using the effective 
interest method. 
Other financial income and expenses comprise mainly foreign currency 
gains and losses, net profit or loss from bond buybacks and the 
impairment of financial instruments.
Taxation
Taxation charge comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable 
income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years. Current tax is recognised in the income 
statement. 
The taxable profit differs from the net loss or profit as reported in 
the income statement because it is adjusted for items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and for items 
that are either not taxable or not deductible. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred 
tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to 
temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is computed 
on the total amount of the revaluation adjustment for investment 
properties. 
Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in equity or in 
other comprehensive income. 
A deferred tax asset shall be recognised on unused tax losses carried 
forward and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax 
losses and unused tax credits can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities within one 
entity only if the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on the same taxable entity. 
Tax exposures
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group 
takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether 
additional taxes and interest may be due. This assessment relies on 
estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements 
about future events. New information may become available that 
causes Atrium to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of 
existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax 
expense in the period that such a determination is made.
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss after 
taxation attributable to the ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that is engaged 
in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the 
Group’s chief operating decision maker, (the executive management 
of Atrium), in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
The Group has two reportable segments:
•	The standing investment segment includes all commercial real estate 
held to generate rental income of the Group; 
•	The development segment includes all development activities and 
activities related with land plots.
The reconciling item includes mainly holding activities and other items 
that relate to activities other than the standing investment segment 
and the development segment. 
The Group’s reportable segments are strategic business sectors which 
carry out different business activities and are managed separately. 
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Financial Report 2012 59
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as 
those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. 
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable 
to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reliable 
basis. The Group evaluates performance of the standing investment 
segment on the basis of profit or loss from operations before tax 
excluding foreign exchange gains and losses. The performance of the 
development segment is evaluated based on expected yield on cost. 
Geographical information is based on the geographical locations 
of the investment properties. The Group operates in the following 
countries: Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Hungary, 
Romania, Latvia, Turkey and Bulgaria. In addition, the Group has 
its holding, management or other companies in Cyprus, Denmark, 
Georgia, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine 
and the parent company in Jersey. 
2.4 Standing investments 
The current portfolio of standing investments consists of 156 
properties (2011: 155); which comprise 21 properties in Poland (2011: 
20), 98 properties in the Czech Republic (2011: 98), 3 properties in 
Slovakia (2011: 3), 7 properties in Russia (2011: 7), 25 properties in 
Hungary (2011: 25), 1 property in Romania (2011: 1) and 1 property 
in Latvia (2011: 1). A roll forward of the total standing investments 
portfolio is provided in the table below:

In June 2012, Atrium signed sale and purchase agreements with IKP 
Togliatti (Invest Kino Project “IKP”) and IKP Volgograd, relating to 
premises in the Group’s shopping centres in Volgograd and Togliatti. 
The sale and purchase agreement with IKP Yekaterinburg for premises 
in the Group’s shopping centre in Yekaterinburg, Russia was signed 
in July 2012. IKP Togliatti, IKP Volgograd and IKP Yekaterinburg 
are subsidiaries of Russian Cinema Holdings (“RCH”) and were the 
co-owners and local operators of the cinemas in those three shopping 
centres. Atrium contracted to acquire both the premises and the 
associated land. These transactions have allowed Atrium to gain 
increased ownership of the buildings and land for a total consideration 
of € 9.3 million. RCH has also signed new lease agreements whereby 
they have remained a tenant of the Group at these locations. 
During the second half of 2012 Atrium finalised two development 
projects and transferred them from developments and land to 
standing investments at fair value of € 6.8 million. The two projects 
included a stand-alone retail box in Gdynia, Poland, handed over to 
the tenant Media Markt and Phase II of Atrium Galeria Mosty in Plock, 
Poland. 
In 2011 the Group completed three shopping mall acquisitions, two in 
Poland and one in the Czech Republic. These new acquisitions added 
a further 117,600 sqm to the gross lettable area and had a fair value 
€ 449.8 million as at 31 December 2011. 
The Promenada shopping centre in Warsaw, Poland, was acquired 
in May 2011 for € 171.4 million. In September 2011, the Palác 
Flóra shopping centre (“Flora”) in Prague, the Czech Republic, was 
purchased at a price of € 190.8 million, which was subsequently 
revised to € 186.0 million due to adjustments at initial recognition. 
In December 2011, Atrium purchased the Molo shopping centre in 
Szczecin, Poland for consideration of € 55.0 million.
The total value of the land leases was € 31.8 million as at 
31 December 2012 (2011: € 27.8 million).
The yield diversification across the Group’s income producing portfolio 
is stated in the table below:

Fair value of collateral 
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had pledged a total of 77 
standing investments (2011: 78) with a fair value of € 1,365.9 million 
(2011: € 1,234.1 million) and one development and land plot with 
a fair value of € 1.5 million in favour of bondholders and various 
commercial banks, same as in year 2011.

In July 2012 Atrium signed definitive contracts with a general 
contractor for the construction of its new development project 
in Lublin, Poland. Total costs of construction for 2012 were € 6.4 
million and total net incremental costs to complete the project are 
approximately € 59.6 million. The hypermarket component of the 
project will be developed and then sold to a major international food 
retailer in line with a forward sale agreement concluded in June 2012. 
As development with a prior agreement to sale represents a change 
in use, € 1.7 million was transferred from developments to inventory. 
With further construction works undertaken, inventory subsequently 
increased to € 2.2 million at 31 December 2012.
In Torun, Atrium finalized in July 2012 the acquisition of the 38,000 
sqm land plot adjacent to our existing Atrium Copernicus shopping 
centre and transferred € 8.9 million from other assets to developments 
and land. Our first priority at the site is to increase the size of the car 
park, for which the incremental costs to complete the project are 
approximately € 4.0 million.
During the second half of 2012 Atrium finalised two developments 
projects (Gdynia and Phase II of Atrium Galeria Mosty) and transferred 
them from developments and land to standing investments at fair 
value of € 6.8 million (note 2.4). 
In 2011, Atrium acquired the public ground lease of a land plot 
adjacent to the Promenada shopping centre in Warsaw, Poland for 
€ 9.3 million. Also in 2011, the Group sold three wholly owned 
subsidiaries which owned land plots in Turkey with an aggregate book 
value of € 28.5 million. 
The capitalisation rate used for capitalisation of borrowing costs was 
4.4% for the year 2012 (2011: 4.6%).
The total value of the land leases was € 15.5 million (2011: € 17.2 
million) as at 31 December 2012.

Change in classification 
During the year 2012, the Group modified the consolidated statement 
of financial position classification of intangible assets from “Other 
assets” to “Intangible assets and goodwill”, as this resulted in a more 
relevant presentation of the nature of these assets. Comparative 
amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Financial Report 2012 61
31 December 2011 were reclassified for comparative purposes, 
which resulted in € 3.3 million being reclassified from “Other assets” 
to “Intangible assets and goodwill”. The Group does not believe 
that these adjustments are material to any of its previously issued 
consolidated financial statements.

2.16 Stated capital
As at 31 December 2012, Atrium’s authorised and issued ordinary 
shares were unlimited with no par value.
As at 31 December 2012, the total number of ordinary shares issued 
was 373,388,756 (2011: 372,892,253 shares), of which 373,377,680 
ordinary shares were registered in the name of Nederlands Centraal 
Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer B.V. (trading as “Euroclear”), 
11,075 ordinary shares were registered in the name of an individual 
shareholder and one ordinary share in the name of Aztec Financial 
Services (Jersey) Limited.
Changes in the stated capital account during the year 2012 were as 
follows:
•	Issue of shares to satisfy the exercise of options of € 0.7 million 
(2011: € 0.3 million);
•	Issue of shares in lieu of director’s remuneration € 0.3 million (2011: 
€ 0.1 million). 
•	Dividend payments of € 63.4 million (2011: € 52.2 million). For the 
year 2012, Atrium adopted a dividend policy of € 0.17 per ordinary 
share per year, payable in quarterly instalments. In November 2012, 
the Board has approved an increase of Atrium’s annual dividend 
payment for 2013 from € 0.17 to at least € 0.20 per share. 
Notes to the Financial Statements 64
Following the approval of the shareholders on 18 May 2010 to 
authorise the directors to issue ordinary shares in lieu of directors’ 
remuneration by agreement with the relevant directors, the Board 
adopted a Restricted Share Plan on 16 May 2011 (the “Plan”), which 
confers on eligible directors of Atrium the right to opt (on a semi-
annual basis) to receive ordinary shares in Atrium in lieu of their 
annual directors’ fees. The Plan further gives directors the ability to 
opt (on a semi-annual basis) to subscribe for ordinary shares, up to 
the value of their annual directors’ fees. Directors will be given the 
opportunity to opt as referred to above in semi-annual option periods, 
being the four week free-dealing periods following the announcement 
of each of the Company’s half year and full year results. The strike 
price for the ordinary shares to be issued pursuant to any option 
notice (being the average market price over the 30 dealing days 
preceding) will be notified to directors at the start of each option 
period. Atrium retains the discretion (subject to the approval of the 
Board) to refuse to satisfy an option notice in certain circumstances.
2.17 Other reserves
Other reserves of € 9.6 million (2011: € 3.8 million) comprise equity 
settled share based payment transactions and hedging reserves.
Share based payments 
In 2009, Atrium established and shareholders approved an Employee 
Share Option Plan (“ESOP”), under which the Board can grant share 
options to key employees. The total number of options which the 
Board can grant under the ESOP is 8,500,000. Each option may be 
exercised by the issue of a new ordinary share in Atrium. The exercise 
price shall be determined by the Board, and shall be not less than the 
market value of a share on the dealing day immediately preceding 
the date of grant, or averaged over the 30 dealing days immediately 
preceding the date of grant. Unless stated otherwise, option periods 
expire five years after the date of grant. Option holders can, in most 
cases, exercise one third of the total number of the options granted 
on or after each of the first, second and third anniversaries respectively 
of the date of grant. 
In August 2012, the Compensation and Nominating Committee 
approved the grant of 127,119 options to Mr. Katzman, Director and 
Chairman, in lieu of a consultancy fee of € 0.15 million. 
The movement in the number of share options outstanding and their

Out of the total of 7,212,621 granted share options, 3,047,006 share 
options were exercisable at 31 December 2012 and 408,333 share 
options were exercised during the year 2012. The total number of the 
outstanding options was 5,130,959 as at 31 December 2012. 
The weighted average fair value of options granted was determined 
using Black-Scholes options valuation model as at the date of grant 
and was approximately € 1.24 per option for the year 2012. The 
significant inputs into the model were the weighted average share 
price as at the date of grant of € 3.73 for the year 2012, the exercise 
price shown above, a volatility of 31.00%-61.61% depending on the 
grant date, the time remaining to the vesting date, and an annual 
risk-free interest rate of 0.84%-0.97% depending on the grant date. 
The volatility measured at the standard deviation of continuously 
compounded share returns is based on statistical analysis of daily 
share prices over the last five years. The volatility and annual risk-free 
interest rate were consulted with a third party expert. 
Hedging reserves
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative 
net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related 
to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.

Loans
In December 2012, an Atrium subsidiary entered into a new loan 
agreement of € 50 million with Berlin-Hannoversche Hypothekenbank 
AG. During the year ended 31 December 2012, Atrium also 
completed early repayments of four loans totalling € 16.4 million of 
which two loans of € 10.6 million issued by EUROHYPO AG bank 
including € 0.2 million costs connected with these early repayments. 
The loans were originally scheduled to mature in October 2012. 
Two other loans of € 5.8 million were repaid to Österreichische 
Volksbanken-AG bank including € 0.4 million costs connected with 
these early repayments. The loans were originally scheduled to mature 
in December 2015 and April 2016. Also during 2012, Atrium settled a 
third party loan of € 9.2 million with Bulwer International Inc.
In 2011, Atrium subsidiaries entered into three new loan agreements 
of € 105.0 million, € 31.0 million and € 115.0 million in order to 
finance two acquisitions of shopping centres in Poland and one in the 
Czech Republic, respectively. Additionally, Atrium repaid the loan of 
€ 12.0 million from Bank für Arbeit und Wirtschaft AG upon maturity.
In order to mitigate interest rate risks associated with two loan 
agreements of € 105.0 million and € 115.0 million, the Group entered 
into interest rate swap agreements under which it receives 3-month 
Euribor as at the interest payment dates and pays a fixed interest. The 
cash outflow as a result of interest payments will then match the cash 
inflow received under the swap agreement.
Most of the loans are subject to normal course of business Loan To 
Value (“LTV”) and Debt Service Coverage Ratio (“DSCR”) covenant 
tests, all of which were met throughout the year.

Fair value
The fair values of loans and bonds were determined by an external 
expert. The fair values were determined using discounted cash flow 
models, zero-cost derivative strategies for fixing the future values of 
market variables and option pricing models of the Black-Scholes type.
2.19 Derivatives
The Group entered into two interest rate swap contracts (“IRSs”) 
during 2011. These swaps exchange floating interest rates to fixed 
interest rates. The swaps are cash flow hedges which are designed to 
reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure from variable interest rates on 
certain borrowings. 
The IRSs are in a liability position as at 31 December 2012, and have 
a fair value of approximately € 17.8 million (2011: € 9.1 million). The 
fair value measurements of the IRSs are derived from inputs other 
than quoted prices in active markets. 
Fair values have been determined with reference to market inputs, the 
most significant of which are:
•	Quoted EUR yield curve;
•	Quoted CZK yield curve;
•	Volatility of EUR swap rates;
•	Spot exchange rates CZK/EUR; and
•	Fair values of effected market transactions.
The used inputs are either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. 
derived from prices) derived. Therefore, these IRSs are classified as 
‘’Level 2 Fair value measurements’’ under IFRS 7.
The interest rate swaps have quarterly coupons. The floating rate on 
the IRSs is the 3 month Euribor and the fixed rates are 2.17% and 
2.89%. 
The payments and receipts for the IRSs occur simultaneously with the 
interest payments on the loans. The Group will settle the difference 
between the fixed and floating interest amounts for the IRSs on a 
net basis with the respective counter party. The two swaps mature in 
2016 and 2018 respectively.

2.31 Interest income and interest expenses
Interest income of € 3.9 million (2011: € 6.1 million) was mainly 
derived from bank deposits and interest on the loans provided 
to third parties, which was subsequently impaired. The decline in 
interest income in 2012 was mainly due to low interest rates on bank 
deposits. 
The Group’s interest expense of € 23.1 million (2011: € 23.2 million) 
consists of interest expense on bank loans € 13.1 million (2011: 
€ 9.7 million) and bonds of € 9.8 million (2011: € 11.3 million). The 
remaining amount relates to the amortised financing expenses of 
€ 1.5 million. In addition to the above mentioned interest expense 
an additional amount of € 1.3 million (2011: € 2.6 million) was 
capitalised to the development projects, see note 2.5.

will be available against which the Group can utilise these benefits. 
These unrecognised deferred tax assets arose primarily from negative 
revaluation of investment properties and will expire over a number of 
years, commencing in 2013, in accordance with local tax legislation.

•	Atrium acquired the remaining 23% of the shares in the company 
MD TIME HOLDING LIMITED and now owns 100% of this entity and 
its subsidiaries. MD CE Holding Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary 
of Atrium, purchased 20% of the shares in the company MD REAL 
ESTATE MANAGEMENT LTD and now owns 100% of this entity and 
its subsidiary. Total consideration paid and transaction costs 
amounted to € 9.0 million. Accordingly, as there is no longer any 
non-controlling interest (“NCI”), the negative historic NCI balance of 
€ 12.4 million was eliminated. 
•	BROADVALE HOLDINGS LIMITED, a 100% owned subsidiary of 
Atrium, purchased 15% of the shares in the company PATTONGATE 
TRADING LIMITED and now owns 100% of this entity and its 
subsidiary. Total consideration paid and transaction costs amounted 
to € 0.4 million. Accordingly, as there is no longer any non-
controlling interest (“NCI”), the negative historic NCI balance of 
€ 2.9 million was eliminated. 
The change in the parent’s ownership interest in the respective 
subsidiaries is accounted for directly in equity as there is no change in 
control and the impact was a decrease of € 24.7 million.
2.37 Merger 
In 2012, OOO Foras Magnitogorsk, OOO Foras Kislovodsk and OOO 
Foras Sergiev Posad merged into OOO Manhattan Brateevo. All assets

The fair values of bonds and loans presented under long term financial 
liabilities are disclosed in note 2.18. The remaining financial liabilities 
are stated at amortised cost which is deemed not to be significantly 
different from fair value. The fair values of the financial assets are 
deemed to equal their book values. The Group has pledged some cash 
as collateral, for more information see note 2.15. 
2.39 Risk management
The objective of the Group is to manage, invest and develop 
commercial real estate in Central and Eastern Europe, South Eastern 
Europe and Russia in order to increase their intrinsic value. In the 
initial phase of growth a group company (a subsidiary) mainly relies 
on equity, and to a smaller extent debt, as a source of financing. The 
Group has always applied a conservative funding strategy. 
Group executive management constantly assesses and reports the 
risk exposures of the Group to the Board of Directors. Together with 
monthly management reporting, Board meetings are held at least 
quarterly.
The capital structure of the Group is described in note 2.16.
Development risk
Since 2004, the Group has been active in property development and is 
therefore exposed to certain development risks.
Development risk relates to the construction of investment properties. 
The main risks arising on development are commercial, financial, 
technical and procedural risks. Examples of commercial and financial 
risks are letting risks and risks connected with foreign exchange 
rate fluctuations. To mitigate commercial and financial risks, before 
any project is started a detailed analysis of the market conditions 
is performed and the situation is monitored during the whole 
construction process. Technical risks include for example design risk, 
construction risk and environmental risks. Procedural and technical 
risks are mitigated also by a primary detailed analysis. Further, the 
Group uses external professionals to deal with procedural actions, 
project design, project management, construction and other 
associated matters. Although management has implemented controls 
to mitigate development risk, the turbulence on the global real estate 
markets has required management to redesign and reconsider many 
of the projects. 
Developments which are found to be incompatible with the Group’s 
development objectives are carefully reviewed by the Group’s 
development and design teams in order to find the best configurations 
for continued development in the existing market conditions. This may 
include re-designing the property to allow for a better utilisation of 
building rights, space and gross lettable area, the thorough analysis 
and improvement of development budgets, re-scheduling construction 
and re-negotiating enabling agreements where appropriate.
Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as unforeseen losses on financial assets if 
counterparties should default. 
The credit worthiness of tenants is closely monitored by a regular 
review of accounts receivable. Rents from tenants are generally 
payable in advance. 
Atrium attempts to minimise concentration of credit risk by spreading 
the exposure over a large number of counterparties.
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Financial Report 2012 87
The credit risk exposure is comprised of normal course of business 
transactions with third parties and associates. 
Furthermore, the Group holds collateral from tenants which would 
reduce the financial impact on the Group in the event of default. The 
collateral is represented by deposits from tenants and cover rents 
of one to three months. In 2012, the Group had secured long term 
deposits from tenants amounting to € 18.9 million (2011: € 16.9 
million) and short term deposits amounting to € 7.9 million (2011: 
€ 5.6 million).
The table in note 2.12 provides an ageing analysis of receivables from 
tenants and gives an overview of the allowances made for doubtful 
balances. 
The credit exposure of the Group arising from the financial assets, as 
disclosed in note 2.38, represents the maximum credit exposure from 
financial assets.
Refer also to the note 2.40 for further discussion on loans to 
associates.
To spread the risk connected to the potential insolvency of financial 
institutions, the Group deposits cash balances at various international 
banking institutions. Before a deposit is made management reviews 
the credit ratings of the banking institutions and only banks with 
credit ratings of an investment grade or better are selected.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity within the Group is managed by appropriate liquidity 
planning and through an adequate financing structure. 
The Group’s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the need to 
fund its development projects, property acquisitions and other capital 
expenditures, debt servicing costs, property management services 
and operating expenses. To date, these have been funded through a 
combination of equity funding, bonds and bank borrowings, and, to a 
lesser extent, from cash flow from operations (including rental income 
and service charges).
Liquid funds, comprising cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in 
note 2.15, amounted to € 207.8 million as at 31 December 2012 
(2011: € 234.9 million). The total net liquid funds calculated as cash 
and cash equivalents plus short term loans less short term borrowings, 
amounts to € 132.9 million (2011: € 209.7 million). The table below 
analyses the Group’s financial liabilities, including interest payments, 
based on maturity. The amounts disclosed in the table are the

Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and 
includes price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk.
The Group’s strategy for managing market risk is driven by the Group’s 
investment objective which is managing and administrating the 
existing property portfolio and identifying potentially attractive new 
investments in the market, conducting due diligence for acquisitions 
and managing all the stages of the acquisition process. The Group’s 
market risk is managed on a daily basis by the Group’s leasing 
managers in accordance with the policies and procedures in place.
The Group’s overall market positions are monitored on a monthly basis 
by management. 
Notes to the Financial Statements 88
Key factors such as market yields, gross and net rental income 
are used in the fair value measurement of investment properties.

Price risk
The Group is not materially exposed to price risk resulting from 
financial instruments as it does not own financial instruments whose 
value would fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices (other 
than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk).
However, the Group’s investment properties are valued at fair value. 
These fair values are influenced by the recent turbulence in the global 
markets as well as the limited amount of publicly available and up 
to date data relating to the real estate markets in the countries in 
which the Group operates. The Group is therefore exposed to the 
price risk resulting from movements in the Group’s asset values that 
could change significantly during subsequent periods. At present, 
management is not able to assess with accuracy the extent of such 
changes. 
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on cash balances that are 
denominated in foreign currencies. Currency risks arising from 
investment properties and from financial instruments denominated in 
the functional currency do not represent a currency risk. 
To eliminate the risk of transactions in foreign currencies, the Group 
attempts to match its income with its expense in the same currency, 
reducing currency risk. 
The Group is mainly financed in EUR. The rents payable to the 
Group under the various lease agreements with tenants are 
mainly denominated in euro. The Group currently has 78% of GRI 
denominated in EUR (2011: 77%) 11 % in CZK (2011: 14%), 4% in 
USD (2011: 5%) and 7% in other local currencies (2011: 4%). GRI 
denominated in USD is generated mainly from Russia. The tenants 
however, mostly have their income denominated in the local currency 
of the relevant country in which they are based. The occupancy cost 
ratio, which reflects the tenants’ rental cost as a proportion of its 
turnover, can be affected by fluctuations of the euro, the currency in 
which rent is based or payable, against the relevant local currency in 
which the tenant generates turnover. Accordingly a weakening of the 
local currency against the euro could result in the Group’s properties 
becoming less attractive, or over-rented. Such fluctuations could 
also result in such rent becoming unsustainable with respect to the 
concerned tenant leading to a demand for discounts or even default 
by the respective tenants. 
The following tables set out the Group’s total exposure to foreign 
currency risk and net exposure to foreign currencies of the financial 
assets and liabilities:

Sensitivity Analysis
The table below indicates how a 10 percentage point strengthening of 
the currencies stated below against the euro as at 31 December 2012 
and 31 December 2011 would have increased/(decreased) the profit 
in the income statement. This analysis assumes that all other variables 
remain constant. Recording and measurement of foreign currency 
results follows the principles outlined in standard IAS 21. 
The table below does not take into account potential gains and losses 
on investment properties measured at fair value which are sensitive 
to foreign exchange fluctuations (e.g. rents in Russia denominated 
in USD) nor does it take into account the impact on any other non 
financial assets or liabilities.

Interest rate risk
The majority of financial instruments bear interest on a fixed interest 
basis. The interest rate risks associated with the Group’s financial 
instruments bearing variable interest rates are hedged by making 
use of financial derivatives (interest rate swaps). As all financial 
instruments other than the derivatives, were measured at amortised 
cost in 2012, there were no value movements due to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in 2012. The interest rate risk was, therefore, reduced 
to the impact on the income statement of the interest paid on 
borrowings bearing variable interest rates. The carrying amount of the 
borrowings bearing variable interest rates was € 190.4 million (2011: 
€ 231.5 million) as at 31 December 2012.
Group executive management analyses interest rate exposure arising 
from long term borrowings on a regular basis. As at 31 December 
2012, 65% (2011: 59%) of the Group’s borrowings were at a fixed 
interest rate. Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration 
refinancing, renewal of existing positions and alternative financing 
through bonds. 
Numerous general economic factors cause interest rates to fluctuate; 
in addition, interest rates are highly sensitive to a government’s 
monetary policy, domestic and international economic and political 
conditions, the situation in the financial markets and inflation rates. 
Interest rates on real estate loans are also affected by other factors 
specific to real estate finance and equity markets, such as changes 
in real estate values and overall liquidity in the real estate debt and 
equity markets. 
Increases in interest rates could adversely affect the Group’s ability 
to finance or refinance additional borrowings, as the availability of 
financing and refinancing proceeds may be reduced to the extent that 
income from properties fails to increase sufficiently to maintain debt 
service coverage.
Sensitivity Analysis
The Group seeks to safeguard its results and cash flow against interest 
rate fluctuations by using financial derivatives (interest rate swaps) to 
hedge financial instruments bearing variable interest rates. 
As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, it was estimated 
that a general increase of one percentage point (100 basis points) 
in interest rates would increase the Group’s interest expense arising 
from variable interest rate instruments and subsequently decrease 
the profit for the year by approximately € 1.9 million (2011: € 2.3 
million). The same would be true for a one percentage point (100 
basis points) decrease, which would increase the profit for the year by 
approximately the same amount. 
2.40 Transactions with related parties
To the best of management’s knowledge, during the year ended 
31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, no single shareholder of 
Atrium held more than 5% of the listed ordinary shares, except for:
•	Gazit-Globe Ltd (“Gazit-Globe”) which held 128,908,715 shares 
(2011: 117,862,332 shares) in Atrium, representing approximately 
34.5% (2011: 31.6%) of Atrium’s total shares as at 31 December 
2012 and 
•	Apollo Global Real Estate (“Apollo”) which held 72,486,084 shares 
in Atrium, representing approximately 19.4% (2011: 19.4%) of 
Atrium’s total shares as at 31 December 2012 and as at 
31 December 2011.
Gazit-Globe and Apollo jointly held approximately 53.9% (2011: 
51.0%) of Atrium’s shares in issue as at 31 December 2012. 
Transactions between Atrium and its subsidiaries, which are related 
parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed 
in this note.
Except as described in the following paragraphs, the directors have 
not entered into any transactions with Atrium and its subsidiaries, do 
not own shares in Atrium and have not invested in any debt issued by 
the Group. 
a. Chaim Katzman, Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors 
together with family members held 255,000 shares (2011: 
240,000 shares) in Atrium as at 31 December 2012. In total, Mr. 
Katzman and his family, through his holdings in Norstar Holdings

(2011: 35,645,097 shares), as at 31 December 2012. Together, 
these direct and indirect holdings represented approximately 8.4% 
of Atrium’s total shares as at 31 December 2012. In August 2012, 
the Compensation and Nominating Committee approved the grant 
of 127,119 options to Mr. Katzman in lieu of a consultancy fee of

0.001% (2011: 0.001%) of Atrium’s total shares as at 
31 December 2012.
c. Dipak Rastogi, Director, held through his family trust an indirect 
investment of 435,755 shares in Atrium as at 31 December 2012 
and as at 31 December 2011.

i. Based on a consultancy agreement with the Group, Chaim 
Katzman, Chairman of the Board was entitled to consultancy fees 
of € 0.6 million (2011: € 0.5 million) and expenses as permitted 
under his agreement. 
Atrium has paid flight and travel expenses of € 0.2 million (2011: 
€ 0.8 million) to MGN Icarus Inc. a subsidiary of Gazit-Globe. Such 
travel expenses were at arm’s length and were incurred by the 
Chairman of the Board and management for property tours and other 
business activities.
The total remuneration of the non-executive directors arising from 
their directors’ contracts amounted to € 0.6 million for the year 2012 
(2011: € 0.4 million). 
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the total compensation 
paid or payable to group executive management personnel amounted 
to € 3.3 million (2011: € 3.9 million) and share based payment 
expenses amounted to € 0.9 million (2011: € 1.0 million). 
Transactions with associates are represented by loans provided in 
2006 with a book value of € 42.5 million (2011: € 35.4 million) as 
at 31 December 2012. The loans are granted to Euro Mall Polska 
XVI SP zoo, Euro Mall Polska XIX SP zoo and Euro Mall Polska XX SP 
zoo, entities in which the Group held a 24% stake at 31 December 
2012. These loans have a fixed interest rate of 6.7% per year and are 
secured over a plot of land in Poland. 
The Group contracted for legal services amounting to € 0.5 million 
(2011: € 0.6 million) provided by Atlas Legal Consultancy Services B.V., 
a consultancy company controlled by Marc Lavine, a related party to 
Rachel Lavine. Amounts were billed based on arm’s length rates for 
such services.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, 227,119 options 
were granted. Out of the 5,372,171 outstanding options as at 
31 December 2011, 408,333 options were exercised and 59,998 
options were returned to the option pool. The total number of the 
outstanding options was 5,130,959 as at 31 December 2012. 
Atrium did not conclude any contracts with Aztec Financial Services 
(Jersey) Limited except for a services contract of € 0.2 million (2011: 
€ 0.2 million), connected with the provision of administration, 
company secretarial and registrar services for Atrium. Aztec Financial 
Services (Jersey) Limited is part of Aztec Group where Simon Radford 
is a director and shareholder. 
2.41 Contingencies
The circumstances of the acquisition of 88,815,500 Austrian 
Depositary Receipts (“ADCs”) representing shares of Atrium 
announced in August 2007 (the “ADC Purchases”), security issuances 
and associated events have been subject to regulatory investigations 
and other proceedings that continue in Austria. 
On 7 February 2012, the Jersey Financial Services Commission 
reconfirmed its conclusions, following an investigation commenced in 
July 2008, that the ADC Purchases involved no breach of the relevant 
articles of the Jersey Companies (Jersey) Law and that its investigation 
has concluded without any finding of wrong- doing. 
Atrium is involved in certain claims submitted by ADC holders alleging 
losses derived from price fluctuations in 2007 and associated potential 
Notes to the Financial Statements  Annual Financial Report 2012 91
claims. As at 11 March 2013, the latest practicable date prior to 
authorization of this report, the value of the claims and proceedings 
to which Atrium was then a party in this regard was approximately 
€ 13 million. The number of claims and amounts claimed are expected 
to fluctuate over time as proceedings develop or are dismissed. The 
claims are at varying stages of development and are expected to be 
resolved over a number of years. While a provision has been recorded 
in respect of these proceedings, based on current knowledge and 
management assumptions and includes the estimated associated 
expenses, the actual outcome of the claims and the timing of their 
resolution cannot be estimated reliably by the Company at this time. 
The further information ordinarily required by IAS 37, ‘Provisions, 
contingent liabilities and contingent assets’ has not been disclosed on 
the grounds that it can be expected seriously to prejudice the outcome 
of the claims. Atrium rejects the claims and is defending them 
vigorously. Where judgment has been handed down against Atrium in 
any proceedings, the matter is subject to appeal. 
There are currently criminal proceedings pending against Mr. Julius 
Meinl and others before the criminal court in Vienna relating to events 
that occurred in 2007 and earlier. In connection with this, a law firm 
representing various investors in Atrium, who had invested at the time 
of these events, has alleged that Atrium is liable for various instances 
of fraud, breach of trust and infringements of the Austrian Stock 
Corporation Act and Austrian Capital Market Act arising from the 
same events. The public prosecutor has directed Atrium to reply to the 
allegations and has started criminal investigation proceedings against 
Atrium based on the Austrian Corporate Criminal Liability Act. This 
legislation, which came into force in 2006, is of uncertain application. 
Atrium’s management believes a finding of liability on its part would 
be inappropriate. Accordingly, Atrium intends to actively defend the 
proceedings.
A settlement agreement dated 17 June 2011 between Atrium, Meinl 
Bank AG (“Meinl Bank”), Mr. Julius Meinl and the other related 
parties resolved a number of pending legal proceedings and disputes 
between those parties including a derivative action in the Royal Court 
of Jersey. An independent committee of the Board also determined 
that there was no basis for the claims made in the derivative action 
and no benefit to Atrium in pursuing the action.
The continuing uncertainty in the global markets, especially the 
Euro Zone and real estate markets, as well as the limited amount of 
publicly available up-to-date data and research relating to the real 
estate markets in the countries in which the Group invests could 
lead to significant changes in the values of the Group’s assets during 
subsequent periods. Management is not at present able to assess with 
accuracy the extent of any such changes.
2.42 Subsequent events
In January 2013, MD CE Holding Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary 
of Atrium, purchased 49% of the shares in Nokiton Investments 
Limited and now owns 100% of this entity and its subsidiaries. Total 
consideration paid and transaction costs amounted to € 3.0 million.

Atrium’s Standalone Financial Report  Annual Financial Report 2012 95
3.1 Basis of Atrium’s standalone financial report
Atrium European Real Estate Limited (“Atrium”) has prepared its 
standalone statement of financial position, income statement and 
related notes to the financial statements.
The significant accounting policies of Atrium are the same as those of 
the Group as described in note 2.3 except for that mentioned below. 
The financial assets of Atrium are classified into the following 
categories: 
•	Loans and receivables; and
•	Available for sale financial assets.
Financial investments represent Atrium’s investment in subsidiaries 
and are, therefore eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 
These financial investments are classified as available for sale financial 
assets stated at cost less impairment, which represent the fair value, 
as they are not quoted in an active market. They are recognised and 
derecognised on the date of the transaction with any resulting gain or 
loss recognised in the income statement.
All financial assets presented by Atrium are tested for impairment. 
The testing is performed annually or whenever there is an indication 
that an asset may be impaired. The recoverable amounts of financial 
investments and amounts due from subsidiary undertakings were 
assessed on the basis of the net assets of subsidiaries included in the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group.

The net impairment of assets for the year 2012 amounted to € 64.5 
million (2011 reversal of impairment: € 191.3 million) and comprised 
mainly of the impairment loss on financial investments of € 57.0 
million (2011: € 29.7 million), and the impairment on amounts due 
from subsidiaries undertakings of € 9.0 million (reversal of impairment 
losses in 2011: € 221.8 million). The increase in the impairment 
amount is mainly due to the decrease in the fair value of the 
subsidiaries in 2012.

3.14 Taxation
With effect from 1 January 2009, Jersey implemented a new tax 
regime which imposes a general corporate income tax rate of 0%, 
while applying a 10% rate to certain regulated financial services 
companies and a 20% rate to utilities and income from Jersey land 
(i.e. rents and development profits). Jersey registered companies 
are treated as resident for tax purposes and are subject to a 0% or 
10% standard income tax rate. As Atrium is not a regulated financial 
services company, the effect of the new tax regime is limited to the 
change of status from exempt to liable to Jersey income tax at 0%.

Atrium’s Standalone Financial Report 98
The fair values of bonds presented under long term and short term 
borrowings are stated in note 2.18.
The fair values of financial assets and remaining financial liabilities 
approximate their book values. Financial liabilities are stated at 
amortised cost. 
Atrium has pledged some cash as collateral, for more information see 
note 3.4. 
3.16 Risk management
The risk management processes of Atrium are the same as those of 
the Group, described in note 2.39, except as stated below.
Credit risk
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit 
risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. 
Atrium’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, other 
receivables, loans and receivables and financial investments. The 
maximum exposure of Atrium to credit risk is the carrying amount of 
each class of financial assets; see also note 3.15. 
Financial assets subject to credit risk are represented principally 
by financial investments and loans and receivables which mainly 
comprise the amounts due from subsidiary undertakings within the 
Group. In 2012, the carrying value of investments decreased mainly 
due to impairments relating to subsidiary undertakings, as a result 
of a decrease in the fair value of those companies. The amounts due 
from subsidiary undertakings were impaired as disclosed in note 3.3. 
As intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in the 
consolidated financial statements, they only represent a credit risk 
exposure on Atrium’s level. To mitigate the other credit risk arising 
from financial instruments - loans to third parties, historical data of 
counterparties from the business relationship are used, in particular 
data in relation to payment behaviour. Allowances for receivables are 
recorded in respect of the level of recognised risks, are individually 
tailored to each borrower and are calculated on the basis of 
management knowledge of the business and the market. 
The credit risk exposure is comprised of normal course of business 
transactions with third parties, associates and its subsidiaries.
Liquidity risk
The liquid funds, comprising cash and cash equivalents (note 3.4), 
amount to € 169.0 million (2011: € 199.3 million). 
The table below analyses Atrium’s financial liabilities including accrued 
interest payments based on maturity. The amounts disclosed in the

Other liabilities comprise accrued expenditures and other payables but exclude provisions and accrued interest on bonds.
Currency risk
Atrium is mainly financed in Euros. Atrium’s main exposure 
to currency risk arises from financial instruments representing 
intercompany transactions within the Group. Atrium currently has 
70% of financial instruments denominated in EUR (2011: 64%), 16% 
in USD (2011: 22%) and 14% in local currencies (2011: 14%).

Sensitivity analysis
A 10 percentage point strengthening of the Euro against the 
following currencies at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 
would have changed profit in the income statement by the amounts 
shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain 
constant.

Interest rate risk
A large share of financial instruments i.e. 29% of financial liabilities 
(2011: 29%) and 65% of financial assets (2011: 66%) bore interest 
on a fixed interest basis in 2012. Therefore, interest rate risk is 
reduced to the income statement impact from interest paid and 
received on variable interest rate of financial instruments. The carrying 
amounts of these instruments are stated in the table below:

Sensitivity Analysis
At 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, it was estimated 
that a general increase of one percentage point (100 basis points) 
in interest rates would increase Atrium’s interest income and profit 
by approximately € 8.6 million (2011: € 7.8 million). As Atrium does 
not use derivatives, the same would be true for a one percentage 
point (100 basis points) decrease, which would decrease the profit by 
approximately the same amounts. Equity would not be affected, as 
Atrium’s financial investments are measured at cost less impairment.

Atrium’s Standalone Financial Report 100
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
(the ‘Annual Financial Statements’) of Atrium European Real Estate 
Limited for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the 
Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Positions, 
the Consolidated and Parent Company Income Statements, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU.
This report is made solely to the Parent Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Parent Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 42, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Annual Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express 
an opinion on, the Annual Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Annual Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the Annual Financial Statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Annual Financial Statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the Annual Financial 
Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited Annual Financial Statements. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.
Opinion on Annual Financial Statements
In our opinion:
•	The Annual Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2012 and of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
profit for the year then ended;
•	the Group Annual Financial Statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
endorsed by the EU; and
•	the Parent Company Statement of Financial Position, Income 
Statement and related notes have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
endorsed by the EU as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991; and 
•	the Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
•	adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company; or
•	the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
•	we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements: Group 
Management Report and comment on the declaration of the 
Parent Company’s management according to para 82 BorseG
Pursuant to statutory provisions, the Group Management Report is 
to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the Group Annual 
Financial Statements and as to whether the other disclosures are not 
misleading with respect to the Company’s position. The auditor’s 
report also has to contain a statement as to whether the Group 
Management Report is consistent with the Group Annual Financial 
Statements.

Our Vision & Strategy 
Atrium’s vision is to become the leading owner, operator and developer of food anchored shopping 
centres in Central & Eastern Europe and for the Atrium brand to become a hallmark of high quality retail 
for consumers and retailers alike.
Our portfolio is, and will continue to be, weighted towards income generating shopping centres that 
produce long term stable cash flows and are located in our core markets of Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia and Russia. Organic growth will be delivered by pro-active hands-on asset management, 
ensuring we uphold our “retail is detail” approach. Further growth will be achieved through the 
acquisition of high quality assets in our core countries and through a selected number of development 
projects, either of new shopping centres or extensions of existing properties. Our balance sheet will be 
efficient and conservatively managed with modest leverage.
Our Profile  Atrium owns a €2.2 billion portfolio of 156 primarily food anchored 
retail properties and shopping centres which produced €193.5 million of annual rental income in 2012 
from 1.2 million sqm of gross lettable area. These properties, which are located predominantly in Poland, 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia, are managed by Atrium’s internal team of retail real estate 
professionals. In addition, Atrium owns a €538.4 million development and land portfolio that offers the 
potential to create value by progressing development.
Atrium is based in Jersey, Channel Islands and is dual listed on the Vienna and NYSE Euronext Amsterdam 
Stock Exchanges under the ticker ATRS. 
Our Objectives for 2013
•	 Continue to drive the financial and operational performance of our assets while striving to constantly 
improve our offering for retailers and consumers
•	 Maintain our pursuit of appropriate investment opportunities in our core markets of Poland, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia
•	 Further improve the capital structure and efficiency of the Group’s balance sheet
•	 Continue to establish the Atrium brand and strengthen our relationships with key clients while seeking 
to work with new retailers as they expand into and across the region. Leader in Shopping Centres in Central and Eastern Europe

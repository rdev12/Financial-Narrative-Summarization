Group Turnover
Managed Services - InTechnology’s secure data centre President’s introduction
The Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 31 March 2004
reflect a period of significant
achievement and importance for
InTechnology. 
First, the Company has substantially
expanded its activities and the
territories in which it operates
through the acquisition of Allasso. It
is now the leading specialist
distributor of network storage and
security solutions in Europe. 
Secondly, InTechnology’s Managed
Services division has begun to fulfil
its early promise and to achieve the
results that the Directors have always
expected. In the UK, there are now
over 200 clients for these services,
including many government
departments. InTechnology provides
an extensive and evolving range of
services in a market poised on the
verge of substantial expansion.
The financial performance of the
Company has been robust
throughout, with strong profitability
being maintained in Specialist
Distribution activities and reduced
losses in Managed Services.
The Company’s strategy remains
unaltered – to provide a range of
products and services that are
absolutely critical to the effective
performance of today’s network-
centric computing environment, and
to do so through a channel of
resellers, consultants and system
integrators.
This strategy has proven to be highly
successful during the last two years
and has positioned InTechnology
strongly as the IT market recovers.
Consequently, I look forward with
optimism to what we will achieve in
the year ahead. 
On behalf of the Company, I would
like to thank all our partners and
suppliers as well as InTechnology’s
own skilled and dedicated staff for
their commitment and energy
throughout the last year.

The financial performance of the 
Company has been robust throughout,
with strong profitability being maintained
in Specialist Distribution activities and
reduced losses in Managed Services. Executive Chairman’s statement
Overview
I was very pleased with the
performance of the Group during the
past 12 months as we made
significant strides towards our goal
of becoming the leading IT
infrastructure provider in Europe
while also growing our revenues and
reducing our losses. Our Managed
Services division has also enjoyed an
acceleration in the cumulative value
of contracts won which at 31 March
2004 was £60m (2003: £40m),
generating £18.0m (2003: £10.5m) 
of recurring revenue per annum 
once commissioned. 
We have significantly altered the mix
of business within our Specialist
Distribution division this year by both
organic growth and acquisition so
that higher margin software,
consultancy and maintenance sales
now represent some 31% (2003:
17%) of our distribution revenues.
The acquisition of Allasso on 31 July
2003 has enabled us to extend our
specialist distribution model to
include IT security products and build
a platform for territorial growth in
five other western European markets. 
Our unique expertise across storage,
security and enterprise software
combined with our ability to deliver
utility-based computing services is
beginning to pay real dividends. As
computing moves inexorably towards
a more networked environment we
are finding that our customers are
looking increasingly for a one-stop IT
infrastructure supplier such as
InTechnology. In this current financial
year we will be taking steps to
significantly increase the levels of
cross-selling to our customer base as
well as unifying key group functions,
which will lead to a much more
effective and efficient operation.
Trading and operating
performance
There was a very strong sales
performance from the Specialist
Distribution division in the second
half of the year which contrasted
with a slow start in the first half. The
Allasso software security products
division performed in line with
expectations and is now fully
integrated into InTechnology.
Managed Services achieved a strong
and consistent level of new contract
wins in each half year. 
Group turnover was £223.5m during
the year (2003: £156.9m) and gross
profit improved by 75% to £40.8m
(2003: £23.3m). Net operating
expenses before depreciation,
amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items were £33.5m
(2003: £19.3m) with the acquisition
of Allasso accounting for £10.5m of
the increase. Net operating expenses
were £43.6m (2003: £29.8m).
Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation of
goodwill and exceptional items
increased to £7.3m (2003: £3.9m).
Group operating profit before
amortisation of goodwill was £1.6m
(2003: £2.6m loss). The Group
reported an operating loss of £2.8m
(2003: £6.6m loss).
InTechnology’s balance sheet remains
strong with cash of £16.4m (2003:
£18.2m) and net debt after finance
leases and term loans of £10.4m
(2003: net funds £10.0m) largely as a
result of the acquisition of Allasso.
Specialist Distribution division
InTechnology’s Specialist Distribution
activities embrace three principal
areas of expertise: Storage, Security
and Enterprise Software. In the UK we
are engaged in all three activities; in
continental Europe revenues are, for
now, almost exclusively derived from
security software and appliances. 
The slow start to the year experienced
by Specialist Distribution was put
firmly behind us during the second
half of the year when we produced
some excellent results, which included
a record third quarter. Despite the
well-documented commercial and
market difficulties experienced by all
partners of Sun and HP in the first
half of the year we managed to retain
our market position, while our IBM
business has continued to expand. 
We were also encouraged by the
performance of our Veritas software
business and made a promising start
in our new UK relationship with
Network Appliance. The storage
market continues to grow in both
volume and complexity and we are
confident that we are, as always, 
well positioned to maximise this
opportunity.
We have now fully integrated the 
UK operation of Allasso into an
enlarged UK Specialist Distribution
business although maintaining the
Allasso brand.
Allasso’s continental European
footprint presents a foundation on
which we can begin to build software,
storage, network and managed
services sales to the IT channel. In this
current financial year we are exploring
the opportunity to sell InTechnology's
storage software product portfolio
through our European offices, as we
believe this to be a strong growth area
for the business.
3 In the year UK Specialist Distribution
achieved revenues of £172.4m (2003:
£148.7m) and maintained operating
margins before amortisation of
goodwill of 5%. Operating margins
after amortisation of goodwill were
maintained at 4%. The division earned
an operating profit before
amortisation of goodwill of £8.5m
(2003: £8.1m) and an operating profit
of £6.5m (2003: £6.4m). Software,
consultancy and maintenance
revenues were 30% (2003: 17%) of
the division’s revenue.
Allasso Europe recorded revenues of
£36.6m and an operating profit of
£0.8m. There was encouraging
revenue growth in southern Europe
and we see good potential to exploit
our new European footprint.
Managed Services division
Managed Services increased revenues
by 77% to £14.5m (2003: £8.2m) with
an operating loss before amortisation
of goodwill and exceptional items of
£7.8m (2003: £9.1m) which reflects
our continued ongoing investment in
this side of the business and the time
delay between winning and
commissioning contracts. The
Managed Services operating loss was
£10.0m (2003: £13.0m).
At 31 March 2004, our annualised
recurring revenues were £18.0m
(2003: £10.5m) and cumulative
contracts won were £60m (2003:
£40m). The Board remains confident
that following the installation of
approximately £65m of cumulative
contract wins, this division will
achieve EBITA breakeven.
I strongly believe that our technology
and methodology has gained
significant market awareness and
acceptance in both the UK public and
private sectors, where we have
achieved equal success. The
restorable data we now manage in
our data centres exceeds 2 petabytes
(2003: 0.7 petabytes) and we now
take data from over 170 customer
sites in the UK. Our network in the
UK, LANnet, has been a tremendous
success and we now have 168 sites
connected to the network taking a
variety of services from us. This year
we are also very encouraged that
55% of our user base now takes
more than one service from us and
10% now take three.
In October of last year we launched
our InPartnership programme,
through which we have formalised
many of our relationships with
consultants, integrators and
outsourcers which sell our services to
their clients. Sales of outsourced
services through this channel have
proved to be extremely effective as
we enable our partners to capture
more of their own clients’ recurring
IT spend without them having to
invest in data centres and network
infrastructure or work with a
competing IT provider. Many more of
our traditional channel partners are
turning to us for these services
which confirms our belief in the
unified InTechnology approach to 
the IT channel. 
As computing moves inexorably towards 
a more networked environment we are
finding that our customers are looking
increasingly for a one-stop IT infrastructure
supplier such as InTechnology.

New developments
We have a number of exciting new
developments across the Group in
the coming year:
InTechnology Appliances 
As the world of enterprise computing
becomes ever more complex we are
developing a range of appliances to
solve particular business and
legislative issues. Today a computing
solution can involve technologies
from many different suppliers
confusing both end users and even
the salesmen. InTechnology
Appliances, which we will launch
under the MyAppliance brand, aim to
remove all this difficulty and simplify
the whole process by defining a
solution to a specific problem and
supplying a turnkey package. 
Network products
InTechnology’s expertise has been
centred on storage and security
related products. Later this financial
year we look forward to significantly
expanding the product range by
adding some leading network
products.
Additional managed services
We are continuing to develop
commercially a number of
technologies in the Managed Services
division to improve performance,
reduce costs and broaden the range
of services offered to customers. In
the coming months we expect to
launch the following: 
• An increased capacity VBAK from
2TB to 4TB per system
• InTechnology Voice over IP (‘VOIP’)
• Archiving/Information Life-cycle
Management (‘ILM’)
• An enhanced data replication
offering.
Current trading
The first two months’ trading of this
financial year have been in line with
management expectations and are
ahead of the same period last year.
Outlook
As computing moves inexorably
towards a more networked
environment our customers are
increasingly turning to us either for
the supply of infrastructure,
products, services and expertise or
choosing to outsource to us the
provision of network, hosting or
storage services to improve the
overall resilience, compliance or
performance of their IT
infrastructure. 
In order to take advantage of our
excellent position as the one-stop IT
infrastructure provider to the
channel (systems integrators,
consultants and resellers) we shall
this fiscal year start integrating our
UK sales, marketing and professional
services divisions into a unified
structure. This will allow us to
achieve better customer focus with
all our products and services and
create greater operating efficiencies. 
The new products and services
outlined above will be launched this
year with the main financial benefits
arising from 2006 onwards.
We believe that the advent of
Network Computing is not only
about to happen, it is happening and
InTechnology is extremely well placed
to capitalise on this opportunity. 
Peter Wilkinson
Executive Chairman
14 June 2004
Executive Chairman’s statement cont. Chief Executive Officer’s report
Overview
The year ended 31 March 2004 has
seen InTechnology significantly
expand its Specialist Distribution
activities as well as enjoying
continued rapid growth in Managed
Services. Overall, we have grown
revenues, altered our business mix,
reduced losses and brought the
Managed Services division to the
point when we can now predict
when it should return a pre-tax
profit to shareholders.
Within our Specialist Distribution
division a significant proportion of
our revenues are now derived from
software products which have the
benefit of also generating a level of
maintenance and support sales. On
31 July 2003 we acquired Allasso to
extend our distribution capability into
security software and extend a
bridgehead into several European
territories. Throughout the year we
have signed agreements to distribute
additional specialist products from
existing suppliers (such as IBM’s
software products) and added new
vendors such as Network Appliance,
KVS and FalconStor.
Managed Services now has over 200
clients and over £60m (2003: £40m)
in cumulative contracts won. In
addition to our core storage services,
we have substantially expanded our
range of managed services to take
advantage of the potential inherent
in our nationwide network ring
(‘LANnet’) which acts as a platform
over which we can offer VPN, data
replication, dial-up and internet
services. 
Specialist Distribution
Our Specialist Distribution activities
now span storage, security and
enterprise software. In the UK, we are
engaged in all three activities; in
continental Europe, revenues are
almost exclusively derived from
security software and appliances.
The first half of the year was
characterised by extremely
challenging trading conditions with a
particular absence of large projects
as companies postponed purchasing
decisions and sought to optimise
existing assets. We continued to see
declines in our Sun volumes and the
post merger integration of HP and
Compaq presented some technical
challenges which hampered
shipments. In the second half of the
year however we saw a resumption
of larger orders and achieved a
record performance in the third
quarter followed by continued strong
momentum into the fourth quarter.
In September 2003 we signed with
Network Appliance as their exclusive
UK distributor and, during the
subsequent two quarters have begun
to grow these revenues. 
Higher margin enterprise software
sales have grown rapidly year-on-
year. We now offer a substantially
broader range of software including
not only the leading storage software
brands such as Veritas, Tivoli and CA
but also some of IBM’s enterprise
products like Websphere, Lotus and
DB2. In January 2004 we launched
the distribution of KVS software in
the UK and also, in March 2004 we
launched the first ever IBM Software
Business Partner Innovation Centre in
Europe where customers could view
examples of how IBM’s software
portfolio can be utilised.
The acquisition of Allasso has further
broadened our specialist distribution
offering into network security as well
as opening up new territories in
which to operate. InTechnology is
now Europe’s leading supplier of
firewall, intrusion detection,
authentication and network security
products from companies such as
Nokia, Check Point, Symantec,
NetScreen and Clearswift. 
On 31 July 2003 we acquired Allasso 
to extend our distribution capability into
security software and extend a bridgehead 
into several European territories.
6 7
Allasso’s operations in France,
Germany, Spain, Italy, the
Netherlands and latterly Switzerland
present a springboard for further
territorial growth as well as a
framework through which to
introduce storage as well as managed
services. Since the acquisition of
Allasso we have integrated the UK
operation into a single UK Specialist
Distribution business while retaining
the Allasso brand within the security
arena. The Allasso team will continue
to operate as a dedicated security
distributor, with no dilution of focus
and with additional Group
investment to support growth in
their sales and technical resource. 
The customer relationships that
InTechnology and Allasso have
developed over the years have
remarkably little overlap and present
an attractive opportunity for us to
offer our customers a one-stop shop
for some of IT’s more complex
network-centre products in storage,
security and software. 
Managed Services
The rate at which the Managed
Services division has been winning
new contracts increased quarter-on-
quarter. We have continued to focus
our efforts with considerable success
in the public sector, financial services
and professional services industries.
We now manage data and provide
offsite back-up or network services
for over 200 clients including a
number of central and local
government departments. We have
an NHS Code of Connection and
manage the back-up of clinical and
patient records. 
This year marks the first full year
when we have used our nationwide
network ring (‘LANnet’) which has
points of presence in 22 UK cities.
Using this as a multi-service
platform, our clients can now place
servers or storage devices in our data
centres as if they were an extension
of their own offices.
In the third quarter of the financial
year we launched our InPartnership
Programme through which we have
formalised many of our relationships
with consultants, integrators and
outsourcers that sell our services to
their clients. Sales of our managed
services through the channel have
proved to be extremely effective as
we enable our partners to capture
more of their clients’ recurring IT
spend without their needing to invest
in their own data centres and
network infrastructure or work with
a competing IT partner. 
The year ahead
In this next fiscal year we have a
number of initiatives which we will
be launching to introduce additional
products to the channel, expand the
range of products offered through
our continental European offices,
improve cross-selling to our
customers through more effective
sales co-ordination and increase the
utilisation of our professional
services and support teams across
the entire Group. 
I am confident that the year ahead
will be one of continued growth and
progress.

Articon-Integralis AG and includes its trading for 8 months of the year.
(iii) An exceptional cost of £1.6m was incurred in 2003 in relation to the closure of the Group’s German subsidiary. In 2004,
a further provision of £0.1m was made to finalise property lease commitments. This is not shown as an exceptional cost.

UK Specialist
Distribution
Strong sales growth in storage
software to £30.8m (2003:
£19.2m) helped to offset a
decline in storage hardware
revenue, however, overall
turnover in storage products
fell by 2.8% to £144.5m (2003:
£148.7m).
The trading net assets and
goodwill of Allasso UK Limited
were hived up on 1 November
2003 to InTechnology plc
becoming part of an enlarged
UK Specialist Distribution
business.
Allasso UK trading was in line
with expectations and whilst
EBITA trading profits are
currently recorded separately,
the full rationalisation of
support and administrative
functions within an enlarged
UK Specialist Distribution
business means that the
revenues and operating profits
shown above are for the
enlarged division as all
operating costs become shared.
European Specialist
Distribution
As part of the acquisition of
Allasso, InTechnology acquired
five trading subsidiaries in
Europe: France, Spain, Italy,
Germany and the Netherlands
with a new subsidiary
subsequently being
incorporated in Switzerland
(‘Allasso Europe’). Total trading
results for the eight months to
31 March 2004 are shown
above. Allasso Europe traded in
line with expectations with
strong growth experienced in
Spain and Italy. We remain
committed to expanding these
subsidiaries further by the
introduction of certain
distribution products on a
country-by-country basis. 9
Managed Services
Turnover increased by 77% to £14.5m
(2003: £8.2m) with a resultant
increase in gross margin, but
operating costs increased partly from
a higher depreciation expense
(directly attributable to capital
expenditure caused by the
installation of new contracts won),
and from a full year impact of
LANnet costs (our high performance
UK wide network commissioned in
February 2003).
Goodwill
We have continued to evaluate the
carrying value of the Group’s
goodwill balances by comparing
them to their recoverable amounts,
represented by their value in use to
the Group. The value in use has been
derived from discounted cash flow
projections that cover the 4 years
from 1 April 2004. After this 4-year
period, the projections use a long-
term growth rate. Our confidence in
the long-term success of both
Specialist Distribution and Managed
Services divisions indicate that no
further impairment write down is
necessary this year.
Following the acquisition of the
Allasso companies from Articon-
Integralis AG on 31 July 2003,
goodwill arising in the Group
consolidated balance sheet increased
by £12.3m. Based on current trading
we estimate that an additional
€1,500,000 (£1,003,000 assuming an
exchange rate of £1 to €1.496) of
contingent consideration will become
payable by 31 July 2005. There is a
further maximum contingent
consideration of €2,270,000
(£1,517,000 assuming an exchange
rate of £1 to €1.496) dependent on
future sales to Articon-Integralis AG.
The acquisition is fully explained in
note 20 to the financial statements.
Goodwill has continued to be
amortised over a 20-year period,
including that arising from the
acquisition of Allasso and this
practice will continue during the
current financial year. However, the
adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) will
cause the goodwill amortisation
charge for the 2004/2005 financial
year to be reversed in the year
ending 31 March 2006 accounts, as
IFRS requires goodwill not to be
amortised but reviewed annually for
impairment.
Cash flow and
liquidity
The cash generative nature of our
business continues to be evidenced
by a net cash inflow from operating
activities of £3.5m (2003: £2.4m).
Cash at bank and in hand at the
year-end was £16.4m (2003: £18.2m).
However, the funding of the
acquisition of Allasso was by debt. A
secured term loan from Peter
Wilkinson, the Executive Chairman of
the Group, of £15m was negotiated
having a three-year term, a fixed rate
of interest of 8% and no premium
for early repayment. In addition a
secured €10m three-year term loan
was negotiated with IBM United
Kingdom Financial Services Limited.
Taxation
The tax charge of £0.9m (2003:
£0.4m) on the loss on ordinary
activities before taxation of £3.8m
(2003: £6.7m) largely arises because
goodwill amortisation is not a taxable
deduction. A full reconciliation of the
tax charge is provided in note 5 to
the financial statements.
Financial review cont. Financial instruments
The Group’s policy is that no trading
in financial instruments is
undertaken. The Group’s financial
instruments comprise borrowings,
cash and liquid resources and various
items that arise directly from its
operations. The main risks arising
from these are interest rate risk,
liquidity risk, and foreign currency
risk as the Group now trades in euro
and US dollars.
The €10m loan mentioned in ‘Cash
flow and liquidity’ above and
explained in note 15 to the financial
statements acts as a hedge against
the euro exposure arising from our
investment in Allasso Europe.
Current trading
The new financial year has
commenced well and is in line with
expectations. Much attention has
been given to improving the
operating efficiencies of the
Specialist Distribution businesses
throughout the Group. However, the
major challenge is to achieve a
Managed Services operating profit
before interest, tax and amortisation
of goodwill. We remain confident
that following the installation of
approximately £65m of Managed
Services contracts this will be
achieved on a quarterly basis. At 31
March 2004 contracts won were
£60m (2003: £40m). Thereafter the
elimination of trading losses in this
division together with continued
profitability in Specialist Distribution
will put InTechnology in a strong
position to grow profitability and
generate cash.
Andrew Kaberry
Finance Director

The cash generative nature of our 
business continues to be evidenced

activities of £3.5m (2003: £2.4m).

Products, services and case studies
Managed Services
InTechnology Managed Services offer
clients in the public and private
sector the opportunity to outsource
the management of their core IT
infrastructure to assure levels of
performance, security and business
continuity.
InTechnology has a clear lead in this
marketplace through VBAK, an
automated data backup and recovery
service which has been adopted by
organisations of all sizes. 
A multi-gigabit network, LANnet
(which runs through 22 UK cities),
allows us to offer to clients their own
secure Virtual Private Network
(‘VPN’), Voice over IP, low cost
internet access, and Managed
Firewalls.
Having invested in high-security Data
Centres, we also provide a set of
Hosting Services for a wide variety of
clients, to assure the safety of their
data under managed supervision at
all times.
Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI)
A commitment to excellence in
government
As part of their commitment to
excellence in the provision of IT
infrastructure services to the
Department of Trade and Industry

years in accordance with the

3 per cent of the issued ordinary
share capital of the Company:
Percentage of
shares held
Peter Wilkinson 56.64%
Artemis Investment 
Management Limited 8.25%
Jon Wood 7.61%
Andrew Kaberry 7.14%
Canada Life 4.16%
Steve Pearce 3.57%
Going concern
Under company law, the Directors are
required to consider whether it is
appropriate to prepare financial
statements on the basis that the
Company and Group are going
concerns. As part of its normal
business practice, budgets, cash flow
forecasts and longer term financial
projections are prepared and in
reviewing this information, the
Directors are satisfied that the
Company and the Group have
adequate resources to enable them
to continue in business for the
foreseeable future. The Directors have
therefore adopted the going concern
basis in the preparation of the
financial statements.
Employees
The Group places considerable value
on the involvement of its employees
and has continued its practice of
keeping them informed of matters
affecting them as employees and the
various factors affecting the
performance of the Group. 16
The Directors recognise that
continued and sustained
improvement in the performance of
the Group depends on its ability to
attract, motivate and retain
employees of the highest calibre.
Furthermore, the Directors believe
that the Group’s ability to sustain a
competitive advantage over the long
term depends in a large part on
ensuring that all employees
contribute to the maximum of their
potential. The Group is committed to
improving the performance of all
employees through development and
training.
The Group is an equal opportunity
employer. The Group’s policies seek to
promote an environment free from
discrimination, harassment and
victimisation and to ensure that no
employee or applicant is treated less
favourably on the grounds of gender,
marital status, age, race, colour,
nationality or national origin,
disability or sexual orientation or is
disadvantaged by conditions or
requirements, which cannot
objectively be justified. Entry into,
and progression within the Group, is
solely determined on the basis of
work criteria and individual merit.
The Group continues to give full and
fair consideration to applications for
employment made by disabled
persons, having regard to their
respective aptitudes and abilities. The
policy includes, where practicable,
the continued employment of those
who may become disabled during
their employment and the provision
of training and career development
and promotion, where appropriate.
Share schemes
Share ownership is at the heart of
the Group’s remuneration philosophy
and the Directors believe that the key
to the Group’s future success lies in a
motivated workforce holding a stake
in the Company. The schemes are
described in the Board’s
Remuneration report and details of
the options granted under the
schemes are set out in note 18 to the
financial statements. All permanent
employees are eligible to join the
schemes.
Research and
development
The Group continues to undertake
research and development of new
products with the objective of
increasing future profitability. The
cost to the Group is charged to the
profit and loss account as incurred.
Policy and practice on
payment of creditors
It is the Group’s policy to agree terms
and conditions for its business
transactions with its suppliers. The
Group seeks to abide by the payment
terms agreed with suppliers
whenever it is satisfied that the
supplier has provided the goods or
services in accordance with the
agreed terms and conditions.
In the year ended 31 March 2004
average creditor days for the Group
and Company were 38 days (2003: 41
days) and 37 days (2003: 41 days
respectively.
Environment
The Group recognises the importance
of environmental responsibility. The
nature of its activities has a minimal
effect on the environment but where
they do, the Group acts responsibly
and is aware of its obligations at all
times.
Annual General
Meeting
The next AGM of the Company will
be held on 10 August 2004. Details of
the business to be proposed at the
AGM are contained within the Notice
of Meeting, which is set out on pages
50 and 51.
Independent auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have
indicated their willingness to
continue in office and a resolution
proposing that they be reappointed
as independent auditors and
authorising the Directors to fix their
remuneration will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting.

14 June 2004 Corporate governance
17
InTechnology plc is an AIM listed
company and is not therefore
required to comply with the
Principles of Good Governance and
Code of Best Practice (‘the Combined
Code’) published by the London Stock
Exchange in June 1998. The following
disclosures are made voluntarily.
Principles of
Corporate Governance
The Board recognises the value of
good corporate governance as a
positive contribution to the well
being of the business and believes in
applying these principles (including
those set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code) in a sensible and
pragmatic manner. 
Peter Wilkinson, as majority
shareholder in the Company, has
signed an agreement stating that he
will not seek to influence the Board
by reason of his shareholding.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors consists of ten
members, including a non-Executive
President and two other non-
Executive Directors.
The roles of President, Executive
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
are separated and clearly defined. The
activities of the Group are controlled
by the Board, which meets
throughout the year. There is a
formal schedule of matters
specifically reserved for the full
Board’s decision, together with a
policy enabling Directors to take
independent advice in the
furtherance of their duties at the
Group’s expense. The Board
programme is designed so that
Directors have regular opportunity to
consider the Group’s strategy,
policies, budgets, progress reports
and financial position and to arrive
at a balanced assessment of the
Group’s position and prospects.
The Board is assisted by the Company
Secretary, who provides a point of
reference and regular support for all
Directors and senior managers. He
has responsibility for ensuring that
Board procedures are followed, for
establishing the Group’s corporate
governance policies and for assisting
the Board in facilitating compliance
by the Company with its legal
obligations.
The Board has appointed two
standing committees, which are as
follows:
The Audit Committee
Comprises the two non-Executive
Directors and the non-Executive
President and is chaired by Lord
Parkinson. Its duties include a
comprehensive review of the annual
and interim financial statements
before they are presented to the
Board for approval. The Audit
Committee meets at least twice a
year to review the findings of the
external auditors, key accounting
policies and judgements. It has
unrestricted access to the Company’s
auditors.
The Remuneration Committee
Comprises the two non-Executive
Directors and the non-Executive
President and is chaired by Joe
McNally. It meets at least once a year
and is responsible for making
recommendations to the Board on
remuneration policy for Executive
Directors and for setting salaries,
incentive payments and share
options granted.
Relations with
shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that all
shareholders are kept informed about
the Company and its activities. A
comprehensive annual report and
accounts and an interim report are
sent to shareholders and there is
frequent dialogue with institutional
investors, including presentations
following the preliminary and interim
announcements.
The Annual General Meeting is a
forum for shareholders’ participation
with the opportunity to meet and
question Board members including
the non-Executive President and the
Chairmen of the Board committees.
Internal control
The Board of Directors acknowledges
its overall responsibility for the
Company’s systems of internal
control and for monitoring their
effectiveness. The Board has control
over strategic, financial and
compliance issues and has
introduced a structure of
responsibility with appropriate levels
of authority. The Board as a whole
has continued to annually review the
effectiveness of the Company’s
systems of internal control.
The Company’s Directors and varying
levels of management have clear
responsibilities in ensuring that the
control environment operates
efficiently. Clear lines of responsibility
are developed through the
Company’s organisation structure.
Ethical policies are communicated
through all forms of personnel
training and via appropriate
procedures, in establishing a code of
ethics.
For the year ended 31 March 2004:
  Although no system of internal
control can provide absolute
assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the Company’s
systems are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that problems
are identified on a timely basis and
are dealt with appropriately. The
principal features of the Company’s
internal financial control structures
can be summarised as follows:
a. Preparation of budgets and
forecasts approved by the Board.
b. Monthly management accounts,
showing comparisons of actual
results against budget and prior
year results, are reviewed by the
Board. Variances from budget are
thoroughly investigated and are
discussed at monthly Board
meetings. Where lapses in internal
control are detected, these are
rectified.
c. The Company’s cash flow is also
monitored monthly compared to
forecast.
d. The Board authorises capital
expenditure where this is
significant.
The Board has continued to enhance
its risk control programme, in
particular, those elements which
relate to ensuring that risk reviews
are formally embedded in control
systems rather than being the subject
of formal annual reviews.
Statement of
Directors’
responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors
to prepare financial statements for
each financial year that give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group as at
the end of the financial year and of
the profit or loss of the Group for
that year.
The Directors confirm that suitable
accounting policies have been used
and applied consistently as explained
on pages 28 and 29 under the
heading ‘Accounting policies’ . They
also confirm that reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates
have been made in preparing the
financial statements for the year
ended 31 March 2004, that applicable
accounting policies have been
followed and that the financial
statements have been prepared on
the going concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the
Group and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They
are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and the
Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the
InTechnology website is the
responsibility of the Directors; the
work carried out by the auditors does
not involve consideration of these
matters and, accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any
changes that may have occurred to
the financial statements since they
were initially presented on the
website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.

Directors’
remuneration
Remuneration of non-Executive
Directors
The remuneration of the non-
Executive Directors is determined by
the Board, with the assistance of
independent advice concerning
comparable organisations and
appointments. The non-Executive
Directors do not take part in
discussions on their remuneration.
Neither the non-Executive President
nor the other non-Executive
Directors received any pension or
other benefits from the Group, nor
did they participate in any of the
bonus schemes.
The non-Executive President and
Directors have interests in share
options as disclosed on page 21.
Remuneration of 
Executive Directors
The main aim of the Company’s
Executive pay policy is to secure the
skills and experience needed to meet
its strategic business objectives.
Furthermore, the Company aims to
align the interests of all employees as
closely as possible with the interests
of shareholders through share-based
incentives.
The Company’s Remuneration
Committee decides the remuneration
policy that applies to Executive
Directors. In setting the policy it
considers a number of factors
including:
(a) The basic salaries and benefits
available to Executive Directors of
comparable companies.
(b) The need to attract and retain
Directors of an appropriate
calibre.
(c) The need to ensure Executive
Directors’ commitment to the
continued success of the Group
by means of incentive schemes.
The Company’s remuneration policy
is to:
(a) Have regard to the Directors’
experience and the nature and
complexity of their work in order
to pay a competitive salary that
attracts and retains management
of the highest quality.
(b) Link individual remuneration
packages to the Group’s long term
performance through the award
of share options and incentive
schemes.
(c) Provide post retirement benefits
through defined contribution
pension schemes.
(d) Provide employment-related
benefits including the provision of
a company car (or car allowance)
fuel, medical and life insurance
and insurance relating to the
Directors’ duties.
Salaries
The Remuneration Committee meets
at least once a year in order to
consider and set the annual salaries
for Executive Directors, having regard
to the needs of the Company,
individual responsibilities, personal
performance and independently
compiled salary survey information.
Pensions
The Executive Directors are members
of defined contribution pension
schemes, the assets of which are held
independently of the Company. The
amounts contributed by the
Company (based on salaries
excluding bonuses) for the year
ended 31 March 2004 were £57,000
(2003: £51,000). The Company does
not provide any other post-
retirement benefits to the Directors.

The Executive Directors have
contracts of service that can be
terminated by the Company with the
following notice periods:
Peter Wilkinson 12 months
Charles Cameron 12 months
Andrew Kaberry 6 months
Richard James 12 months
Steve Pearce 6 months
Bryn Sage 6 months
John Swingewood 12 months
With the exception of the contracts
with Charles Cameron, Richard James
and John Swingewood, if the
Company terminates the contract by
notice but other than on giving full
notice, the contracts of service
provide for the payment of a fixed
amount equal to the salary and other
contractual benefits for the
unexpired portion of the
appointment or entitlement to
notice, as the case may be.
Non-Executive
Directorships
The Remuneration Committee
believes that the Group can benefit
from Executive Directors accepting
appointments as non-Executive
directors of other companies. The
Director concerned may retain any
fees related to such employment.

Remuneration report cont. Independent auditors’ report to the
members of InTechnology plc
We have audited the financial
statements which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account,
consolidated statement of total
recognised gains and losses,
reconciliation of movements in
Group shareholders’ funds, balance
sheets, consolidated cash flow
statement, the statement of
accounting policies and the related
notes.
Respective
responsibilities of
Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the annual report and the
financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law
and accounting standards are set out
in the statement of Directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements in accordance
with the relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom
Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. This report,
including the opinion, has been
prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose
or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands
it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in
writing.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and are
properly prepared in accordance with
the United Kingdom Companies Act
1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial
statements, if the company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by
law regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions is not
disclosed.
We read the other information
contained in the Annual Report and
consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information
comprises only the Non-Executive
President’s introduction, Executive
Chairman’s statement, Chief
Executive Officer’s report, the
Financial review, the Products,
Services and Case Studies review, the
Directors’ Report, the Corporate
Governance report and the
Remuneration report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in
accordance with Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by
the Directors in the preparation of
the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s
circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit
so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy
of the presentation of information in
the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial
statements give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group as at 31
March 2004 and of the loss and cash
flows of the Group for the year then
ended and have been properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

27 Accounting policies
28
The financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and applicable
Accounting Standards in the United
Kingdom. A summary of the main
accounting policies which have been
applied consistently, is set out below.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the
historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated profit and loss
account and balance sheet include
the financial statements of the
company and its subsidiary
undertakings up to 31 March. The
results of subsidiaries acquired are
included in the consolidated profit
and loss account from the date on
which control passes. Intra-group
sales and profits are eliminated fully
on consolidation.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, its
assets and liabilities that exist at the
date of acquisition are recorded at
their fair values. All gains and losses
that arise after the group has gained
control of the subsidiary are included
in the post acquisition profit and loss
account.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation
represents the excess of the fair
value of the consideration paid over
the fair value of the identifiable net
assets acquired and is amortised
through the profit and loss account
over its useful economic life. The
Directors have assessed the
estimated useful economic life of
goodwill at 20 years from date of
acquisition based on the strengths of
the underlying businesses and
projected future market growth. The
Directors review the level of goodwill
for impairment at the end of the first
full financial year following
acquisition and in other periods if
events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable.
Tangible fixed assets
The cost of tangible fixed assets is
their purchase cost, together with
any incidental expenses of
acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to
write-off the cost of tangible fixed
assets less their estimated residual
values, on a straight line basis over
the expected useful economic lives of
the assets concerned. The principal
annual rates used for this purpose
are:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold improvements 20%
Office fixtures & fittings 10% to 50%
Vehicles & computer
equipment 20% to 50%
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The Directors review tangible fixed
assets for impairment if events or
changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost
and net realisable value. Provisions
are made for obsolete, slow-moving
and defective items where
appropriate.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when
persuasive evidence of a sales
arrangement exists and the right to
consideration has been earned in
exchange for performance (typically
when delivery has occurred or a
services has been rendered). The
following policies apply to the major
categories of revenue transaction:
Products
Revenue on the outright sale of
equipment and software is
recognised when the product is
delivered to the customer and when
there are no unfulfilled obligations
that affect the customer’s final
acceptance of the arrangement.
Services
Service revenues, including customer
support and maintenance updates,
are recognised over the period to
which the service relates. The terms
of service contracts are typically one
year. Unrecognised service revenue
and cost of sales are included as
deferred income (within creditors due
in less than one year) and deferred
cost of sales (within debtors)
respectively in the balance sheet. Accounting policies cont..
29
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are
recorded at the rate of exchange
ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies
are translated to sterling at the
exchange rates ruling at the balance
sheet date.
The results of overseas subsidiary
undertakings are translated at the
average exchange rate for the year.
The assets and liabilities of such
undertakings are translated at year
end exchange rates. Any resulting
exchange differences are taken to
reserves and are reported in the
statement of total recognised gains
and losses. Exchange differences
arising on borrowings in foreign
currency financing overseas
investments are also dealt with
through reserves, to the extent they
offset exchange adjustments in the
investment.
All other exchange differences are
taken to the profit and loss account.
Lease agreements
Finance lease arrangements, which
transfer to the Group substantially all
the benefits and risks of ownership
of an asset, are treated as if the asset
had been purchased outright. The
assets are included in fixed assets
and the capital element of the
finance leases is shown as
obligations under finance leases. The
finance lease rentals are treated as
consisting of capital and interest
elements. The capital element is
applied to reduce the outstanding
obligations and the interest element
is charged to the profit and loss
account in proportion to the
reducing capital element
outstanding. Assets held under
finance leases are depreciated over
the shorter of the lease term and the
useful lives of equivalent owned
assets.
Costs in respect of operating leases
are charged to the profit and loss
account on a straight line basis over
the term of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Full provision is made for deferred
taxation resulting from timing
differences between profits
computed for taxation purposes and
profits stated in the financial
statements to the extent that there is
an obligation to pay more tax in the
future as a result of the reversal of
those timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that they are considered
more likely than not to be
recoverable in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
not discounted.
Research and development
Research and development
expenditure is written off to the
profit and loss account as incurred.
Pension costs
The Company operates a defined
contribution pension scheme for
employees and directors. The assets
of the scheme are held separately
from those of the Company. The
annual contributions payable are
charged to the profit and loss
account. The Company provides no
other post-retirement benefits to its
employees and directors.
Share schemes
The Group grants share options to
employees and directors on a
discretionary basis. The scheme is
‘unapproved’ and all employees have
agreed in writing to accept liability
for any National Insurance
contributions that become due on
exercise of options.
Debt issue costs
Debt issue costs are capitalised and
offset against the loans to which
they relate. The costs are amortised
over the term of the loan. Notes to the financial statements

The loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of
calculating the diluted earnings per ordinary share are identical to those used for basic earnings per ordinary share. This is
because the exercise of share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore not
dilutive under the terms of FRS 14 “Earnings per share” .

On 1 November 2003 the trade and net assets of Allasso UK Limited were transferred to InTechnology plc at book value,
following which the net investment held by InTechnology in Allasso UK Limited was £10,800,000. As the trade of Allasso
UK Limited was transferred to InTechnology, the value of the investment held is only supported by the net assets and
future cash flows of Allasso UK Limited’s trading subsidiaries, Allasso GmbH and Allasso Benelux bv. Since the transfer
does not impair the future profitability of the Company £8,000,000 has been transferred from investments to goodwill in
the InTechnology company balance sheet.
Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost.

15. Financial instruments
The main financial risks faced by the Group include interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, liquid resources and various items, such as debtors and creditors that
arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading
in financial instruments shall be undertaken. The year end position reflects these policies and there have been no changes
in policies or risks since the year end.
Although the Group has net debt of £10,404,000, £15,000,000 has been agreed at a fixed rate of interest of 8% thus
reducing the levels of interest rate exposure. Group policy is to continue to monitor financial markets and to repay
outstanding loans in line with agreed repayment schedules.
Financial asset returns are maximised by ongoing review of the Group’s cash flow requirements. Any funds surplus to
short-term working capital requirements are placed on interest bearing deposit.
Liquidity risk is further managed by agreeing separate borrowing facilities for any additional working capital and
investment requirements. In accordance with this policy, the Group has negotiated an invoice discounting facility of
£4,669,000 with IBM, which was unused as at 31 March 2004. This facility is provided on a rolling basis and is subject to
60 days notice by either party.
Short term trade debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets

Deferred shares are excluded from the ‘weighted average period to maturity on which no interest is paid’ calculation as
there is no specified maturity date.
Financial liabilities include secured loan arrangements with IBM and Peter Wilkinson and finance leases and are detailed in
note 14. The floating rate sterling and Euro loans bear interest by reference to LIBOR and EURIBOR respectively and are
repayable as set out in note 14.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it. The undrawn committed facilities available as at 31 March, in
respect of which all conditions have been met at that date, were as follows:
2004 2003
£’000 £’000
Expiring within one year 4,669 946
Non-equity shares
A proportion of the Group’s share capital is attributable to non-equity interests, in the form of deferred shares of 1p each.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the deferred shares are described in note 18 to the financial statements.
Fair value
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between
informed and willing parties, other than by a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. The fair value of
financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2004 approximate to the book value at those dates.
41 Notes to the financial statements cont..
15. Financial instruments continued
Currency exposure
The Group seeks to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas by borrowing
as far as possible in the same currencies as the operating currencies of its main operating units. Gains and losses arising
on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the
statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their
local currency. Foreign exchange differences on translation of earnings are taken to the profit and loss account of the Group.

Group and
Company
£’000
At 1 April 2003 235
Credited to the profit and loss account (25)
At 31 March 2004 210
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which
timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet dates.
The deferred tax asset is included in debtors and is analysed as follows:
Group and Company Amount recognised Amount not recognised
2004 2003 2004 2003
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Accelerated capital allowances - - 410 322
Short term timing differences 210 235 - -
Losses carried forward - - 892 892
210 235 1,302 1,214
Based on current capital expenditure plans, the Group does not expect fixed asset timing differences to reverse in the
foreseeable future, hence no deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of accelerated capital allowances. In
addition, in the light of medium term forecasts prepared, the Group does not at present consider it more likely than not
that suitable taxable profits will be available to offset the losses carried forward, hence no deferred tax asset has been
recognised in respect of losses carried forward. In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’, the Directors will continue to
assess whether deferred tax assets should be recognised in respect of these items.

The number of allotted, called up and fully paid shares increased in the year as the Company issued 313,478 shares (2003:
nil shares) in respect of the exercise of employee share options.
Deferred shares differ to ordinary shares in that they do not entitle the holder to receive any dividend or other
distribution; do not entitle the holder to vote at any general meeting of the Company; do entitle the holder on a winding
up to repayment of amounts paid only after payment in respect of each Ordinary Share of the capital paid up and a
further payment of £10,000 on each Ordinary Share and are treated as non-equity shares.
Share options
Certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the Company at prices ranging from 1.8p to 337.5p under the
share option schemes.
During the year the Company issued 313,478 shares (2003: nil shares) in respect of the exercise of employee share options.
The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be
exercised are as follows:

20. Acquisitions
On 31 July 2003 the Group acquired all of the issued share capital of Allasso UK Limited and Allasso France SAS from
Articon-Integralis AG for cash consideration (including costs) of £18,578,000 and contingent consideration to a maximum
of €3,770,000 (£2,520,000 assuming an exchange rate of £1 to €1.496). The contingent consideration is dependent upon
the level of revenue earned from Articon-Integralis AG in the 24 month period following completion. The full contingent
consideration of €3,770,000 is payable if cumulative sales to Articon-Integralis AG reach €61,500,000 by 31 July 2005. 
Based on current trading the Directors estimate that €1,500,000 (£1,003,000 assuming an exchange rate of £1 to €1.496)
of contingent consideration will become payable by 31 July 2005.
The amounts in the following table represent the provisional book and fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and
the consideration paid. Completion accounts have been prepared in respect of the acquisition and are in the process of
being agreed with Articon-Integralis AG. Any adjustments to the book and provisional fair values shown below which
result from this process will be reflected in the Group’s 2004/2005 accounts.

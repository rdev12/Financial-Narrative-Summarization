Chairman’s statement
Adjusted earnings per share, our principal measure of the
Company’s performance, increased by 24.4 per cent to 
84.7 pence per share (2006: 68.1 pence).
The results achieved in 2007 continue to show that both of
Charter’s businesses, ESAB and Howden, are successfully
building upon the investments previously made in restructuring
the businesses and subsequently on enlarging the product
range and on new and improved capacity, much of which 
is now in low cost areas. This has taken place against 
a background of generally strong markets.
As shown opposite, in 2007 Charter generated sales 
of £1,451.1 million (2006: £1,257.9 million), an increase 
of 15.4 per cent, and operating profit of £173.3 million (2006:
£144.6 million), an increase of 19.8 per cent. Adjusted profit
before tax was £181.1 million (2006: £145.8 million), an
increase of 24.2 per cent, and profit attributable to equity
shareholders was £137.8 million (2006: £123.4 million), 
an increase of 11.7 per cent. 
As a reflection of the Company’s strong results and much
improved financial position, the Board is recommending a final
dividend of 12 pence per share.
Balance sheet and cash flow
During the year, equity shareholders’ funds increased by
£180.3 million to £426.4 million, reflecting the profit attributable
to equity shareholders generated during the year of 
£137.8 million, the net reduction in retirement benefit
obligations of £11.9 million, the exchange translation gain 
of £25.1 million plus other items of £5.5 million.
During the year, cash generated from operations was 
£149.1 million (2006: £106.8 million), an increase of 39.6 
per cent. Capital expenditure was £47.7 million (2006: 
£24.5 million), an increase of 94.7 per cent. The depreciation
charge for the year was £14.7 million (2006: £13.5 million).
Various acquisitions, including an increased shareholding 
in ESAB India, cost £26.2 million. Net cash, which stood at
£43.1 million at the end of 2006, increased to £88.2 million 
at 31 December 2007.
I am pleased to present another
successful year for Charter in my 
first report to you as Chairman.

Dividend
The Board has decided to recommend a final dividend in
respect of 2007 of 12 pence per share. Subject to approval 
by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 May
2008, the dividend will be paid on 23 May 2008, to holders 
of ordinary shares registered on 2 May 2008.
The Board envisages a progressive dividend policy under
which payments to Shareholders will reflect future growth 
in earnings per share and anticipates declaring an interim
dividend at the time of the interim results, subject to the
general economic and financial conditions in the principal
markets in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate.

Chairman
12 March 2008  06 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Chief Executive’s statement
Charter delivered excellent results 
for 2007, building on the performance
reported in earlier years and at the half
year. These results were achieved
against the background of generally
favourable market conditions that
prevailed during the year. 
In 2007, sales increased by 15.4 per cent to £1,451.1 million,
notwithstanding a negative currency impact of 2.2 per cent.
Adjusted operating profit increased to £173.8 million, despite
adverse currency movements of £1.5 million. 
Our principal measure of the value that we are creating for
shareholders is adjusted earnings per share, which increased
by 24.4 per cent to 84.7 pence per share. 
Summary of results
The key performance indicators used by the Board in assessing
the results of the welding, cutting and automation business
(‘ESAB’), the air and gas handling business (‘Howden’) and 
the consolidated results of Charter are summarised in the
following table, alongside comparatives for 2006. 
In relation to each indicator, the outcome for the year is
considered against the outcome for the previous year and
against budget, taking into account internal and external
factors, and any unusual or non-recurring items, which
otherwise might have a distorting effect on the outcome. 
The results for 2007 continue the trend of ten successive 
half years of growth in adjusted earnings per share, as the
businesses have been strengthened and improved.
ESAB achieved strong increases in its sales and operating
profit, which were in line with the demanding targets set by
the Board, and which reflected generally favourable market
conditions and the significant efforts made to develop the
business in recent years. Margins improved with increased
activity and operational improvements in the business.
Howden’s increases in sales and operating profit were also 
in line with the targets set by the Board. These targets
reflected generally favourable market conditions and also the
changing composition of Howden’s business as higher sales
to customers in North America and Europe offset the
anticipated fall in sales to customers in China. Margins
continued to move forward.
The Board considers that the best measure of the extent 
to which Charter is generating shareholder value is adjusted
earnings per share, which is considered against budget and
against the performance of a peer group of companies. The
actual growth in adjusted earnings per share achieved by Charter
in 2007 of 24.4 per cent was ahead of budget and ranked
favourably alongside the growth achieved by its peer group.
It is recognised that financial performance is not a sufficient
measure on its own. Non-financial key performance indicators,
such as health and safety and environmental measures, are
monitored with robust plans in place to continuously improve
performance. These matters receive regular focus, both from
management and the Board and are reported on in the
Company’s Corporate social responsibility report.

Status of businesses
During 2007, both ESAB and Howden continued to build
upon their market leadership positions, through commissioning
new factories, enhancing their product ranges and entering
new countries and regions. ESAB and Howden are continuing
the process of change and development that have been
implemented over the last five years, during which time ESAB
has significantly developed its presence in emerging markets
and Howden has redefined itself from being a manufacturer 
to being an applications engineer. 
In 2007, ESAB continued to focus on the creation of value
from its customer relationships, technology and manufacturing
facilities. ESAB’s markedly improved financial performance,
over recent years, has been made possible by operational
improvements which include positioning a significant part of 
its manufacturing capacity in low cost locations in Europe and
elsewhere, driving high levels of plant utilisation and increasing
the economic scale of operations. The shortfall in capital
expenditure that occurred whilst Charter was suffering from
excessively high levels of indebtedness has now been largely
remedied. Significant increases in capacity, which have been
underway since mid-2006, are due to complete by the middle
of this year. This new capacity is focused on high growth
products and is predominantly located in developing economies,
such as China, from where a significant amount of product is
now exported. We expect to undertake continued investment
in solid wire capacity, increased geographic coverage and also
in cost reduction programmes. The benefits of the Lean
initiative, which was launched in 2005, continued to grow 
in 2007. It is being expanded beyond manufacturing to other
areas of the business including logistics and administration. 
Within the ESAB welding business, the standard equipment
business grew significantly in 2007, with revenue up some 
15 per cent and margins improving towards our expectations.
The development of the business will take another significant
step forward later this year with the opening of the new
equipment factory in China. This will supply a middle market
range of welding equipment to customers in Asia. The cutting
and automation business recovered from the problems
reported in the first half, with an overall margin for the year 
of 8.9 per cent, and finished the year with record order books. 
During 2007, Howden grew sales by nearly 12 per cent to
£480.3 million. It also achieved a better balance in business
between Europe, North America, China and the rest of the
world; each of which accounted for around one-quarter of its
sales. In 2007 margins grew by 30 basis points compared to
2006. Sales to customers in Europe and North America grew
significantly during the year. We expect these sales to remain
strong in 2008. Despite the fall in sales to China during 2007,
it will remain a significant market for Howden.
The principal markets where Howden sells its fans, new 
build coal-fired power generating plant and emission control
equipment, remained strong. High levels of worldwide
investment in the oil and gas and petrochemical industries
were maintained during 2007 and Howden continues to 
focus on these sectors with both fans and compressors.
Howden’s compressor business made considerable progress
during 2007, with the successful integration of Howden
Compressors (in which we acquired the outstanding 51 per
cent shareholding in December 2006) and the opening of the
new compressor factory in China. Howden is pursuing other
areas where its compressor technology can be put to good
use. Wastewater treatment is perceived as a significant
opportunity given the growing water shortages in China and
many other countries.
During 2007, Howden successfully grew its aftermarket
business, with revenue and margins up 10.3 per cent and 
150 basis points respectively. The Chinese aftermarket
business progressed well during the year. It is ahead of plan
and we are focused on ensuring that Howden becomes 
a major force in the Chinese aftermarket. 
At 31 December 2007, Howden’s order book stood at 
£416.7 million, a record year-end level and an increase 
of 15.4 per cent compared to the end of 2006. It has
continued to grow in the first two months of 2008, and at the
end of February was a record, standing at over £500 million. 08 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Chief Executive’s statement (continued)
Acquisitions and disposals
ESAB and Howden completed a number of acquisitions
during the year. The combined cost of these acquisitions, 
net of cash acquired, was some £25 million, details of which
are given in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.
In July, ESAB acquired the business and assets of ATAS, 
a cutting technology company, and Air Liquide’s Argentine
welding business. ESAB also increased its stake in ESAB
India, the market leader in India, from 37.3 per cent to 
55.6 per cent. In October, ESAB completed the acquisition 
of Electrodi Ihtiman, the market leader for welding electrodes
in Bulgaria, which will give ESAB enhanced access to markets
in the Balkan region. 
In July, Howden acquired the outstanding 50 per cent
shareholding in its subsidiary, Bateman Howden South Africa
(Pty) Ltd, which designs and services gas cleaning systems used
in coal-fired power stations. Howden also disposed of its non-
core shareholding of 42 per cent in Pump Brands Pty Limited. 
Outlook
The outlook for both businesses remains positive. Demand 
for welding and cutting products is determined largely by
worldwide consumption of steel, which is expected to grow 
at around 5 per cent per year in the short to medium term.
Higher growth in demand from Brazil, Russia, India and China,
and other emerging economies is expected to more than
offset any slowdown in North America and Western Europe.
Process conversion (the move away from electrodes to
continuous processes) continues, particularly in emerging
markets. This results in stronger growth in demand for solid
and flux cored wires than for higher margin electrodes.
However, growth is expected in all product areas as market
consolidation takes place. The increased use of continuous
processes will mean more opportunity for ESAB’s welding
equipment, and the shortage of skilled welders is likely to
increase the opportunity for advanced automated solutions.
The outlook for end markets is further strengthened by 
major developments taking place in energy, oil and gas and
infrastructure around the world. The strong demand for ships
is being maintained with shipyards around the world heavily
loaded for the next few years.
A significant part of Howden’s business is the supply of
equipment to the electricity supply industry, most particularly
for use in coal-fired generating plant. As such, demand for
new Howden equipment is strongly influenced by the
construction of new coal-fired power stations. 
We expect that the worldwide construction of new electricity
generating capacity will continue at historic highs and with 
the continued high price of natural gas and concerns over
its future supply, as well as the on-going public debate over
nuclear power, we expect coal to continue to be seen as 
an attractive primary energy source. The International Energy
Agency (‘IEA’) predicts that the global coal-fired generating
capacity will almost double by 2030, implying a net annual
average addition of 57 GW of new plant per year. In China,
construction of new coal-fired generating capacity over this
period is expected to average 30 GW per year, which is more
than the UK’s entire present coal-fired generating capacity.
There is also some evidence to suggest that, in China, older
generating capacity will be replaced sooner than previously
expected. This underlines that China will remain an important
market for Howden. In other emerging economies, such as
India and Central and Eastern Europe, and in more mature
economies, such as Western Europe and North America, 
we expect increasing new build of coal-fired power plants,
accompanied by the refurbishment and upgrading of 
existing plant. 
Governmental regulations can also stimulate demand for a
number of Howden products, particularly in the environmental
protection sector, where Howden supplies equipment for use
in processes which reduce atmospheric pollution generated
by coal-fired power stations and industrial plant. Demand for
emission control products has been an important factor
behind the upturn in orders from customers in North America.
In the longer term the commercialisation of processes to
capture and store CO2 will provide an opportunity for Howden.
We expect increasing demand for Howden products from the
petrochemical and oil and gas industries. The high level of oil
prices seen during 2007 continues to stimulate investment,
particularly in the refining sector. We see major potential for
this sector going forward.
The power industry
The IEA forecasts that worldwide coal-fired electricity generating
capacity will almost double by 2030. This corresponds to an
average of 57 GW of net new capacity being added each year. 
Demand for electricity in China is expected to increase broadly 
in line with GDP growth. To meet this increasing demand, each
year on average, China is expected to add 30 GW of net
additional coal-fired generating capacity. China is therefore
expected to remain an important market for Howden.
In addition to the construction of new generating capacity, Howden
expects to benefit from ongoing programmes worldwide for the
retrofitting of emission control equipment to existing capacity.

Howden has opened representative offices in both India and
Russia and remains optimistic about the prospects for these
two significant markets where future potential is high.
Charter’s strategy
Charter’s strategy is to deliver sustained growth in shareholder
value through the development of ESAB and Howden as
leaders in their respective fields.
A comprehensive review of strategy was undertaken during
2007 which was approved by the Board in September 2007.
This confirmed the potential for Charter to continue to make
significant progress in operating profit and earnings over the
next five years. 
The Board concluded that Charter should remain focused 
on its two businesses, both of which it believes are capable 
of further development and the creation of significant
additional value for shareholders.
ESAB will:
• enhance its market leadership through brand recognition,
new technology and enhanced customer service;
• act as a consolidator in the global welding industry, using
acquisitions to strengthen market positions, enter new
markets and improve its technology base;
• leverage its global footprint through establishing
manufacturing facilities in locations which best suit 
the needs of the market; and
• achieve growth through increasing volumes in 
developing markets and through range expansion,
especially into high-end technology products, 
in established developed markets.
Howden will:
• build upon its world-leading position as an applications
engineer, which designs, manufactures, installs and
maintains performance critical components for air and 
gas handling;
• maintain and enhance its position in all those regions where
there is expected to be significant new build of coal-fired
generating capacity and emission control equipment;
• develop further its position in the petrochemicals industry, 
in particular with compressors;
• enhance its presence in other industries where its
technology and expertise can be used to advantage; and
• continue to develop its aftermarket business, in particular
as recently installed equipment requires maintenance.
Current trading and prospects
As we progress through 2008, we see significant opportunities
for both ESAB and Howden arising from their global presence,
market leadership positions, their strong technology and flexible
cost bases, supported by Charter’s strengthened balance
sheet. There are positive long-term dynamics in key end-user
segments of both ESAB and Howden, such as power, oil and
gas, petrochemicals and shipbuilding. 
The current year has started well. Markets remain strong with
positive trends in both the mature markets of Europe and North
America and the emerging markets worldwide, with particular
strength in South America. The Board, therefore, views the
outlook for 2008 at this early stage of the year with confidence.

growth in shareholder value through
the development of ESAB and Howden
as leaders in their respective fields. 10 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Business and financial review – ESAB
ESAB’s comprehensive range of welding consumables includes electrodes, cored and solid wires and fluxes.
ESAB’s welding equipment ranges from small retail uses to large plant in the energy and shipbuilding sectors.
ESAB’s sales are split broadly evenly between the developed economies of Western and Northern Europe
and North America, and the developing economies of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, South America
and Asia. ESAB derives over 80 per cent of its sales from welding consumables and equipment and the
remainder from cutting and automation solutions.
ESAB’s manufacturing facilities are located predominantly in low cost locations, in particular in Central 
and Eastern Europe, South America and Asia. ESAB has invested heavily in new capacity in China to meet
the needs of domestic customers as well as supplying other parts of the world. 
Further growth will come through ESAB increasing its sales of welding consumables, particularly in
emerging economies, and increasing the range and market penetration of its equipment and automation
businesses, which it will do through a combination of organic growth and acquisition.

from 37 per cent to 56 per cent;
– Air Liquide’s Argentine welding business;
– Electrodi Ihtiman, the leading Bulgarian manufacturer 
of welding electrodes; and
– ATAS, a cutting technology company in Germany.
• ESAB completed its programme to increase capacity 
for the production of welding consumables by 20 per cent
(90,000 tonnes) by mid-2007 and expects to increase
capacity by a further 10 per cent by mid-2008.
• A new welding equipment factory in China is due 
to open in 2008. 12 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Major global end-user segments are: 
• Shipbuilding and offshore industries, which are amongst 
the largest and most demanding users of both welding 
and cutting products;
• Construction, where welding plays an important role in 
the fabrication of commercial buildings, bridges, railways
and other infrastructure;
• Transport (including automotive and mobile machinery),
which requires technically demanding welding solutions
within the highly automated production environments 
of most automotive OEMs. This segment also includes 
‘off road’ vehicles such as excavators, dumpers and
agricultural equipment, which generally require high levels 
of welding;
• Pipelines and pipe mills, which is focused on the production
and installation of oil and gas pipeline networks across
countries and continents, for example from Siberia to Europe;
• The energy sector, which uses considerable quantities 
of welding consumables in the construction of energy
generating plants, including nuclear. Wind towers are a
rapidly growing sub-segment of the electricity generating
industry, the construction of which uses relatively high 
levels of welding consumables; and
• Oil and gas and process industries, which includes
refineries, petrochemicals, pulp and paper and food
processing. Equipment in these industries often operates 
in hostile environments that demand specialists materials,
including stainless steels and specialist alloy materials 
and require technically demanding welding solutions.
Overview of performance
In 2007, ESAB recorded another excellent performance, with
sales of £970.8 million (2006: £828.4 million), an increase of
17.2 per cent, and operating profit of £126.6 million (2006:
£102.1 million), an increase of 24.0 per cent. The operating
margin improved to 13.0 per cent (2006: 12.3 per cent).
Out of the total sales growth of 17.2 per cent, 8.0 per cent
came from consumables volume growth, 3.0 per cent from
consumables product mix and price increases, 6.1 per cent
from the equipment, cutting and automation businesses and
2.0 per cent from acquisitions, reduced by 1.9 per cent due 
to currency impacts, in particular the US dollar. 
Volumes were up in all product groups, particularly welding
consumables and standard equipment, continuing the trend
seen in the first half of the year with continued strength in
demand from shipbuilding, oil and gas and other industries.
Sales grew in each region, with a particularly strong
performance in South America.
The increases in operating profit and margin achieved by ESAB
in 2007 reflect on-going operational improvements and high
levels of capacity utilisation throughout the year.
The cutting and automation business recovered from its
disappointing first half performance as it overcame the previously
reported difficulties and produced an overall operating margin
of 8.9 per cent for the year. As at 31 December 2007, the
order books stood at record levels.
Industries and segmentation
The global welding and cutting market is estimated to amount
to in excess of US $17 billion per annum. In monetary terms,
Europe and North America account for just under half of the
global market, and are broadly matched by the more rapidly
growing emerging markets of China and the rest of the world
(predominantly Asia). 
The welding and cutting of steel and other metals takes place
in many industries. Although steel remains the most widely
used metal, aluminium and high performance alloys are being
increasingly used to construct sections of ships, offshore
platforms and in the automotive industry. 
What does the ESAB brand stand for? 
The ESAB brand, with its Swedish engineering heritage, is
synonymous with good designs, reliability and over 100 years of
experience since Oscar Kjellberg first invented the coated welding
electrode back in 1904. Since then, ESAB has become a world
leader in welding and cutting with sales, technical support and
know-how available across the world, providing customers with
complete confidence.
Today, ESAB produces consumables and equipment for virtually
every welding and cutting process and application. ESAB’s
subsidiaries and distributors work in partnership to find the
optimum solution for customers’ businesses wherever in the
world that may be and however large or small the requirement.

Industry overview
Demand
Demand for welding and cutting products is determined
largely by worldwide consumption of steel and, to a lesser 
but growing extent, of other metals, such as aluminium and
advanced alloys.
The International Iron and Steel Institute (‘IISI’) estimates that
world production of crude steel in 2007 was 1,343.5 million
metric tonnes (‘mmt’), an increase of 7.5 per cent compared
with 2006. China produced 489.0 mmt (2006: 422.7 mmt), 
an increase of 15.7 per cent, and accounted for 36.4 per cent
of global steel production (2006: 33.8 per cent). The rest 
of the world increased production by 3.2 per cent. The IISI
estimates that the demand for steel will continue to grow 
at around 5 per cent per year in the medium term.
ESAB estimates that worldwide consumption of weld metal 
in 2007 amounted to in excess of 4.4 mmt, annual growth 
of around 10 per cent, of which some 70 per cent was
consumed in Asia. Worldwide growth is expected to continue
for the foreseeable future, led by increased consumption 
in China and other emerging economies.
The welding market continues to experience ‘process
conversion’ whereby end-users migrate from the use of
welding electrodes to higher productivity welding processes,
which use continuous consumables such as welding wires.
Whilst this conversion process is close to maturity in markets
such as parts of Europe, North America and Japan, it will
continue for the foreseeable future at varying rates within the
world’s emerging markets, particularly in China and elsewhere
in Asia. 
Competitive environment
ESAB operates in a competitive environment, consisting 
of a relatively small number of companies that operate on 
a multinational basis and a much larger number of smaller
companies which operate in regional or product niches.
ESAB estimates that it has an 11 per cent share, by value, 
of the global welding and cutting markets. Globally, ESAB is
the leading supplier of welding consumables. In the welding
and cutting markets as a whole, it is the clear industry 
leader outside North America where it ranks behind the two
market leaders.

Source: ESAB estimates
ESAB aims to maintain and strengthen its competitive 
position by being able to provide comprehensive, technically
advanced and cost effective solutions to meet customers’
welding and cutting demands. ESAB’s brand and its Swedish
engineering heritage are important factors underpinning ESAB’s
relationships with existing and new customers. Given the
relatively high costs of transporting welding and cutting
materials, the location of welding consumables and
equipment factories close to end-users can also be 
an important factor in maintaining competitiveness.
ESAB supply chain
Manufacturing locations
ESAB has made considerable progress in relocating its
manufacturing facilities to low cost locations, in particular 
in Central Europe, China and Mexico. Certain facilities remain
in relatively high cost areas, which is justified by strategic
reasons such as the availability of specific expertise.
Following the success of the pilot programmes, ESAB has
continued to roll out its Lean-manufacturing programme to all
manufacturing sites in its organisation. During the first half of
2008, initial focus is being directed to ESAB India and China.
ESAB will continue to focus on Lean initiatives to ensure that
Lean principles are adopted throughout the organisation, 
to include applications in logistics and administration.
During the year, ESAB completed an increase of around 
20 per cent (90,000 tonnes) in its welding consumables
manufacturing capacity, which is mainly located in China,
Central Europe and South America. Further increases 
in capacity are scheduled for the first half of 2008, including 
the planned opening of a new consumables factory in Weihai,
China and a new equipment factory in Zhangjiagang, China.
ESAB’s manufacturing presence in low cost areas was
enhanced through the increase, during 2007, of its ownership
of ESAB India. 14 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Technical developments and new products 
To assist ESAB in remaining at the forefront of the welding
industry, a programme of continuous development of new
welding products is undertaken, which reflect prevailing trends
in the global industry, in particular customers seeking higher
productivity from a generally less skilled workforce and the 
use of increasingly sophisticated materials to be joined by
thinner and stronger welding material.
Welding 
ESAB’s market-leading OK AristoRod™ series of solid wires
has been further enhanced and now offers even higher
welding quality. The AristoRod™ product is used extensively 
in robotic welding applications in industries such as
shipbuilding and the automotive sector, where higher levels 
of welding performance are being demanded. Additionally,
new flux products were developed for cladding applications
and for the welding of pipe steels in spiral pipe production.
ESAB has introduced new welding equipment products
related to the tungsten inert gas (‘TIG’) welding process that
makes mechanised and orbital TIG welding easier. ESAB has
also expanded its AC/DC TIG offering including a new range
of TIG torches with remote control capabilities and has
launched the Friction Stir Welding (‘FSW’) robot, which greatly
enhances the possibility of the FSW range.
The research and development facility in Chennai, India, for
welding consumables, welding equipment and cutting systems
is now fully operational. It employs some 15 research engineers
and provides global support to ESAB’s businesses.
Cutting and automation
In 2007, the principal cutting and automation developments
focused on improving value and productivity for the end-user.
These included the new Production Data Management
software product for data linking the production to the
available planning systems. 
ESAB also introduced the new AUTOREX facility, which is 
the first encapsulated production cell for quiet, clean plasma
cutting. The AUTOREX is below the limit of noise control
regulations and eliminates the need for special noise control
measures in the production environment.
Business and financial review – ESAB (continued)
Raw materials
The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of welding
consumables are various grades of steel and to a lesser
extent, aluminium alloys, chemicals and minerals, most of
which are normally available on the open market. However,
certain of ESAB’s more specialised welding wires require
bespoke orders from steel mills.
In the case of welding equipment, automation and cutting, the
most significant items purchased are electronic components,
copper and aluminium alloys.
Whilst energy costs are less significant than raw material costs
in ESAB’s own manufacturing process, they are significant
costs in the production of steel, aluminium and copper, and
therefore indirectly impact upon the cost of goods sold.
Human resources
ESAB recognises that human resources are a key part of 
its supply chain. ESAB’s policy is to attract, train and retain
management resources within the group, which includes 
the recruitment and training of shop floor personnel.
Intellectual property
A key component of every welding electrode or cored wire
is the formulation of the electrode coating or cored wire filling.
This produces the unique welding properties of each individual
product. ESAB’s international development team has market
leading expertise and significant experience in these areas.
Similarly, manufacturing process knowledge is critical to
achieving optimal product characteristics, as well as maximising
production efficiency, from which the customer benefits through
superior products and lower manufacturing costs.
ESAB is strongly focused on providing customers with
complete process solutions, and has built a number of
process centres throughout the world where experienced
welding engineers combine their knowledge with ESAB’s
broad range of welding and cutting products to develop 
the optimal solution for each customer.
ESAB and the environment
As a world leader in the welding and cutting industry, ESAB 
is committed to continuously improving its environmental
performance.
As a demonstration of its commitment to control its environmental
impact, ESAB was the first company within the welding industry
to achieve ISO 14001 certification.
A significant further step forward in 2007 was the external
certification of ESAB’s management systems to OHSAS 18001.
Additional information on ESAB’s commitment to the environment
is contained within the Corporate social responsibility report. Charter plc Annual Report 2007 15
Regional overview of performance
ESAB’s revenue by destination is summarised in the table
below. During 2007, ESAB once again experienced sales
growth in all five regions. 
In 2007, ESAB’s sales were split broadly equally between 
the developed economies of Western and Northern Europe
and North America and the developing economies of Central,
Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia and South America.
Regional markets 
Europe
ESAB is the leading welding company in Europe, which remains
ESAB’s most important region, representing 48.9 per cent 
of its total sales during the year. In 2007, sales to customers 
in Western and Northern Europe broadly matched sales 
to customers in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. 
Within the Western and Northern European markets, there
was generally solid growth with some notable performances
from Germany and the UK, where sales grew by 17.4 and
13.2 per cent respectively. Sales to customers in Central,
Eastern and Southern Europe grew faster, with particularly
strong performances in Russia (up 31.3 per cent) and
Southern Europe (up 23.0 per cent). 
Increased volumes were seen across all types of welding
consumables, driven by sales to the shipbuilding, offshore
energy, pipelines and pipe mills and general industrial
segments. Standard equipment sales performed strongly
during the year. The cutting and automation business also
produced a strong increase in revenue compared to 2006. 
In October, ESAB completed the acquisition of Electrodi
Ihtiman, the leading manufacturer of welding electrodes in
Bulgaria. ESAB intends to use the company as a platform from
which to access the Balkan region. ESAB also completed the
purchase of ATAS, a German cutting technology business.
Consumables manufacturing capacity was added at the
Vamberk plant in the Czech Republic and in Russia.
North America 
ESAB Group Inc recorded sales in North America of 
£213.4 million (2006: £210.2 million), an increase of 1.5 per
cent. This result was negatively impacted by the depreciation
of the US dollar against sterling compared to 2006. In US dollar
terms, sales were some 8.4 per cent ahead of the previous
year. Operating profits were markedly ahead of 2006 in both
sterling and local currency terms.

Map of manufacturing locations – Europe
ESAB’s production of welding consumables is concentrated 
in low cost locations in Central Europe. The largest welding
consumables plants are at Vamberk in the Czech Republic,
Katowice in Poland and Mór in Hungary. Increasingly, only
specialised consumables are manufactured within the 
Nordic region.
ESAB acquired the plant at Ihtiman in Bulgaria during 2007. 
This will be used to service welding consumables markets 
in the Balkan region. 
Standard equipment is manufactured at Laxå in Sweden, 
and in Opole in Poland. Cutting equipment is manufactured
at Karben in Germany and ESAB automated welding products
are manufactured at Laxå. 16 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Business and financial review – ESAB (continued)
ESAB’s cutting operation in China continued to perform well
during 2007, with a significant order being won for a shipyard
in China.
Further expansion of ESAB’s welding consumables
manufacturing capacity is underway through the construction
of a new consumables plant in Weihai to serve the Chinese
shipbuilding industry.
ESAB also expects to complete a new equipment factory next
to its existing consumables plant at Zhangjiagang in the first
half of 2008. This will increase the competitiveness of the
equipment offering in China and throughout the rest of Asia.
Rest of world 
Asia Pacific (excluding China)
In 2007, ESAB performed well, mainly due to volume driven
sales growth from key shipbuilding, mining and offshore 
oil and gas customers, particularly in Singapore, Malaysia 
and Australia. ESAB increased its manufacturing presence 
in the region with the expansion of its consumables plant 
in Indonesia.
India
ESAB increased its holding in ESAB India from 37.3 per cent 
to 55.6 per cent in September 2007, from which time it became
a subsidiary and accordingly its results were fully consolidated.
ESAB India produced another year of strong sales growth 
in both its consumables and equipment businesses, driven 
by energy, heavy engineering and wind turbines.
A new equipment assembly factory was opened in Chennai
during the year and further expansion is planned for the first
half of 2008. 
The growth in welding sales reflected a recovery from the
effects of the strike in 2006 and the underlying strength in
demand from its principal end-user segments. ESAB focuses
on a limited number of industrial segments in North America,
in particular naval shipbuilding, energy, infrastructure and rail
cars, which together accounted for around one-half of welding
consumables sales. 
During the year, ESAB secured a key automotive contract
benefiting the consumables businesses. Progress in the
cutting business continued.
South America 
ESAB’s business in South America produced an excellent
result, with sales growing by some 29.2 per cent. Operating
profit was also strongly ahead.
The increase in turnover was driven by demand from the
shipbuilding, power generation, mining and sugar and alcohol
segments in Brazil and Argentina.
Sales of Eutectic products, which are made under licence 
by ESAB in Brazil, increased markedly due to strong demand
from the mining industry.
ESAB’s presence in the region was strengthened through the
acquisition of Air Liquide’s Argentine welding business in July.
Further capacity for the production of welding consumables and
equipment is scheduled to be operational in the first half of 2008.
China
2007 saw further progress in ESAB’s strategy of establishing 
a meaningful manufacturing and sales presence in the country. 
ESAB has continued its dual sales strategy for China, with
strong growth in both domestic and export sales. Sales to
customers in China were £24.7 million (2006: £20.9 million),
an increase of 18.2 per cent (22.0 per cent in local currency
terms). Export sales increased by over 300 per cent.

ESAB’s principal consumables factory in China is located 
in Zhangjiagang. This was opened in July 2006 and was fully
commissioned during 2007. Capacity is currently 57,000 tonnes
and further capacity is in the process of being added. A new
consumables plant is under construction in Weihai, strategically
located near to the rapidly growing Chinese shipbuilding industry.
ESAB is in the process of constructing a new equipment plant 
in Zhangjiagang, which will supply a new mid-market range 
of welding equipment for sale in Asia and is expected to be
completed in the first half of 2008.
ESAB has also established a cutting factory in Shanghai as a centre
of excellence to service the Chinese and other Asian markets. Charter plc Annual Report 2007 17
Middle East and Africa
In the Middle East, ESAB’s revenue has seen continued
growth in 2007, led by increasing sales to the energy,
construction and shipyard sectors in the UAE, Qatar and
Saudi Arabia. 
Associated undertakings
ESAB’s share of the post tax profits of associates was 
£3.0 million (2006: £4.3 million), a decrease of 30.2 per cent.
ESAB India was accounted for as an associate until September
2007, from which time it was accounted for as a subsidiary.
ESAB’s only remaining associated undertaking is ESAB SeAH

Acquisition of ESAB India
In September 2007, ESAB increased its shareholding in ESAB
India from 37.3 per cent to 55.6 per cent at which time it became
a subsidiary. ESAB India is the market leader in the Indian
welding market, with manufacturing facilities located in Nagpur,
Kolkata and Chennai, where a new equipment factory was
opened in 2007 alongside the existing consumables plant.
ESAB believes that the Indian economy will continue to enjoy
sustained growth, leading to further strong growth in the
demand for welding products, particularly in the construction,
transportation (including automotive), energy and oil and 
gas industries.
There is also the prospect of ESAB India supplying product 
to adjacent markets in the Indian sub-continent, Asia and 
East Africa. 18 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Business and financial review – Howden
Howden’s core products include centrifugal and axial fans, air and gas rotary preheaters and compressors.
Howden’s fans and heaters are integral parts of the coal-fired boiler and emission control systems used 
by the power industry. Howden also makes significant sales to the oil and gas, mining, iron and steel and
other process industries. 
Howden’s sales are split broadly equally between the developed economies of Europe and North America,
and emerging economies, in particular China, the rest of Asia and South Africa. 
Howden derives approximately one-quarter of its revenues through aftermarket sales, which benefit 
from its extensive installed product base.
As Howden has increasingly concentrated on the higher value-added parts of its activities, the manufacture
of non-performance-critical components has increasingly been outsourced to sub-contractors in low 
cost locations.
Howden’s strategy envisages increased sales to the power and oil and gas industries, where Howden 
has an established presence and the long-term dynamics remain extremely positive, and to other industries
where Howden’s applications engineering expertise offers significant opportunities. Aftermarket sales 
are expected to increase reflecting recent sales of new equipment.

Business and financial review – Howden (continued)
Outstanding orders from customers in Europe and China
amounted to £107.9 million and £90.3 million respectively,
representing 25.9 per cent and 21.7 per cent of the order
book, compared with £104.8 million and £98.0 million
respectively as at 31 December 2006.
The order book largely reflects contracted future sales of new
equipment. Order lead times are typically 9 to 18 months,
generally being shorter in China and longer in Europe and
North America. The order book at 31 December 2007
represented approximately 12 months of new equipment sales
(based on the average monthly sales achieved in 2007).
Industries and segmentation
As at the end of 2007, the total market for Howden products
was estimated at £2.4 billion, including aftermarket, of which
the power, petrochemical and oil and gas industries are the
largest components. Other users of Howden products include
the steel, mining, cement and wastewater treatment industries.
The products supplied by Howden to its principal global 
end-user market segments include: 
• Power generation – fans and rotary heat exchangers 
for boilers and emission control, such as Flue Gas
Desulphurisation (‘FGD’) plant and denitrification; cooling
fans for dry cooling systems;
• Petrochemical plant and oil and gas – fans and compressors
for refineries, ethanol and methanol production, and other
processes; compressors and specialised fans for offshore
platforms; cooling fans for heat exchangers and condensers;
• Steel – heavy duty fans for iron ore beneficiation plant
(sintering and pelletising) and for basic oxygen and electric
arc furnace steelmaking;

Overview of performance
Howden achieved another set of strong results in 2007 with
sales of £480.3 million (2006: £429.5 million), an increase 
of 11.8 per cent (14.6 per cent at constant exchange rates).
Operating profit for the period was £57.6 million (2006: 
£50.3 million), an increase of 14.5 per cent (17.1 per cent 
at constant exchange rates). Net operating margin increased
to 12.0 per cent (2006: 11.7 per cent). 
Out of the total sales growth of 11.8 per cent, 7.2 per cent
came from new build, 3.7 per cent from aftermarket and 
3.7 per cent from acquisitions, reduced by 2.8 per cent due 
to adverse currency impacts, in particular the US dollar.
The results achieved by Howden in 2007 reflected increased
demand for Howden products for use in generation and
emission control equipment in the electricity supply industries
in North America and Europe and from the oil and gas
sectors, which offset reduced sales to customers in China.
Sales were spread broadly evenly across Europe, North
America, China and the rest of the world (principally South
Africa, Australia, South America and the rest of Asia).
As at 31 December 2007, the order book was £416.7 million
(2006: £361.0 million), a year-end record, representing an
increase of 15.4 per cent. 
Aftermarket sales were £121.5 million (2006: £110.2 million)
an increase of 10.3 per cent, partly reflecting increased sales
in China. Margins and operating profit also increased.
Order book
As at 31 December 2007, the order book stood at £416.7 million
(31 December 2006: £361.0 million), an increase of 15.4 per
cent. Orders booked in the year were £536 million (2006:
£487 million), an increase of 10.1 per cent. The increase in the
order book during the period primarily arose from customers
in North America. 
As at 31 December 2007, outstanding orders from customers
in North America amounted to £143.3 million, representing
34.4 per cent of the total order book, compared with 
£99.0 million as at 31 December 2006, an increase of 
44.7 per cent.

Industry overview
Demand
A significant part of Howden’s business is the supply of
equipment to the electricity supply industry, most particularly
for use in coal-fired generating plant. As such, demand 
for new Howden equipment is strongly influenced by the
construction of new coal-fired power stations. Howden
equipment is also used in the production of oil and gas,
petrochemicals, steel and cement, in the deep mining of
commodities such as gold and platinum and in wastewater
treatment. As with many capital goods industries, the
aftermarket represents an important part of the total market.
With the continued high price of natural gas and concerns
over its future supply, as well as the on-going public debate
over nuclear power, coal continues to be seen as an attractive
primary energy source. The IEA projects that the global coal-
fired generating capacity will almost double by 2030, implying
a net annual average addition of 57 GW of new plant. 
In China, construction of new coal-fired generating capacity
over this period is expected to average 30 GW per year, which
is more than the UK’s entire present coal-fired generating
capacity. There is also some evidence to suggest that older
generating capacity will also be replaced sooner than
previously expected. This underlines that China will remain an
important market for Howden.
In other emerging economies, such as India and Central/Eastern
Europe, and in more mature economies, such as Western
Europe and North America, Howden expects increasing 
new build of coal-fired power plants, accompanied by 
the refurbishment and upgrading of existing plant. 
Howden order book
During 2007, the order book grew to £417 million (2006: £361
million), an increase of 15.5 per cent. The absolute and relative
dependency on China has reduced, and orders from customers 
in other parts of the world, especially North America and Europe,
have increased. 
The order book predominantly reflects demand for new equipment,
and the year-end order book represented approximately 
12 months of new equipment sales (based on the average
monthly sales achieved in 2007).

Governmental regulations can also stimulate demand for a
number of Howden products, particularly in the environmental
protection sector, where Howden supplies equipment for 
use in processes that reduce atmospheric pollution generated
by coal-fired power stations and industrial plant. Demand for
emission control products has been an important factor
behind the upturn in orders from customers in North America.
Technology that dramatically reduces CO2 emissions from
coal-fired power stations already exists and is being developed
to make it more commercially attractive.
Howden expects increasing demand for its products from the
petrochemical and oil and gas industries. The high level of oil
prices seen during 2007 continues to stimulate upstream and
downstream plant construction, particularly in the refining sector.
Competitive environment
Howden has an established position within certain segments 
of the combined worldwide markets for heavy-duty fans and
heat exchangers. Howden is one of the five leading worldwide
manufacturers of screw compressors for use in the
petrochemical industry.
Howden’s share of the aftermarket varies between regions.
The share is higher in some locations, such as Africa where
Howden supplied a high proportion of the original equipment,
and Australia, where recent new build activity has been low.
The aftermarket in China, while in its early stages following the
rapid new build programme in the last few years, is increasing
as new plants reach the point where major servicing is required. 22 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Business and financial review – Howden (continued)
Regional markets 
Europe
Sales in Europe increased by 39.9 per cent to £140.6 million
reflecting strong demand for Howden products from the
power and other industrial sectors. Activity levels at Howden’s
facilities in Europe were high as product was also exported,
particularly to China and North America. 
Demand from customers in the power industry continued to
strengthen during the year, again being led by Germany, but
with higher levels of investment activity evident throughout 
the region. FGD demand in the Iberian region was particularly
strong during the year. Other industrial markets continue to be
active and Howden, with its wide European presence, is well
placed to participate going forward.
North America
Howden Buffalo Inc has two manufacturing facilities, one of
which is located in Mexico City. Sales to customers in North
America increased to £114.8 million, an increase of 31.1 per
cent (36.2 per cent at constant exchange rates).
Howden supply chain
Manufacturing 
Howden has principal manufacturing centres in each of its
major markets of Europe, China and North America and other
manufacturing facilities exist to serve the local markets in
South Africa. Equipment is generally produced in the same
region as the customer is located, although Howden does
export product between regions, for example from its
manufacturing facilities in Europe and in China to North America. 
Sub-contractors
Howden increasingly uses sub-contractors to manufacture
non-performance critical components. In 2007, the number 
of man-hours sub-contracted is estimated to have broadly
matched the number of man-hours in-house. The use of sub-
contractors has allowed Howden to meet peaks in demands
without significantly increasing its own cost base and has
been an important factor in moving a significant portion 
of Howden’s manufacturing to low cost areas. 
Human resources
A key component in Howden’s supply chain is the quality 
and quantity of its engineers. During 2007, Howden increased
the total number of engineers it employs by 150. At the end 
of 2007, Howden employed 285 engineers in China, 37 
more than last year. In 2008 Howden will set up the Howden
Academy in Scotland, an in-house training school for
engineers new to the company, which will deliver focused 
role-specific training on products and applications.
Intellectual property
Technology and the Howden brand are key parts of Howden’s
supply chain. According to recent customer research, Howden
has maintained its position of technology leadership in its
principal product areas. The research also emphasised the
strength of Howden’s brand, which is seen as representing
engineering excellence, customer service, global reach,
technology leadership and quality.

Howden and the environment
Howden technology and know-how helps the power generation,
oil and gas, mining and other industries that it supplies to
operate in a less environmentally harmful manner.
Howden products increase the efficiency of each unit of
production into which they are incorporated and thereby help 
to minimise emissions. Howden equipment is also used in
emission abatement, with, for example, Howden fans, blowers
and heat exchangers being key components in the flue gas
desulphurisation process.
Additional information on Howden’s commitment to the
environment is contained within the Corporate Social
Responsibility Report.
Regional overview of performance
Howden’s revenue by destination is summarised in the table
below. In 2007, Howden achieved significant growth in North
America, Europe and South America, which more than offset the
fall in sales to China. This resulted in sales being more balanced
across the different geographic regions than compared to 2006.  Charter plc Annual Report 2007 23
Investment by the power and petrochemical industries
remained strong. The improvement in sales was mostly
attributable to retrofits of FGD equipment and, to a lesser
extent, new build capacity enhancements. Aftermarket sales
increased compared with 2006, driven mainly by the power
utility segment. The growth in the order book during the
period reflects the continued strength of the market for new
build and emission control equipment for the power industry,
driven by environmental controls legislation, and across 
a number of other sectors.
China
As anticipated, sales to China fell compared to 2006. This was
primarily as a result of reduced demand from the power supply
industry for new generating equipment and from the reduction
in demand for FGD equipment for retrofits.
A programme of product expansion is well underway in China
and in September Howden increased its manufacturing
capabilities for various highly engineered products associated
with the oil and gas and petrochemical sectors with the opening
of a new compressor factory on its existing site in Weihai.
The Chinese aftermarket business progressed well during 
the year and is ahead of plan. Overall the Chinese aftermarket
remains a large growth opportunity for Howden.
China will continue to be an important market for Howden
products going forward, reflecting new build of coal-fired
power stations (expected to average 30 GW per year for 
at least the next 20 years), emission control equipment, 
other Howden products and the aftermarket.
South America 
Sales were £15.4 million in 2007 (2006: £12.6 million), an
increase of 22.2 per cent, with additional projects within the
iron and steel industry and the petrochemical sector.
Howden’s principal market in the region is Brazil, the world’s
biggest exporter of iron ore, which continues to expand its
capacity to produce iron ore pellets used throughout the world
as a feedstock for steel making. Further opportunities are
seen in the oil and gas and biofuels industries.
Rest of the world
Africa 
Howden Africa Holdings Limited (‘HAHL’), in which Howden
has a holding of some 55 per cent, increased sales by 12.6 per
cent to £44.8 million in the year driven by increased equipment
and aftermarket sales to the power and mining sectors.
In May 2007, HAHL disposed of its 42 per cent holding in
Pump Brands Pty Limited for a consideration of £2.4 million,
which was considered a non-core asset. In July, HAHL
completed the acquisition of the outstanding 50 per cent
shareholding in its subsidiary Bateman Howden South Africa
(Pty) Limited, a supplier of emission control equipment, for 
a consideration of £1.9 million. 
Other 
Howden’s sales in Asia Pacific (excluding China) are
predominantly to the mining, industrial and power supply
industries in Australia, and have benefited from favourable
commodity prices and buoyant conditions in the mining sector. 
Howden has established a presence in India, initially to service
the oil and gas, petrochemical and mining industries. The first
orders were won during the year.
Associated undertakings
In 2007, Howden’s share of the post tax profits of its associated
undertakings amounted to £0.2 million (2006: £1.5 million)
and arose from the shareholding in Pump Brands Pty Limited,
which was disposed of in May 2007.
Following the disposal of HAHL’s holding in Pump Brands 
Pty Limited, Howden no longer has any associated trading
undertakings.

Howden successfully integrated Howden Compressors Limited
(‘HCL’), in which it purchased the majority shareholding in
December 2006. HCL has design and manufacturing facilities 
in Glasgow and a distribution and service centre in Philadelphia.
During 2007, Howden opened of a factory at Weihai to supply
compressors to the rapidly expanding oil and gas and
petrochemical industries in China and around the world.
Potential areas of growth for the compressor business include
India, where a sales office has now been opened, and through
developing compressors for use in a wider range of applications. 24 Charter plc Annual Report 2007

Trading results for the year
A detailed review of the trading results for the year is set out in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s statement and the
business reviews of ESAB and Howden. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 82.7 pence (2006: 74.4 pence). However, we believe that adjusted earnings per share provide 
a better indication of Charter’s underlying business performance. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 24.4 per cent 
to 84.7 pence (2006: 68.1 pence) and were derived from basic earnings per share as set out below.

There is no adjustment to the net financing charge in 2006, as the expected return on the schemes’ assets was equal to the
interest on the schemes’ liabilities.
The restatement has increased adjusted earnings per share by 0.9 pence to 68.1 pence for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Net financing credit/(charge)
The net financing credit, before retranslation of intercompany loan balances, of £4.1 million (2006: £4.6 million charge)
comprised interest income of £6.1 million and a net credit from retirement benefit obligations of £2.3 million offset by interest
payable of £3.8 million and the unwinding of discounts on provisions of £0.5 million.
Restatement of 2006 results – employee benefits
All actuarial gains and losses on pension schemes and other post retirement employee benefits are now recognised immediately,
directly in equity. Previously actuarial gains and losses below a certain threshold were not recognised and those above this
threshold were only recognised prospectively over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating
in the plan.
The classification of the income statement charge has been changed such that the expected return on the schemes’ assets 
and interest on the schemes’ liabilities are now included within net financing costs. Previously these items were included in
arriving at operating profit.
These changes have been implemented with effect from 1 January 2007 and the 2006 comparatives have been restated
accordingly. The Directors consider these changes align Charter more closely with general UK accounting practice under IFRS.
The impact of these changes on 2006 is shown in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

In 2007, the total tax on profit on ordinary activities was £33.3 million (2006: £16.9 million), which comprised:
The tax charge of £33.3 million compares with tax paid in the year of £35.9 million. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 18.4 per cent (2006: 19.4 per cent), calculated as follows:
The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate in the year was largely a consequence of increasing profits being generated in low
tax jurisdictions such as China and Eastern Europe but also reflects the recognition and utilisation of previously unrecognised
brought forward tax losses. The adjusted effective tax rate is likely to remain around the level seen in 2007 in the short term.
Acquisitions
In line with our strategy, during the year Charter made a number of acquisitions, details of which are set out in note 29 to 
the consolidated financial statements. The impact of acquisitions on the 2007 results was to increase Welding, cutting and
automation sales and operating profit by £16.7 million and £4.5 million respectively. In 2007, the annual sales and operating
profits of the businesses acquired were £48.0 million and £12.0 million respectively. 26 Charter plc Annual Report 2007

At 31 December 2007 (58.1) (2.9) (61.0) (15.6) (76.6) 
During the year, total equity shareholders’ funds increased by £180.3 million to £426.4 million (2006: £246.1 million).
The principal components of this increase were the profit for the year attributable to Charter shareholders of £137.8 million, 
the reduction in retirement benefit obligations of £11.9 million and net translation exchange gains of £25.1 million.
As at 31 December 2007, the total equity attributable to minority interests increased to £27.6 million (2006: £10.3 million) largely
as a result of the minority interest in ESAB India Limited, which arose following that company becoming a subsidiary in
September 2007.
The minority interests that are significant are the 30 per cent interest in Howden Hua Engineering Co Limited, the 45 per cent
interest in Howden Africa Holdings Limited and the 44 per cent interest in ESAB India Limited.
As at 31 December 2007, the Company had net retirement benefit obligations of £76.6 million. This sum represents 18.0 per cent 
of equity shareholders’ funds as at that date compared with 44.2 per cent as at 31 December 2006.
Working capital has grown by £29.4 million to £193.4 million, an increase of 17.9%. However, as a percentage of sales, working
capital has remained fairly constant at around 13 per cent. Included within trade and other receivables are amounts receivable
under construction contracts of £55.7 million (2006: £38.4 million). Included within trade and other payables are amounts
payable under construction contracts of £82.2 million (2006: £53.6 million).
Retirement benefit obligations
As shown in the table below, the net obligation in respect of pensions and other post retirement benefits fell by £32.2 million 
in the year to £76.6 million.
Under the new accounting policy for employee benefits adopted from 1 January 2007, changes in the fair value of plan assets
and in the present value of funded and unfunded obligations are recognised immediately, directly in equity.
The majority of the £32.2 million reduction in the net retirement benefit obligation arose as a result of actuarial gains due 
to increasing interest rates, which caused the present value of liabilities to fall, and cash contributions of £19.5 million.

Charter has delivered strong growth in cash flows, with cash flow from operations generating £149.1 million (2006: £106.8 million),
an increase of 39.6 per cent. This represents cash conversion of 86.0 per cent compared with 73.9 per cent for 2006. The amount
spent on acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of £26.2 million related to the increased shareholding in ESAB India and acquisitions
in Argentina, Bulgaria, South Africa and Germany, together with £1.0 million in respect of prior year acquisitions.
Free cash flow for the year was £67.4 million compared with £65.7 million in 2006, despite investing a net £47.3 million 
(2006: £14.7 million) on capital expenditure and development costs, net of disposal proceeds.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment of £45.2 million exceeded depreciation by £30.5 million (2006: £11.1 million).
Capital expenditure was far greater in ESAB than in Howden, the largest expenditure being incurred in China on ESAB’s new
consumables plant and on expansion of existing plants.  30 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Business and financial review – Financial review (continued)
Cash and borrowings 
As at 31 December 2007, cash balances were £118.5 million (2006: £62.3 million), of which the majority was held in the UK,
with the balance held overseas for local working capital purposes or pending dividend payments. Of the cash held overseas,
£3.3 million (2006: £4.5 million) is retained as cash collateral in connection with certain local trading practices or banking facilities.
The credit status of institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
As at 31 December 2007, gross borrowings were £30.3 million (2006: £19.2 million).
In certain instances, borrowings are denominated in the currencies of the Company’s net investments overseas which provides 
a hedge against currency fluctuations. Gains and losses arising from borrowings or forward exchange contracts which are used
to hedge foreign currency exposures are recognised as required under IFRS in the consolidated statement of changes in equity
until the items being hedged have impacted on the income statement.
Charter’s central treasury department is responsible for ensuring the availability of suitable and sufficient borrowing and other
financing facilities. In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks, liquidity risks and balance sheet foreign
exchange translation risks. Foreign exchange transaction exposures are generally managed by operating subsidiaries within
strict guidelines and controls established by the management of their parent companies and overseen by the central treasury
department. It is the Company’s policy not to hedge profit and loss account translation exposures. 
Contingent liabilities 
Details of contingent liabilities are set out in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the accounting policies set out in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements. Applying accounting policies requires the use of certain judgments, assumptions and
estimates. The following accounting policies have been identified as being the most significant and where there is most risk 
of a material adjustment to the carrying value of Charter’s assets and liabilities within the next financial year:
• goodwill impairment
• construction contracts
• deferred tax
• warranty and legal liabilities
• retirement benefits.
Risks and uncertainties
Charter, both directly and through ESAB and Howden, is exposed to a wide variety of markets and geographies and seeks to
manage the risks and uncertainties which arise from this. In certain instances and where it is cost-effective to do so, exposures
can be transferred to third parties, for example through insurance or through currency hedging.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by Charter, and the ways in which they are being managed, are set out below.
Economic recession
Economic recession in a particular region may be created by internal factors, such as declining consumer expenditure, 
or external factors, such as changes in exchange rates.
Both ESAB and Howden have improved their operating efficiencies and the geographic spread of their businesses, each of which
should assist in protecting their overall profitability even if an economic recession were to lead to falling sales volumes and product
prices in a particular country or region. In response to the recent high demand for its products globally, Howden has increased its
capacity principally through the extensive use of sub-contractors. In the event that market conditions change, Howden should be
able to reduce this capacity without incurring significant costs. ESAB has moved large amounts of its manufacturing capacity to 
low cost areas.
Actions of competitors
ESAB and Howden both operate in competitive markets and are exposed to market behaviour such as aggressive pricing by 
a low cost manufacturer looking to enter a new market.
As set out in the business and financial review, both businesses have established strong market positions through technological
leadership, strong brands and through providing cost-effective solutions to their customers’ needs. These positions are being
maintained through measures such as continued expenditure on research and development, the lean manufacturing initiative
and customer service. Charter plc Annual Report 2007 31
Competitor action may result initially in reductions in profit, although these are more likely to be specific to particular product areas 
or geographies. The businesses’ strong market positions will assist them in maintaining their longer term performance.
Foreign exchange: transaction risk
Transaction risk arises from product being manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another. 
In ESAB, manufacturing tends to be relatively close to the end-user, which naturally reduces currency exposures. The principal
exposures which arise do so on account of manufacturing of product in Central Europe and Sweden which is exported to the
euro-zone. ESAB’s policy is not to hedge currency exposures unless they relate to a significant specific contract, as customer
prices, particularly for consumables, are generally able to be changed at relatively short notice to reflect cost changes.
In relation to Howden, exposure is principally in relation to the US dollar and pegged currencies such as the Chinese yuan.
Howden substantially covers forward its committed trading exposures. 
Foreign exchange: translation risk
Translation risk arises from the profits and net assets of non-UK businesses being translated into a sterling value which depends
upon the exchange rate. 
Apart from Howden’s operations in Scotland and Northern Ireland, ESAB’s head office and its own headquarters, Charter has
minimal operations in the UK. The largest single profit translation exposures are in relation to the US dollar and the euro. It is Charter’s
policy not to hedge profit translation exposures; this may give rise to unexpected fluctuations in Charter’s reported profit.
The Company has significant investments in overseas operations; as a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly
affect the consolidated balance sheet. In certain circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts 
or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses arising on such hedges are recognised 
as required under IFRS in the consolidated statement of changes in equity until the items being hedged have impacted on the
income statement.
Litigation
Charter, ESAB and Howden are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of their business. 
Certain comments on current litigation are set out in the Chairman’s statement and further details are contained in note 27 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Pension risk 
There are various post retirement benefit schemes in place within Charter, ESAB and Howden.
The assets held by the various schemes are invested by the trustees primarily in equities and bonds. A level of contributions
payable by the Company, ESAB and Howden into the schemes has been agreed with respective trustees. 
The Company’s liabilities in respect of retirement benefits are subject to movements in long-term interest rates and changes in life
expectancy. The Company’ s net retirement benefit obligation is also subject to movements in the value of assets held by the schemes,
which are principally shares and bonds. Future cash contributions by the Company to the schemes will also depend on other
factors, such as the outcome of negotiations with the pension trustees and changes in legislation.
Raw material prices
Most products manufactured by ESAB and Howden contain steel or other metals whose prices are determined on world
markets and can fluctuate significantly. 
This risk is addressed by the use of long-term contracts with suppliers where available and appropriate and, subject to market
conditions and other factors, the passing through to customers of increases in underlying costs.
Internal controls
Charter has in place a system of internal controls covering its own activities and those of ESAB and Howden. These controls 
are essential for the effective management of such geographically diverse businesses. 
The Company’s Audit Committee has been delegated formal responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system 
of internal control. A failure of the system of internal controls could have a material impact on the Company. 32 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Business and financial review – Corporate social responsibility report
The Board and the Executive Committee receive a report
every month that summarises EHS performance worldwide,
using lost time injuries and days away from work or on
restricted duty as the KPIs. The report also highlights any
internal EHS audit findings, lists progress during the month
and plans for the next quarter. This enables issues most
relevant to the business to be identified and resources
focused on any key areas identified.
Management resources
During 2007, EHS management resources were strengthened
both at a senior level and a site level. A Head of Risk
Management, whose primary responsibility is EHS for
Howden, and a new full-time Director, EHS for North America
have been appointed. 
At site level, twelve full-time EHS professionals have been
appointed with responsibility to assist line managers in
improving overall performance. Each business now has a
named individual responsible for supporting and advising line
management on EHS matters and there is on-going training 
to upgrade skills as necessary.
Certification of EHS Management Systems
Certification of the EHS Management Systems has been 
a priority as it provides a high level of assurance that the
systems being implemented are to an appropriate standard.
Significant progress has been made in achieving this objective.
ESAB gained worldwide certification by the end of 2007. 
It includes all production operations, sales and central
functions within ESAB at 1 July 2007.
It is ESAB’s aim to include all of the sites of ESAB India and
the businesses acquired during 2007 in its EHS Management
System during 2008. Trained personnel undertake internal
audits to ensure compliance with policies and that remedial
actions are taken to correct any audit findings. These provide
an important component in achieving continuous improvement.
Twenty-four audits were completed in 2007, covering most 
of the production operations, four sales operations and 
the central functions. In 2008, ESAB aims to extend the
programme to forty-two audits so as to cover all operations,
including new acquisitions.
Approach and policies
The Board considers social, environmental and ethical matters
as part of the overall corporate governance framework (see
page 42) and is committed to continuous improvement. This is
driven by appropriate policies, management systems and
operational performance measurement. The four key policy
areas that provide the framework for the management 
of Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) are Health & Safety,
Environmental, Employment and the Code of Conduct. 
Copies of these policies will shortly be available on the
Company’s website (www.charterplc.com). 
These four policies are incorporated into an overall policies
and procedures manual that applies to all Charter businesses
worldwide. The manual has been provided to the Managing
Directors of all Charter businesses, who in turn have the
responsibility to disseminate the relevant contents to all
employees and to ensure operational implementation.
The Company takes a risk based approach to CSR and
identified the safety of employees as a priority in 2007. Other
issues were the selection of environmental Key Performance
Indicators (‘KPIs’), training and development, and maintaining
the highest standards of integrity. 
Environmental, Health and Safety (‘EHS’) Management
The responsibility for EHS issues follows the general
management organisation structure. This means that local 
line management at each Charter business has primary
responsibility for: 
• compliance with local regulatory requirements
• following Charter policies and procedures
• implementing standards issued by ESAB or Howden
• assessing and managing operational EHS risks
• implementing management systems and driving 
continuous improvement. 
In 2007, it was decided that safety performance would be one
of the factors taken into account in evaluating the performance
of senior managers. 
ESAB’s Director of Sustainable Development
One of the targets set for 2007 was to extend the number 
of Charter businesses that operate environmental, health and
safety management systems certified to international standards.
In January 2008, ESAB received a worldwide certificate from Det
Norske Veritas covering all production, sales and central
functions as at 1 July 2007 for ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS
18001:2007.
Stefan Larsson (Director of ESAB Sustainable Development)
and Anders Wingqvist (MD of Det Norske Veritas, Sweden)  Charter plc Annual Report 2007 33
Howden has continued to make progress by introducing
accredited systems at its manufacturing locations. Howden
Spain was recommended for certification to OHSAS
18001:1999, and Howden Australia achieved AS/ANZ 4801
accreditation in 2007. Of the fourteen manufacturing and
service operations, six are now accredited and a further six
should complete the certification process during the first half
of 2008. In addition, three of the five engineering offices 
are certified.
EHS regulatory issues
During 2007, there were no regulatory actions, fines or penalties
as a result of EHS incidents or inspections by the authorities
and no reportable environmental releases.
Preparations have started to ensure timely compliance 
with the EU regulation for Registration, Evaluation,
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (‘REACH’). It is 
too early to quantify the full impact on the business as some
key aspects of this regulation have not yet been fully defined
by the authorities.
Safety performance
Regrettably, the death of an employee of Howden South
America occurred in March 2007. The Operations Director
was returning from a supplier’s factory to his home in Sao
Paulo and had a road accident. No other cars or individuals
were involved.
Charter’s operational goal for safety is zero lost time injuries.
Progress towards this goal is monitored by tracking the lost
time frequency rate, expressed as a 3-month rolling average,
and the expectation is to achieve at least a 10 per cent year-
on-year reduction.
In 2007, Charter established, for the first time, two global KPIs
for safety, namely:
• Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, being the number of injuries
that result in lost time or restricted duty, and
• Lost Days Severity Rate, being the total number of days 
off work or on restricted duties (including weekends or
vacation periods), capped at 180 days per injury as per
OSHA reporting requirements.
To enable trend analysis, these are expressed per 200,000
hours worked and tracked on a moving three-month basis. 
In 2008, a further KPI is being added based on the total
number of first aid injuries and near misses reported.
The graphs above illustrate the performance in 2007 and
show an encouraging picture, with a 24 per cent reduction 
in Lost Time injuries and 14 per cent reduction in Lost Days.
Environmental performance
In selecting its environmental impact KPIs, Charter has taken
into account UK Government guidelines and the worldwide
concerns over climate change and water scarcity. As a result,
Charter has selected as KPIs the reduction of energy usage
(both direct and indirect) with the ultimate aim of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and waste
transferred to landfill. Focusing on these KPIs is also expected
to drive efficiency gains and cost savings and will be integrated
with the introduction of Lean manufacturing processes.
Data are provided this year for ESAB, which it has been
collecting for several years. For Howden, data to enable these
KPIs to be measured will be collected for both 2007 and 2008
so that overall Charter targets can be set. Overall performance
should be available for reporting in 2009.
The graphs at the top of pages 34 and 35 show totals 
of greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and total
waste to landfill for 1997 and 2006 for all ESAB production
sites. These totals have not been adjusted for changes in the
business as a result of acquisitions, disposals, site closures 
or production line transfers. 
During the ten-year period from 1997 to 2006, ESAB’s sales
have increased by 28.7 per cent. Energy usage, as illustrated,
has reduced by 3.8 per cent in actual terms whilst greenhouse
gas emissions in CO2 equivalents have increased by 20.4 per
cent. There are two main reasons for this increase. One is that
production volumes have increased mainly in countries where
electricity is generated using fossil fuels such as Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic. The other reason is that
some units have switched to less CO2 efficient energy resources.
Water consumption and waste to landfill have both reduced
by around 60 per cent, primarily as a result of increased recycling.

Business and financial review – Corporate social responsibility report (continued)
Howden has identified a requirement for additional engineers
with the required level of expertise in its products and industries
to assist it in achieving its worldwide growth aspirations. 
To respond to this, in 2008, Howden will set up the Howden
Academy, an in-house training school for engineers new to the
Company which will deliver focused, non-specific training on
products and applications. 
Whistleblowing
Charter has an established whistleblowing policy. During 2007
four disclosures were investigated, one of which led to the
dismissal of an employee for breach of financial controls. 
Employee relations and communications
ESAB is continuously improving its communication channels
with employees. In addition to issuing ‘Let’s Talk’, which 
is a bi-weekly internal newsletter that includes community
initiatives and staff stories, as well as customer wins and
company projects, ESAB now produces ‘The Wire’. This
focuses on updating employees on ESAB’s strategy and 
new business initiatives and is translated into the 12 main
languages spoken by ESAB employees around the world 
and is issued twice a year.
Howden continues to produce the ‘Team Brief’ every two
months and every six months, a Group newsletter. Works
councils and other consultative bodies are also used to
provide information to employees.
Community involvement
Many Charter businesses support local charities through
fundraising or other forms of assistance. There is no central
reporting currently in place, but, based on the information
submitted, over £0.1 million was donated during 2007.
ESAB Brazil continues to participate in ‘Cidades da Solda’
(Welding Towns), a project which is targeted at training people
to gain a qualification in welding. ‘Cidades da Solda’ has 
set up three units located in the cities of Coronel Fabriciano,
Contagem and Betim, in the state of Minas Gerais, close 
to ESAB Brazil’s plants. Twice a year, six new groups of
disadvantaged young people are trained at the units and 
from this experience they develop a new social perspective,
opening up new job opportunities for them. ESAB Brazil’s
participation in this project involves the donation of equipment
used in the welding workshops and the provision of technical
support to the professionals who give the lessons.
For 2008, ESAB has set environmental targets of reducing
energy, water and waste in production operations by a further
5 per cent.
The ESAB data is based on internally reported numbers that
are checked during internal audits by the central ESAB team.
Since July 2007, Det Norske Veritas has also been undertaking
an external data verification exercise when they visit a site for
certification. No significant errors have been found at the four
sites reviewed so far, which provides further assurance on the
validity of the data.
Employment
Retaining, recruiting and training employees is vital to the
continuing success of the Charter businesses. During 2007,
the average number of employees increased from 10,420 
to 12,180 including acquisitions. Over 500 of this increase 
is attributable to organic growth, thus generating socio-
economic benefits for the communities in which employees live. 
Equal opportunities
Charter has complied with anti-discrimination laws in all
relevant jurisdictions concerning matters of gender, ethnic
origin, age, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
Charter recognises and values diversity in the workforce 
and all recruitment, selection and promotion is on the basis 
of individuals’ qualifications, skills, experience and merit. 
Training and development of people
Charter businesses invest in employees’ skills and capabilities
through a variety of programmes, including training and
succession planning. Over 22,000 man-days were spent 
on training in 2007 and this will increase in 2008 as there 
is continuing investment in developing skills.
ESAB has continued with its Henley Leadership programme
which now has an alumni of over 50 people. During 2007 
a further 18 individuals completed the first part of the programme
which will be completed during the third quarter of 2008. 
A high potential talent programme is being piloted which will
result in two candidates being selected to commence a three-
year International Development programme. Lean manufacturing
training has continued and, in January 2008, a Global Project
Management training programme commenced.

Code of Conduct
Charter’s Code of Conduct provides the framework for the
behaviour expected of all employees in conducting themselves,
whatever their role and wherever they are located. It is the
responsibility of all Charter businesses and employees to
ensure the Code is followed and that all supporting policies
and procedures are complied with.
Compliance with competition laws is seen as a priority and 
the roll-out of structured competition compliance training for
relevant employees will take place during 2008.

spent 25 years in private legal practice.

the Chief Executive’s statement on pages 6 to 9 and the business 
and financial review on pages 10 to 35. These are incorporated by

Business and financial review
The Business and financial review is a review of the development,

the year ended 31 December 2007 and a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties facing the business. 
Profits and Dividends
The profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 was £144.8 million

management of Hoeganaes Corp or Hoeganaes Europe.
No other Directors had any interest in contracts with the Company 
or its subsidiaries at any time during the period other than service

details of their remuneration and service contracts can be found in 
the Remuneration report on pages 47 to 51. 
Settlement with City Index
On 7 February 2006, the Company announced that it had settled its
legal proceedings against City Index in respect of losses incurred as 
a consequence of certain unauthorised payments having been made
by a former employee. The Board is aware that, following the
settlement with the Company, City Index sought to continue to pursue
claims for contribution against certain current and former Directors 
of the Company and against the Company’s Auditors. An application
for leave to appeal to the House of Lords has been sought in respect
of a motion to strike out the claims.
Corporate governance
A review of the Company’s application of the principles and provisions
of the Combined Code can be found on pages 42 to 45.
Directors’ indemnities
Each of the Directors has been granted an indemnity by the Company
to the extent permitted by law in respect of certain liabilities incurred as
a result of their office. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of
Association each Director is indemnified against liability to third parties,
excluding criminal liability and regulatory penalties and certain other
liabilities. In addition, the Company may pay the Directors’ legal costs
as they are incurred, subject to reimbursement if the Director is

at the offices of ABN AMRO, 250 Bishopsgate, London EC2M 4AA.
The Notice of AGM (the ‘Notice’) can be found in a separate circular 
to shareholders. The Notice sets out details of the resolutions that 
will be proposed at the AGM as well as explanatory notes giving the
background and reasons for such resolutions. In June 2007 shareholders
granted the Directors authority to purchase up to 55 million ordinary
shares in the Company, which will expire on 26 September 2008. 
A resolution to renew this authority will be put to shareholders 
at the AGM on 16 May 2008.
Employees
The Company’s policy is to encourage effective communication and
consultation between employees and management. Subsidiaries
develop their own consultation and communication procedures as 
part of their employment practices. Further details can be found in 
the Corporate social responsibility report on pages 32 to 35 of the
Business and financial review.
The Company and its subsidiaries are equal opportunities employers
and seek to attract, develop, deploy and reward prospective and
present employees solely on the basis of merit, regardless of gender,
ethnic origin, religion or sexual orientation. In addition, the Company
and its subsidiaries give full and fair consideration to applications for
employment made by disabled people, having regard to their aptitudes
and abilities. Should employees become disabled during employment,
they would be considered for any necessary retraining and available
work within their capabilities. For the purposes of training, career
development and promotion, disabled employees are treated in the
same way as other employees. Creditor payment policy
The creditor payment policy of the Company and its subsidiaries is 
to settle amounts due to creditors in accordance with agreed terms.
The policy provides that local practice must be observed in the
countries in which they operate and that standard payment terms 
in each country may also be varied by negotiation with individual
suppliers. The Company had no trade creditors at the year end.
Charitable and political contributions
During the year the Company and its subsidiaries donated £90,000
(2006: £58,000) to charities of which £8,581 (2006: £8,000) was

on research and development to meet the changing needs of the
markets they serve. Research and development expenditure, which
excludes engineering and production support costs, totalled 
£9.2 million (2006: £9.1 million) for the year of which £6.3 million
(2006: £6.7 million) has been charged to the income statement for 
the year and £2.9 million (2006: £2.4 million) has been capitalised 
as intangible assets.

Rights and obligations 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s shares are
contained in the Articles of Association, a copy of which can be viewed
on the Company’s website at www.charterplc.com or can be obtained
upon request to the Company Secretary. The Articles of Association
may only be changed by a special resolution passed at a general
meeting of the Company.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive notice of, attend,
speak and vote at any general meeting of the Company, except as
described below. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present
has one vote and on a poll every member who is present has one vote
for every £0.02 in nominal amount of his shares. Where shares are held
jointly, the vote of the shareholder who first appears on the register of
members in respect of the share shall be conclusive. At any general
40 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Directors’ report (continued)
meeting, a poll may be demanded by shareholders who are present
and entitled to vote when (i) not less than three such shareholders 
make such a demand; (ii) those shareholders represent not less than
one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right 
to vote at the meeting; or (iii) those shareholders represent not less 
than one-tenth of the total paid-up share capital.
Holders of ordinary shares also have various rights to appoint a proxy
or proxies (who need not be members of the Company) or, where
appropriate, a corporate representative, to attend and vote on their
behalf. Further details about the right to appoint a proxy or a corporate
representative are set out on page 6 of the Notice.
Shareholders may, by special resolution, set out regulations or
provisions according to which the Directors must abide. Shareholders
may by ordinary resolution appoint additional Directors, re-elect a
retiring Director (or, in place of a retiring Director, elect some other
person eligible for appointment) or authorise the Directors to ignore the
borrowing restrictions which are set out in the Articles of Association.
Shareholders also have the right, by ordinary resolution, to remove 
any Director from office if at least 28 days notice of the intention 
to move such a resolution has been given to the Company. 
Without prejudice to any special rights which have been conferred 
on any shareholders, any share of the Company may be issued with
such preferred, deferred or other special rights or subject to such
restrictions as the Directors or the shareholders may determine.
The Directors may make calls on shareholders in respect of monies
unpaid on their shares. If any call is not complied with the Directors
may serve a notice requiring payment with interest and expenses.
Failure to comply with this may result in forfeiture of any share the
subject of the notice. The Company has a lien on any share which 
is not fully paid. 
The shareholders may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends up to
the amount recommended by the Directors which may, if recommended
by the Directors, be paid by the distribution of assets or which the
Directors may, if authorised by an ordinary resolution, offer to
shareholders in the form of fully-paid ordinary shares. The Directors
may declare interim dividends of such amounts and on such dates 
as they think fit.
Unless the Directors determine otherwise, a shareholder is not entitled
to exercise any rights attaching to his shares in relation to general
meetings of the Company if any sum payable by him to the Company
in respect of such shares remains unpaid. Further, a shareholder is not,
unless the Directors otherwise determine, entitled to attend or vote 
at any general meeting if the shareholder has failed to comply with 
a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers
upon public companies the power to require information with respect
to interests in their voting shares) within 14 days (or, in the case of 
a holder of less than 0.25% in nominal value of the ordinary shares, 
28 days) from the date of service of such notice. If a shareholder who
holds at least 0.25% in nominal value of the ordinary shares is in
default of a section 793 notice, then the Directors may also withhold
the payment of any dividend to and restrict the transfer of shares held 
by that shareholder.
Transfer restrictions
The registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for
such periods as the Directors may determine for up to 30 days in any
year. The Directors may refuse to register any transfer of any share
which is not a fully-paid up share and refuse to register any transfer in
favour of more than four persons jointly. The Directors may also refuse
to recognise any instrument of transfer unless it is in respect of any
one class of share, is lodged at such place as they may determine
and, where appropriate, is accompanied by any relevant share
certificates and such other evidence as they may reasonably require 
to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer.
The Directors may also suspend transfers where a shareholder has
failed to comply with a section 793 notice, in the manner noted above. Charter plc Annual Report 2007 41
Voting restrictions
No member shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine, be entitled to
vote at a general meeting either personally or by proxy, or to exercise
any other right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of 
the Company, if any call or other sum presently payable by him to 
the Company in respect of such shares remains unpaid. The Directors
also have powers to suspend voting rights in certain limited
circumstances when a shareholder has failed to comply with 
a section 793 notice in the manner noted above. 
Change of control
Significant agreements
The Company acts as guarantor in respect of a £75 million Multi-
Currency Revolving Facility Agreement dated 6 March 2006 (as
amended on 6 September 2007) between HSBC Bank (‘HSBC’) 
and Charter Central Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.
This contains a change of control provision which, if triggered, 
could restrict further utilisations and/or require the repayment 
of all outstanding utilisations. In such circumstances HSBC may 
also call for cash collateral for outstanding utilisations under 
separate documentary credit facilities provided to two subsidiaries 
of the Company of £40 million and US$ 20 million respectively.
The Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 contains provisions
that allow outstanding awards to vest in certain circumstances upon 
a change of control of the Company. Conditional awards made
pursuant to the Charter Deferred Bonus Plan will automatically vest 
on a change of control of the Company. Further details concerning 
the above can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 47 and 48.
Corporate social responsibility (‘CSR’)
The Company’s report on CSR, including its approach to health and
safety, social, environmental and other related environmental issues,
can be found on pages 32 to 35 of the Business and financial review.
Statement of disclosure of information to Auditors
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information
(that is, information needed by the Company’s Auditors in connection
with preparing their report) of which the Company’s Auditors are
unaware, and each Director has taken all reasonable steps that 
he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s
Auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Auditors 
to the Company and a further resolution to authorise the Board 
to fix the Auditors’ remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.

Registered office:

London SW1W 0AU
Registered in England Number 2794949 1 Compliance with the Combined Code
The Company monitors its compliance with the requirements of 
the Combined Code on a continuous basis. This report, in addition to
the Remuneration report on pages 47 to 51 and the Audit Committee
report on page 46, describe how the Company has applied and
complied with the principles, supporting principles and provisions
contained in the Combined Code.
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2007, the Board is of the
opinion that the Company has been in compliance with the provisions
of the Combined Code with only one exception. The service contracts
of Michael Foster and Robert Careless contain liquidated damages
clauses, which are in contrast to requirement B.1.5 of the Combined
Code for outgoing directors to mitigate their loss. The Board feels 
that these arrangements are not excessive and serve to balance 
the interests of shareholders with the need to ensure the retention 
of these individuals. The policy has since been revised with regard 
to the service contracts of new Executive Directors and therefore 
the service contract of James Deeley contains no such provision.
2 Directors
(a) The Board 
The Board conducts itself in such a way as to provide leadership 
to the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective employees. 
It is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance 
and to the delivery of enhanced shareholder value in a manner
consistent with sound business practices and proper standards 
of CSR. In providing such leadership, the Board focuses on integrity
and personal responsibility with the overriding objective of creating
shareholder value.
The Board operates in accordance with a Management and
Governance Framework (the ‘Framework’). This has been approved
and adopted by the Board, and consolidates those policies which
govern the management and governance of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The Framework contains details of (a) the specific 
powers that the Board has retained, (b) the authority that has been
delegated to the Board Committees and their terms of reference 
and (c) the role of the Board, the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
and the responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director (copies 
of the Terms of Reference of the Committees and the documents
covering the role of the Board, the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
and the responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director may be
viewed on the Company’ s website, www.charterplc.com or obtained
upon request to the Company Secretary). The Framework is kept under
regular review and modified as and when new situations, requirements
or developments in best practice arise. The Board ensures that the
membership of its committees is refreshed so that undue reliance is
not placed on individual Directors. 
The Board meets regularly and there were 11 scheduled meetings 
held during the course of 2007. The Board also hosts an annual
Strategy Conference, at which it considers and determines the
strategic plans for the Company’s businesses. Details of attendance
at meetings of the Board and its Nominations, Audit and Remuneration
Committees are shown in the table below. There are 9 Board meetings
scheduled to take place in 2008. Agendas and supporting papers are
distributed to Directors in advance of each meeting so that the
meeting can benefit from informed debate. Should any Director be
unable to attend any meeting he is encouraged to pass any comments
in advance of the meeting to the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the
Finance Director or the Company Secretary. No individuals other than
the committee chairman and the members are entitled to be present 
at meetings of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees,
although others including the Executive Directors, Head of Internal
Audit, Head of Taxation and the external Auditors may attend at 
the prior invitation of the relevant committee chairman.

statements and associated announcements;
• the membership, authority and terms of reference of Board
committees;
• corporate strategy;
• significant financing arrangements;
• matters relating to share capital (including employee share schemes
and share options);
• contracts or expenditures in excess of certain monetary thresholds;
• adoption of annual budgets; and
• appointment and removal of the Company Secretary.
The day-to-day management of the Company has been delegated 
to the Executive Committee and the boards of the Company’s two
main operating businesses. Any concerns that the Non-Executive
Directors may have regarding either the administration of the 
Company and its subsidiaries, or any proposed actions, are 
recorded in the minutes of the Company where an alternative
resolution cannot be found.
The Company has provided its Directors with appropriate insurance
cover in respect of legal proceedings and other claims against them.
Further details on this can be found on page 39.
(b) Board committees
(i) Nominations Committee
Composition: Lars Emilson (Chairman), Michael Foster, John Biles, 
The Hon. James Bruce, Grey Denham and Andrew Osborne. 
With the exception of Lars Emilson and Michael Foster, who were
appointed to the Committee on 14 September 2007 and 24 January
2007 respectively, all were members throughout the year. All of the
members of the Committee, excluding Michael Foster, are considered
independent Non-Executive Directors pursuant to the Combined 
Code and accordingly a majority of the members are independent.
David Gawler was Chairman of the Committee until his retirement 
on 31 October 2007.
Role: The Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board concerning appointments to the Board, including
evaluating the skills, knowledge and experience required and setting 
a job description for specific appointments. Charter plc Annual Report 2007 43
Activities: During the year the Committee led the process to appoint 
a new Non-Executive Chairman to replace David Gawler on his
retirement from the Board. This process involved the preparation 
of a suitable job description for the role and a selection process with
the assistance of external search consultants. Under the terms of
reference of the Committee, the Chairman is not entitled to chair the
Committee on matters regarding the appointment of a successor 
to the chairmanship of the Company. Accordingly, the Senior
Independent Director, The Hon. James Bruce, chaired all 7 meetings.
The Board also reviewed plans for orderly management succession 
in relation to both Board and senior management appointments at 
the Company’s annual strategy conference in September 2007 with 
a follow-up session taking place at a subsequent Board meeting.
Consideration was also given to the results of a review of senior
management teams across all businesses conducted by an external
agency earlier in the year. Following this exercise the Board believes
that appropriate plans have been adopted to ensure that the correct
balance of skills and experience are maintained on the Board and
within the senior management of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
(ii) Remuneration Committee
Composition: Throughout the year the Committee comprised 
The Hon. James Bruce (Chairman), John Biles, Grey Denham, 
Lars Emilson and Andrew Osborne, all of whom are considered
independent Non-Executive Directors pursuant to the Code.
Role and activities: A detailed explanation of the role and activities 
of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the Remuneration
report on pages 47 to 51.
(iii) Executive Committee
Composition: The Committee comprises the three Executive Directors;
Michael Foster, Robert Careless and James Deeley, and the 
Chief Executive Officers of ESAB Global and Howden Global being
Jon Templeman and Bob Cleland respectively. David Gawler was also
a member of the Committee until his retirement on 31 October 2007.
Role: Meetings of the Committee generally took place twice a month 
in 2007 although the number of meetings has been reduced to an
average of just over one per month for 2008 as a result of improved
efficiencies within the Company’s internal management and
administration processes. The Board has delegated the necessary
powers and authority to the Executive Committee for the day-to-day
management of the affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries (other
than Anderson Group Inc (see paragraph (c) below)), subject to powers
that the Board has either retained or explicitly delegated to other Board
committees. The Committee operates in accordance with detailed
terms of reference that form part of the Framework.
(iv) Disclosure Committee
Composition: The Committee comprises the three Executive Directors.
David Gawler was a member of the Committee until his retirement on
31 October 2007.
Role: With the exception of David Gawler, all were members
throughout the year. The Committee is primarily responsible for the
creation and maintenance of appropriate procedures, systems and
controls to ensure compliance by the Company with its obligations
under the DTR and the Listing Rules of the FSA. In particular, it has
responsibility for the determination, on a timely basis, of the disclosure
treatment of material information and designing, implementing and
evaluating disclosure controls and procedures that operate within the
Company and its subsidiaries. The Committee also has responsibility 
identifying inside information, for the purpose of maintaining the
Company’s insider lists as required by the DTR.
(v) Audit Committee
Details regarding the membership, role, responsibilities and work 
of the Audit Committee during the year under review can be found 
in the Audit Committee report on page 46.
(c) Anderson Group Inc
The operations of ESAB and Howden in North America are managed
by Anderson Group Inc (‘AGI’), a subsidiary of the Company. AGI’s
Board is responsible for all aspects of the management of its affairs
and for the corporate governance framework of the businesses that
are operated by its subsidiaries. The Company exercises its rights as
shareholder of AGI by appointing three nominees as Non-Executive
Directors to the Board of AGI and they, on behalf of the Company,
review matters of significance relating to its ownership interest in AGI
such as board appointments, financial results, corporate strategy,
major investments and divestments and corporate governance issues.
(d) Chairman and Chief Executive
Lars Emilson was appointed Chairman of the Company on 
1 November 2007 and Michael Foster was appointed Chief Executive
on 1 July 2006. The Board believes that the two roles carry different
responsibilities and has approved a clear division of responsibilities
between the Chairman and Chief Executive which are reflected in 
the Framework. It also believes that the appointment of Lars Emilson
as an independent Non-Executive Chairman will reinforce this
distinction further.
The Chairman has primary responsibility for leading the Board, for
ensuring its effectiveness, and for ensuring that good communications
are maintained with shareholders, whilst the Chief Executive has
responsibility for running the Company’s businesses. Lars Emilson 
has no significant commitments that require disclosure in relation 
to his Chairmanship.
During his time as Chairman, David Gawler would periodically 
meet with the Non-Executive Directors without the other Executive
Directors present as well as maintaining contact should they wish to
raise any issues with him outside of the formal setting of the monthly
Board meetings. It is the intention of the new Chairman to continue 
this practice as often as time will allow.
(e) Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises nine directors, three of whom are
Executive and six of whom are Non-Executive. The Board believes 
that this structure provides the correct balance of skills and experience
for the business and would allow for any changes to the Board’s
composition to be managed without undue disruption, whilst ensuring
that the presence of six Non-Executive Directors prevents a concentration
of power and influence in a small number of individuals.
The Board has determined that, with the exception of John Neill 
who is no longer considered to be independent by virtue of his length 
of service on the Board and his relationship with the Unipart Group 
of Companies which is summarised on page 39, all of the 
Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman are regarded 
as independent. The Board does not consider that there exist 
any relationships or circumstances likely to affect the judgment 
of any Non-Executive Director.
The Board greatly values the contribution and experience of John Neill
and recommends his re-election at the forthcoming AGM as a Non-
Executive Director.
No Executive Director currently holds a non-executive directorship 
of a FTSE 100 company. (f) Information and professional development
The Company Secretary, under the guidance of the Chairman, 
is responsible for ensuring good information flows within the Board 
and its committees. All Directors of the Company have access 
to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and may 
take independent professional advice on any matter relating to 
the Company at the Company’s expense. In advance of Board and
committee meetings, Directors and relevant committee members
receive detailed papers on the matters to be considered, enabling
them to request further clarification or additional information and to
participate fully in discussions. The Company Secretary is responsible
for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance
matters and best practice.
The Company has a comprehensive induction process for all 
Non-Executive Directors when they join the Board. This includes 
a detailed information pack, which combines publicly available
information, such as the Report and Accounts and product information,
with confidential briefing notes on the Company’ s financing arrangements,
corporate structures, management accounts, advisers and other
relevant information. In addition briefing meetings are organised with
key members of the Board and senior management and visits are
arranged to the Company’s businesses. 
(g) Performance evaluation
Evaluation of the Board and its principal committees is conducted 
by gathering feedback from the relevant members of the Board and
committees on questionnaires prepared by the Company’s Auditors,
the results of which are collated and presented to the Board by the
Chairman. The Chairman is responsible for conducting the
performance evaluation of the Chief Executive. The Non-Executive
Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, are responsible 
for evaluating the performance of the Chairman and in doing so take
account of the views of the Executive Directors. The Chief Executive
conducts individual evaluations of the Executive Directors against 
a number of pre-agreed performance objectives. In view of the fact
that Lars Emilson was only appointed Chairman in November 2007,
no performance evaluation has been conducted in relation to 
his role as Chairman for the current year.
The results of the questionnaires were summarised in a paper submitted
to the Board by the Chairman on 27 February 2008. This considered
the areas that the Directors identified for improvement and set out 
the manner in which these were to be addressed going forward. 
The Board was unanimous in its agreement with the Chairman’s
assessment that the Board, its committees and individuals continued
to be effective.
(h) Reappointment
Under article 91 of the Articles of Association of the Company, 
up to one-third of the Directors are required to submit themselves 
for re-election each year. At this year’s AGM, Michael Foster and 
John Biles retire by rotation and will offer themselves for re-election.
John Neill offers himself for re-election annually pursuant to the
Combined Code as he has served on the Board for more than 
9 years. In addition, the appointment of Lars Emilson as a 
Non-Executive Director on 14 September 2007 and as Chairman 
on 1 November 2007 means that, in accordance with article 97 
of the Company’s Articles of Association, he must offer himself 
for election at the AGM. The Board considers that these Directors
continue to make an effective contribution to the business of the
Company and as a result recommends their re-election.
3 Accountability and Audit
(a) Financial reporting
(i) Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The following statement sets out the responsibilities of the Directors 
in relation to the consolidated financial statements and those of the
Company. The reports of the external Auditors, shown on pages 52 and
53, set out their responsibilities in relation to those financial statements.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for
each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and of the Group as at the end of the financial year
and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year. In preparing
those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
44 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Corporate governance (continued)
(1) select appropriate accounting policies and apply them consistently;
(2) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
(3) state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures being disclosed and explained; and
(4) prepare those financial statements on the going concern basis,
unless they consider that to be inappropriate.
The applicable accounting standards referred to in (3) above are:
(a) UK GAAP for the Company; and 
(b) IFRS as adopted by the European Union and implemented 
in the UK for the Group.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps
sufficient accounting records to disclose with reasonable accuracy 
the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard 
the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and, in that context, 
to have proper regard to the establishment of appropriate systems 
of internal control with a view to the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements and to
provide the Auditors with every opportunity to take whatever steps, 
and undertake whatever inspections, the Auditors consider to be
appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit report.
The Directors consider that they have taken the actions necessary 
to meet their responsibilities as set out in this statement.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
(ii) Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the accounts.
(b) Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the maintenance of a system 
of internal control. The Audit Committee has been formally delegated
responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of 
internal control.
The processes to manage the key risks to the success of the
Company and its businesses are reviewed and improved as
necessary. There is an organisational structure with clearly defined
lines of responsibility and delegation of authority and there are also
established policies and procedures for monitoring each business. 
While the operational control is largely decentralised and responsibility
is delegated, the businesses are subject to the overall internal control
framework. This, by its nature, can provide reasonable but not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Detailed policies and procedures have been established by the Board
and/or the Executive Committee dealing with numerous issues,
including internal controls. Examples of internal control procedures 
are summarised below:
(i) Assessment of business risk
A system of risk identification assessment and identification 
and evaluation of controls is embedded within the Company’s
management processes. Strategic risks and opportunities arising 
from changes in the business environment are regularly reviewed 
by the Executive Committee and formally discussed by the Board.
Risks relating to key activities within the operating businesses and 
at the Company’s head office are assessed on a continuous basis 
and reported to the Executive Committee and the Board. Charter plc Annual Report 2007 45
(ii) Control environment
Under the Framework described on page 42, the Board sets overall
policy and delegates authority to implement that policy to the Executive
Committee, which is empowered to appoint nominees to the Board 
of AGI and to sub-delegate authority to the operating businesses 
of ESAB Global and Howden Global.
A well-defined organisational structure with clear operating procedures,
lines of responsibility and delegated authority has been established.
There are procedures for appraisal, review and authorisation of matters
of significance, including investments, capital expenditure, borrowings,
guarantees, indemnities and material contracts.
(iii) Information and communication
The Company’s operating procedures include a comprehensive
system for reporting financial and non-financial information to the
Board, including:
• the preparation and review of annual budgets;
• a review of the businesses at each Board meeting, focusing 
on any new risks arising (for example, those relating to proposed
major investments and key changes in the markets); and
• meetings between various Executive Directors and 
operational management.
(iv) Control procedures
Detailed operational procedures are developed for each key activity
that embody key controls. The implications of changes in law and
regulations are taken into account within these procedures.
Procedures are established to safeguard the assets of the Company
and its subsidiaries and to ensure that all financial transactions are
properly recorded. Accounting policies and practices are widely
disseminated throughout the Company’s subsidiaries and its affiliates.
(v) Monitoring process
There are clear procedures for monitoring the system of internal
controls. The significant components of these are:
• the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each
operating company are required to review internal controls and 
to return a self-certified internal control questionnaire confirming 
the effectiveness of internal control systems;
• each operating company deploys a variety of risk identification 
and assessment processes and develops mitigating actions. Major,
high or medium risks are escalated and progress on action plans
reviewed at least quarterly as part of management meetings. 
The Board reviews every six months the major and high risks 
and monitors progress against action plans.
• as part of its audit visits to operating companies the internal audit
function evaluates the effectiveness of internal controls. The Audit
Committee reviews the findings of the internal audit process;
• the Audit Committee has specific responsibility for reviewing 
the effectiveness of internal controls and monitors the process 
of assessing the internal controls on behalf of the Board; and
• the Audit Committee reviews the process by which risks are 
identified and assessed by operating units, operational 
management and the Board.
The Board confirms it has carried out a review of the effectiveness 
of the system of internal controls described above for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2007 and up to the date of this Report 
in accordance with the guidance set out in Internal Control: Revised
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code (the ‘Turnbull
Guidance’). The review encompassed operational, financial and
compliance controls as well as risk management. The system used
included the following elements:
• as part of their ongoing reviews of the business, the Executive
Directors and Key Management reviewed the effectiveness 
of strategic, operational and compliance internal controls and risk
management. This involved considering reports on key risk areas
(concentrating on significant changes in the risk profile) and in the
light of such reviews making appropriate amendments to policies
and procedures to control risks; and
• the Board considered reports from the Audit Committee and 
the Executive Directors on these areas during the year and at the
time of approving the Annual Report and Accounts, considered 
a summary of the assessments of the effectiveness of the key 
risks and controls identified.
4 Relations with shareholders 
The Company has a policy of maintaining an active dialogue with
institutional shareholders through individual meetings. Communications
with private shareholders are conducted through the Annual Report,
Company announcements, presentations at the AGM and the
Company’s website which includes descriptions of the Company’s
business operations.
The Board receives regular updates on all meetings and communications
with major shareholders and major shareholders are offered the
opportunity to meet with the Non-Executive Directors from time to time.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they
have concerns that cannot be addressed through regular channels
such as the Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director. Composition
The Committee presently comprises John Biles (Chairman), the Hon.
James Bruce, Grey Denham and Andrew Osborne, all of whom are
considered independent Non-Executive Directors pursuant to the
Combined Code. Their biographical details are set out on page 37.
There were no changes to the membership of the Committee during
2007. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board, as part of the review of the effectiveness of the Board and its
committees, has satisfied itself that The Hon. James Bruce, John Biles
and Andrew Osborne all have recent and relevant financial experience,
as required by the Combined Code.
Role of the Committee
The primary role of the Audit Committee, which reports its findings 
to the Board, is to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting and
audit processes, and the maintenance of a sound internal control and
risk management system. In pursuing these objectives, the Committee:
• monitors the integrity of the financial statements of the Company 
and any formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial
performance;
• makes recommendations to the Board regarding the adoption 
of Annual and Interim Financial Reports;
• reviews the Company’s internal financial controls and internal control
and risk management systems;
• monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
audit function;
• makes recommendations to the Board regarding the external
Auditors and their terms of appointment;
• reviews and monitors the external Auditors’ independence and
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process;
• is responsible for developing and implementing a policy on 
the engagement of the external Auditors to supply non-audit
services; and
• makes recommendations to the Board in relation to ‘whistleblowing’
policies and procedures.
In the performance of its duties, the Committee has independent access
to the services of the internal audit function and to the external Auditors,
and may obtain outside professional advice as necessary. Both the
Head of Internal Audit and the external Auditors have direct access 
to the Chairman of the Committee outside formal committee meetings.
The Committee has written terms of reference that outline its authority
and responsibilities. These are considered annually by the Audit
Committee and any proposed changes are referred to the Board for
approval. The Committee’ s current terms of reference are available upon
request from the Company Secretary and are on the Company’ s website.
Report on the Committee’s activities in 2007
Meetings and attendance
The Committee met on four occasions in 2007 timed to coincide 
with the financial and reporting cycles of the Company. Committee
members’ attendance at the meetings held during the year is set 
out in the table contained in the Corporate governance report 
on page 42.
The Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, representatives 
of the external Auditors, the Head of Internal Audit and senior financial
executives from head office and the operations attended meetings 
by invitation for appropriate business. In addition, the members of the
Committee met separately with the external Auditors and the Head 
of Internal Audit to discuss matters without the Executive Directors
being present.
During the year the Chairman of the Audit Committee has had
additional meetings with the Company’s senior financial managers 
to review a range of financial matters, and has also met with external
and internal Auditors prior to Audit Committee meetings.
46 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Audit Committee report
Financial reporting
During 2007 the Committee reviewed a wide range of financial reporting
and related matters, including the interim and annual financial
statements prior to their submission to the Board. The Committee
focused in particular on key accounting policies and practices adopted
by the Company and its subsidiaries and significant areas of judgement
that impacted reported results.
External Auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation
and monitoring of the Company’s policies on external audit. The Audit
Committee has reviewed those services provided by the external
Auditors throughout the year in accordance with the Company’s policy
on the provision of non-audit services by the external Auditors. 
This policy notes that such services are likely to fall within the following
types: (a) financial statements and external reports, (b) acquisitions, 
(c) disposals, (d) taxation and (e) other services. It identifies three
categories of non-audit services: permitted engagements that require
no specific approval; permitted engagements requiring the approval 
of the Committee Chairman; and engagements that are not permitted.
Non-audit fees of £1.2 million as a percentage of the total fees paid 
to the external Auditor of £3.4 million were 35 per cent.
In accordance with its remit, the Committee reviewed and approved
the external Auditors’ plans for the audit of the Company’s 2007
financial statements. In approving the terms of engagement for the
audit, the Committee considered the proposed audit fee and
associated expenses.
During the year the Committee performed its annual review of 
the effectiveness of the Company’s external Auditors, and has
recommended to the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be
reappointed as the external Auditors of the Company. The Committee
remains satisfied as to the independence of the external Auditors
following a review at its meeting on 27 February 2008, and has
received written confirmation from the external Auditors to this effect. 
Internal audit and monitoring of control issues
At its meetings during 2007, the Committee reviewed the results of 
the audits undertaken by the internal audit function and considered 
the adequacy of management’s response to the matters raised,
including the implementation of recommendations made by the
function. It also reviewed and approved the internal audit plan for the
coming year and the level of resources allocated to the internal audit
function. The review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function
was based primarily on guidelines issued by the Institute of Internal
Auditors. A new Head of Internal Audit was appointed during the year.
The Committee reviewed the reports from the internal audit function
and the external Auditors on the Company’s systems of internal
control and reported to the Board on the results of these reviews.
Further details of the Company’s system of internal control and its
policies and procedures can be found in the Corporate governance
report on pages 44 to 45.
Whistleblowing
The Company’s whistleblowing policy was monitored by the 
Audit Committee throughout 2007. Issues raised through 
the Company’s whistleblowing procedures during the year were
considered by the Committee, and any follow-up actions taken 
as and when required.
On behalf of the Committee

Remuneration report
The Directors present the Remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2007. The report contains all of the information 
that is required by Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and
describes how the Company has applied the principles of the
Combined Code with regard to remuneration. Sections 3(iii), 3(iv), 
3(v), 3(vi), 3(b) and the notes to the Remuneration report on pages 
50 and 51 are subject to audit.
1 The Remuneration Committee 
The Board has delegated authority to the Committee to review the
remuneration trends across the Company and its major businesses
and to determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions 
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman, the Company Secretary and 
the Key Management of the Company, as shown on pages 36 to 38. 
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration 
of those individuals identified as senior management by the Board 
of the Company.
Throughout 2007 the members of the Committee were as follows: 
The Hon. James Bruce (Chairman), John Biles, Grey Denham and
Andrew Osborne. Lars Emilson was appointed as a member of the
Committee on 14 September 2007 and, as Company Chairman, is
absent when his own fee is discussed by the Committee. All members
of the Committee are deemed independent in accordance with the
Combined Code (Lars Emilson was independent on appointment 
to the Company). Details of the number of meetings held by the
Committee during the year, as well as attendance details, can be
found in the table contained in the Corporate governance report 
on page 42.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available upon request 
from the Company Secretary and are on the Company’ s website. 
The Committee has access to the advice of the Chief Executive and 
the Company Secretary (neither of whom participated in any discussion
relating to their own remuneration) and a number of external advisers
in conducting its duties. During 2007 the Committee consulted the
following: Hewitt Associates, who provided the Company with actuarial
advice in relation to pensions and New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
(‘NBSC’), who provided independent advice to the Committee
regarding Executive Directors’ remuneration and long term incentive
arrangements (but no further services to the Company).
2 Remuneration policy 
The policy for Executive Directors and Key Management is designed 
to enable the Company to attract, motivate and retain individuals 
by ensuring that their rewards are both competitive and linked 
to individual and business performance.
Consistent with this policy, the remuneration packages of the
Executive Directors are intended to be competitive and comprise 
both fixed and performance-related elements. Performance-related
elements are designed to comprise a significant part of potential
remuneration. Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed each 
year to ensure that it is supportive of the Company’s business
objectives and the creation of shareholder value. It is the intention 
of the Committee that there should be long-term incentive plans for
Executive Directors whereby they are rewarded with interests in the
Company’s shares for sustained performance over a period of time.
The remuneration packages for other Key Management are designed
to operate on a basis similar to that of the Executive Directors.
3 Remuneration
(a) Executive Directors
(i) Base salary
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually 
and following exceptional one-off events where the individual
responsibilities of the Executive Director change significantly. Salaries 
are benchmarked against those paid to directors in companies of 
a similar size and international complexity as well as those operating 
within comparable sectors.
The salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed with effect from
1 November 2007 taking into account the additional responsibilities
that they assumed following the appointment of a Non-Executive
Chairman rather than an Executive Chairman on 1 November 2007.
These reviews incorporated the annual review of Executive Directors’
salaries which would otherwise have taken place on 1 January 2008.
(ii) Bonus
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2007 the Executive
Directors were contractually entitled to receive a maximum bonus 
of 100 per cent of base salary depending on the achievement of 
a number of corporate and individual targets as discussed below. 
It is the Company’ s policy that bonuses are only payable for the
achievement of stretching performance targets, the majority of which
are linked to the financial performance of the Company. For the year
ended 31 December 2007, these targets were as follows:
1. 64 per cent of bonus: EPS performance relative to budget
2. 16 per cent of bonus: Cash flow performance relative to budget
3. 20 per cent of bonus: Personal performance.
For targets 1 and 2, 50 per cent of the maximum bonus on each part
would be payable for meeting budget, the maximum bonus would 
only become payable for performance that was substantially in excess 
of budget and no bonus would be payable for performance that 
was substantially below budget. The Committee has reserved the
overriding discretion to review aggregate bonus levels payable 
to Executive Directors based on the above criteria to ensure that they 
are appropriate taking into account the overall financial performance 
of the Company and its performance relative to the market. No bonuses
payable to Executive Directors are pensionable. Bonuses equivalent 
to 99.2 per cent of salary were awarded to the Executive Directors 
in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007.
For the year ending 31 December 2008, bonuses payable to the
Executive Directors will be measured against the same performance
objectives as those used in determining the 2007 bonus entitlements
of the Executive Directors save that target 2 (cash flow performance
relative to budget) will be appraised both at the half year and the 
full year. Targets 1 (EPS performance in relation to budget) and 3
(Personal performance) will continue to be appraised at the year end.
Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
One quarter of any bonus paid to Executive Directors (i.e. up to 
25 per cent of salary) will be paid in shares acquired in the market 
and compulsorily deferred for three years under the DBP . If the
Executive Director leaves voluntarily or for cause during this deferral
period, his awards will normally lapse. These shares are held in trust
prior to their release on vesting following the expiration of the three
year deferral period.  (iii) Long-term incentives
Michael Foster’s Long-term Incentive Plan (the ‘MF Plan’)
Michael Foster was granted an option over the Company’s ordinary
shares pursuant to a one-off arrangement that was put in place
specifically to facilitate and secure his appointment as Commercial
Director in 2005. As a result no awards were made under the MF Plan
in respect of the year under review and there is no intention to make
any awards under this plan in the future.
The option vests on 13 March 2008, following the announcement of
the Company’s Preliminary Results for the year ended 31 December
2007 and is exercisable for a period of 12 months thereafter. Two
performance conditions are attached to the MF Plan.
Exercise of 50 per cent of the option requires average real earnings 
per share growth of 3 per cent per annum over a single three-year
period whilst exercise of the remaining 50 per cent is dependent 
on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance
compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding
Investment Trusts). No vesting will occur for a below median TSR
ranking, 50 per cent of the TSR portion of the grant will vest for a
median ranking and 100 per cent will vest for a ranking within the
upper quartile, with straight line vesting for intermediate performance.
Benefits under the MF Plan are not pensionable.
The Committee has determined, following advice from its external
remuneration consultants, NBSC, that the TSR ranking of the Company
was No. 2 in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts) and
thus was in the upper quartile TSR ranking, and that the average 
real earnings per share growth over the performance period was 
229 per cent above the three per cent performance condition.
Accordingly the option will vest on 13 March 2008.
Charter 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Under the LTIP , Executive Directors and selected other members of
Key Management are eligible to receive awards in one of three forms: 
(i) conditional allocations, where a participant receives free ordinary
shares in the Company automatically on vesting; (ii) nil (or nominal)
cost options, where a participant can decide when to exercise his
award during a short period after it has vested; or (iii) forfeitable shares
in the Company, which are similar to conditional shares except that 
the participant has certain shareholder rights prior to vesting. 
The Remuneration Committee may also decide to grant cash-based
awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy
share-based awards in cash (either in whole or in part), although 
it does not intend to do so except where it would be expedient 
in overseas jurisdictions.
An individual may not receive awards in any financial year over shares
having a market value in excess of 100 per cent of his annual salary
except, in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention,
where an individual may receive an award over shares worth up to 
200 per cent of his annual salary.
Vesting is based on the Company’s TSR performance compared to
the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts)
over a single three-year period beginning on the date of the grant 
of the award. No vesting occurs for a below median ranking. 
At median, 25 per cent of the shares vest and at upper quartile 
100 per cent of the shares vest. Between median and upper quartile
rankings, awards vest on a straight line basis. In addition, awards 
only vest if the Committee is satisfied that there has been a significant
improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance over
the three-year performance period. Awards normally only vest on or
after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided the individual
remains an employee of the Company and the performance conditions
and any other objective conditions have been satisfied. LTIP participants
have received annual conditional awards of shares at nil cost from 
its inception.
48 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Remuneration report (continued)
During the year the Committee made five awards pursuant to the LTIP .
On 22 March 2007, Michael Foster, Robert Careless, James Deeley,
Jon Templeman and Bob Cleland were made conditional awards 
of shares and details of the awards made to the Executive Directors
can be found on page 51. 
(iv) Dilution
During the year the Company remained within the headroom limits 
set out in the ABI Guidelines ‘Executive Remuneration – Policies and
Practices’, for the Company’s existing share plans as set out below:
Total issued share capital at 31 December 2007 166,699,142
All schemes (10% in any rolling 10-year period) 5,803,621
Remaining headroom 10,866,293
Discretionary schemes (5% in any rolling 10-year period) 5,803,621
Remaining headroom 2,531,336
The Committee has the flexibility to satisfy awards pursuant to the LTIP
by either a market purchase or new issue of the Company’s shares. 
To date the Company has not bought shares to hedge the exposure 
to the Company’s share price, however, the Committee intends to
review its hedging policy closer to the date for the vesting of the first
awards under the LTIP . Awards under the DBP will be satisfied by
shares purchased on the market.
(v) Pensions
Michael Foster and Robert Careless are both members of the
Company’s HMRC approved pension scheme, providing benefits 
of one-thirtieth of base salary and one-forty-fifth of base salary
respectively for each year of service as an Executive Director. 
They are both subject to a cap on pensionable earnings of £105,600
per annum and are entitled to receive, in lieu of pension over the cap,
an additional 25 per cent of non-pensionable salary to the extent that
their base salaries exceed this cap. These payments are included in
their emoluments shown on page 50.
James Deeley is a member of the Company’s HMRC approved
pension scheme and is provided with benefits of one-forty-fifth 
of his base salary for each year of pensionable service subject 
to a cap on pensionable earnings of £105,600. Prior to 1 November
2007 the Company additionally contributed 9 per cent of his base
salary in excess of this cap to the Company’s defined contribution
stakeholder pension scheme. Following 1 November 2007 in lieu 
of pension over the cap, Mr Deeley is entitled to receive an additional
25 per cent of non-pensionable salary to the extent that his base
salary exceeds the cap. This change was made in order to align 
Mr Deeley’s benefits with those of Messrs Foster and Careless.
Details of pension entitlements can be found in the table on page 50.
(vi) Other benefits
Further benefits contained within the remuneration packages of 
the Executive Directors comprise tax assessable benefits arising 
from employment and include car and petrol allowances, medical
insurance for the Executive Directors and their immediate dependants
and life assurance. Charter plc Annual Report 2007 49
(vii) Service contracts
Details of the service contracts of those individuals who served as Executive Directors during the year are set out in the table below: The service
contracts of all Executive Directors, other than that of David Gawler, contain a retirement age of 65.

(1) David Gawler retired on 31 October 2007.
(viii) Total shareholder return (‘TSR’)
TSR calculations are carried out independently by NBSC by monitoring the percentage change in the Company’s share price plus dividends
reinvested over a period of time. The chart below sets out the TSR generated by Charter and the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index
(excluding investment trusts) since 2002.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of 
Charter plc should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies.
(b) Non-Executive Directors

(1) The accrued entitlement includes that earned by Robert Careless as an employee, prior to becoming a Director, as well as that earned for qualifying services after becoming a Director.
(2) The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to the end of 2007 under the approved scheme.
(3) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(4) The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme’s liabilities in respect of the
Director’s pension benefits. It does not represent sums payable to the individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
(5) The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the
change in his transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market
volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.

The Hon. James Bruce
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
12 March 2008 Independent Auditors’ report to the members 
of Charter plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Charter plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated
cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of recognised
income and expense and the related notes. These group financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set 
out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Charter plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that 
is described as having been audited. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ report is consistent with the group financial statements. 
The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific
information presented in the Business and financial review that 
is cross referred from the Business and financial review section 
of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required 
to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control 
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
report, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s statement, 
the Business and financial review, the unaudited part of the
Remuneration report, the Corporate Governance Statement and the
other information listed on the contents page of the Annual Report. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the group
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state 
of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit 
and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with 
the group financial statements.

Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense For the year ended 31 December 2007
1 Accounting policies
(i) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Charter plc have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations 
as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the UK as well as those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies
reporting under IFRS.
Use of adjusted measures
To help provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance adjusted earnings per share excludes:
• amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill;
• items which are both material and non-recurring (exceptional items); and
• foreign currency exchange differences on the retranslation of intercompany loans, which are determined by reference to movements in exchange
rates. These amounts are likely to be volatile and are unrelated to underlying performance.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated, in respect 
of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets
and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS requires the Group to make
estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, estimates are evaluated using historical experience, consultation
with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the particular circumstances to ensure compliance with IFRS. Actual results
may differ significantly from these estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become
known. Should circumstances change, such that different assumptions, estimates and judgements are considered to be more appropriate, this
may give rise to material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year particularly in respect of the key
estimates, judgements and assumptions outlined below.
Construction contracts
Revenue and profit on construction contracts are usually recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract calculated by reference 
to estimates of contract revenue and expected costs including provisions for warranty and product liability. At 31 December 2007, amounts
receivable/payable under construction contracts were £55.7 million (2006: £38.4 million) and £82.2 million (2006: £53.6 million) respectively.
Contract retentions held by customers at 31 December 2007, in respect of construction contracts amounted to £29.3 million (2006: £22.1 million).
Warranty and product liability provisions at 31 December 2007, of £21.3 million (2006: £14.6 million) mainly relate to construction contracts.
Employee benefits
Provisions for defined benefit post employment obligations are calculated by independent actuaries. The principal actuarial assumptions and
estimates used are based on independent actuarial advice and include the discount rate and estimates of life expectancy. At 31 December 2007,
the net retirement benefit obligation was £76.6 million (2006: £108.8 million).
Goodwill impairment testing
Capitalised goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Should the carrying value of the goodwill exceed its recoverable amount an impairment loss
is recognised. The recoverable amounts are calculated based on the estimated value in use of cash-generating units. These calculations require
estimates of cash flows and discount rates based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with
particular cash-generating units. At 31 December 2007, the carrying amount of capitalised goodwill was £60.1 million (2006: £39.3 million).
Provisions
Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement. These include provisions for legal and environmental claims.
Calculations of these provisions are based on cash flows relating to these costs estimated by management supported by the use of external
consultants, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material. At 31 December 2007, these provisions amounted 
to £29.7 million (2006: £29.7 million).
Tax estimates
The Group’s tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in effect. The determination of appropriate provisions for current and
deferred income taxation requires the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate the Group’s ability to 
utilise tax benefits through future earnings and tax planning. These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events. At 31 December
2007, income tax liabilities provided were £27.3 million (2006: £22.0 million) and net deferred income tax assets recognised amounted 
to £12.7 million (2006: £10.0 million).
Changes to accounting policies
Employee benefits – recognition of actuarial gains and losses and classification of income statement charge
All actuarial gains and losses are now recognised immediately directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
Previously actuarial gains and losses below a certain threshold were not recognised and those above this threshold were recognised 
in the income statement prospectively over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in the plan.
A statement of recognised income and expense is now presented as a primary statement instead of a statement of changes in equity.
The classification of the income statement charge has been changed such that the expected return on schemes’ assets and interest on schemes’
liabilities are now included within the net financing credit. Previously these items were included in arriving at operating profit.
These changes have been implemented with effect from 1 January 2007 and the 2006 comparatives have been restated to reflect these changes.
The Directors consider these changes align the Group more closely with general UK accounting practice under IFRS.

Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements – Capital disclosures’,
introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Group’s
financial instruments or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 but not relevant or have an insignificant impact on the Group’s 
financial statements
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2007, but they are not relevant or have an insignificant impact on the Group’s financial statements:
• IFRS 4, ‘Insurance contracts’;
• IFRIC 7, ‘Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies’;
• IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’;
• IFRIC 9, ‘Re-assessment of embedded derivatives’; and
• IFRIC 10, ‘Interim financial reporting and impairment’.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted 
by the Group
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
• IAS 23 (Amendment), ‘Borrowing costs’ (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement 
by the European Union. It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset. The option of
immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. The Group will apply IAS 23 (Amendment) from 1 January 2009 but it is 
currently not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
• IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’ (effective from 1 January 2009). IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of 
the US standard SFAS 131, ‘Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information’. The new standard requires a ‘management
approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. The Group will apply
IFRS 8 from 1 January 2009. The expected impact is being assessed, but it appears likely that the number of reportable segments, as well 
as the manner in which the segments are reported, will change in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker.
• IFRIC 14, ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction’ (effective from 1 January 2008).
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset. It also explains
how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement. The Group will apply IFRIC 14
from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any significant impact on the Group’s financial statements. 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Group’s operations
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2008 or later periods but are not relevant for the Group’s operations:
• IFRIC 12, ‘Service concession arrangements’ (effective from 1 January 2008). IFRIC 12 applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private
sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services. IFRIC 12 
is not relevant to the Group’s operations because none of the Group’s companies provide for public sector services.
• IFRIC 13, ‘Customer loyalty programmes’ (effective from 1 July 2008). IFRIC 13 clarifies that where goods or services are sold together with 
a customer loyalty incentive (for example, loyalty points or free products), the arrangement is a multiple-element arrangement and the consideration
receivable from the customer is allocated between the components of the arrangement in using fair values. IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the
Group’s operations because none of the Group’s companies operate any loyalty programmes.
(ii) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity. A shareholding of more
than one-half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is
transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus the costs directly
attributable to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired,
including all separately identifiable intangible assets, is goodwill which has been recorded as an intangible asset since 1 January 1998 (see (viii) (a)
Goodwill below). Where additional shareholdings in associate entities are acquired any fair value adjustments related to the shareholdings prior 
to the increase in shareholding are taken directly to equity.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, normally on the basis of a shareholding of between 
20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are 
initially recorded at cost.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post acquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the income statement and its share
of post acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the
Group’s interest in the associates.
The Group has taken advantage of the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations that took place
before 1 January 2004.
(iii) Segmental reporting
The Group’s primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments. A business segment is a group 
of assets and operations engaged in providing products that are subject to risks and returns that are different from other business segments.
Segmental assets comprise total assets excluding income tax assets. Segmental liabilities comprise total liabilities excluding income tax liabilities
and borrowings other than bank overdrafts. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment
that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments. Revenue by geographic
segment is allocated based on the country in which the customer is located. Assets and capital expenditure by geographic segment are allocated
based on where the assets are located.
(iv) Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements for each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which that entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency
and presentation currency of Charter plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. The results and 
net assets of all Group companies that have non-sterling functional currency are included in the consolidated financial statements as follows:
(a) Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date;
(b) Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period; and
(c) All resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders’ equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part 
of the gain or loss on sale.
(v) Financial assets
The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. Management determines the classification 
of an asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates their designation at each reporting date. Assets are classified as: loans and receivables; held 
to maturity investments; available-for-sale financial assets; or financial assets where changes in fair value are charged (or credited) to the income
statement. Available-for-sale financial assets include non-derivatives not classified in any of the other categories.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification. On initial recognition loans and receivables and held-to-maturity
investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets where
changes in fair value are charged (or credited) to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value. Realised and unrealised gains
and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit and loss’ category are included in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified
as available-for-sale are recognised in equity. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value
adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
60 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) Charter plc Annual Report 2007 61
1 Accounting policies (continued)
(v) Financial assets (continued)
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired or has been transferred, and the Company
has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’. They are classified 
as current if they are expected to be realised within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
(vi) Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, that are used as hedges in the financing 
and financial risk management of the Group are categorised as hedges. Derivative financial instruments categorised as hedges are initially measured
at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the
nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities
(fair value hedge); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
(net investment hedge). 
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement
together with any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective
hedge is recognised in shareholders’ equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement. When hedged cash flows result in
the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders’ equity are included in the
initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders’ equity are
transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement. For net investment hedges
gains and losses accumulated in shareholders’ equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
(vii) Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except that
certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004. These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004 
as allowed by IFRS 1.
In accordance with the benchmark treatment under IFRS, borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment are not
capitalised. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’ s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the
replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method spreading the difference between cost and
residual value over the estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings 30-50 years
Plant, machinery and equipment 8-14 years
Vehicles 5 years
IT equipment 3-5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. A review of useful lives of plant,
machinery and equipment was performed during 2006. This resulted in a reduction of the depreciation charge of £1.6 million for 2006, which is
expected to recur over the remaining life of the plant, machinery and equipment.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its recoverable
amount (see (ix) Impairment of assets below). 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
(viii) Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the
subsidiary or associate acquired. 
Goodwill, represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Group’s previous accounting policy together with additional amounts
arising since that date is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is included in intangible
assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates in relation to associates. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004,
the classification and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves. Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December
2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, 
a period not exceeding twenty years or included as part of the carrying value of associates. 
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) that are
expected to benefit from the business combination.
(b) Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38
‘Intangible assets’, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually
between three and ten years. 
(c) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful life of the licence, usually between three and five years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in which 
it is incurred, except such costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by
the Group that are likely to generate benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised 
on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than three years. 1 Accounting policies (continued)
(viii) Intangible assets (continued)
(d) Intangibles arising on acquisitions
In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and
relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how. All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the
expected useful economic lives, usually between three and ten years.
(ix) Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are
subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
(x) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out (‘FIFO’) basis or the average cost
basis. Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred. 
(xi) Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This
condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within one year from the
date of classification.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be depreciated from
the date of classification.
(xii) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all
amounts due. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money
is considered material. Amounts due after more than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified in the balance sheet as ‘non-current’.
(xiii) Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts
Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the
balance sheet.
(xiv) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(xv) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Where borrowings
are used to hedge the Group’s interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined
to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders’ equity are included in the income
statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months
after the balance sheet date.
(xvi) Taxation
Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred income taxation. Tax is recognised in the income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity including actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obligations (see (xvii)
Employee benefits below) and share-based payments (see (xviii) Share-based payments below), in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting temporary
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or where the
remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
(xvii) Employee benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and similar post retirement benefits (principally healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’.
In respect of defined benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined by the
plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan assets,
together with an adjustment for any unrecognised past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Taxation attributable to actuarial gains and losses is taken to equity.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining 
in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
62 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) Charter plc Annual Report 2007 63
1 Accounting policies (continued)
(xvii) Employee benefits (continued)
For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, past service
cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments. Interest on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is included within the
financing credit in the income statement. For defined contribution plans, where the Group pays a fixed contribution into a separate entity and has
no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether or not the fund has sufficient assets to pay all employees
the benefits relating to service in the current and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
For other defined benefit post employment obligations, principally post employment medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting
methodology to that for defined benefit pension plans is used.
Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group
can benefit in future, for example, by refunds or a reduction in contributions. Movements in the amount of any irrecoverable surplus are recognised
directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
(xviii) Share-based payments
The Group operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
In the case of equity-settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This expense
is spread over the vesting period of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. Taxation attributable to the excess of the fair value
over the charge to the income statement is taken to equity. The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is re-measured
at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent 
it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cash-settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date, with changes
recognised in the income statement. For cash-settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
(xix) Government grants
Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant
are met. Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated. Where
they relate to revenue expenditure and/or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure
is incurred and criteria met.
(xx) Provisions for other liabilities
Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the Group
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. If all these conditions are not met then no provision is recognised. Incurred but 
not reported (‘IBNR’) amounts are included in provisions. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. If the effect of discounting 
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
(xxi) Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work executed during the
year in respect of construction contracts. Revenue, which is recorded net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intra-
group sales, is recognised as follows:
(a) Sales of goods and services
The majority of the Group’s revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a group entity has fulfilled its
contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration. In respect of the sale of goods this is usually 
on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
(b) Construction contracts
Revenue is recognised by a group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer. The stage 
of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the contract, where
this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable. Contract losses are determined to be the
amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the
contract.
(xxii) Leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term. Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group
substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included 
in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance leases. The lease
rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations
and the interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting
period. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
(xxiii) Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the accounts in the period when paid or, if earlier, in which the dividends
are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 2 Segment analysis
Primary reporting format – business segments
The Group is organised into two principal businesses: ESAB (welding, cutting and automation) and Howden (air and gas handling). For the
purposes of IAS 14 ‘Segment reporting’, ESAB is split into two segments: (i) welding; and (ii) cutting and automation. Inter-segmental revenue 
is not significant.
The following is an analysis of the revenue, results, assets and liabilities for the year analysed by business segment, the Group’s primary basis 
of segmentation.

5 Exceptional items
To help provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance, items which are both material and non-recurring are presented
as exceptional items.
In the year ended 31 December 2006, there was an exceptional credit to the tax charge of £10.5 million on the recognition of a deferred income
tax asset in respect of unrecognised tax losses in North America that arose in prior years that will be utilised in future periods. As a consequence
of this, the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2006 was reduced by £10.5 million.

9 Earnings per share
Basic headline earnings per share is calculated on an average of 166,693,787 shares (2006: 165,952,056 shares).
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 458,103 
(2006: 1,101,560) dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options 
granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year 
and the potentially issuable shares under the Group’s long-term incentive plans.
To help provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and
goodwill, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including attributable tax and minority
interests, are excluded from the calculations of adjusted earnings per share as set out in the following table. It should be noted that the term
‘adjusted’ is not defined under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies. 
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to IFRS, measures of profit.

Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected
to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amounts of goodwill have been allocated as follows:
2007 2006
£m £m
Welding
Alcotec (single CGU) 10.4 10.4
ESAB Sp z o.o. (single CGU) 5.8 5.8

Howden South Africa (several CGUs) 2.6 0.9
Howden Compressors (several CGUs) 7.3 7.2
60.1 39.3
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations 
are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount 
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on
industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts. Selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future 
changes in the market. 10 Intangible assets (continued)
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next two years and
extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on estimated growth rates detailed in the table below. This does not exceed the average
long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows are detailed in the table below.

Other intangible assets have finite lives, over which the assets are amortised. The amortisation periods are set out in the accounting policies 
on pages 61 and 62.
Development costs are internally generated.
Amortisation has been included in the income statement as follows:

Development costs are amortised once the asset is brought into use. The Group tests development costs for assets not yet brought into use 
at least annually for impairment.
No impairment losses have been recognised in either 2007 or 2006.

business, and £0.3 million (2006: £0.3 million) in respect of property costs in the welding, cutting and automation business. This is expected 
to result in cash expenditure in the next one to two years. The remaining provisions in this category are also expected to be utilised over the
next one to two years. The effect of discounting these provisions is not material.
(ii) Warranty and product liability provisions relate to continuing businesses and are expected to be utilised over a period of one to two years
dependent on the warranty period provided but will also be replaced by comparable amounts as they are utilised. The effect of discounting
these provisions is not material. 18 Provisions for other liabilities (continued)
(iii) Provision has been made for the probable exposure arising from legal and environmental claims and disputes, both existing and threatened, 
in some cases arising from warranties given on disposal of businesses. Provisions have been made representing the best estimate of the
outcome of the claims including costs before taking account of insurance recoveries. Where the outcome of a claim is uncertain the legal 
costs of defence have been provided for to the extent that they are reliably measurable. Where appropriate insurance recoveries are
recognised in ‘receivables’. At 31 December 2007 these receivables amounted to £6.7 million (2006: £6.9 million). If the effect of discounting
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Due to their nature, it is not possible
to predict precisely when these provisions will be utilised though most are expected to be utilised over the short to medium term with
utilisation in the next year expected to be in the region of £11 million (2006: £10 million) before taking account of insurance recoveries.
(iv) Other provisions include various amounts which are not individually material. Due to their nature it is not possible to predict precisely when
these provisions will be utilised but utilisation in the next year is expected to be in the region of £1 to £2 million (2006: £1 to £2 million).

of such earnings and has no intention of making any such remittance.
A deferred income tax liability of £1.3 million (2006: £1.5 million) is provided in respect of the tax that would be payable on the remittance of the

The major pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and are of the defined benefit type, the assets of which are held 
in trustee administered funds. The Group also provides post employment medical benefits in the United States.
Change in accounting policy for recognition of actuarial gains and losses and classification of income statement charge
As explained in note 1 all actuarial gains and losses are now recognised immediately directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income 
and expense. Previously actuarial gains and losses below a certain threshold were not recognised and those above this threshold were recognised
in the income statement prospectively over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in the plan.
The classification of the income statement charge has been changed such that the expected return on schemes’ assets and interest on schemes’
liabilities are now included within the net financing credit. Previously these items were included in arriving at operating profit.
These changes have been implemented with effect from 1 January 2007 and the 2006 comparatives have been restated to reflect these changes.
The Directors consider these changes align the Group more closely with general UK accounting practice under IFRS.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas defined benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States post employment medical
benefits are assessed by professionally qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on either the PA92 or PA00 standard mortality tables after retirement with allowance for
future mortality improvements and scheme specific factors. Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live
on average for a further 26 years (2006: 25 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 29 years (2006: 28 years) after retirement if they
are female. A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 25 years (2006: 24 years) if they are male and for 
a further 28 years (2006: 27 years) if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States. The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been derived from the
RP-2000 table with allowance for further mortality improvements. Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will
live on average for a further 24 years (2006: 22 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 26 years (2006: 24 years) after retirement if
they are female. A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 23 years (2006: 22 years) if they are male and for 
a further 25 years (2006: 24 years) if they are female. Mortality assumptions for schemes in Sweden and Germany have been derived from the
FFFS 2007 tables and the Heubeck 2005 G tables respectively.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term results for the various asset classes. Equity returns are developed
based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes’ holdings of these
instruments. Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience.
The estimated impact on the liability for defined benefit pensions and post employment medical benefits as at 31 December 2007 resulting from
changes to key assumptions is set out below:

A 1 per cent increase in the inflation assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by £0.1 million and the
liability by £1.6 million. A 1 per cent decrease in the inflation assumption on medical costs would reduce the total service cost and interest cost 
by £0.1 million and the liability by £1.5 million.

(i) Risk management
(a) Treasury management
Charter’ s central treasury department is responsible for ensuring there are appropriate funding arrangements to meet the ongoing requirements
of the Group and for managing effectively liquid funds held in the Group. In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks and
balance sheet foreign currency translation risks of the Group within guidelines agreed by the Board. Foreign currency transaction risks are
generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries in accordance with guidelines and controls defined in Group policy. Regular cash flow
forecasts are prepared and reviewed by management.
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations mainly from its own cash resources. It is the Group’s objective to minimise the cost of borrowings and
maximise the value from cash resources, whilst retaining the flexibility of funding opportunities. If considered appropriate, the Group would
use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile and to manage
the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
(c) Currency risk
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations and recurring exposures to exchange rate fluctuations in respect of foreign 
currency transactions. As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the Group’s balance sheet and income statement. In certain
circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet
translation exposures. Forward foreign exchange contracts may be used to hedge cash flows resulting from foreign currency transactions.
The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate. 
(d) Credit risk
The credit status of dealing counterparties and institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and 
monitored regularly.
(e) Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain committed facilities to ensure that there are sufficient funds for current operations and their future
growth.  During the year the Group increased its principal committed facility to £75 million.
(f) Capital management
The Group aims to manage its capital structure in order to safeguard the going concern of the Group and to provide returns for shareholders
and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets. Capital is regarded as consisting of total equity, net
cash and retirement benefit obligations.

(iii) Market price risk
(a) Interest rate risk
On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that a rise/fall of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which the Group’s 
cash balances are exposed would increase/decrease profit before tax by approximately £0.9 million (2006: £0.5 million).
On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that a rise/fall of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which the Group’s
borrowings are exposed would decrease/increase profit before tax by approximately £0.3 million (2006: £0.2 million).

It is estimated that the impact of a 10 per cent strengthening/weakening of the exchange rates of the principal currencies to which the
Group’s receivables are exposed would increase/decrease profit before tax by approximately £1.4 million (2006: £1.9 million). 
It is estimated that the impact of a 10 per cent strengthening/weakening of the exchange rates of the principal currencies to which the
Group’s payables are exposed would decrease/increase profit before tax by approximately £2.5 million (2006: £2.8 million).
(iv) Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets is represented by the amount of cash and cash equivalents and trade
and other receivables. Details of the credit risk relating to financial assets are given in note 14 and note 15 in relation to trade and other receivables
and cash and cash equivalents respectively.
(v) Liquidity risk
An analysis of the maturity profile of financial liabilities is given in note 16 and (vi) below in relation to borrowings and derivative financial
instruments respectively. Financial liabilities included within trade and other payables (note 17) have a contractual maturity date within 12 months

Forward foreign exchange contracts totalling US$43.0 million (2006: US$12.0 million) were designated as a hedge of the Group’s US$ denominated
investments in foreign operations at 31 December 2007. There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment hedges in either 2007
or 2006.

The fair values of foreign exchange contracts have been calculated by reference to the prices available from the market on which the instruments
are traded. All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The fair values of short-
term deposits and borrowings approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.

allotted to David Gawler in settlement of his entitlement under the terms of the DG (2004) incentive plan and 72,786 options over ordinary shares
were surrendered for cash consideration of £489,710.
At 31 December 2007 , 3 (2006: 5) participants held options over a total of 228,506 (2006: 242,146) ordinary shares of the Company. During 2007 ,
options over 10,287 ordinary shares were exercised and options over 3,353 shares lapsed. These options were granted under various employee
share option schemes and are exercisable during various periods up to 29 March 2011 at prices ranging from 139.9 pence to 218.0 pence.
Included in the above, under the terms of the Equity Partnership Plan approved by shareholders in 1997, are deferred rights to acquire shares.
This plan has not operated since 2001. At 31 December 2007, 1 participant held rights over 13,004 shares. These rights expire on 30 March
2008. As none of the performance targets associated with any of the awards has been met, the awards would only be of value in the event of 
a change of control of the Company. The exercise price of these awards would be funded by a cash bonus payable at the date of exercise and
therefore the effective cost to the allottee would be nil.
Details of awards of contingent rights to the allotment of ordinary shares in the Company under long-term incentive plans are given in the
Remuneration report on pages 47 to 51.

27 Contingent liabilities
(i) Central operations
Since about 1985, Charter, its principal subsidiary Charter Consolidated PLC, and certain of their wholly owned subsidiaries have been named 
as defendants in asbestos-related actions in the United States. These lawsuits have alleged that the Charter defendants were liable for the acts 
of Cape PLC, a former partly owned subsidiary of Charter. Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was
resolved in Charter’s favour either at trial or on appeal. In subsequent years, Charter and its subsidiaries have continued to be named in asbestos-
related lawsuits. Charter has contested these actions and, in most cases, has obtained dismissals. Charter has settled some of the cases brought
in Mississippi. Currently, the only pending cases against Charter are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued 
by plaintiffs. The Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend
successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action. 
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages, which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any 
of its wholly owned subsidiaries. The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charter’s operating profits in 2007 were negligible. 
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is
unlikely to have a material effect on Charter’s financial position. In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate 
to make provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
(ii) Air and gas handling
Howden Buffalo Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in the United
States. On the advice of counsel, Howden Buffalo is vigorously defending all the cases that have been filed against it. Over the past few years,
Howden Buffalo has sought and received dismissals in 10,024 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 313 cases. These cases were 
all settled for nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial. Howden Buffalo has received legal advice indicating
that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought. At this time, it is not practical to estimate the amount of any
potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the majority of cases do not specify the amount
of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process. However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims
and the cost of the settlements have been covered by applicable insurance. The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of
asbestos-related lawsuits against Howden Buffalo, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden Buffalo
known as Buffalo Forge Company, will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance. The situation is reviewed regularly 
and based on the most recent review and legal advice obtained by Howden Buffalo, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential
liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charter’s financial position.

27 Contingent liabilities (continued)
(iii) Welding
The ESAB Group Inc. (‘EGI’), an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and federal courts 
in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables. Other current and former
manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various other defendants such as distributors, trade
associations and others. The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts. A multi-district
litigation proceeding has been established to consolidate and co-ordinate pre-trial proceedings in the federal court cases. Last year, the federal
court denied a motion to certify a class action of welders who were seeking medical monitoring relief on behalf of all welders in eight states who
were exposed to welding fumes. Subsequently, the named plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss their individual claims. In addition, EGI and four other
welding companies were defendants in a federal court trial involving a single claimant. The jury returned a verdict of US$20.5 million against the
five defendants, including EGI, which, if upheld on appeal, would be shared among the defendants. Since the year end, EGI and two other
welding companies were defendants in a further federal court trial involving a single claimant. The jury returned a verdict of US$0.72 million by way
of compensatory damages (after a 40 per cent reduction to take account of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff) which, if upheld on appeal,
would be shared among the defendants. In addition the jury awarded punitive damages of US$1.7 million of which EGI’s share is US$0.75 million.
Post-trial motions seeking to overturn these verdicts have been or will be filed, and it is anticipated that in each case an appeal will be filed if the
post-trial motions are denied. With the exception of the punitive damage award, if upheld on appeal, these verdicts would be covered in
substantial part by insurance.
EGI was also a defendant in a number of state court trials. However, all of those cases were either dismissed or postponed. There are 10
manganese trials scheduled for the balance of 2008, although it is not anticipated that they will all involve EGI or that they will proceed to trial 
as scheduled. Additional trials could also be scheduled. 
Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGI’s counsel 
in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in whole or in part
by insurance. EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending these claims vigorously.
The defence costs, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of US$20 million, which is reflected in EGI’s balance sheet at 
31 December 2007. In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United States, the Directors do not consider that
such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charter’s financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants allege asbestos-
induced personal injuries. The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts from EGI, other
welding consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of asbestos products. Several cases are listed for trial 
this year; however, EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant. Upon the advice of counsel,
the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend these lawsuits, which should be
covered in whole or in part by insurance. In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by EGI’s insurers.

In addition there are contingent liabilities entered into in the normal course of business from which no liability is expected to arise.

For the year ended 31 December 2007
1 Basis of preparation
The financial information in this report for the Company has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out in note 2 using accounting
principles generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP) and the Companies Act 1985. As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the 
profit and loss account is not presented. Details of the Auditors’ remuneration payable by the Company is disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated
accounts on page 66.
2 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from
the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the profit
and loss account.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred income taxation
Deferred income taxation is provided on the incremental liability approach in respect of timing differences giving rise to an asset or liability.
Deferred income taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred income
taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments
The Company operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This expense is spread over the vesting 
period of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards 
is re-measured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting 
periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Interest
Interest on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings held at amortised cost is recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective 
interest method. Interest includes exchange differences arising on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the period when paid or, if earlier, in which the dividends are approved 
by the Company’s shareholders. Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment has been established and 
is unconditional.

In 2007, 10,287 ordinary shares were issued for cash of £30,583 on the exercise of employee share options.
In 2006, 314,371 ordinary shares were issued for cash of £580,390 on the exercise of employee share options, 1,120,579 ordinary shares were
allotted to David Gawler in settlement of his entitlement under the terms of the DG (2004) incentive plan and 72,786 options over ordinary shares
were surrendered for cash consideration of £489,710.
At 31 December 2007 , 3 (2006: 5) participants held options over a total of 228,506 (2006: 242,146) ordinary shares of the Company. During 2007
options over 10,287 ordinary shares were exercised and options over 3,353 shares lapsed. These options were granted under various employee
share option schemes and are exercisable during various periods up to 29 March 2011 at prices ranging from 139.9 pence to 218.0 pence.
Included in the above, under the terms of the Equity Partnership Plan approved by shareholders in 1997, are deferred rights to acquire shares.
This plan has not operated since 2001. At 31 December 2007, 1 participant held rights over 13,004 shares. These rights expire on 30 March
2008. As none of the performance targets associated with any of the awards has been met, the awards would only be of value in the event of 
a change of control of the Company. The exercise price of these awards would be funded by a cash bonus payable at the date of exercise and
therefore the effective cost to the allottee would be nil.
Details of awards of contingent rights to the allotment of ordinary shares in the Company under long-term incentive plans are given in the
Remuneration report on pages 47 to 51.

2006 and 2007 awards
The awards granted under the Charter 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) were valued using the Stochastic (‘Monte Carlo’) model as follows:
Grant date
24 March 2006 10 July 2006 22 March 2007
Number of shares 113,525 19,257 125,506
Fair value – £ 591,125 95,072 684,008

Expected volatility % 42.6 41.1 31.8
Risk-free interest rate % 4.4 4.8 5.3
Dividend yield % –––
Expected volatility is calculated based on historical volatility for the Company. The total shareholder return performance condition of the awards
has been incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
10 Contingent liabilities
Since about 1985, Charter, its principal subsidiary Charter Consolidated PLC, and certain of their wholly owned subsidiaries have been named 
as defendants in asbestos-related actions in the United States. These lawsuits have alleged that the Charter defendants were liable for the acts 
of Cape PLC, a former partly owned subsidiary of Charter. Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was
resolved in Charter’s favour either at trial or on appeal. In subsequent years, Charter and its subsidiaries have continued to be named in asbestos-
related lawsuits. Charter has contested these actions and, in most cases, has obtained dismissals. Charter has settled some of the cases brought
in Mississippi. Currently, the only pending cases against Charter are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued 
by plaintiffs. The Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend
successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action. 
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages, which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any 
of its wholly owned subsidiaries. The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charter’s operating profits in 2007 were negligible. 
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is
unlikely to have a material effect on Charter’s financial position. In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate 
to make any provision for any liability in respect of such actions.

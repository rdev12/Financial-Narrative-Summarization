Chairman’s	 Statement
Customer	 focus	 is	 imperative
Sir	 John	 Collins
Chairman
Trading conditions in most countries in Europe 
became increasingly challenging through the year, 
and prospects in the short term declined.
Despite many business strengths and a good  
track record, the Group has not kept pace with the 
changing needs of its customers.  As a result, the 
shopping experience in the UK was not a match for 
the best of our competitors or the pressure from the 
internet and mass merchants on pricing.
Your Board appointed John Browett, a skilled retailer 
with a passion for the customer and enormous 
energy, to lead the Group forward and address these 
challenges.  Under his leadership we will capitalise on 
our strengths in price and range by delivering a top 
class shopping experience offering value, choice and 
service.  His experience of the internet will also be 
invaluable in guiding our e-commerce businesses of 
PIXmania.com and Dixons.co.uk to become a key 
component of the Group.
John Browett has announced a radical plan to turn 
around the financial performance of the Group.   
He will firmly establish your Group as a specialist 
electrical retailer.  A very thorough analysis of our 
customers has led to a redefinition of priorities and  
an understanding of exactly what the customer  
wants from us.  Plans are well advanced to trial new 
formats, expand the range and retrain staff to provide 
the standard of service required.  The TechGuys  
will provide advice and practical support in the  
home or in store.  The internet offers a major growth 
opportunity and PIXmania.com and Dixons.co.uk are 
positioning themselves to be leaders on internet sales 
throughout Europe.  
Simplicity and efficiency in supporting services to the 
stores are a key feature of John’s plan and investment 
is being made in providing technology support for the 
processes needed.  Through simplifying processes we 
can also refocus around £50 million of central costs into 
our stores to improve the experience of customers.
The importance in recovering earnings and the reality 
of a difficult market ahead means we will have to  
find methods to put all of our countries in a position  
to compete effectively and deliver better value  
for shareholders.
Your Board is totally committed to these changes  
and in supporting John Browett and his team.   
He has recruited a number of senior specialists  
who will strengthen management. 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 05
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
>	Simplicity 	 and	 efficiency
>	Deliver 	 better	 value
>	Trial 	 new	 formats
>	Expand 	 the	 range
In a year of transition our priority has been to support 
a thorough examination of every part of our business, 
whilst trading in increasingly testing conditions.   
The Italian businesses, UniEuro and PC City, have 
demanded considerable attention as losses and 
consequent asset write downs have been material  
to the Group.  It is a difficult market but we have not 
done justice to ourselves and some fundamental 
retailing mistakes have been made.  However, we 
have built an excellent management team who have 
developed a recovery plan approved by the Board.
Remuneration in terms of performance related pay  
is being adapted to offer appropriate rewards for 
success and the incentive to change.  However, it will 
take time to reinvigorate our business and the cultural 
change needed should not be underestimated.  
I thank everyone involved in volunteering or 
fundraising for our Switched on Communities 
partners.  The DSG international Foundation, through 
its support for Switched on Communities and 
specifically the four charities that are beneficiaries, 
has spent the money well and made a real difference 
to many people.  
It has been a demanding and difficult year for all  
of us and the decline in our share price and market 
capitalisation has placed a great responsibility on the 
Board to deliver recovery.  Our colleagues have, as 
always, shown strong commitment and recognised 
the need for radical change.  My thanks go to every 
one of my colleagues across the Group.

Chief	 Executive’s	 Statement
John Browett
Chief Executive
An	 unbeatable	 combination	 of	 value,	 choice	 and	 service
My first priority when I joined the business was to 
really understand what our customers want.  It is only 
by using the voice of the customers in everything  
we do that we will succeed.  From an outside 
perspective, we should be making good returns for 
shareholders and growing our profits, because we 
have market leading positions with great brands  
in a number of the most important markets across 
Europe.  However, this is not the case.  Despite all  
the advantages of being a market leader, only some 
of our businesses performed to a good standard  
last year.  
Elkjøp continues to lead across the Nordic  
markets.  We are building on a very strong position  
in Greece.  Our pure online businesses PIXmania  
and Dixons.co.uk in combination grew 27% year on 
year.  But in the UK, PC World’s profits were down 
significantly, and although Currys performed relatively 
well in a difficult market, we are not satisfied with the 
results.  In Italy, the tough consumer environment 
compounded our poor execution.
When we talked to customers, we found the reason 
they are not always shopping from our stores and 
websites is that we have not kept pace with their needs.  
As we listened to customers they were very clear on 
what they wanted: they want better service, improved 
choice, contemporary stores and new services.
Now, of course, we are in a tough economic 
environment.  To afford this much better customer 
offer we need to reduce costs and simplify the 
business from top to bottom.  We know we are  
not operating as efficiently as we could and should 
be.  So we are making our processes better for 
customers, easier for staff and therefore cheaper  
to operate.
On 15 May 2008, we announced details of a five  
point plan for the renewal and transformation of  
our business.
The heart of the plan is to give customers an 
unbeatable combination of value, choice and service.
These are the main points of the plan, which is 
already under way.   	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 07

Renewal	 and	 Transformation	 plan
1.		 Focus	 on	 the	 customer
Every part of the plan hinges on knowing and acting 
on what customers want.  
Historically, the Group’s focus was on product and 
price, but this isn’t the full story.  Now we must move 
to providing value, choice and service.
This means our stores and sites should be easier  
and more exciting places to shop, better able to  
give customers what they want, when they want it.  
Customers want us to offer them the know-how to 
choose and use technology with confidence; to make 
things work and keep them working.
To make sure we’re helping customers choose a 
complete solution, with the right product or service 
and everything else they need, we’re improving 
training and incentives for all store colleagues.  We 
expect that 24,000 store colleagues in the UK will  
be trained in time for Christmas 2008.  We’re also 
improving our after sales services through delivery, 
installation, help and support.
2.		 Focus	 the	 portfolio	 on	 winning	 positions
Our immediate focus is on the potential of our strong 
market leading retail operations in the UK & Ireland, 
the Nordics, Greece and over the internet.
Our businesses in the Nordics and Greece 
successfully serve customers and here we will be 
consolidating our market position and further 
improving the customer offer.  In the UK, Currys, 
Currys.digital and PC World are being reinvigorated 
as we make a fundamental shift in the way these 
businesses are run.  
Operations in Italy require a significant turnaround 
and the new management team there have made 
good progress in identifying the issues and actions 
that need to be addressed.
In Spain and Central Europe we are not yet in a strong 
enough position to serve our customers well over  
the long term.  We are reviewing the businesses to 
strengthen their competitiveness.

3.		 Transform	 the	 business
Our initial focus for Renewal and Transformation will 
be in the UK and Italy where there is the greatest 
potential to serve customers better and improve value 
for shareholders.  The ranges in each category are 
being improved to deliver greater and clearer choices 
of good, better and best products at great prices.  
Store formats are being improved to provide easier 
navigation, improved display and greater interactivity 
with products for customers.  Trials will be in place  
for Christmas 2008, with intended roll out across  
the UK businesses thereafter.  These formats include 
reallocation of space to provide the right mix of 
products that customers want from the stores as  
well as increasing overall densities.  
PC World is being reinvigorated as the destination for 
computing and new technology digital products and 
services.  A new store format has been developed 
and is currently being trialled with plans to refit at 
least 10% of the stores in the portfolio in time for 
Christmas 2008.  In the new format, aisles have  
been straightened to ease navigation, and products 
are displayed to make it easier for customers to 
experience their features and benefits.  
Currys is reinvigorating its position as the destination 
for electrical products for everyone by offering an 
unbeatable range of products and services at great 
prices.  A new store format has been developed with 
several stores to be trialled through Christmas 2008.
Currys.digital is focusing on becoming the High 
Street destination for the latest portable technology.  
White goods, small kitchen appliances and personal 
care products are being replaced by a greater range 
of laptops, televisions and other digital products and 
a much greater depth of accessories.  While the 
majority of the 177 Currys.digital stores make a 
positive contribution to the Group there are up to 100 
stores in attractive catchments that will most likely be 
the focus for future trading.  The remaining stores will 
be closed as their leases expire.  The average high 
street lease has 4–5 years to run to expiry.
Stores are being improved to provide greater interactivity with products 
for customers.
We will offer clear choices of good, better and best products. 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 09
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
In Italy, the new management team have identified the 
key issues and started work on a detailed turnaround 
plan.  We have already announced a rationalisation  
of the portfolio with the planned closure of up to 43 
stores that were uneconomic or poorly located.   
They are also improving marketing effectiveness  
and improving in-store product availability.
PC City in Italy and Sweden will be integrated into the 
operations of UniEuro and Elkjøp respectively.  In 
Italy, stand alone PC City stores will be closed as part 
of the store rationalisation plan.  A trial of a PC City 
store within a large UniEuro store has been opened 
and initial results are encouraging.  Further trials will 
be undertaken during the year.
4.		 Win	 on	 the	 internet
We are already the leading electrical retailer on  
the internet in Europe with over £1 billion of sales 
achieved in the year.  The internet market is likely to 
grow to around 30% of the electricals market over the 
next few years, through a combination of pure-play 
and multi-channel.  PIXmania’s market leading 
operating platform will be implemented in all our 
internet sites.  In addition PIXmania will be integrated 
into the logistics infrastructure of the Group.
Customers continue to favour trusted brands and the 
convenience of the store proposition combined with 
the immediacy of collecting products ordered over 
the internet in store.  We expect that multi-channel 
will continue to comprise at least a half of our total 
internet sales going forward.  A large proportion of 
this is likely to be reserved online for collection at 
store.  We will be making further enhancements to 
our reserve&collect facilities in the UK, Nordics and 
Greece over the new financial year.
5.		 Reduce	 costs
We are working to make our business processes 
better for customers, easier for staff and therefore 
cheaper to operate.  Our existing One Group 
programme is establishing a common operating 
model for the Group and will consequently reduce 
costs significantly.  The programme is designed to 
simplify business processes, improve systems and 
decision making.  One set of business processes  
will make it easier to improve operations more quickly 
across the Group.
In addition, a Step Change programme is expected to 
remove £50 million of costs in the new financial year.  
Initial focus will be on removing duplication and 
creating efficient structures in our head office, supply 
chain and in stock management.  Savings will largely 
be reinvested back into the stores to enable us to 
deliver a better service to our customers.
Although the economic backdrop continues to be 
difficult, and we remain cautious about consumer 
confidence in many of our markets, we can 
significantly improve performance for customers, 
staff and shareholders by implementing our plans 
quickly and effectively.  There’s a lot we can achieve.  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 
employees for their commitment and enthusiasm, 
and our shareholders for their ongoing support.

NOTES
 1 Sales in 2007/08 were based on a 53 week year, compared to 52 weeks in 2006/07.  On a consistent basis, Group sales were up 7%.
 2  Like for like sales are calculated based on stores that have been open for a full financial year both at the commencement and end of the financial 
period.  Customer support agreement sales are excluded from all UK like for like calculations to remove the distorting effect of the introduction  
of pay-as-you-go customer support agreements.  Operations that are subject to closure have sales excluded as of the announcement date.
 3  Throughout this statement, references are made to “underlying” performance measures.  Underlying results are defined as being before 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, net restructuring and business impairment charges, other one-off items, profit on sale of investments, net 
fair value remeasurements of financial instruments and, where applicable, discontinued operations.  The financial effect of these items is shown 
in the analyses on the face of the income statement and in note 4 to the financial statements.
 4 Retail profit is underlying profit before: tax, net finance income and property (losses) / profits.
 5  Free Cash Flow relates to continuing operations and comprises net cash flow from operating activities before special pension contributions,  
plus net finance income, less income tax paid and net capital expenditure.
 6 Total sales percentage change is reported in local currency for regional sales and in pounds sterling for divisional and Group totals.
 7 UK Computing comprises PC World, DSGi Business and The TechGuys.
 8  International Computing comprises the PC City operations in Spain, Sweden and Italy.  The prior year includes PC City France.  The number of 
International Computing stores trading are insufficient for a meaningful like for like comparison to be made.
 9  A small business services part of the Group is now reported within UK & Ireland Electricals instead of UK Computing to better reflect 
management responsibility.  2006/07 sales of £4.5 million and underlying profit of £0.2 million have also been reclassified to reflect this change.
 10 Nordic comprises the Elkjøp Group, which operates in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
 11 Southern Europe comprises operations in Italy, Greece and Turkey.  
 12  Central Europe comprises Electro World operations in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland.  The number of Central Europe stores trading 
are insufficient for a meaningful like for like comparison to be made.
 13 e-commerce division comprises Dixons.co.uk and PIXmania.
Unless otherwise noted, throughout this statement figures relate to continuing operations.  Total revenue including discontinued operations was 
£8,556.8 million (2006/07 £8,104.5 million).

Total sales in the UK & Ireland operations were up 4% 
at £2,927.0 million (2006/07 £2,813.4 million) with like 
for like sales up 3%.  Underlying operating profit was 
£93.5 million (2006/07 £103.3 million).
Currys, including Currys.digital, experienced a strong 
start to the year, with market share gains in key 
categories.  The second half was more challenging as 
the consumer environment worsened and increased 
promotional activity impacted margins.
Currys’ internet sales continued to grow strongly, 
supported by the reserve&collect facility which is an 
increasingly popular route to purchase for customers.
Currys added mezzanines to 12 stores during the 
year.  The addition of the extra space enables 
extended ranges of products, particularly for flat 
panel televisions, as well as improved display of 
essentials and accessories.  Early indications for this 
trial have been very encouraging and a further five 
stores have been identified for mezzanine installation 
in time for Christmas 2008, with further conversions 
planned before the 2008/09 year end.
Ireland grew total sales by 5% across the year, driven 
by the opening of new stores underpinning the 
Group’s leading position in that market.  With a sharp 
slowdown in the consumer environment, particularly 
in the second half, like for like sales were impacted.
Dixons Tax Free opened four new stores in Terminal 5 
at Heathrow.  These include two updated formats of 
the Dixons Tax Free stores, a new accessories store 
and the first PC World store in a UK airport.  The 
Terminal 5 stores are trading well.  Dixons Tax Free 
now operates a total of 29 stores in 12 airports.

Nordic
In the Nordic region, Elkjøp grew total sales by 5% at 
constant exchange rates to £1,564.2 million (2006/07 
£1,394.3 million) with like for like sales up 2%.  Underlying 
operating profits declined by 3% (by 9% at constant 
exchange rates) to £88.7 million (2006/07 £91.0 million).  
Profit was held back primarily by a poor performance  
in Markantalo and to some extent by a weakening 
consumer environment across the Nordic market.  Elkjøp 
has now accelerated the integration of Markantalo more 
fully into the Group, involving refits to stores to improve 
ranges of key products, improvements in the availability 
of accessories and essentials, reducing older ranges and 
closing smaller stores.  
Elkjøp’s multi-channel offering continued to grow in  
all markets with a 34% increase in online sales.  It 
introduced a reserve and collect service in time for 
Christmas 2007 in most of its operations which has 
been well received by customers.
In early May 2008, Elkjøp opened a new large store 
format in Lørenskog (near Oslo) in Norway.  This is a 
50,000 sq ft store on two levels set out to the Group’s 
new format with increased ranges, particularly of 
accessories and essentials.  Initial customer feedback  
is positive and this format provides the basis of further 
large stores across the Nordic region and other markets.
As part of the Renewal and Transformation plan, 
PC City Sweden will be integrated into the operations 
of Elkjøp in that market.  Management plans to trial a 
PC City proposition within a large El Giganten store 
during the forthcoming year.
With the addition of 21 new stores in the year, of which 
16 are franchise stores, Elkjøp now operates a total of 
274 stores across the region of which 176 are owned.
Southern	 Europe
Sales in the Group’s Southern European operations 
grew in total by 5% at constant exchange rates to 
£1,037.0 million (2006/07 £917.0 million), with like for 
like sales down 6%.  Another strong performance  
in Greece has been more than offset by the weak 
performance in Italy and the planned investment in 
new stores in Turkey.  The underlying operating loss 
was £(8.1) million (2006/07 profit of £8.0 million).
Italy
Total sales for UniEuro in Italy were up 1% at constant 
exchange rates to £663.0 million (2006/07 £621.4 million).  
Like for like sales were down 11%, affected by the 
weakening consumer environment, combined with poor 
execution in a very competitive electrical retailing market.
During the year UniEuro appointed a new managing 
director, together with other senior appointments.   
The new management team have quickly identified the 
issues facing UniEuro and actions are being taken.  They 
have completed the review of the property portfolio, 
announcing the closure of 43 stores that UniEuro will exit 
over the next two years.  UniEuro will continue to look for 
new store locations that complement Italian shopping 
trends and UniEuro’s specialist electrical proposition.  
Progress is also being made to refocus UniEuro’s 
marketing efforts as well as improving ranges, in-store 
availability and stock turn.
PC City in Italy has been integrated into the existing 
UniEuro operations.  The PC City stores will either be 
closed as a part of the existing store closure programme 
or rebranded under the UniEuro brand.  The Group is 
trialling a PC City shop within UniEuro stores.
As a result of the actions the new management team are 
taking, the Group is confident in the long term prospects 
for UniEuro, however the weak consumer environment 
will impact overall performance in the short term.

Greece
Kotsovolos total sales were up 13% at constant 
exchange rates at £354.1 million (2006/07 £295.6 
million) with like for like sales up 4%.
Kotsovolos continued to consolidate its position  
as Greece’s leading specialist electrical retailer 
delivering market leading prices, services and  
ranges to its customers.
Four new large space out of town stores were  
opened during the year.  Three of these were under 
the Electro World brand.  These stores are based  
on a new large space proposition of 30-40,000 sq ft.  
These formats provide an exciting retail environment 
for customers, delivering greater depth of ranges  
in all product areas, especially for accessories  
and essentials.
On 24 May 2007, the Group announced that following 
the exercise of a put option by Fourlis Holding SA 
(“Fourlis”), it had acquired a further 10% interest in 
Kotsovolos for a cash consideration of €22.9 million 
(£15.6 million).  The consideration was calculated in 
accordance with the pricing formula agreed at the 
time the Group acquired a controlling interest in 
Kotsovolos in September 2004.  This acquisition 
takes the Group’s total interest in Kotsovolos to 89% 
of the issued share capital.  Under the terms of the 
original acquisition agreement, Fourlis retained a 20% 
interest in Kotsovolos, which has now reduced to 
10% as a consequence of this transaction.  Fourlis 
has the right to sell its remaining interest to the Group 
from September 2008 and the Group has the right to 
acquire any outstanding interest held by Fourlis from 
September 2009.
Turkey
During the year the Group commenced operations in 
Turkey with its local joint venture partner and has now 
opened a total of five stores under the Electro World 
brand.  These new stores are based on the Group’s

In Central Europe, Electro World grew total sales by

Operations in the Czech Republic continue to 
perform well, delivering a second year of profits

programme being implemented by the Government, 
operations in Hungary delivered a more encouraging

competitive market, and operations performed in  
line with expectations.  A total of eight stores were 
opened across all three markets in the year.  
Electro World has an established central logistics 
infrastructure and regional management team across 
its markets and is building strong market positions in

UK Computing comprises PC World, DSGi Business 
and The TechGuys.  PC World is the leader in its 
market and is having to adapt to a changing, and 
increasingly competitive, computing retail market.  
Technology change, digital products, convergence 
and connectivity in the home as well as customers’ 
increasing need for service and support are driving 
PC World’s move from selling computers to 
computing.  The Renewal and Transformation plan 
outlined on 15 May 2008 will ensure PC World is well 
positioned to capitalise on, and benefit from, these 
changing dynamics.
Total sales were down 1% at £1,818.7 million  
(2006/07 £1,846.3 million) with like for like sales down 
5%.  Underlying operating profit was £63.2 million 
(2006/07 £124.6 million).
PC World’s profitability was materially impacted 
during the year by:
increased promotional activity as a result of the 
need to reduce laptop stocks in the first half;
a higher mix of lower margin sales of hardware  
due to the strong demand for laptops;
a reduction of higher margin non-hardware 
products in the sales mix as these products 
became more widely available; and
the weaker consumer environment, particularly  
in the second half.
The Renewal and Transformation plan is designed  
to improve PC World’s hardware and non-hardware 
performance by focusing on giving customers a 
unique offer of value, choice and service for computing 
related products.  This includes helping customers 
with the complete solution for the technology they use 
and providing after-sales services to ensure they get 
the most out of their technology.
Collect@store continues to engage customers and is 
proving to be a popular route to purchase.  PC World 
continues to develop this proposition both online and 
in-store to increase attachment levels.

The TechGuys performed well in its first full year, more 
than doubling sales.  It is the UK’s only truly national 
digital support service for UK homes.  It employs 500 
engineers, 1,500 call centre technicians, 40 product 
evaluation specialists and 450 in-store experts.  The 
TechGuys service is a key part of the Group’s offering 
to customers, with The TechGuys service desks now 
operational in all PC World stores.  PC World is well 
placed to leverage the benefit of product and services 
being available together for customers in store.  The 
Group remains excited about the prospects for The 
TechGuys, particularly as a significant differentiator  
for the specialist in the computing market.
DSGi Business sales were £397.0 million (2006/07 
£407.3 million).  It continued to perform in line  
with profit expectations with strong sales of 
desktops, laptops and software.  New initiatives  
in customer service, training and development  
have started to deliver benefits to customers with,  
for example, a significant improvement in next  
day customer fulfilment.
International	 Computing
PC City total sales were down 8% at constant 
exchange rates to £343.2 million (2006/07 £347.0 
million).  Excluding the PC City France operations, 
which closed during 2007, total sales were up  
8%.  The product trends across mainland Europe 
were similar to those in the UK, with laptops and  
flat panel televisions selling well.  Underlying 
investment operating losses were £(12.0) million 
(2006/07 £(28.2) million).  
PC City in Spain was profitable in the year but has 
been impacted, particularly in the second half, by  
a significant slowdown in the economy.  
As part of the Group’s Renewal and Transformation 
plan it has been decided that the best way to deliver 
value to shareholders is to integrate the operations  
of PC City in Italy and Sweden into the existing 
specialist electrical operations of UniEuro and Elkjøp 
respectively.  It is expected that this will be completed 
during the first half of the new financial year.
PC World is well placed to leverage the benefit of product and services 
available together.
The TechGuys service is a key part of the Group’s offering to 
customers.

Operations
The e-commerce division comprises Dixons.co.uk 
and PIXmania.com (this excludes internet sales 
through the retail brands).  
Dixons.co.uk experienced strong sales growth of 
65% in its second full year as a pure-play e-tailer.   
It has gone from strength to strength as it continues 
to widen its appeal and customer base through the 
addition of more categories to the core proposition  
of electricals, such as White Goods, as well as 
growing ranges of non-electrical products.
PIXmania continues to grow strongly, consolidating 
its leading position as Europe’s largest online 
specialist electrical retailer.  Key growth has come 
from products introduced since becoming part of the 
Group, particularly flat panel televisions and 
computing.  Sales of its traditional product set, such 
as digital imaging, have performed less well in line 
with these markets.  Integrating PIXmania’s systems 
more fully into the Group will enable it to exploit the 
Group’s logistics infrastructure improving the range of 
products available to customers in local markets.
In addition the Group will transfer existing internet 
operations of Dixons.co.uk and the multi-channel 
brands on to PIXmania’s platforms.  These systems 
provide an enriched customer experience as well as 
more powerful tools to improve accessibility, brand 
awareness and cash margins.

Underlying profit before tax is reported before one-off net operating costs of £393.6 million and  
non-underlying financing charges of £4.5 million.  A further explanation of these charges is explained below:
£341.3 million relating to the impairment of the Italian operations.  The main constituent of the charge is  
the impairment of goodwill of £246.2 million which leaves £129.0 million remaining on the balance sheet.  
Other charges comprise the impairment of fixed assets and inventory of £20.1 million and £10.1 million, 
respectively, together with provisions for onerous lease commitments of £51.9 million and other charges  
of £13.0 million;
strategic reorganisation costs of £29.5 million relate to the UK business transformation and mainly 
comprises asset impairments associated with the reformat of the UK store portfolio;
£27.2 million of other business impairment charges which relate to impairments of businesses and  
assets outside the UK and Italy;
distribution network income of £6.7 million relates to the final part of the reorganisation of the UK 
distribution model.  The income comprises a profit of £12.3 million generated on the sale of the Group’s 
former main UK warehouse site in Stevenage offset by further onerous lease charges on vacant 
distribution centre properties reflecting the difficult property market;
PC City France non-underlying income of £2.1 million, reflecting a positive variance against the expected 
costs of closure provided for in 2006/07;
£4.4 million amortisation of acquired intangibles which predominantly comprise brand names; and
the financing charge of £4.5 million comprises a gain of £1.7 million on the sale of a small minority 
investment offset by £6.2 million relating to net fair value remeasurement losses on revaluation of financial 
instruments as required by IAS 32 and IAS 39.  The net charge is caused mainly by a £7.8 million 
revaluation of a put option held by the minority shareholder of Kotsovolos, Fourlis, who held 10% of the 
share capital at 3 May 2008.  This revaluation represents an increase in the expected purchase price of 
this stake and is driven by a strong performance by Kotsovolos.  As described above, on 24 May 2007, 
Fourlis exercised an option to sell 10% of Kotsovolos such that the Group now owns 89% of this business.

Underlying working capital improvements in the period were £46.6 million (2006/07 £57.1 million), with the 
Group again achieving its target of zero average paid days stock across the year.  The growth of the monthly

(2006/07 £67.3 million).
Capital expenditure was £167.7 million (2006/07 £135.9 million), up £31.8 million driven by investment in store

Funding
Net	 funds
At 3 May 2008 the Group had net funds of £50.1 million, compared with net funds of £224.9 million in the previous

The Board believes that the Group has sufficient funds available to deliver the Renewal and Transformation plan.
Dividends
The Board has reviewed the level of dividend in light of the Group’s current performance, the Renewal and 
Transformation plan and the outlook for the consumer environment.  As a result the directors propose to pay 
a final dividend of 3.43p (2006/07 6.85p) making a total for the year of 5.45p (8.87p relating to the 52 weeks 
ended 28 April 2007).  The Board believes that the Group should have an objective of rebuilding dividend 
cover to 2.0 times underlying earnings.  Once this objective has been achieved the Board considers that the 
Group should grow dividends in line with earnings.
Consolidated	 Balance	 Sheet
Consolidated net assets decreased to £853.5 million from £1,304.3 million at 28 April 2007.  The main 
movements comprised an increase of £142.3 million generated from underlying post tax profits which was 
more than offset by non-underlying post tax charges of £402.0 million as set out in the income statement on 
page 68.  Net assets were further decreased by actuarial losses of £24.7 million on the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme but increased due to movements in derivative contracts, foreign exchange movements and 
related tax effects of £83.6 million, all of which affected reserves directly.  The increased stake in Kotsovolos, 
following the exercise of a put option, further increased net assets by £15.6 million.  These movements were 
offset by dividend payments of £160.3 million and £100.0 million relating to the share buy-back programme.  
Tax
The Group’s tax rate on underlying profit was 30.7% (2006/07 30.0%).  The increase in the tax rate reflects 
non-recognition of tax benefits arising from loss making businesses.
Cost	 savings
In the period, the Group delivered £30 million of cost savings from a number of areas across the business 
including outsourcing of IS services and reorganisation of the Group’s logistics infrastructure.  The 
introduction of a Step Change programme presented on 15 May 2008 will remove £50 million of costs per 
annum commencing in 2008/09.  Initial focus will be on removing duplication and creating efficient structures 
in the head office, the supply chain and in stock management.  Savings from this programme will largely be 
reinvested back into the stores to enable the Group to deliver better on the needs of its customers. 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 21
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
Pensions
At 3 May 2008, excluding deferred tax benefits, the IAS 19 accounting deficit of the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme amounted to £51.0 million (28 April 2007 £38.4 million).  Including deferred tax benefits  
the deficit amounted to £29.9 million (28 April 2007 £17.0 million).  During the period, the triennial actuarial 
valuation of the Group’s pension scheme was completed and showed the deficit as at 5 April 2007 to be 
£61.0 million.  Over the last three years, the Group has been implementing a programme of changes to 
pension arrangements in order to address the deficit over the longer term which have included the gradual 
increase in the Group contribution rate and the change of benefits to operate on a career average earnings 
basis rather than “final salary” for future service.  The remedy agreed by the Group to address this deficit is 
for the Group to make annual cash contributions to the scheme of £12 million for the next five years.  This will 
be paid in two equal tranches of £6 million in June and December each year.
The charge to operating profit for the scheme was £9.3 million (2006/07 £11.8 million, including the one-off 
benefit of £4.7 million relating to the change in legislation concerning lump sum payments allowed on retirement).  
Also included in the income statement is a net financing income of £8.1 million (2006/07 £4.5 million) which 
represents the expected return on assets of the scheme, based on market conditions prevailing at the start of  
the financial period, offset by the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities of the scheme.  The defined 
benefit section of the UK pension scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 September 2002.
Going	 concern
After making due enquiry, on the basis of current financial projections and borrowing facilities available,  
the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future.  Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in  
preparing the financial statements.

Corporate	 Responsibility	 Review
We continue to integrate social, environmental and 
ethical initiatives into our business operations from 
design to disposal. We understand the need to make 
ethical practices sustainable and measurable in order 
for them to be widely and successfully adopted.
As a multi-channel electrical retailer our key 
accountabilities are in how we source, deliver and 
encourage responsible disposal of the goods we  
sell, how we empower our employees to deliver  
good service, and in how we help disadvantaged 
individuals and communities get the most  
from technology.
We remain a constituent member of the Dow Jones 
Sustainability and FTSE4GOOD Indices, and one of 
the Business in the Community Top 100 “Companies 
That Count”.  During the year we were shortlisted for 
several awards for environmental sustainability 
including the National Energy Efficiency Awards and 
the Chartered Institute of Waste Management Awards.
During the year we reviewed our CR activities, in 
order to establish a detailed framework for our 
ongoing work.  This review was supervised by our 
Group CR Committee, a team of executives from all 
key operational areas of our business who meet 
quarterly and who advise the Board on non-financial 
risks and progress.  Kevin O’Byrne is the executive 
director with responsibility for CR matters.  Visit  
www.dsgiplc.com/crgovernance to see the 
Committee’s Terms of Reference.  
We review and update our employee policies  
to comply with current regulations.  Our overall  
principle is that no employees or stakeholders are 
discriminated against on the basis of age, gender, 
sexual orientation, nationality, ethnic origin, religious 
beliefs, disability, or for any other reason.  This 
applies to the recruitment, training and career 
development of individuals.  We are a member of the 
Employers’ Forum on Disability and have been 
awarded the “Two Ticks” Positive about Disabled 
People accreditation from Jobcentre Plus.
To aid us in improving the environmental 
effectiveness of our UK operations, and our  
supply chain in particular, an Energy Management 
Committee has recently been established.  
We empower our employees to deliver good service.

participate in our various share-based incentive 
schemes, including Sharesave.
Marketplace
Customer satisfaction is one of our principal 
concerns and in March 2008 we were delighted to 
win a Retail Week Award for Customer Service for 
Currys’ free in-store and home collection recycling 
service.  This is detailed further below.  We were also 
a finalist for PC World’s TechStick – a device invented 
by a PC World employee that helps our customers 
“test drive” a PC or laptop before purchase.
Following our participation in the digital switchover 
trial in Whitehaven, Cumbria in which we supplied 
equipment to 450 homes switching over to digital 
television in advance of the UK programme, we have 
remained heavily involved in work to support the 
switchover.  We are represented on the Spectrum 
Planning Group and the Digital Stakeholder  
Group.  A summary of our activity can be found  
at www.dsgiplc.com/digitalswitchover.
We have joined the Electronic Industry Code of

In December 2007 we welcomed our new Chief 
Executive John Browett, who was introduced to 
employees through face to face briefings, and DVD 
and podcast interviews.  Regular Q&A sessions,  
a weekly employee blog and a well-publicised 
feedback email address, answered by John Browett 
personally, create a dialogue with colleagues and 
help to bring corporate vision and values to life.  
We operate a balanced scorecard approach to drive 
employee performance and enhance customers’ 
experience.  This follows on from our previously 
reported “hothousing” initiatives that empower  
store teams to grow their own business and solve 
problems locally.  
We are in the process of introducing a new selling 
model to store teams in the UK.  The model is based 
on the structured sales process already used in our 
Nordic operations, and is designed to better establish 
customers’ needs and help them make a more 
informed and complete choice.
In May 2008 we supported National Learning at  
Work Day, part of Adult Learners’ Week, with a series 
of training events at our UK Retail Support Centre 
themed around personal development in and out  
of the workplace.  Around 250 people took part.
We implemented a single Group-wide employee 
engagement survey for the first time during the 
period, replacing divisional surveys.  This helps us 
compare results more effectively.  More than 27,000 
employees participated in the survey and managers 
were trained on how to share results with their teams 
and create action plans to tackle areas in which we 
could do better.
A record 50% rise in applications were received  
from UK and Ireland employees for our Sharesave 
scheme, under which employees save a set amount 
from their salary over three or five years and can opt

retailers collaborate to ensure safe conditions, worker

last year’s update of our Ethical Purchasing Policy, 
our buying teams have received refreshed ethical 
sourcing training on supply chain best practice.  We 
carry out audits of our suppliers’ factories to certify 
they are meeting our ethical sourcing standards and, 
during the year, we delisted eight suppliers as they 
were unable to meet these standards.
Community
In July 2006 we launched Switched on Communities 
– a three year community involvement programme 
funded by our registered charity, The DSG international 
Foundation.  Through Switched on Communities we 
provide technology and training to disadvantaged 
communities, working with four main UK charitable 
partners.  We also support smaller charities and 
encourage our employees throughout Europe in their 
volunteering and fundraising work.
Last year we funded 300 smaller charities and gave 
out 200 employee grants.  We also offer employees 
volunteering options with our main charity partners, for 
instance 18 volunteers have trained as Eco-Assessors 
and visit Eco-Schools to help them with projects and 
assess who deserves green flag status.
Update:	 charitable	 partners
 
The Foyer Federation has a network of 130 centres, 
giving homeless young people safe accommodation, 
guidance and access to learning and work.  So far  
we have worked with 51 Foyers, improving the lives  
of more than 2,100 young people.  Projects have 
included providing kitchen equipment and IT suites, 
and teaching life skills by methods including in-store 
work experience.
This worldwide environmental award programme for 
schools encourages children to take responsibility for 
the environment.  We have worked with 53 schools 
and reached more than 18,500 children.  As a result, 
schools have developed gardening clubs, and fitted 
solar panels and wind turbines.   
 
 
Using IT in home study can make a significant impact 
on the educational attainment of a child, but 1.4 
million children in the UK do not have the use of a 
computer for their studies at home.  Through the  
e-Learning Foundation we have funded 22 schools 
and 1,200 pupils.  One school reported that 69% of 
pupils using laptops jumped three Information and 
Communication Technology sub levels in half a term, 
compared with the norm of two sub levels per year.
AbilityNet works to provide expert advice and IT 
equipment so that people with disabilities can 
perform everyday tasks such as communicating, 
working, banking and shopping.  Using our funding, 
AbilityNet developed a network of charitable partners 
who have become “mini AbilityNets” across the UK.  
So far 56 organisations are linked to the project, 
working with 4,000 disabled people each year.   
PC World seconded a manager to AbilityNet to help 
with fundraising, and our funding and support 
enabled AbilityNet to secure a £750,000 lottery grant.
We work to support smaller organisations throughout 
Europe.  In Greece, Kotsovolos is working with 
several charities, provides PCs for local schools and 
electrical equipment for a homeless hostel.  In Ireland 
we are working with FIT (Fast-track into Technology).  
We also support a children’s hospital in Dublin. 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 25

service if / when a product is delivered.  Goods are 
collected in delivery lorries that would otherwise 
return to our national delivery centre empty, so the 
scheme is run within our existing carbon footprint.
Since the UK scheme was launched, 32,000 tonnes 
of electrical products have been recycled – equating 
to 78 jumbo jets taken out of landfill sites.  Most 
goods will be back in use as a new item within two 
months, and 85% of goods received can be recycled.  
We were delighted when the service won the Retail 
Week Customer Service Initiative of 2008 Award.
Our Nordic operations run a similar scheme, where 
end of life goods can be dropped off at stores 24 
hours a day in special containers.  As a Group, we 
have recycled more than 50,000 tonnes of end of  
life electrical products to date as part of our WEEE 
obligations across Europe.  We also work with the 
Furniture Retail Network charity, through which more 
than 25,000 older electrical items have been given a 
second life.
Conclusion
We have made encouraging progress on the issues 
we have identified as priorities for our business, and 
will continue to monitor our performance within the 
five KPIs outlined here.  We would like to thank all  
our people for their contribution, operationally and 
through volunteering and fundraising, in making 
DSG international a good corporate citizen.

We launched the UK’s first in-store and free home collection  
recycling service.
Environment
We have been working on initiatives to improve  
the environmental effectiveness of our operations.  
Following on from the introduction of double-decker 
trailers in our home delivery network, reducing CO
2
 
emissions by almost 600 tonnes per year, we have 
implemented aerodynamically shaped biodiesel 
lorries to deliver stock to UK stores.  The lorry, which 
we call the RoadMouse due to its shape, has a 
greater storage capacity and is 20% more CO
2
 
efficient.  We are trialling reusable packaging for large 
appliances and working with suppliers to reduce 
packaging for White Goods.  We are also working 
with the manufacturers of our own brand products  
to record energy consumption data in order to make 
more informed decisions on the products we stock.
We supported the Energy Savings Trust’s Energy 
Saving Week in October by offering our customers 
free delivery on a wide selection of energy saving 
goods.  “Energy Doctors” gave advice to customers 
in our flagship stores.  Top tips are also offered  
at Dixons.co.uk’s Greenshop, which is a section  
of the website highlighting good value energy  
saving products.
In July 2007 when the UK Government introduced the 
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 
(WEEE), which makes retailers responsible for 
financing the collection and recycling of end of life 
electrical products, we launched the UK’s first and 
only in-store and free home collection recycling

Products	 and	 services
The principal products sold by the Group are categorised as Brown Goods, White Goods, Personal 
Computing, Mobile Phones and related products.  
Brown Goods includes televisions, DVD players, audio products, iPods and MP3 players, cameras  
and camcorders.  These products are characterised by rapid technological advances offering major 
improvements in quality, functionality, interactivity and design.
White Goods includes washing machines and dryers, fridges and freezers, gas and electric cookers, 
microwaves, vacuum cleaners and small domestic products such as kettles, toasters, irons and 
breadmakers.  While these products benefit from innovation, fashion and improved design, they are  
heavily dependent on the replacement cycle in most markets.
Personal Computing includes desktops, laptops, printers and a wide range of related products.  Computer 
technology is benefiting from increasing processing power, lower costs and rapidly increasing interaction 
with digital products.  Increasing use of PCs in the home and in business is a major area of market 
development for the Group.  In response to this growing demand the Group launched a customer support 
service, The TechGuys, designed to provide expert, fast-track support for increasingly technology-
dependent homes.  The success of this service has led to the provision of services in areas outside 
computing and encompasses the interaction between the various technologies available in the home, 
educating both young and old on the benefits available.  The service is a response to the growing reliance  
on life-enhancing technologies in the home and offers a beginning to end solution with credit facilities to 
purchase products, support and advice on installation and after-sales support agreements.  These provide 
customers with comprehensive advice, access to help lines, and prompt repair services or replacement 
following purchase.
The Group also offers its customers financial services such as credit facilities and after-sales support 
agreements.  Customer support agreements provide customers with comprehensive advice, access  
to help lines, prompt repair services or replacement following purchase.
Mobile phones are now a common purchase for most European consumers.  The introduction of new 
technologies offers significant opportunities for increased functionality and add-on services, including 
broadband, portable audio, photography and e-mail.
Objective	 and	 strategy	 The long term objective of the Group is to offer the best value, choice and service to customers in order  
to create value for shareholders. The Board’s strategy to achieve this goal is described in the Renewal  
and Transformation plan in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 6 to 9 and encompasses the  
following key principles:
retailing operations shall only be conducted in markets where the Group is, or can become, the number 
one or number two specialist electrical retailer;
the Group shall offer customers the opportunity to purchase products and services from a number of 
channels, principally large efficient space and the internet, via online transactions and reserve online  
with collect at store facilities;
to attract a strong customer base, stores shall compete on value and offer an extensive choice  
of products, excellent customer service and outstanding after-sales support;
stores shall employ and develop highly motivated sales staff, knowledgeable about the products and 
services they sell and trained in selling skills and customer service;
the Group shall utilise its scale to buy goods at the lowest cost to enhance margins and provide value  
to customers; and 
operations in all countries shall share experience, knowledge and best practice to improve efficiency  
and to reduce operating costs.

Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
European	 electrical	 retail	 markets
The European market for electrical goods and related services sold by the Group is estimated to be in  
excess of £130 billion per annum.  It is highly competitive, characterised by a relatively small number of  
global manufacturers supplying goods to local, regional and national electrical retailers.  
Specialist electrical retailers are the predominant destination for customers.  Buying groups, general 
merchants and independents also have a retail presence in most European markets.
The internet delivers enhanced product information and facilitates price comparability for consumers.   
Whilst this creates new challenges in terms of margin maintenance, it also provides a significant opportunity.  
The Group believes that over time internet demand will polarise towards the larger retailers with scaleable 
distribution and systems, together with proven after-sales service and support.  
Risks	 to	 achieving	 the	 Group’s	 objective
The Corporate Governance Report on pages 41 to 46 describes the processes through which the directors 
assess, manage and mitigate risk.  The Board regularly reviews the risks faced by the Group.  The directors 
consider that the major risks to achieving the Group’s objective are those set out below.  The Board 
recognises that the profile of risks changes constantly and additional risks not presently known, or that  
are currently deemed immaterial, may also impact on attainment of the Group’s business objective.  
(i)	 Economic	 environment
The economic environment impacts on spending on electrical goods in many ways.  House moves and home 
improvements impact on spending on domestic appliances.  The “feel good” factor is an important influence 
on discretionary spending on electrical goods.  Unemployment levels, interest rates, consumer debt levels, 
availability of credit, taxation and many other factors influence customers’ spending decisions.  
The Group recognises that the current difficult economic climate may affect individual countries and regions.  
Management therefore monitors economic metrics and works closely with suppliers to adjust forecasts of 
demand.  Stock orders are realigned and, where possible, selling capacity and support services are flexed  
in response to changing expectations.  
Meeting customers’ needs 
What differentiates specialist electrical retailers is the wide range of products stocked and the provision of 
services that customers want, in a convenient location with staff that provide excellent service at competitive 
prices.  Giving outstanding service is a key ingredient of our Renewal and Transformation plan announced on 
15 May 2008.
Regular surveys of customer satisfaction are conducted across all stores.  The results are used to assess 
store performance and to drive high standards across each chain.  Customer feedback is used to shape  
our ranges and to understand where the Group can be more responsive to customers’ needs.  
Seasonality
The Group’s business is highly seasonal, with a very significant proportion of its sales and operating profit 
generated during its third quarter, which includes the Christmas and New Year season.
Directors’	 Report	 continued 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 33
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
Competition
The Group operates in a highly competitive environment.  There are few barriers to new entrants to markets 
for the sale of electrical goods.  Businesses therefore join and leave the market and / or expand or reduce 
their product ranges in response to competitive forces.  Different channels to market have different cost 
structures and different appeal to customers.
The Group continuously monitors the activities of its competitors and potential competitors in each of its 
markets and takes appropriate action in terms of, for example, its product and service offering and pricing  
to maintain and strengthen its position.  The Group actively manages its brands through advertising, 
promotions and enhancing the retail experience with the goal of ensuring the Group’s stores are seen as  
the primary destination for electrical goods.
Market margin pressure
The level of margins in electrical retailing is governed by a combination of the market and buying prices.  
Consumer demand, manufacturer supply, competition from store and internet channels, regulation and taxation 
all impact on margins.  The Group is focused on protecting margins through maximising its international buying 
scale, maintaining an efficient supply chain and placing continued emphasis on strong selling skills.  The Group 
actively manages its cost structures to mitigate the impact of product margin erosion.  
Price deflation
Electrical goods are typically subject to price deflation as the production of new products and technologies 
grows and availability increases.  This has been a common feature of the electrical goods market for some 
time and the Group works closely with its suppliers to bring products to the mass market.
 
(ii)	 Store	 portfolio
The quality and location of the Group’s store portfolio is a key contributor to the Group’s growth strategy.   
The Group principally operates from large out of town stores in convenient locations that are accessible to 
substantial numbers of customers.  The ability to secure the best sites is critical to building the retail brands.  
The Group is implementing a programme to review the store portfolio in both the UK and overseas.  The 
review has already identified stores within the Currys.digital portfolio which will be the focus for future trading.  
The Group will continue to actively manage the store portfolio to optimise the location, size and costs of each 
of its stores.  In areas where the population catchment is lower, franchising of the Group’s brands offers the 
potential for market growth.  During the period, the Group had franchised brands in Norway (Elkjøp), Italy 
(UniEuro), Sweden (El Giganten), Greece (Kotsovolos), Denmark (El Giganten), Finland (Gigantti), Iceland 
(Elko), Greenland (Pisiffik), the Faroe Islands (El Ding) and Ireland (Currys).  
(iii)	 Employees
The Group has a strong reputation for developing retail leaders and sales staff with entrepreneurial spirit.  All 
retailers face the challenge to attract, develop and retain the right calibre of staff for their business.  Through 
the Group’s retail reputation, development and incentive programmes and the career opportunities afforded 
by its size and diversity of operations, the Board believes that the Group is well placed to build on its success.   
A review of the long term incentive arrangements used to retain employees has been carried out by the 
Remuneration Committee and is discussed on pages 54 and 55.  
(iv)	 Product	 life	 cycle	 and	 supply
Some electrical products sold by the Group are subject to rapid technological change which shortens their 
life cycle.  Careful management is required to avoid loss of value and / or the risk of stock obsolescence 
when products are superseded.  The Group has extensive experience of managing electrical goods with 
short product life cycles.  It maintains aged stock records and utilises demand forecasts, price management, 
accessory offers and point of sale material to sell through the products.

(v)	 Entering	 new	 markets
Expansion through acquisition or the establishment of new businesses is subject to the availability of suitable 
opportunities.  Companies operating large out of town stores may not be available for purchase and new 
operations may not be able to find suitable sites for new stores.  Entry into new markets gives rise to risks 
related to culture, markets, legislation, regulation and access to goods and resources.  The Group will 
consider acquisitions made in stages as well as outright purchases in a single stage.
(vi)	 Treasury	 risks	 and	 policies
Treasury operations are managed centrally within policies approved by the Board and are subject to periodic 
independent internal and external reviews.  Group Treasury reports regularly to the Executive Committee and 
the Tax & Treasury Committee.  The major treasury risks to which the Group is exposed relate to market risks 
(movements in foreign exchange and interest rates), liquidity risk and credit risk.  Areas where risks are most 
likely to occur are evaluated regularly using statistical modelling techniques and regular reviews of forecast 
interest and foreign exchange rates are included in such evaluations.  The Group uses financial instruments 
and derivatives to manage these risks in accordance with defined policies.  Throughout the period under 
review, in accordance with Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or other 
instruments was permitted.
The Group’s accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 1.16 to the financial statements.  
Exchange rate risk 
The Group is exposed to exchange movements on recognised assets and liabilities, overseas earnings and 
fluctuations in translated values of foreign currency assets and liabilities.  The Group’s principal translation 
currency exposures are the euro and Norwegian kroner.  Taking into account the cost of hedging, the 
Group’s policy is to match, in whole or in part, currency earnings with related currency costs and currency 
assets with currency liabilities through the use of appropriate hedging instruments.
The Group is also exposed to certain transactional currency exposures.  Such exposures arise from 
purchases in currencies other than in the functional currency of the entity.  The Group’s principal 
transactional currency exposures are the US dollar and euro.  It is Group policy to minimise the currency 
exposures on such purchases through the use of appropriate hedging instruments such as forward 
exchange contracts.  Such contracts are designed to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
Interest rate risk
The principal interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect of sterling cash and investments, internally 
hedged Norwegian kroner liabilities and euro borrowings.  Potential exposure to interest rate movements  
is mitigated by the Group’s policy to match the profile of interest payments with that of its interest receipts.  
Further mitigation is achieved with interest based credit commissions received and through the use of 
interest based hedging instruments.  Such matching is evaluated regularly to ensure that risks are minimised.  
Liquidity risk
It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings, committed bank and other facilities sufficient  
to meet anticipated short term and long term financial requirements.  In applying this policy the Group 
continuously monitors forecast and actual cash flows against the maturity profiles of financial assets and 
liabilities.  Uncommitted facilities are also maintained and used if available on advantageous terms.  It is 
Group treasury policy to ensure that a specific level of committed facilities is always available based on 
forecast working capital requirements.  
Directors’	 Report	 continued 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 35
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.  The Group’s exposure to credit risk on liquid funds, 
investments and derivative financial instruments arises from the risk of default of counterparties, with a 
maximum exposure equal to the book value of these instruments.  This is limited as Group treasury policy on 
investment restricts counterparties to those with a minimum Moody’s long term credit rating of AA3, bank 
financial strength rating of B– and short term credit rating of P1.  In the prior period, the policy on investment 
restricted counterparties to those with a minimum Moody’s long term credit rating of A3 and short term credit 
rating of P1.  The exposure limit for each counterparty is based upon a percentage of shareholders funds.  
Investments mainly comprise bank deposits, floating rate notes and commercial paper.  The Group 
continuously reviews the credit quality of counterparties, the limits placed on individual credit exposures  
and categories of investments.  
Sales to retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major credit cards.  It is Group policy that  
all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.  New credit 
customers are assessed using an external rating report which is used to establish a credit limit.  Such limits 
are reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis, for example when a customer wishes to 
place an order in excess of their existing credit limit.  The maximum exposure is equal to the book value of 
receivables.  Receivable balances are monitored regularly with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad 
debts is not significant.  The Group’s receivable balances comprise a large number of individually small 
customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Capital risk management
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market 
confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.  The Group is subject to certain externally 
imposed capital requirements in the form of banking covenants involving borrowing ratios which it met 
throughout the period.
The Board has delegated responsibility for routine capital expenditure to a Capital Committee, which has 
approval responsibility up to an agreed limit for: Group long term and budgeted capital spend, setting capital 
assessment criteria, new store capital approval, subsidiary company funding, business acquisitions and 
disposals up to a specified limit, and contingent liabilities such as guarantees.  The Committee also approves 
routine statutory and internal delegated powers of authority in relation to capital expenditure.
The Group considers the manner in which funds are distributed to shareholders by assessing the 
performance of the business, the level of available net funds and the short to medium term strategic plans 
concerning future capital spend as well as the need to meet banking covenants and borrowing ratios.  Such 
assessment will influence the level of dividends payable as well as consideration from time to time of market 
purchases of the Group’s own shares.
The Group monitors available net funds on a regular basis and this is affected by Free Cash Flow, one of the 
Group’s key performance indicators (see page 37).
(vii)	 Pension	 risk	 and	 policies
The principal pension scheme operated by the Group is the UK defined benefit scheme.  
This scheme is subject to risks regarding the amount of the liabilities as a result of changes in life expectancy, 
inflation and future salary increases, risks regarding the value of investments and the returns derived from 
such investments.
The pension trustee, in consultation with the Company, has implemented changes to the scheme’s 
investment strategy to mitigate the volatility of liabilities and to diversify investment risk.

(viii)	 Systems	 failure	 In common with other large businesses, the Group is dependent on the suitability and reliability of its systems 
and procedures, including its information technology, warehousing and distribution systems.  The Group  
has developed emergency procedures which are regularly tested.  The Group carries out evaluation,  
planning and implementation analysis before updating or introducing new systems that have an impact  
on critical functions.
(ix)	 Outsourcing
The Group has outsourced the majority of its UK call handling, IT and HR services including payroll.  While 
these contracts produce significant cost savings, the Group recognises the increased dependency on third 
parties, in particular the relationships with its IT partner, HCL, and its payroll provider, Northgate, to deliver 
core activities and has put in place appropriate service level agreements within the contracts.  
(x)	 Damage	 to	 property	 and	 consequential	 business	 interruption	 The Group operates from a large number of sites, all of which are subject to the risks of fire, weather and 
water damage and in some cases are subject to earthquake and other specific risks.
The Group regularly reviews and assesses these risks, takes action to mitigate the likelihood and cost of 
potential incidents and has insurance in place to cover material exposures.  Business continuity plans are  
in place to respond to major disruption to the business.  
(xi)	 Legislative,	 reputational	 and	 regulatory	 risks
The Group is subject to a range of legal and regulatory requirements originating from the UK and the 
European Union, particularly in the areas of consumer protection, competition, health and safety, and the 
environment.  Changes in these laws and regulations and the policies regarding enforcement may impact on 
the Group in terms of cost, changes to business practices and restrictions on activities.  The Group engages 
with governmental bodies in the UK and Europe through trade associations such as the CBI and British Retail 
Consortium, or directly, where it considers it appropriate to do so.
Tax laws that apply to the Group’s businesses may be amended by the relevant authorities, for example as  
a result of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities.  Such potential amendments and their application  
to the Group are regularly monitored and, if relevant, appropriate actions taken to ensure ongoing efficiency.  
Social, environmental and ethical risks that might impact on the Group’s reputation are annually monitored  
by the Board.

Performance	 monitoring
The successful delivery of the Group’s strategic objective is monitored by the Board through Key 
Performance Indicators and the periodic review of Group operations.
Key	 Performance	 Indicators
Financial and operational  Definition
Total sales  Growth in total sales
Like for like sales  The ability to grow sales in stores in the Group is an important measure of  
a brand’s appeal to customers and its competitive position.  The Board 
measures like for like sales as sales in stores that have been open for a full 
financial year both at the commencement and end of the financial period.  
Customer support agreement sales are excluded from all UK like for like 
calculations to remove the distorting effect of the introduction of pay-as-you-
go agreements. 
 
Sales targets and growth are set relative to the market and expected 
economic conditions.
Market position  In line with the Group’s strategy to be the leading specialist electrical  
retailer in Europe, this is an important measure of how well customers are 
being engaged by the Group’s brands in each market.  Retailing operations 
should be, or be capable of becoming, the number one or number two 
specialist electrical retailer in that market, measured by market share.
Underlying operating profit  Continued growth of underlying operating profit enables the Group to  
invest in its future and provide a return for shareholders.  Targets are set 
relative to expected market performance.
Underlying profit before tax  Continued growth of underlying profit before tax represents a measure of 
total Group performance to external investors and shareholders.  Targets  
are set relative to expected market performance.
Free Cash Flow  The Group defines Free Cash Flow as net cash generated from operations, 
plus net finance income, less taxation and net capital expenditure and 
excluding certain discrete items such as special pension contributions.  The 
management of cash usage, in particular working capital employed in the 
business, optimises resources available for the Group to invest in its future 
growth and to generate shareholder value.
Stakeholder satisfaction Definition
Customer satisfaction Results of mystery shopping and telephone surveys.
Staff satisfaction Results of staff surveys.
Staff turnover Number of leavers as a percentage of the average number of employees.
Shareholder Definition
Underlying diluted    The level of growth in underlying diluted earnings per share (EPS)
earnings per share   provides a suitable measure of the overall financial health of the Group and   
 its ability to deliver returns to shareholders each year.  The Group targets   
 growth in EPS at fixed increments over the annual Retail Prices Index (RPI).  
Total Shareholder Return  This metric provides a relative performance measure over the longer term of
(TSR)   the Group’s ability to deliver returns for shareholders.  The Group seeks to   
 outperform the FTSE 350 index over a three year period.

Corporate	 Responsibility	 Key	 Performance	 Indicators
The Group monitors five principal Corporate Responsibility indicators.  These are:
Staff diversity.
Health and Safety – employee accidents.
Ethical supply chain audits.
Contributions to the community.
Waste recycled.
Details are set out in the Corporate Responsibility Review on pages 22 to 25, together with the performance 
results for 2007/08.
These indicators are used to manage the business on a divisional and regional basis as appropriate.   
They assist the Board in identifying risks to achieving the Group’s objectives and to take mitigating action.
A review of the Group’s results and key performance indicators for 2007/08 is set out in the Business and 
Financial Review on pages 10 to 21.
Corporate	 activity
On 24 May 2007, following the exercise of a put option held by Fourlis Holding SA, the main minority 
shareholder of DSGi South-East Europe A.E.V.E.  (formerly P .  Kotsovolos S.A.) (Kotsovolos), the Group 
acquired a further 10% stake in Kotsovolos for cash consideration of €22.9 million (£15.6 million).   
The acquisition increases the Group’s total interest in Kotsovolos to 89.1%.
In 2004/05, a cooperation agreement was entered into by the Group with Eldorado Group (Eldorado) granting 
the Group the option to acquire Eldorado in tranches up to 100%, by 2011.  On 19 June 2007 the directors 
notified Eldorado that the Group was terminating this agreement.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 2.02p per share was paid on 25 January 2008 to shareholders on the register  
at the close of business on 14 December 2007.  The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend  
of 3.43p per share, making total dividends of 5.45p per share for the period (2006/07 8.87p per share).  
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the annual general meeting on 3 September 2008 the final dividend  
will be paid on 26 September 2008 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on  
15 August 2008.
Total dividends payable to shareholders in respect of the financial period were £97.4 million.
Share	 capital
Details of the Company’s share capital and changes to the issued share capital during the period, including 
share options exercised, are given in note 22(a) to the financial statements.  On 22 June 2007 the Company 
announced its intention to repurchase shares to the value of £100 million.  This programme was completed 
on 17 December 2007 when 73.1 million shares had been repurchased and cancelled during the financial 
year.  At the annual general meeting on 5 September 2007, shareholders approved a resolution for the 
Company to make purchases of its own shares to a maximum number of 183 million ordinary shares.  This 
resolution remains valid until the conclusion of this year’s annual general meeting.  Shareholders will be 
asked to renew this authority at the annual general meeting on 3 September 2008.

Directors’	 Report	 continued 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 41
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
The Company maintains high standards of corporate governance for which the directors are collectively 
accountable to shareholders.  Sound governance is central to achieving the directors’ prime objective of 
maximising shareholder value and comprises, principally, the processes by which the Group is directed  
and managed, risks are identified and controlled and effective accountability is assured.
Combined	 Code
The following statement, together with the Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 64, the Audit Committee 
Report on pages 47 and 48 and the Nominations Committee Report on pages 49 and 50, explains how the 
Group has throughout the period applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (“the Combined Code”).  
Board	 of	 Directors
The Board comprises a non-executive Chairman, four non-executive directors considered by the Board to be 
independent and two executive directors.  Andrew Lynch fulfilled the role of the Senior Independent Director 
throughout the year.  On 5 September 2007 John Clare retired as Group Chief Executive; on 5 December 
2007 John Browett was appointed as Chief Executive in his place.  During the intervening period Sir John 
Collins assumed additional responsibilities as acting Chief Executive, which were then relinquished when 
John Browett joined the Board.  The offices of Chairman and Chief Executive are, however, held separately 
and written statements of their responsibilities have been approved by the Board.  
The Chairman ensures that the Board has full and timely access to all relevant information and holds 
occasional meetings with the non-executive directors without the executive directors being present to 
discuss, amongst other matters, corporate strategy and performance.  There is frequent contact between 
directors outside formal meetings to progress the Group’s business and to promote open communication 
and teamworking.
The articles of association require one third of the Board not otherwise subject to reappointment by 
shareholders to retire by rotation each year and ensure that over a three year period each director is subject 
to reappointment by shareholders in general meeting.  Details of the directors retiring by rotation at the 
annual general meeting on 3 September 2008 are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 39, with detailed 
biographies of the Board members shown on pages 26 and 27.
The schedule of matters reserved for the Board includes:
approval of the interim statement and annual report and accounts (including the review of critical 
accounting policies and accounting judgements and an assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects);
approval of the interim and final dividends;
the appointment and remuneration of the external auditors;
communication with shareholders, including approval of all circulars, prospectuses and major public 
announcements;
changes relating to the Company’s capital structure and the Memorandum and Articles of Association;
the appointment, removal and remuneration of directors and the Company Secretary;
the terms of reference of Board committees, the Chairman and the executive directors;
approval of the Group’s strategy and annual budget;
review of Group performance;
maintaining and monitoring the Group’s system of internal control and risk management; 
approval of major capital expenditure or disposals, material contracts, material acquisitions and 
divestments; and
changes to retirement benefits schemes, employee share plans and long term incentive programmes.

Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
An annual Board “awayday” focuses on the longer term strategic direction of the Group and the markets  
in which it operates.
An evaluation of the principal committees of the Board and of their constitution and processes was 
undertaken during the period.  The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, also 
reviewed the leadership and performance of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive 
directors.  The Board normally conducts the annual assessment of the Board and directors in July each year.  
In view of the impending retirement of John Clare and the appointment of John Browett it was decided to 
delay the commencement of this process until several months after the new Chief Executive had joined the 
Company.  The process for assessing the effectiveness of the Board commenced in April 2008 and is 
expected to conclude shortly.  The process involved interviews between all directors and the Company 
Secretary and a written report will be presented to the Board highlighting the matters discussed.  To date 
these assessments have concluded that the structure of the Board and of its committees is robust and that 
the contributions and the time commitments of their constituent members satisfy the present needs of the 
business.  Certain action points have been identified, and will be followed up and monitored during 2008.
A corporate governance framework has been approved by the Board defining the role and responsibilities  
of the constituent elements of the Group’s management structure.  This enables the Board to plan, execute, 
control and monitor the Group’s activities so as to achieve its strategic objectives.
All directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties.  On appointment, each director receives 
a tailored induction programme into the Group together with guidance and training appropriate to their level 
of previous experience.  Non-executive directors are encouraged to meet members of senior management 
regularly, to undertake visits to all parts of the Group, particularly newly acquired and developing businesses, 
and to attend external seminars on corporate governance matters.  All directors are kept informed of 
changes in relevant legislation and changes in commercial and financial risks.
The Board met eight times during the period excluding four ad hoc meetings convened to deal with 
procedural matters.  All directors attended all meetings apart from Andrew Lynch and John Whybrow who 
were absent from one meeting.  Following his appointment as Chief Executive on 5 December 2007 John 
Browett attended all meetings.  Meetings were held at various locations in which the Group operates both  
in the UK and elsewhere in Europe enabling the non-executive directors to gain first hand experience of 
markets in which the Group trades and giving local management direct access to members of the Board.  
There were meetings of the non-executive directors during the period without the executive directors being 
present and meetings between the Senior Independent Director and the other non-executive directors 
without the Chairman being present.
Board	 committees
The Board has established a number of committees to which it has delegated specific responsibilities.   
The trading divisions are managed by separate executive committees.  Separate reports from the Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees, including details of membership and terms of reference, are  
set out on pages 47 to 64.  Membership of the other principal committees and a summary of their terms of 
reference are shown below:

John Clare attended all meetings of both committees up until the date of his retirement.  Katie Bickerstaffe  
was appointed to the Chairman’s Committee and the Executive Committee on 2 June 2008.
All committees operate within written terms of reference approved by the Board, which are available on 
request from the Company Secretary.  The Board receives and reviews minutes of their meetings.  The 
Executive Committee supports the Board and ensures that the policy decided by the Board is implemented 
within the business.  Individuals from the Committee are invited to attend Board meetings to provide expert 
advice upon the areas which they share responsibility for within the Company.  
Relations	 with	 shareholders	 and	 other	 stakeholders
The Board attaches considerable importance to the maintenance of constructive relationships with 
shareholders and its other stakeholders.  Relationships with suppliers, employees and the community  
are further discussed in the Corporate Responsibility Review on pages 22 to 24.  Effective two way 
communication with institutional investors and analysts is established through regular presentations and 
meetings in the UK and overseas, usually by the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group 
Communications Director.  
The Chairman holds occasional meetings with major shareholders to discuss matters of mutual interest 
including corporate strategy and governance.  Where appropriate the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee communicates with major shareholders to canvas opinion when deciding remuneration policy  
for consideration by the Board.  Matters arising from these presentations and meetings are communicated  
to the Board.  Presentations are conducted in accordance with the Financial Services Authority’s Disclosure 
Rules on the dissemination of inside information to ensure the protection of such information that has not 
already been made available generally to the Company’s shareholders.  The Board receives and reviews an 
investor relations report at each of its meetings.  The Senior Independent Director is available to discuss with 
shareholders any major issues that cannot be resolved through normal channels.  Non-executive directors 
are offered the opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders.

The annual general meeting provides an opportunity to communicate directly with shareholders.  The 
chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees are available at the meeting to answer 
questions from shareholders.  Notice of the annual general meeting and related documents are mailed to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.  Separate resolutions are proposed on each 
substantially different issue.  The notice is contained in an accompanying letter.
In addition to the interim and annual reports, shareholders can obtain information about the Group from the 
corporate website (www.dsgiplc.com).
Pension	 schemes	 The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.  The principal 
scheme, which operates in the UK, comprises a funded defined benefit section and a defined contribution 
section.
A Corporate trustee holds the assets of the scheme separately from those of the Group.  There are six 
directors of the trustee company: two are nominated by the Group, two are selected from amongst the 
scheme membership and two are independent directors.  Asset management is delegated to a number  
of independent companies whose performance is monitored by a specialist performance measurement 
service.  The scheme’s accounts are audited annually by Nexia Smith & Williamson, who are not auditors  
to any Group companies.  Members of the scheme receive an annual statement of their accrued benefits  
and a copy of the trustee’s annual report.  
Further information about pensions is given in note 27 to the financial statements.
Internal	 control
In accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull working party set out in “Internal Control: Revised Guidance 
for Directors on the Combined Code”, the Group has established and maintained a process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control and for confirming that action has been taken to remedy any significant failings  
or weaknesses that have been identified.  This process, which is reviewed periodically by the Board, was  
in place throughout the 53 weeks ended 3 May 2008 and to the date of approval of the financial statements.  
Responsibility	 and	 accountability
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control, for reviewing its effectiveness 
and the Group’s approach to risk management.
The Board delegates to executive management the day to day responsibility for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks facing the Group’s operations, and for implementing and maintaining internal control 
systems that manage those risks in an efficient and effective manner, appropriate to their nature and scale.  
Senior management is responsible and accountable for internal control and risk management and for 
ensuring compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures.
Inherent	 limitations	 and	 continuous	 improvement
In determining its policies on internal control, the Board has regard to the materiality of the relevant risks, the 
likelihood of losses occurring and the costs of control.  The directors are aware that the inherent limitations  
in any system of control means that risk cannot be totally eliminated.  It follows that the Group’s system of 
internal control is designed to manage and mitigate, rather than remove, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.  
Corporate	 Governance	 Report	 continued 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 45
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
The Group’s approach to managing and monitoring internal control and risk assessment is regularly reviewed 
to identify ways in which it can be improved and further embedded throughout the Group’s operations.  
Where significant weaknesses are identified, these are investigated fully using appropriate internal resources 
and, where deemed necessary, engaging external expertise.  Detailed plans are drawn to remedy the 
weaknesses and progress is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Control	 environment	 and	 control	 activities
In addition to the corporate governance structure described above, the Group’s system of internal control 
and processes for managing risk comprise the following main elements:
the Board and management committees meet regularly to monitor progress against the targets set out in 
the Group’s budget and strategic three year plan and to consider the quarterly re-forecasts of the Group’s 
expected financial period end position.  Financial and non-financial performance reports are produced 
daily, weekly and four-weekly to facilitate this review process;
the defined lines of authority established by the Board ensure that significant decisions are taken at an 
appropriate level.  These include requirements for the approval and control of both capital and operating 
expenditure, treasury operations and cash management.  The procedures in respect of delegated 
authority have been enhanced during the year and revised authorities have been issued, notably in 
respect of contracts and commitments.  For details on the statement of matters reserved for the Board 
please see page 41;
each business function has established procedures and controls to minimise the risk of fraud and to 
safeguard the Group’s assets;
appropriate controls and procedures have been established over the security of data held on, and 
functionality provided by, the Group’s business systems.  These include disaster recovery arrangements.  
The computer systems are periodically tested and reviewed by both internal and external audit functions;
the Group appoints individuals who are of a calibre to enable them to discharge the duties and 
responsibilities of the roles assigned to them.  Established performance review and development 
mechanisms exist to identify key objectives and areas for improvement for each member of staff.  
Succession planning forms an integral part of HR management;
Group Treasury operates within established and documented policies and procedures.  The policies  
are described in the Directors’ Report on page 34 and are reviewed and approved annually by the 
Executive Committee;
the Group’s programme of insurance covers the material risks to the Group’s assets and business and  
is reviewed annually by the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee;

Internal	 audit	 The Internal Audit department is fully independent of business operations and has a Group-wide mandate.  
Their work is driven by a risk-based methodology ensuring that the controls to mitigate the Group’s key risks 
are audited on a regular basis.  Its plans are approved by the Audit Committee, which also receives regular 
reports on its findings and progress of related actions.  The function also works with the business to promote 
and further develop effective risk management within their operations.
External	 audit	 The external auditors provide further independent observations on certain elements of the internal  
financial controls as part of their audit of the financial statements and their findings are presented  
to the Audit Committee.
Corporate	 responsibility
The Group operates a Corporate Responsibility (CR) Committee, which was chaired by the Group Director  
of HR during the period and chaired by the Company Secretary after 31 May 2008.  During the period the 
Committee met on four occasions.  The Group Finance Director is the Board member with specific responsibility 
for social, environmental, ethical and other CR related matters.  The CR Committee assists the Board  
in identifying reputational and other risks arising from the conduct of the Group’s businesses.  It makes 
recommendations on measurement tools and audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of  
systems for managing CR related matters.  All Board members receive regular updates on CR issues,  
risks and opportunities.

The current membership of the Committee, whose biographies and qualifications are set out on page 27,  
is set out in the table below and comprises the four independent non-executive directors.  All committee 
members served throughout the period.  The Committee met four times during the period in June, September, 
November and April in advance of key internal and external reporting dates.  The Committee has a formal 
schedule of matters to be considered over the course of the year which are allocated across the four 
meetings.  The agendas may be supplemented by specific meetings when required and through informal 
discussions with the Chairman and other members of the Committee.
Members      Meetings attended during period
Andrew Lynch (Chairman)        4
Rita Clifton         4
Count Emmanuel d’André        4
John Whybrow        4
The Chairman has recent and relevant financial experience.  The Company Secretary acted as secretary  
to the Committee during the period.
Representatives of the external auditors, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and  
the Group Director of Internal Audit and Risk Management were invited to attend each meeting to ensure  
that Committee members were fully informed and fully supported in carrying out their duties.  Part of each 
meeting was held between the members of the Committee and the external auditors in private.  
Role	 of	 the	 Committee
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility to:
monitor the integrity of the financial statements and any formal announcements relating to the  
Company’s financial performance;
review critical accounting policies and financial reporting judgements;
review the integrity of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management;
monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function;
the annual audit plan of both the internal and external audit functions including the principal areas  
of focus;
review the Group’s risk and insurance programmes;
review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and objectivity, assess the effectiveness of the 
external audit process, approve the external auditors’ remuneration and terms of engagement and make 
recommendations in respect of their reappointment or removal; 
review regularly the Group’s policy on the supply of non-audit services by the external auditors, to  
approve the qualifying services and the level of non-audit fees and to monitor the services provided.   
In this respect, the level of fees paid for non-audit services when taken as a proportion of the  
audit fee is considered in addition to the nature of such services in order to preserve the external  
auditors’ independence and objectivity; and
monitor the results and effectiveness of arrangements under which employees can raise in confidence 
issues of concern relating to financial matters and internal controls.
In addition, the Audit Committee has responsibility for reviewing taxation matters and working capital 
management.  The full terms of reference of the Audit Committee are available on the corporate responsibility 
section of the corporate website.

Key	 matters	 considered
In addition to executing the responsibilities described above, the key matters considered by the Committee 
during the period included:
significant issues arising from reports from both the internal and external audits;
a review of the acquisition of FotoVista and the process in resolving the systems and control issues 
identified following the discovery of the fraud;
the carrying value of certain assets in the Group;
a review of the effectiveness of Internal Audit by the new Group Director of Internal Audit and Risk 
Management; 
a review of the performance of the Committee leading to a recommendation to the Board that the 
Committee’s terms of reference be changed.  Revised terms of reference were adopted at the meeting of 
the Board on 8 April 2008; and
the annual audit fee with particular regard to the balance between audit and non-audit fees.  A pre-
approval policy for non-audit work permitted to be carried out has been carefully monitored throughout 
the period and helps to ensure that engagements which might compromise auditor independence are not 
assigned to Deloitte & Touche LLP .
The Committee, having considered the policies and procedures applied by the Group and the internal 
policies and representations of Deloitte & Touche LLP , including the regular rotation of audit partner, remains 
satisfied with the auditors’ objectivity and independence and the effectiveness of the audit process.  
Accordingly, the Committee has recommended to the Board that a resolution for their reappointment be 
proposed at the annual general meeting.

Role	 of	 the	 Committee
The Committee’s principal roles and responsibilities are:
to keep under review the structure, size and composition of the Board and its principal committees  
and to recommend changes deemed necessary;

the present needs of the Group.  The Committee is also satisfied that the present structure offers strong 
leadership for the Company, but does not concentrate authority in one or two key individuals; 
review of the Committee’s terms of reference following changes implemented by the Companies Act  
2006 and other relevant legislation;
consideration of the terms of service of Count Emmanuel d’André and Sir John Collins and the

This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 1985 (the “Act”), as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,  
and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.  Apart from the information relating to individual 
remuneration, share options, share awards, share interests and pensions information on pages 57 and  
60 to 64, this report is not subject to audit.
The purposes of this report are to inform shareholders of the Company’s policies on directors’ remuneration 
applicable to the two financial periods up to 3 May 2008 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years  
as well as to provide details of the remuneration of individual directors as determined by the Remuneration 
Committee.  Shareholders will be asked to approve the report at the annual general meeting on  
3 September 2008.
Remuneration	 Committee
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for determining policy in relation to, 
and approval of, remuneration packages for senior executives.  This includes the terms and conditions of 
employment of each of the executive directors of the Company and for other senior executives of the Group; 
and policy in relation to the operation of the Group’s share-based employee incentive schemes.  In setting its 
policies, the Committee has regard to the compensation and benefits arrangements which apply below 
senior management level.
The current membership of the Committee, whose biographies and qualifications are set out on pages 26 
and 27, is set out in the table below and comprises three independent non-executive directors and the 
Chairman of the Company.  All the Committee members served throughout the current and prior periods, 
except for the Company Chairman who joined the Committee in January 2008.  The Committee’s terms of 
reference are shown on the corporate responsibility section of the corporate website.  The Committee met 
six times during the period (including two ad hoc meetings which were convened to deal with procedural 
matters).  Andrew Lynch and John Whybrow were unable to attend one of the meetings.  
Following the changes in the Combined Code in July 2006 which allowed the Chairman of the Company to 
join the Remuneration Committee, Sir John Collins became a member of the Committee with effect from  
15 January 2008 and he has attended each meeting of the Committee since that date.

Remuneration	 policy
Executive	 directors
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to:
ensure that the remuneration structure incentivises and rewards directors and senior executives for their 
contribution to the attainment of the Group’s short and longer term results and, where appropriate, the 
performance of individual trading divisions and business units;
maintain, particularly through reward schemes based on performance, a competitive package of pay  
and benefits which provides the motivation for future achievement;
facilitate, in an increasingly competitive international environment, the building and retention of a high 
calibre and focused team which will work effectively to achieve the Group’s longer term strategic 
objectives;
align the directors’ interests with those of shareholders by offering participation in schemes which provide 
opportunities to build shareholdings in the Company; and
facilitate effective succession planning.
In implementing this policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of information and surveys from 
internal and independent sources and the remuneration paid for comparable positions in other companies, 
especially those operating internationally.  It reviews data and surveys provided by remuneration consultants 
and market research companies with particular reference to the scale and composition of the total 
remuneration packages payable to people with like responsibilities, qualifications, skills and experience  
in businesses of similar size and structure.
The remuneration policy, which was in place for the period under review and the previous financial period 
(approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held in 2007) is set out below.  During the period 
under review, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy.  The Committee decided that 
the fundamental structure of the incentive design for executive directors should remain unchanged; changes 
were needed, however, mainly in the area of the Group’s short and long term incentive arrangements 
particularly with regard to ensuring appropriate performance conditions were in place and changes to  
reflect good corporate governance.  These changes are discussed further on pages 53 to 56.
Shareholder approval will be sought at the forthcoming annual general meeting to adopt the developed long 
term incentive arrangements mentioned above along with a new Save As You Earn (Sharesave) plan.  The 
Committee plans to award shares in 2008 under the current share plans but to make changes which are 
consistent with the proposals being put to the annual general meeting in terms of performance conditions, 
“good leaver” situations and change of control.  Good leaver circumstances relate to a participant leaving  
the Group under compassionate circumstances including those leaving due to retirement, ill-health, injury, 
disability or redundancy (Good Leaver).
The Remuneration Committee is also putting in place for 2008/09 only arrangements intended to retain and 
incentivise key senior executives and management below Board level, on a selective basis, to achieve the 
aims set out in the Renewal and Transformation plan announced on 15 May 2008.  Details are referred to in 
the relevant sections of this report.
The main components of the remuneration of the executive directors are as follows:
(a) Basic salaries
Basic salaries reflect the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of the mid market rate for relevant positions 
and levels of responsibility and the individual director’s experience, performance and value to the business.  
The basic salaries of the two executive directors were reviewed prior to the start of the 2008/09 financial year

(to coincide with the Group-wide pay reviews) and are currently £670,000 and £495,000 for John Browett  
and Kevin O’Byrne, respectively, representing increases of approximately 3% from their previous levels.   
The Committee assessed pay and employment conditions of employees of the Company and of other 
undertakings within the Group when determining the executive directors’ remuneration.  The increases are  
in line with the annual review of senior executive salaries for which the average was just under 3% across  
the population and are in line with the average increase of salary across the employee base of the Group.  
(b) Performance related remuneration
The performance based elements of remuneration are designed to drive performance and to strengthen  
the alignment between the interests of the Company’s shareholders and its senior management, whilst 
encouraging management retention.  The components of performance related remuneration are as follows:
(i) Annual cash bonus
During 2006/07 and 2007/08 performance based remuneration for the executive directors comprised an 
annual cash bonus plan based on the achievement of the Group’s targets.  In the case of other participating 
executives below Board level, divisional and business unit targets were applied.
For 2006/07, the bonus performance measures were underlying diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth and 
Free Cash Flow.  EPS and Free Cash Flow are defined in the consolidated financial statements in note 8 and 
the consolidated cash flow statement, respectively.  The maximum bonus payable to John Clare was 100% 
of basic salary.  The maximum payable to the Group Finance Director was also 100% of basic salary which 
included an element based on the attainment of the Controllable Earnings targets of the Computing Division 
for which he had responsibility in 2006/07 in addition to his duties as Group Finance Director.  Controllable 
Earnings are defined as operating profit less a charge based on the average amount of invested capital 
across the year.  For 2006/07 the performance targets were not met and accordingly neither John Clare nor 
the Group Finance Director were paid a bonus.  
For 2007/08, the maximum bonus payable to the Group Finance Director and John Clare was 100% of  
basic salary.  In the case of both of the executive directors, the bonus performance measures were based  
on Controllable Earnings and the achievement of Free Cash Flow targets whereby Controllable Earnings 
represented 80% of the bonus opportunity and Free Cash Flow comprised 20% of the bonus opportunity.  
The maximum potential bonus for members of the Executive Committee was 85% of basic salary and for 
other participating senior executives was 80% of basic salary.  For 2007/08 the performance targets were  
not met and accordingly neither John Clare nor the Group Finance Director were paid a performance-related 
bonus.  John Browett’s bonus arrangements upon joining are discussed below in section (g).
In the autumn of 2007, Kevin O’Byrne received a “one-off” payment of £75,000 and was also granted an 
award under the LTIP , details of which can be found in the table on page 62.  These arrangements were  
in recognition of his performance and additional responsibility assumed during the period between John 
Clare’s departure and John Browett joining the Group and the value placed on his future contribution.
For 2008/09 the maximum potential bonus for the Chief Executive is 100% of basic salary.  However, for 
2008/09 only, the Group Finance Director will be eligible for a bonus of up to 130% of salary to reflect his  
key role in the Renewal and Transformation plan.  Payment will be dependent on underlying Group operating 
profit (60% of bonus), Group Free Cash Flow (20% of bonus) and achievement of personal objectives (20%  
of bonus), which will include an element related to non-financial KPIs.  For 2008/09 the maximum potential 
bonus for members of the Executive Committee will be 85% of basic salary and for other participating senior 
executives will be 80% of basic salary.
Targets are set using benchmarks that reflect both internal business objectives and external expectations.  
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the targets are challenging.  Before approving bonus 
payments, the Remuneration Committee will confirm that awards reflect genuine improvement in the Group’s 
underlying financial performance.  Further information on employee costs, including those relating to senior 
management is given in notes 6 and 33, respectively, to the financial statements.

(ii) Long Term Incentive Plan – LTIP
For awards to date under the LTIP , performance has been measured in terms of the Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) achieved by the Company over a three year period relative to the companies comprising the FTSE 100 
Index at the start of the performance period.  
Vesting of shares is subject to the achievement of the following performance targets: 
no shares vest if TSR performance is below the median for the comparator group; and
for performance in the upper quartile, 100% would vest, for median performance 40% would vest  
and for performance between the median and upper quartile the number of shares is calculated using  
a sliding scale.
Any shares which vest cannot be released within close periods.
TSR data is collated by HNBS to calculate the extent to which the performance condition has been met.   
The number of shares awarded is calculated by reference to basic salary at the date of grant.  The maximum 
award of shares is equivalent to 50% of basic salary in the case of the executive directors, 45% for the 
members of the Executive Committee and 40% for other participating executives.  Prior to vesting, the 
Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the TSR performance achieved reasonably reflects the 
financial performance of the Group and reserves the right to vary awards accordingly.  
Details of awards made in 2007/08 to Kevin O’Byrne and those made to John Browett on joining the Group 
are detailed on page 62.
At the annual general meeting on 3 September 2008 shareholder approval will be sought for the 
establishment of a new LTIP which will be called the Performance Share Plan (PSP), to replace the current 
LTIP .  The Remuneration Committee continues to believe that TSR is the most appropriate performance 
condition as it aligns management interests with those of the shareholders.  However, the Remuneration 
Committee no longer considers the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index to be the most appropriate 
benchmark of performance.  Accordingly, for the annual awards to be made in 2008/09, it is intended that 
TSR performance will be compared to that of a bespoke weighted index comprising UK and European 
retailers Debenhams, Inchcape, Signet Group, Halfords Group, Kesa Electricals, Marks & Spencer, Sports 
Direct International, Home Retail Group, Kingfisher, Next, Tesco, PPR, Metro AG, Jelmoli and Praktiker.  All 
companies would have equal weighting within the group other than Kesa and Metro AG, who have greater 
relevance and will, therefore, have double weighting.  25% of an award will vest for performance equivalent  
to median with full vesting occurring for performance equivalent to the upper quartile over the three year 
performance period.  None of the award will vest for performance below the median.  The terms of the PSP 
will be set out in the notice of annual general meeting.
It is intended that the annual awards to be made in the summer of 2008 will contain provisions consistent 
with the new PSP in terms of the performance condition referred to above and how the awards are dealt  
with in the event of an individual leaving as a Good Leaver and on a change of control as follows:
in the event of a participant leaving the Group as a Good Leaver the current position is that the extent  
to which an award vests is entirely at the discretion of the Committee.  It is intended that in the event of 
cessation of employment in Good Leaver circumstances awards will be capable of vesting, at the normal 
vesting date (except in the event of death), subject to satisfaction of the TSR performance condition.  
Awards will be pro-rated to reflect the shortened service during the performance period; and  
•
•
•
Remuneration	 Report	 continued 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 55
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
in the event of a change of control, it is intended that future awards will only vest to the extent that the 
Remuneration Committee determines that performance warrants it and awards will be pro-rated unless 
the Committee determines that it is inappropriate to do so.  Currently awards vest in their entirety.
(iii) Share option and reward share plans
The Remuneration Committee approves the basis on which options are granted to executive directors and 
other employees under the Company’s discretionary share option schemes and other performance plans.
Options are normally granted annually to executive directors and other senior executives over shares having 
a market value on the date of grant equal to twice their basic salary.  However, in exceptional circumstances 
(for instance to facilitate recruitment or to retain key executives) this limit can be exceeded.  Executive 
directors and senior executives are also entitled to participate in the Sharesave plan on the same conditions 
as other employees.  In 2007/08 the Company launched a Sharesave plan which attracted a take up rate of 
21%, a 50% improvement on the 2006/07 plan.  
For 2007/08 the Group Finance Director received a grant of share options with a value of 200% of salary and, 
on joining, the Chief Executive received a grant of share options with a value of 200% of salary.  Both awards 
were subject to the EPS performance conditions which have previously applied for option grants (and which 
are detailed on page 57), and are measured over three financial years.  The performance period for the award 
made to the Group Finance Director commenced on 29 April 2007; and the performance period for the award 
made to the Chief Executive commenced on 4 May 2008.
The next three years are an important period for the Group.  Under the new Chief Executive the Company  
will be putting in place a strategy to lead the recovery of the business as detailed in the Renewal and 
Transformation plan.  To deliver this strategy it is imperative that the senior executives who are vital in 
delivering it are retained within the business over this period.  Therefore, for 2008/09 only, a very small 
number of executives, including the Group Finance Director, will receive an exceptional grant of share options 
worth 300% of salary.  For 2008/09, the Chief Executive will receive an award of 200% of salary as originally 
agreed upon joining.  In order to incentivise junior management to develop a stronger ownership culture in 
the Group, it is also intended that a grant of share options will be made to this population in 2008.
A limited number of senior executives below Board level will also receive awards under a retention plan 
(Reward Shares) whereby no performance condition will apply but, other than in the event of death, or on 
change of control, shares will only be released in the event that the relevant individuals remain with the Group 
for a three year period.  The awards under the retention plan will range between 30% and 50% of salary.
Both the exceptional share option grant and Reward Shares are considered necessary to ensure that those 
executives key to delivering the recovery are appropriately incentivised and “locked in” to the Company for 
the next three years.  In the event of a change of control, it is intended that future awards under the share 
option plan will only vest to the extent that the Committee determines that performance warrants it and 
awards will be pro-rated unless the Committee determines that it is inappropriate to do so.  Currently awards 
vest in their entirety.  
The increase in share option awards for 2008/09 has been considered in conjunction with a review of the EPS 
targets applying to the share options.  During the period under review, option grants have been subject to a 
requirement to deliver real growth in EPS of RPI plus 3% per annum (where 50% of the share option vests)  
to RPI plus 5% per annum (100% of the share option vests).  The options to be granted in 2008/09 to the 
Group’s most senior executives (those in the top three management grades) will be subject to performance 
conditions which are strengthened as follows:
Grant level     EPS hurdles
100% of salary     RPI plus 4% per annum
100%–200% of salary    RPI plus 4%–7% per annum*
200%–300% of salary    RPI plus 7%–10% per annum*
*
 Awards will vest on a straight-line basis.

Beyond 2008/09 the Committee will consider appropriate hurdles in light of business circumstances 
prevailing at the time of grant and accordingly will have the flexibility to amend performance conditions  
for future options.
To maximise the perceived value of the options, no performance conditions will apply to awards made to 
employees below the top three management grades.  Such awards will be granted for this year at a level of 
up to 150% of salary.  The average award made to employees participating is approximately 30% of salary.  
In future years performance conditions will apply but it is intended that these will be based upon internal 
financial / operational targets.
All share options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant and, for those options 
subject to a performance target, if the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been 
met.  Such determination is made following presentation of the calculation which is performed once EPS 
figures are known for the relevant financial year and targets are tested only once.  All share options lapse on 
the earlier of ten years from the date of grant or, where performance conditions apply, on the date on which 
the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have not been met.
At the annual general meeting on 3 September 2008 shareholder approval will be sought for the 
establishment of a new executive share option scheme.  The terms of the share option scheme will  
be set out in the notice of annual general meeting.
The grants to be made in 2008 prior to the annual general meeting will be made under the existing  
share option scheme.  However, the Remuneration Committee intends that in addition to the change  
in performance conditions referred to above it will make these grants consistent with the proposed  
new share option scheme in respect of Good Leaver situations and change of control as follows:
Option exercises on cessation of employment in Good Leaver circumstances will continue to be delayed 
until the normal vesting date (except in the case of death) subject to the EPS performance condition 
(where this applies) and time pro-rating of options will be applied as follows:
Time of leaving    Pro-rata rate of options
Good Leaver < first anniversary of date of grant Lapse in full
Good Leaver between first and second anniversary 
1
/
3
 exercisable,

/
3
 lapse
Good Leaver between second and third anniversary 
2
/
3
 exercisable, 
1
/
3
 lapse
All other circumstances   Lapse in full
The plan currently allows options to be exercised in full on a change of control irrespective of whether the 
performance conditions have been satisfied.  It is intended that this is altered so that the vesting of future 
options is subject to the Committee’s assessment of the extent to which performance warrants it.  The 
exercise of share options will be time pro-rated unless the Committee determines that it is inappropriate  
to do so.

Performance conditions Re-testing
Grants made  
before 1 July 2003
The market price on the date of exercise is at 
least 20% higher than the option price, assuming 
exercise takes place between three and four 
years after the date of grant.  For later exercises, 
the rate of share growth is adjusted in line  
with RPI.
Exercise is also conditional upon EPS having 
increased by not less than 3% above the annual 
RPI over any consecutive period of three years 
during the life of the option.
During the life of the option
Grant made  
on 28 July 2003
On the third anniversary of the date of grant, EPS 
growth over the period since the date of grant 
must exceed the annual RPI by at least 3%  
per annum compound.
Re-testing on the fourth 
and fifth anniversaries
Grant made  
on 4 August 2004
On the third anniversary of the date of grant, EPS 
growth over the period since the date of grant 
must exceed the annual RPI by at least 3%  
per annum compound.
No re-testing
Grants made  
after 11 October 2004
Over the three year performance period EPS 
growth is equal to or greater than annual RPI plus 
5%.  Where EPS growth is between annual RPI 
plus 3% and RPI plus 5%, options will vest on a 
straight-line basis between 50% and 100% of  
the award.
No re-testing
Prior to 2005/06, share options were granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of 
management grade and to employees with more than three years’ service.  Since 2005/06 and until 2007/08 
employees below executive level have either participated in a cash settled performance share plan or in a few 
selected cases have been granted share options, both of which were linked in most cases to the attainment 
of three year EPS targets.  
(iv) Dilution
The Remuneration Committee is aware of, and supports, the ABI guidelines regarding dilution and regularly 
monitors compliance with these requirements.  The Remuneration Committee’s policy is to include 
provisions in scheme rules which limit the number of newly issued shares which can be granted.  Shares 
bought in the market are to be used to satisfy awards under the Group’s LTIP and the Reward Shares to be 
granted in 2008.  A combination of both newly issued and existing shares are to be used to satisfy options 
under the Group’s executive share option schemes.  The Group has an established employee trust which  
it uses to hold existing shares and the Committee’s intention is to make purchases of shares taking into 
account the portion of awards and options to be satisfied by new issue, the likelihood of any performance 
targets being met and also potential lapsing of awards when employees leave the Group.
Of the shares currently under option, 13.13% relate to the executive directors and members of senior 
management and, if exercised, the proportion of shares currently under option for all schemes which are to 
be satisfied by the issue of new shares would represent 6.62% of the issued share capital of the Company 
for the 10 years ended 3 May 2008.
Further information on share-based payments is set out in note 25 to the financial statements.

(c) Taxable benefits
Each of the executive directors is entitled to the use of a company car with related benefits or cash payments 
in lieu and is a member of the non-contributory DSGi medical expenses plan which provides benefits similar 
to those applicable in similar companies.
(d) Pensions and related benefit
Kevin O’Byrne accrues, and John Clare accrued, benefits under the senior executive defined benefit section 
of DSG Retirement & Employee Security Scheme (DRESS).  This is a funded, HM Revenue & Customs 
registered contributory pension scheme which provides a pension at normal retirement age (60) of two thirds 
of pensionable salary subject to a minimum period of 20 years’ membership.  Part of this pension may be 
exchanged for cash at the date of retirement.  Membership of the scheme also confers dependants’ 
pensions, insured lump sums on death in service and benefits in the event of prolonged disability.  
Details of pension benefits earned by directors during the financial period are shown on page 61.  
Notwithstanding the abolition of the statutory earnings cap for pension purposes on 6 April 2006, an 
equivalent cap, adjusted annually for inflation, has been introduced for the purposes of DRESS.  From  
1 May 2008 this is £117,600.  Kevin O’Byrne will continue to receive a salary supplement equivalent to  
the contributions which would otherwise have been paid by the Company to DRESS on that part of  
his pensionable salary which exceeds the earnings cap.  A similar salary supplement arrangement  
for pension purposes applies to three other senior executives.
New externally recruited executive directors will be offered membership of the money purchase section of 
DRESS and the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion regarding the level of award of any 
salary supplement or enhanced contributions.  John Browett has chosen not to become a member of this 
section of DRESS, however, he receives a contribution of 32.1% of salary to fund his own retirement 
arrangements.
(e) Service agreements
Kevin O’Byrne has a service agreement with DSG Retail Limited which may be terminated at any time  
by 12 months’ notice.  John Browett has a service agreement with DSG international plc which can be 
terminated on 24 months’ notice where such notice is served prior to the expiry of 12 months from his 
commencement of employment and on 12 months’ notice thereafter.  Service agreements contain neither a 
liquidated damages nor a change of control clause.  It is the Company’s policy to ensure that any payments 
made to a director in the event of the early termination of a service agreement reflect the circumstances 
giving rise to termination and, where considered appropriate, the obligation of the outgoing director to 
mitigate his loss.  Accordingly, consideration is given to making compensation payments in instalments and 
is conditional on the leaver’s employment and earnings status.
The service agreements of the executive directors who served during the financial period were entered into 
on the following dates:
        Date
John Browett        6 Jun 2007
Kevin O’Byrne        16 Jul 2004
John Clare        3 Feb 1989
The service agreements of the continuing directors are available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours on each business day.

(f) External directorships
Executive directors are permitted to accept non-executive directorships in external companies and to retain 
the fees which they receive in such roles.  Normally only one such appointment will be authorised for each 
director.  John Browett is a non-executive director of easyJet plc and was paid a fee at the rate of £45,000 
per annum.  Kevin O’Byrne was appointed as a non-executive director of Land Securities Group plc on  
1 April 2008 and is paid a total fee at the rate of £55,000 per annum.  
(g) Recruitment of John Browett
On 31 May 2007 John Clare announced his intention to retire from the Board at the 2007 annual general 
meeting.  The Nominations Committee undertook a search for a new Chief Executive which culminated in  
the recruitment of John Browett.  In order to facilitate his recruitment, and in compensation of the significant 
value of share awards and bonus entitlement John Browett was forfeiting upon joining the Company, the 
Remuneration Committee agreed the following incentive arrangements:
on joining, an award of shares with a value of 200% of salary under the LTIP , which will vest after the third 
anniversary of appointment in December 2010 subject to the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 100 index over the three year period starting on  
5 December 2007.  Vesting is in line with current LTIP grants (which are referred to in section (b)(ii) above);
a grant of options under the share option scheme with a value of 200% of salary, which will be exercisable 
subject to achieving EPS growth over the three financial years commencing 4 May 2008.  These options 
cannot be exercised until after the preliminary announcement of results for the 2010/11 financial year.  
Where EPS growth is 3% per annum, half of the options will become exercisable increasing on a 
straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of 5% per annum;
on joining, a “one-off” award of 200% of salary under the LTIP , which will vest on 6 December 2010 subject, 
in most circumstances, to John Browett remaining in employment with the Group at that time; and
a “one-off” guaranteed bonus for 2007/08 of £600,000 payable in August 2008.
Non-executive	 directors
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for three year terms, although appointments vary depending 
on length of service and succession planning considerations.  Their current terms expire as follows:
        Date
Sir John Collins        11 Sep 2009
Count Emmanuel d’André       1 Sep 2009
Rita Clifton        1 Sep 2009
Andrew Lynch        20 May 2009
John Whybrow        24 Jun 2009
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board upon the recommendation of the 
Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director.  
Sir John Collins’ fee is currently £320,000 per annum; he is also provided with the use of a car and related 
benefits and is a member of the Group’s medical expenses plan.  The Chairman’s fees were reviewed in  
June 2008 and were increased by approximately 3% to £330,000.  The change in fees will be implemented  
in September 2008.
The other non-executive directors receive a fee (currently £45,000 per annum or euro equivalent).  The fee  
is normally reviewed bi-annually and this review in 2008 has resulted in an increase to £48,000 for 
implementation in September 2008.  
In July 2007 the Board reviewed the fees paid for services as Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees and agreed to increase the fee paid from £7,500 per annum to £10,000 per annum.
Andrew Lynch has been designated Senior Independent Director for which he receives a further fee  
of £5,000 per annum.

  In the case of John Clare, values are shown as at his date of leaving the Company.  On this date he chose to commence drawing on his pension.  This 
represented early draw down and accordingly an appropriate reduction was applied.  As a result there was no increase in accrued pension during the period.
Accrued pension shown is that payable at normal retirement age (60).
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with Guidance Note GN 11 “Retirement Benefit 
Schemes – Transfer Values” published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries and dated  
6 April 2001.  The difference between the transfer values at the beginning and end of the period includes the 
effect of factors beyond the control of the Company and the directors, such as stock market movements.
In 2003 the Remuneration Committee decided that bonuses should no longer be pensionable and addressed 
this by removing bonuses from the definition of pensionable pay in respect of pensionable service accruing 
after the end of 2004/05.  As John Clare had already accrued the minimum period of 20 years’ membership 
required to secure the maximum pension of two thirds of pensionable salary as at the date of this change, his 
pensionable pay includes cash bonuses and pension contributions have been paid on this basis.

Following a meeting in May 2008 the Remuneration Committee adopted a policy for implementation in the 
2008/09 financial year of encouraging executive directors to build shareholdings in the Company.  The policy 
is that executive directors are required to retain 50% of the net of tax out-turn from the vesting of future 
awards or share options under the Company’s share plans until a shareholding with a minimum value 
equivalent to their basic salary is achieved.

1 The award of 788,834 shares was made on 6 December 2007.  The quantum of shares awarded was calculated using the mid-market value of the shares on 
6 June 2007, the date on which John Browett accepted the offer of employment with the Group.  
2 The release of these shares, in most circumstances, is dependent on John Browett remaining in employment until the vesting date, 6 December 2010.  
These shares may vest on an earlier date in certain circumstances.
3 Following the period end, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the TSR performance condition associated with the awards made to Kevin O’Byrne in the 
2005/06 financial period and determined that the target had not been met.  Accordingly, these awards have now lapsed.
The status of the provisional awards under the LTIP are regularly reviewed and as at the last review the status 
of the awards as at the date of this report is as follows:
Financial period in which provisional award made  Status Award if status maintained
2006/07   TSR below median No award
2007/08   TSR below median No award
The “one-off” LTIP award made to John Browett upon joining the Group is not subject to performance 
conditions.
It is intended that any releases of shares under the LTIP will be satisfied by shares held in trust by Halifax EES 
Trustees International Limited, the trustee of the employee share ownership trust (the Trust).  Vesting of the 
shares provisionally awarded under the LTIP in 2006/07 and 2007/08 occurs in June 2009 and June 2010, 
respectively subject to the attainment of performance targets.  The shares provisionally awarded under the 
LTIP in 2005/06 did not vest as they did not satisfy the performance targets.  There were no changes in 
directors’ restricted or unrestricted share interest between 3 May 2008 and the date of this report except  
as detailed in the Directors’ Report on page 39.

1 Options are exercisable between three and 10 years from the date of grant, subject to the performance conditions being met.  The conditions upon  
which discretionary options may be exercised are summarised on pages 55 to 57.  
2 Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are exercisable in the six month period following the date of maturity of a three year or five year  
savings contract.  
3 The performance period for the options granted on 3 August 2005 expired at the end of 2007/08 financial year.  The Remuneration Committee has reviewed 
the EPS performance condition associated with these options and determined that it had not been met.  Accordingly these options have now lapsed.
4 The price of an ordinary share on the date of exercise was 117.00p when Kevin O’Byrne exercised his Sharesave options.  
5 The performance period for the award made to John Browett commences on 4 May 2008.
Options may be exercised earlier by Good Leavers, subject to performance conditions being satisfied.
The mid-market price of an ordinary share on 3 May 2008 was 69.25p.  The highest and lowest mid-market 
prices during the period were 176.30p and 53.00p, respectively.
Former	 directors	 (audited	 information)
Pursuant to an agreement dated 1 October 2002, Lord Kalms, the former Chairman, was appointed 
President of the Company for an initial period ending on 16 September 2012.  He received £28,790 for his 
services as President during the year.  His remuneration is subject to annual review in line with the RPI.  He 
was provided with benefits amounting to £35,186 comprising membership of the Group’s medical expenses 
plan, a car and related benefits and with office facilities.  On 30 May 2008 Lord Kalms voluntarily lapsed his 
remaining rights attaching to approved share options unexercised at the date of his retirement from the 
Board.  He is no longer eligible to participate in discretionary share schemes or in any bonus arrangements.  
John Clare retired from the Board on 5 September 2007.  In accordance with the rules of the Sharesave 
Scheme, John Clare was entitled to exercise his five year scheme from 2003 within six months of the date of 
his retirement.  Subject in all cases to the satisfaction of the performance conditions attached to each award 
under the LTIP scheme, John Clare was entitled to a pro-rata award at the end of the original vesting period.

FTSE 350 Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening nancial year ends. 
For the 2005 award John Clare was entitled to two-thirds of the award, which did not meet its applicable 
performance target and has therefore lapsed.  For the 2006 award, John Clare is entitled to a maximum  
of one-third of the LTIP award which vests in 2009.  
Various options granted under the executive share option scheme between 1999 and 2003 lapsed six 
months after retirement without exercise and the 2003 and 2005 awards have lapsed as the applicable 
performance targets have not been met.  For the 2006 award he will be eligible to one third of any award 
which vests in 2009 subject to achievement of the performance conditions.  Throughout the period under 
review John Clare was appointed a non-executive director of Hammerson plc and was paid a fee at the  
rate of £59,000 per annum.

Statement	 of	 Directors’	 Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.  They are required to prepare accounts for the Group in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and have chosen to 
prepare unconsolidated company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).
In the case of the consolidated IFRS financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows.  This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and 
Presentation of Financial Statements”.  In almost all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable IFRSs.  The directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; and
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
financial position and financial performance.
In the case of the unconsolidated Company financial statements prepared under UK GAAP , the directors are 
required by UK company law to prepare financial statements which give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company for each financial period as at the end of that financial period and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period.  
In preparing both the consolidated Group financial statements and the unconsolidated Company financial 
statements, suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently, and reasonable and 
prudent judgements and estimates have been made.  Applicable accounting standards have been followed.  
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for maintaining adequate accounting records and sufficient internal controls to 
safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud or any other irregularities and for the 
preparation of a Directors’ Report and directors’ Remuneration Report which comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 1985.
Responsibility	 statement	 We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
the Group and unconsolidated Company financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and (loss) / profit of the Group and Company, respectively; and
the business and financial review includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

To	 the	 members	 of	 DSG	 international	 plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of DSG international plc for the 53 weeks ended 3 May 2008 
which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and 
expense, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 
34.  These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.  We have 
also audited the information in the directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of DSG international plc for the  
53 weeks ended 3 May 2008.  
 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.   
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions  
we have formed.
Respective	 responsibilities	 of	 directors	 and	 auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the directors’ Remuneration Report and  
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, whether 
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards Regulation (IAS Regulation) No 1606/2002 and 
whether the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group financial statements.  The information 
given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business and Financial 
Review and the Corporate Responsibility Review that is cross referred from the Business and Operating 
Review section of the Directors’ Report.  In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not.  We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statement on 
internal control covers all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements.  We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group 
financial statements.  Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.  
Independent	 Auditors’	 Report 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 67
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
Basis	 of	 audit	 opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued  
by the Auditing Practices Board.  An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to  
the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration 
Report described as having been audited.  It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates  
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of  
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we 
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
Group financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been 
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.  In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial 
statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by  
the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 3 May 2008 and of its loss for the period  
then ended; 
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; 
the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Separate	 opinion	 in	 relation	 to	 IFRS	 As explained in note 1 of the Group financial statements, the Group, in addition to complying with its legal 
obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also complied with the IFRSs as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.  In our opinion the Group financial statements give 
a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 3 May 2008 and of its 
loss for the period then ended.

1	 Accounting	 policies
1.1	 Basis	 of	 preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRS.  
The directors consider that the “underlying” performance measures, together with the associated income 
statement  presentation, provide additional useful information for shareholders on underlying performance  
of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.  Such measures 
exclude the amortisation of acquired intangibles, net restructuring and business impairment charges and 
other one-off items, profit on sale of investments, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments and, 
where applicable, discontinued operations.  These measures are not recognised profit measures under  
IFRS and may not be directly comparable with “adjusted” profit measures used by other companies.  
During the period, the Group adopted the following new standards:
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the associated amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial 
Statements: Capital Disclosures.  IFRS 7 replaces the disclosure requirements of IAS 32 by introducing new 
disclosures to increase the information provided about financial instruments and risk exposures.  The 
presentation requirements of IAS 32 remain unchanged.  The IAS 1 amendment introduces new disclosures 
about the management of capital.
The principal accounting policies are set out below:
1.2	 Accounting	 convention	 and	 basis	 of	 consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company.  Control is achieved where the Company has the power to control the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.  The results of subsidiaries 
acquired are included from the date on which power to control passes.  The net assets of subsidiaries 
acquired are recorded at their fair values.  The results of subsidiaries disposed of are included up to the 
effective date of disposal.  
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting from the date on which the power  
to exercise significant influence passes.  
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
1.3	 Revenue	 Revenue comprises sales of goods and services excluding sales taxes.  Revenue from sales of goods is 
recognised at the point of sale or, where later, upon delivery to the customer and is stated net of returns.  
Revenue earned from customer support agreements is recognised as such over the life of the agreement  
by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.  
1.4	 Other	 income,	 including	 non	 operating	 income	 Other income which is incidental to the Group’s principal activities of selling goods and services and 
accordingly is not recorded as part of revenue, is recognised when the Group obtains the right to 
consideration by performance of its contractual obligations.  Interest income is accrued on a time basis,  
by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.  Dividend income  
from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established.
Notes	 to	 the	 Financial	 Statements 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 73
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
1.5	 Discontinued	 operations	 A discontinued operation is a component of the Group which represents a significant separate line of 
business which has been sold.  Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or earlier if 
beneficial title and risk has transferred to the purchaser and in the case of a business acquired exclusively 
with a view to subsequent disposal, on the date of acquisition.  
1.6	 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks  
and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  The determination of the classification of property leases is made 
by reference to the land and buildings elements separately.  All leases not classified as finance leases are 
operating leases.
Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their fair value on acquisition or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease and depreciated over 
their estimated useful lives or the lease term if shorter.  The corresponding obligation to the lessor is included 
in the balance sheet as a liability.  Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction 
of the lease obligation.  Finance charges are charged to the income statement over the period of the lease  
in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating property leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the fixed term of the lease.  At the end of the fixed term of leases, rental payments are reset to 
market rates, typically on an upwards only basis.  
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.7	 Translation	 of	 foreign	 currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction 
date.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  Exchange gains and losses arising on settlement or retranslation 
of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the income statement.  
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange during 
the period.  Exchange differences resulting from the translation of the results and balance sheets of overseas 
subsidiary undertakings are charged or credited directly to retained earnings.  Such translation differences become 
recognised in the income statement in the period in which the subsidiary undertaking is disposed.
As the cumulative translation differences for all foreign subsidiaries were deemed to be zero at the transition 
date to IFRS on 2 May 2004, upon disposal of a foreign subsidiary, any gain or loss arising will include only 
those foreign exchange gains or losses attributable to periods after that date.
1.8	 Goodwill
On acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, the fair value of the consideration is allocated between the identifiable 
net tangible and intangible assets / liabilities on a fair value basis, with any excess consideration representing 
goodwill.  Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill on the balance sheet; goodwill relating  
to associates is capitalised in investments in associates as part of the carrying value of the associate.
Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is reviewed annually for impairment.  Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.  
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the gain or loss on disposal.

1.9	 Intangible	 assets	 Acquired intangibles
Acquired intangibles comprise brands and customer lists purchased as part of acquisitions of businesses 
and are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight-line basis.  Acquired 
intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for 
impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.  Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets  
on a straight-line basis between three and 30 years.
Other intangible assets: computer software
Computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred both to acquire and bring into use the 
specific software.  Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives of between three and seven years.  Costs associated with developing or maintaining 
computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred unless they increase the future economic 
benefits of the asset, in which case they are capitalised.
Internally generated computer software is capitalised at cost if the project is technically and commercially 
feasible and the economic benefits which are expected to be generated exceed one year.  The expenditure 
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.  
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the 
specific asset to which it relates.  Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight-line 
basis between three and seven years.
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for 
impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.
1.10	 Property,	 plant	 &	 equipment
Property, plant & equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and, where appropriate, 
provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.  Depreciation is provided to write off the  
cost of the assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives.  The rates used are:
Short leasehold property  – over the term of the lease
Freehold and long leasehold buildings  – between 1
2
/ 3% and 2½% per annum
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  – between 10% and 33
1
/ 3% per annum
No depreciation is provided on freehold and long leasehold land or on assets in the course of construction.
Property, plant & equipment is assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that 
could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value is not supportable.  Where assets are to be taken  
out of use, an impairment charge is levied.  Where assets’ useful lives are shortened, an estimate is made of 
their new lives and an accelerated depreciation charge is levied.  Where the property, plant & equipment  
form part of a separate cash generating unit (CGU) the recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by 
calculating its value in use.  The value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to 
management’s projection of future profitability and any impairment is determined by comparing the carrying 
value with the value in use.

1.11	 Investments	 and	 other	 financial	 assets
The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and those 
receivables which involve a contractual right to receive cash from external parties.  Financial assets comprise 
all items shown in notes 14, 15 and 16 with the exception of prepayments.  Under the classifications 
stipulated by IAS 39, short term investments and trade and other receivables, (excluding derivative financial 
assets) are classified as “available for sale” and “loans and receivables”, respectively.  Cash and cash 
equivalents and derivative financial instruments, which are further described in notes 1.14 and 1.16, are 
classified as “loans and receivables” and “held for trading unless designated in a hedge relationship”, 
respectively.
Investment in associates
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting from the date on which the power to 
exercise significant influence passes.  All purchases and sales of investments and other financial assets are 
recognised on the date that the Group becomes committed to make such purchase or sale (“the trade date”).  
Short term investments
Investments are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently remeasured to fair value at each 
balance sheet date owing to occasional sales of such investments.  The fair value of unlisted investments is 
estimated either by comparing recent arm’s length transactions or by using discounted cash flow analysis  
or other modelling techniques.  Gains and losses arising from revaluation at the balance sheet date are 
recognised directly in equity.  For unlisted investments a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value  
of the investment below its cost is considered evidence of impairment.
To the extent that any fair value losses are deemed permanent, such impairment is recognised in the income 
statement.  Upon sale or impairment of the investments, any cumulative gains or losses held in equity are 
transferred to the income statement.  
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables (excluding derivative financial assets) are recorded at cost less an allowance for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts and any other adjustments required to align cost to fair value.  The carrying 
amount of trade receivables is reduced through the use of a provision account.  A provision for bad and 
doubtful debts is made for specific receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group will not  
be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.  Receivables that are not 
assessed individually for impairment are assessed for impairment on a collective basis using ageing analysis 
to determine the required provision.  Bad debts are written off when identified.
1.12	 Taxation	 Current taxation
Current taxation is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using prevailing tax rates 
and adjusted for any tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.  Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  No provision is made for tax 
which would have been payable on the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries or associated 
undertakings, unless the distribution of such earnings has been accrued in the balance sheet.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the 
same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged  
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which  
the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted,  
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
1.13	 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost and net realisable value.  Cost comprises direct purchase 
cost and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition, both types of cost being measured using a weighted average cost formula.  Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated and directly attributable costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.  
1.14	 Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid 
deposits with a maturity of three months or less and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes  
in value.  Bank overdrafts, which form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow 
statement, are shown under current liabilities.
1.15	 Borrowings	 and	 other	 financial	 liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are those which involve a contractual obligation to deliver cash to external 
parties at a future date.  Financial liabilities comprise all items shown in notes 17, 18 and 19 with the exception 
of other taxation and social security, accruals and deferred income from customer support agreements, other 
deferred income and other non financial creditors.  Under the classifications stipulated by IAS 39, borrowings, 
finance lease obligations and trade and other payables (excluding derivative financial liabilities) are classified 
as “financial liabilities measured at amortised cost”.  Derivative financial instruments, which are described 
further in note 1.16 below, are classified as “held for trading unless designated in a hedge relationship”.  
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.  
Transaction costs are amortised through the income statement using the effective interest method and the 
unamortised balance is included as part of the related borrowing at the balance sheet date.  A fair value 
adjustment is made to the borrowing where hedge accounting, as described in note 1.16 below, has been applied.  
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables (excluding derivative financial liabilities) are recorded at cost.  Derivative financial 
instruments, which includes put options over equity held by minority shareholders, are initially recorded at  
fair value and then subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and are held within 
assets or liabilities as appropriate.  Gains and losses arising from revaluation at the balance sheet date are 
recognised in the income statement unless the derivatives are designated as hedges and such hedges are 
proved to be effective.

1.16	 Derivative	 financial	 instruments	 and	 hedge	 accounting
Derivative financial instruments held by the Group are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value 
within assets or liabilities as appropriate and then subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance 
sheet date.  Gains and losses arising from revaluation at the balance sheet date are recognised in the income 
statement unless the derivatives are designated as hedges and such hedges are proved to be effective.  
Derivatives are classified as non-current assets or liabilities where a hedge relationship is identified and the 
remaining maturity of the hedged item is greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date.  Derivatives  
are classified as current assets or liabilities in all other circumstances.
Fair values are derived from market values.  The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets  
is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.  
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks associated with changes in interest rates and 
foreign currency exchange rates.  The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate 
swaps, options, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts to hedge these risks.  The Group 
does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where hedge accounting is to be applied, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective  
and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, 
or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting.
The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting is dependent on how they are 
designated.  The different designations and accounting treatments are explained below:
Fair value hedges
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets 
and liabilities.
 
Derivative financial instruments that meet the “fair value” hedging requirements are recognised in the balance 
sheet at fair value with corresponding fair value movements recognised within finance income / costs in the 
income statement.  For an effective fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value 
attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement.  To the extent 
that the designated hedge relationship is effective, such amounts in the income statement offset each  
other.  As a result, only the ineffective element of any designated hedging relationship impacts the income 
statement.  If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the hedged item for which the effective interest method is used, is amortised to the income 
statement over the period to maturity.
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure on inventory 
ordered and purchased and certain sales of inventory.  It is Group policy to hedge between 80% and  
100% of committed purchase orders and sales.  At any point in time the Group also hedges up to 80%  
of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast purchases and sales for the subsequent  
12 months.  Orders and purchases as well as sales are each considered to be separate hedge transactions.  
Derivative financial instruments that qualify for such cash flow hedging are initially recognised on the balance 
sheet with gains and losses relating to the remeasurement of the effective portion of the hedge being 
deferred in equity.  To the extent that such items are ineffectively hedged, gains or losses relating to the 
ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement.  Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the 
income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss (i.e. when a purchase or sale is made).

For inventory purchases, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been 
recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of inventory.  For sales, the gains or losses on the 
derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the income statement in the period in 
which the sale is made.  
Net investment hedges
The Group uses currency forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge its currency risk on the translation 
of net investments in foreign entities.  Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of the investments and  
the related derivatives are recognised in equity.  However, this is on the basis that the hedging requirements 
of IAS 39 are met and the hedging relationship is effective.  To the extent that such items are ineffectively 
hedged, gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised within the income statement.  
1.17	 Retirement	 benefit	 obligations
Company contributions to defined contribution pension schemes and contributions made to state pension 
schemes for certain overseas employees are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis as 
contributions become payable.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the regular service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees 
during the period, together with the cost of any benefits relating to past service is charged to operating profit 
in the period.  A credit representing the expected return on assets of the retirement benefit schemes during 
the year is included within other finance income.  This is based on the market value of the assets of the 
schemes at the start of the financial period.  A charge is included within other finance costs, representing  
the expected increase in the liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes during the period.  The difference 
between the market value of the assets and the present value of the accrued pension liabilities is shown as 
an asset or liability in the balance sheet.  Differences between the actual and expected returns on assets 
during the period are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense, together with 
differences arising from changes in actuarial assumptions.
1.18	 Share-based	 payments	 The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees which are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant.  This fair value is expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest as adjusted for  
any non-market conditions.
A liability equal to the portion of services received from employees is recognised at the current fair value 
determined at each balance sheet date for cash settled share-based payments.
1.19	 Estimates,	 judgements	 and	 critical	 accounting	 policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Significant items subject to such assumptions and 
estimates include the useful lives of assets; the measurement and recognition of provisions; the recognition 
of deferred tax assets; and liabilities for potential corporation tax.  Actual results could differ from these 
estimates and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on income at the time such updated 
information becomes available.  The most critical accounting policies in determining the financial condition 
and results of the Group are those requiring the greatest degree of subjective or complex judgements.   
These relate to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, lease costs, the valuation of goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets, share-based payments, post-retirement benefits and taxation, and are set out below.
Notes	 to	 the	 Financial	 Statements	 continued 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 79
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
Revenue recognition
Revenue earned from the sale of customer support agreements is recognised over the term of the  
contracts when the Group obtains the right to consideration by performance of its contractual obligations.  
Performance of these contractual obligations is determined by reference to extensive historical claims data.  
Reliance on historical data assumes that current and future experience will follow past trends.  The directors 
consider that the quantity and quality of data available provides an appropriate proxy for current trends.
Inventory valuation
Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value.  Net realisable value includes, 
where necessary, provisions for slow moving and damaged inventory.  The provision represents the 
difference between the cost of stock and its estimated market value, based on ageing.  Calculation of these 
provisions requires judgements to be made which include forecast consumer demand, the promotional, 
competitive and economic environment and inventory loss trends.
Provisions and accruals for onerous leases
If the Group vacates a store or other property prior to the expiry of the related lease, it records a provision  
for the expected lease payments that the Group will incur prior to assignment or sublease of the property.  
Such a calculation requires a judgement as to the timing and duration of the expected vacancy periods and 
the amount and timing of future potential sublease income.  When making these judgements, the directors 
consider a number of factors, including the landlord, the location and condition of the property, the terms of 
the lease, the specific marketplace demand and the economic environment.
Goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment impairment reviews
Goodwill is required to be valued annually to assess the requirement for potential impairment.  Other  
assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to  
the conclusion that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable.  Impairment testing on goodwill  
is carried out in accordance with the analyses described in note 9.  Such calculations require judgement 
relating to the appropriate discount factors and long term growth prevalent in a particular market as well as 
short and medium term business plans.  The directors draw upon experience as well as external resources  
in making these judgements.
In assessing impairment of intangible assets and property, plant & equipment discounted cash flow methods 
are used as described in note 1.10.  Judgement is required in determining the appropriate discount factors  
as well as the short and medium term business plans.  As for goodwill, the directors draw upon experience 
and external resources in making these judgements.  
Share-based payments
The charge for share-based payments is calculated in accordance with the analysis described in note 25.  
The option valuation models used require highly subjective assumptions to be made including the future 
volatility of the Company’s share price, expected dividend yields, risk-free interest rates and expected staff 
turnover.  The directors draw upon a variety of external sources to aid in the determination of the appropriate 
data to use in such calculations.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The surplus or deficit in the UK defined benefit scheme that is recognised through the statement of 
recognised income and expense is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties.  The calculated 
liabilities of the scheme are based on assumptions regarding salary increases, inflation rates, discount rates, 
the long term expected return on the scheme’s assets and member longevity.  Details of the assumptions 
used are shown in note 27.  Such assumptions are based on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against 
similar pension schemes.

Taxation
Tax laws that apply to the Group’s businesses may be amended by the relevant authorities, for example as  
a result of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities.  Such potential amendments and their application  
to the Group are regularly monitored and the requirement for recognition of any liabilities assessed where 
necessary.  The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of different jurisdictions and judgement is 
required in determining the appropriate provision for transactions where the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain.  In such circumstances, the Group recognises liabilities for anticipated taxes due based on best 
information available and where the anticipated liability is probable and estimable.  Where the final outcome 
of such matters differs from the amounts initially recorded, any differences will impact the income tax and 
deferred tax provisions in the period to which such determination is made.  Where the potential liabilities are 
not considered probable, the amount at risk is disclosed unless an adverse outcome is considered remote.  
Deferred tax is recognised on taxable losses based on the expected ability to utilise such losses.  This ability 
takes account of the business plans for the relevant companies, potential uncertainties around the longer 
term aspects of these business plans, any expiry of taxable benefits and potential future volatility in the local 
tax regimes.  
1.20	 New	 accounting	 standards	 and	 interpretations
During the period, the following new standards which are applicable to the Group were published, but do not 
become effective until future accounting periods:
IFRS 8 Operating Segments.  IFRS 8 adopts a management approach to segmental reporting requiring 
the identification of operating segments based on internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker 
and extends the scope and disclosure requirements of IAS 14 Segmental Reporting.  It is effective for 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and will have no impact on the net results or net assets  
of the Group.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements.  This revises the presentation of non-owner changes 
in equity and introduces a statement of comprehensive income.  It is effective for periods beginning on  
or after 1 January 2009 and is not expected to have an impact on the net results, net assets or disclosures 
of the Group.
IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs.  This removes the option of immediately recognising as an expense 
borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial time to prepare for use.  It therefore requires 
an entity to capitalise borrowing costs as part of the costs of such assets.  It is effective for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and will have no impact on the net results or net assets of the Group.  
IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations and IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements.  IFRS 3 Revised introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business 
combinations that will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an 
acquisition occurs and the future reported results.  IAS 27 Revised requires that a change in the ownership 
interest of a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction.  These changes must be applied 
prospectively and will affect future acquisitions and transactions with minority interests.  The revised 
standards are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Certain interpretations were issued during the period which either do not apply to the Group or are not 
expected to have any material effect.

2	 Segmental	 analysis	 The Group is managed and reported according to three operating divisions: Computing, Electricals  
and e-commerce.  
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information.  The principal 
activities of each division are as follows:
the Computing division is engaged in the retail and business to business sale of computer hardware and 
software, associated peripherals and services and related financial and after-sales services.  The division 
operates in the UK and Southern Europe (which also includes the small Nordic operations).  Results  
for 2006/07 include the activities of the Group’s store based operations in France, which the Group 
announced its withdrawal from in that financial year.  Any closure costs arising in 2007/08 have been 
categorised as non-underlying;
the Electricals division is engaged in the retail sale of high technology consumer electronics, domestic 
appliances, photographic equipment and related financial and after-sales services.  The division operates 
in the UK, Ireland, the Nordic region, Southern Europe and Central Europe; and
the e-commerce division is engaged in the online retail sale of high technology consumer electronics, 
domestic appliances, photographic equipment and related financial and after-sales services.  The division 
operates in the UK, Ireland, the Nordic region, Southern Europe and Central Europe.
During the period management responsibility for a small business services related part of the business was 
transferred from the Computing division to the Electricals division.  Comparative figures have been restated 
to reflect this change in responsibility.
Corporate centre & shared services assets and liabilities comprise mainly freehold land and buildings, 
investments, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, net retirement benefit obligations, intersegment 
adjustments and eliminations and related tax assets and liabilities.  The income statement for Corporate 
centre & shared services includes intersegment eliminations.
The Group’s secondary reporting segments are geographical and comprise four territories: the UK & Ireland, 
the Nordic region, Southern Europe and Central Europe.  There were no material exports from the locations 
in which the Group operates.

  Property charges comprise onerous lease costs.  Asset impairments relate to intangible assets and  
items of property, plant & equipment which are to be eliminated from the business over a shorter period 
than their current useful expected lives and inventories.  Impairments relating to intangible assets and 
property, plant & equipment comprise a combination of asset write offs and incremental accelerated 
depreciation charges associated with the economic useful life of these assets being shortened and for 
which incremental charges of £17.7 million are expected to be spread over the next two financial periods.  
Other charges predominantly comprise employee severance (2006/07 also included certain incremental 
transition costs).
  The Italian business impairment relates to UniEuro S.p.A.  (UniEuro).  Goodwill is discussed further  
in note 9.  Other asset impairments comprise other intangible assets, property, plant & equipment  
and inventory.  Such impairments relate to assets in individual under performing stores connected  
with impairment reviews of the relevant businesses and for which either stores have been deemed  
impaired or are to be closed.  Other charges relate predominantly to employee severance.
(ii)  Effect of changes in pension benefits: 2006/07 related to the change in benefits accruing to members of 
the UK defined benefit pension scheme following changes in legislation concerning lump sums allowed 
on retirement (commutations).
(iii)  Profit on sale of investments: Relates to the sale of a small minority shareholding which had been held  
at £nil in the Balance Sheet.
(iv)  Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: Items excluded 
from underlying finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation 
of derivative financial instruments under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on  
an accruals basis (the basis upon which all other items in the financial statements is prepared).  Also 
included within this amount are remeasurement losses relating to put options predominantly held by 
minority shareholders.  Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption 
that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.  
  Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors’ view also conflict with both the commercial 
reasons for entering into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement  
in the majority of cases would amount to speculative use of derivatives.

The effective tax rate on underlying earnings of 31% (2006/07 30%) is expected to fall in future periods  
due to decreases in effective UK and overseas tax rates.  The Group has total unrecognised tax losses  
of £57.1 million (28 April 2007 £63.7 million) of which £13.9 million (28 April 2007 £18.7 million) have no time 
restriction over when they can be utilised.  The Group has unrecognised time restricted tax losses of  
£43.2 million (28 April 2007 £45.0 million) for which the weighted average period over which they can be 
utilised is six years (28 April 2007 five years).  
The effect on the income statement of changes in tax rates, which resulted in an adjustment to deferred tax 
asset carrying values, was a charge of a £6.2 million (2006/07 £nil) which predominantly relates to the UK 
and Italy.

Other deferred tax assets predominantly comprise the recognition of trading losses carried forward.  
The Group has provided deferred tax of £0.4 million (2006/07 £7.3 million) in relation to temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and the income tax consequences of paying dividends.  In all 
other cases, the Group has determined that the undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed 
in the foreseeable future.  The deferred tax which has not been recognised for the taxes which would be 
payable on the undistributed earnings of the Group’s investment in subsidiaries is £27.3 million (2006/07 
£45.9 million).
As a result of share disposals, allowable losses have been incurred which are available for offset against 
certain future chargeable gains.  A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as 
it is considered that there is insufficient evidence that chargeable gains will arise.  The deferred tax asset not 
recognised, measured at the standard rate of 28%, is not less than £351.3 million (28 April 2007 £360 million).  
Where applicable, certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset for financial reporting purposes.

Additions in the period relate mainly to the exercise of a put option held by a minority shareholder in 
Kotsovolos as described further in note 22 and which resulted in a further 10% of Kotsovolos being acquired.  
As required by IFRS 3, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.  These reviews are carried out using 
the following criteria.  An amount of goodwill is attributed to each specific acquisition.  Such acquisitions are 
determined to be a “Cash Generating Unit” (CGU) as determined by IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”.  The 
recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on calculating its value in use.  The value in use  
is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to management’s own projections covering a  
five year period.  Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate 
equivalent to the relevant market’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  The value in use is compared to the 
carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.  
The impairment charge in the current year relates predominantly to UniEuro (2006/07 UniEuro) and is 
discussed further below.  
The most significant components of goodwill relate to Elkjøp Nordic AS (Elkjøp), UniEuro S.p.A. (UniEuro)  
and FotoVista S.A.S. (FotoVista).  In addition to management’s five year projections, the key assumptions 
used in calculating value in use as well as the carrying values are:
    2008   2007
   Key assumptions                          Key assumptions 
    Pre tax risk   Pre tax risk

Elkjøp   2.5% 11.4% 585.5 2.2% 11.1% 516.3
UniEuro   1.2% 12.7% 129.0 1.4% 12.9% 325.9
FotoVista   2.3% 13.7% 162.5 1.8% 13.3% 141.9
The growth rate beyond five years is based on GDP for the territories in which these businesses operate.  
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital with  
a risk premium reflecting the relative risks in the markets in which the businesses operate.

9	 Goodwill continued
Management’s five year projections have been prepared on the basis of strategic plans, knowledge of the 
market, performance of competitors and management’s views on achievable growth in market share over  
the longer term.  
For UniEuro, the continuing weakness in the Italian economy highlighted by poor trading in the current 
period, coupled with further increased competition in the market has caused the directors to further revise 
significantly the projections for the five year period referred to above and which has been used to assess 
impairment in previous financial periods.  As a result of this revision, an impairment loss of £246.2 million  
has been recognised in the current period.  
Sensitivities
A sensitivity analysis had been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill.  
The directors have concluded that in the case of Elkjøp there are no reasonably possible changes in key 
assumptions which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.  In the case  
of UniEuro and FotoVista, it is reasonably possible that a change in key assumptions could occur over the 
course of the next financial period.  
UniEuro
In respect of management’s five year projections, a decrease of 5.0% in the compound annual growth rate  
in pre tax profits over this five year period would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in 
use by £1.6 million.  In addition, the five year projections are sensitive to the level and timing of cost reduction 
initiatives built into the five year compound annual growth rate in pre tax profits.  An average reduction of 
10% per annum in such savings over that five year period would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in  
use by £3.5 million.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 0.1% and an increase in the pre tax adjusted discount rate 
of 0.1% would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use by £1.2 million and £1.7 million, respectively.
FotoVista
In respect of management’s five year projections, a 1.0% decrease in compound annual growth rate would 
cause the current headroom of £26.6 million to erode by £7.9 million.  
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 0.1% and an increase in the pre tax adjusted discount rate 
of 0.1% would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use by £1.7 million and £2.7 million, respectively.

The following table sets out the fair values of financial assets and liabilities excluding derivative financial 
instruments, which are shown separately.  For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating 
rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.  For receivables and 
payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be 
equivalent to book value.  The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy 
are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15.

Included in derivative financial instruments are forward foreign currency contracts, options, interest rate 
swaps and currency swaps.  The interest rate swaps of the Group carry fixed interest rates of 6.125%  
(28 April 2007 6.125%) and floating rates of LIBOR.  The currency swaps carry fixed rates ranging from 3.46% 
to 5.99% (28 April 2007 4.60% to 5.72%) and the main floating rates are based on EURIBOR and LIBOR 
which ranged between 5.14% and 7.37% (28 April 2007 4.90% to 6.52%).
The Group holds options to acquire equity stakes in other businesses which are recorded at £nil  
(28 April 2007 £nil) owing to the option prices being at or above their current market value.
(c)	 Hedging	 activities
The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies by 
entering predominantly into forward foreign exchange currency contracts.  It also uses swaps and options  
to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange translation exposure.  The Group designates financial 
instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows:
Cash flow hedges
At 3 May 2008 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of  
£351.5 million (28 April 2007 £541.5 million) that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.  The  
fair value of these currency derivatives, which have been deferred in equity amounts to a £1.5 million loss  
(28 April 2007 £2.7 million loss).  In respect of contracts which matured during the period, losses of  
£11.5 million and profits of £6.4 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity 
into operating profit, respectively (2006/07 losses of £3.1 million and £5.4 million have been transferred  
out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively).  
No significant hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement (2006/07 £nil).
Fair value hedges
At 3 May 2008 and 28 April 2007 the Group had interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of  
£300 million whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and pays a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a 
spread on the notional amount with a November 2012 maturity.  The swaps are used to hedge the exposure 
to changes in the fair value of the Bonds and have the same critical terms.  The fair value of interest rate 
swaps entered into as fair value hedges is a liability of £0.1 million (28 April 2007 a liability of £5.9 million).   
A fair value loss on the interest rate swaps of £5.6 million (2006/07 gain of £9.6 million) has been recognised 
in the income statement and offset by an equivalent fair value gain on the Bonds.
Hedge of net investments in foreign operations
At 3 May 2008 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps in place with  
a notional value of £858.1 million (28 April 2007 £827.7 million) which have been designated as a hedge of  
the net investments in foreign operations.  Gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are 
transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the foreign 
operations.  The fair value of currency derivatives entered into as net investment hedges is a £104.9 million 
loss (2006/07 £5.9 million loss).  
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement (2006/07 £nil).

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.  
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The principal sterling interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect of the Group’s net cash and investments, 
and interest based credit commission.  Each is based on floating interest rates and the two elements provide a 
degree of natural hedge against each other.  Sterling cash and investments include £66.5 million (28 April 2007 
£111.2 million) of restricted funds which predominantly comprise funds held under trust to fund customer 
support agreement liabilities.  Sterling floating rate assets comprise floating rate notes together with cash and 
commercial paper.  Sterling fixed rate assets comprise money market deposits.  Sterling floating rate borrowings 
comprise bank overdrafts and £50 million of the Bonds that bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.  The 
remaining £250 million of the Bonds have been swapped into floating rate euro borrowings.  After taking  
account of interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, no sterling borrowings carry interest at fixed rates  
(28 April 2007 none).
Notes	 to	 the	 Financial	 Statements	 continued 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 105
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
Floating rate euro borrowings comprise £250 million of the Bonds swapped into EURIBOR and bank 
borrowings.  These borrowings provide a hedge against certain euro denominated fixed asset investments 
and to finance working capital.  After taking account of interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, no euro 
borrowings carry interest at fixed rates (28 April 2007 none).
Amounts in respect of other currencies relate to funds held within subsidiary companies, operating in the 
Nordic region and Central Europe.  
(e)	 Sensitivity	 analysis
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to 
changes in specified market variables.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Group’s profit before tax due to changes in the value of monetary 
assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.  Changes in exchange rates affect the Group’s total 
equity due to changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment 
hedges.  The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Group’s key 
currencies, with other variables held constant.

Euro    ±10% 1.2 41.5 2.4 41.6
Changes in interest rates affect the Group’s profit before tax, mainly due to the impact of floating rate 
borrowings, cash and derivative financial instruments.  Changes in interest rates affect the Group’s total 
equity, due to the impact of changes’ in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as 
cashflow hedges.  The table below shows the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, 
with other variables held constant.

Sterling    ±1.0% (3.7) 0.1 (12.8) 0.3
Euro    ±1.0% 1.9 0.4 12.5 (0.4)
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
the balance of borrowings, investments and the derivative portfolio are all held constant for the whole year;
the effect of changes in interest rates on total equity relates only to derivative financial instruments as the 
carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities does not change as interest rates change;
changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges arising 
from movements in interest rates and exchange rates are fully recorded in equity;
changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges 
arising from movements in interest rates are recorded in the income statement.  The impact of movements 
in exchange rates are recorded directly in equity; and
changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments that are not in hedging relationships 
arising from movements in interest rates and exchange rates only affect the income statement to the 
extent that they are not offset by changes in an underlying transaction.

Minority interests for 2007/08 comprise shareholdings in DSGi South-East Europe A.E.V.E. (Kotsovolos), 
FotoVista and Electroworld Iç ve Dis Ticaret AS (ElectroWorld Turkey) (2006/07 comprised shareholdings  
in Kotsovolos and FotoVista).  Included in other reserves is a reduction of £15.6 million which relates to the 
exercise on 24 May 2007 of a put option held by Fourlis Holding SA, the main minority shareholders of 
Kotsovolos, whereby the Group acquired a further 10% for this amount increasing its stake from 79.1% to 
89.1%.  Transfers between retained earnings and other reserves of £8.4 million (2006/07 £9.3 million) relate  
to the fair value remeasurements of put options predominantly held by a minority shareholder.  
In 2006/07, a transfer of £425.5 million between other reserves and retained earnings was made.  This relates 
to amounts within capital reserves which were reclassified as available for distribution as further described 
below in note 22(c).  A transfer of £20.8 million was made between minority interests and other reserves to 
better classify the initial valuation of a put option held by a minority shareholder.

The merger reserve arose on the Group reconstruction which occurred during 1999/00.  The Group 
reconstruction took the form of introducing a new parent company above the existing Group and the merger 
reserve represents the difference between the capital structure of the new parent company and that of the 
former parent company.
The capital reserves as at 30 April 2006 and 28 April 2007 comprised a capital reduction reserve of  
£425.5 million which arose on the Group reconstruction in 1999/00 referred to above with the balance  
relating to a capital redemption reserve.  Following approval by the Court on 2 April 2007 the capital  
reduction reserve was reclassified as available for distribution to shareholders and as a result was  
transferred to retained earnings.  
Own shares held by the Group represent shares in the Company held by Halifax EES Trustees International 
Limited further details of which are given in note 24.  The 2,233,063 shares held at 3 May 2008 had a market 
value of £1.5 million (28 April 2007 2,233,063 shares held had a market value of £3.6 million) and their nominal 
value was £0.1 million (28 April 2007 £0.1 million).  
Transfers to the revaluation reserve represents the valuation of put options held predominantly by a minority

24	 Employee	 share	 ownership	 trusts
Halifax EES Trustees International Limited is the trustee of a number of employee share ownership trusts (the 
Trusts).  At 3 May 2008, the Trusts held shares in the Company for the purposes of satisfying potential awards 
to specified executive directors and senior employees under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).  Details of 
the LTIP are given in the Remuneration Report in section (b)(ii).  Movements in the number of shares held by 
the Trusts is shown in the table below.
The Company’s aim is to hedge its obligations under the LTIP by buying shares through the Trusts to meet 
the anticipated future liability.  The anticipated liability is regularly reassessed during the relevant performance 
period and additional shares are purchased when required to meet an increase in this liability.  The costs of 
funding and administering the Trusts are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.  
Shareholders’ funds are reduced by the net book value of shares held in the Trusts which have not vested 
unconditionally.

Share	 option	 plans
Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
Options are granted annually to executive directors and other senior executives over shares having a market 
value at the time of grant equal to twice their basic salary.  Prior to 2005/06, options were also granted to 
other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade and to further employees with 
more than three years’ service.  Vesting of options is based upon the level of growth in underlying diluted 
earnings per share (EPS) over a three year period, with the ability to exercise the options up to seven years 
after the vesting date.
Save As You Earn (SAYE)
The Group offers to all of its UK and Irish employees having completed the relevant period of service, share-
based savings plans whereby amounts may be contributed up to a specified limit per plan and per employee.  
Three year and five year plans have been offered annually, with exercise prices set at a 20% discount to the 
market share price on the date of grant.  Exercise is conditional upon employees remaining employed by the 
Group for the full term of the plan.  Employees can choose to withdraw their contributions in full from the plan 
at any time, together with any interest earned.

The fair value of such equity settled share-based payments granted is estimated as at the date of grant  
using either the Binomial option pricing model or Monte Carlo simulation taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted.  The following table lists the inputs to the models used 
for the periods ended 3 May 2008 and 28 April 2007.

(ii)	 Cash	 settled	 Awards are granted to employees annually on the basis of a monetary amount determined by grade and 
length of service.  Employees must remain in employment until the vesting date which occurs on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant.  The vesting of such share-based payments for employees above a certain 
grade is determined based on the level of growth in EPS over a three year period.  Such awards are settled in 
cash which is calculated based on the share price at the exercise date.  The fair value of cash settled share-
based payment plans is estimated as at the date of grant using the Binomial option pricing model taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.  No cash settled awards had 
vested at 3 May 2008 (28 April 2007 none).

27	 Retirement	 benefit	 obligations
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.  
The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are 
held in a separate trustee administered fund.  The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three 
years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuary’s advice so as to spread the pension 
cost over the normal expected service lives of members.  Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit 
section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants.  Membership of the defined contribution section is 
offered to eligible employees.  
In the Nordic region, the Group operates secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life 
insurance company and an unsecured pension arrangement.  In addition, contributions are made to a state 
pension scheme.  
In other territories, the Group also provides other additional post-employment benefits.  In particular, in 
Greece and Italy, the Group has state related obligations to fund post employment benefits to employees.  
These benefits are unfunded.
(a)	 Defined	 contribution	 pension	 schemes
The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was £5.1 million (2006/07 £2.2 million).   
A further £0.1 million (2006/07 £0.1 million) provision was made in respect of the Nordic unsecured pension 
arrangement.
(b)	 UK	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 –	 actuarial	 valuation	 and	 assumptions
A full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2007 using the projected unit method 
and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.  The Group’s contribution rate for the 
period ended 3 May 2008, agreed in consultation with the trustees’ actuaries, was 12.6% (2006/07 12.9%) 
with the reduction representing a change in the mix of contributions between different sections of the 
scheme.  The contribution rate for future periods is currently planned to remain at this level, however  
a “recovery plan” has been agreed with the trustees whereby the Company is to make twice yearly 
contributions of £6.0 million commencing in June 2008 and ending in December 2012.  Since April 2007,  
the scheme has operated on a career average revalued earnings arrangement where benefits are earned  
for each year of pensionable service as opposed to being calculated with reference to salary near to  
date of retirement.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 5 April 2007 used for determining costs and contributions were:
  Rate per annum
Discount rate  – Pre retirement 6.6% 
 – Post retirement  5.2% 
Rate of increase in  – Up to April 2010 3.5% 
 pensionable salaries – Thereafter  4.5% 
Rate of increase to pensions  – Guaranteed Minimum Pension 3.0% 
 – Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.5%-3.75% 
Inflation   3.0% 
Expected return on assets  6.5%
At 5 April 2007, the market value of the scheme’s investments was £688 million and, based on the above 
assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 92% of the benefits accrued to members after 
allowing for expected future increases in earnings.  The value of liabilities exceeded assets by £61.0 million.

methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining 
funding arrangements.

Rate of increase in pensions in payment / deferred pensions   3.6% 3.0%
Inflation       3.6% 3.0%
The Group uses certain mortality rate assumptions when calculating scheme obligations.  The demographic 
assumptions used are those underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 5 April 2007.   
In particular, post retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard tables PA92 projected to 
calendar year 2008 in line with the “medium cohort” factors set out in CMI working paper 1: “interim basis  
for adjusting the “92” series mortality projections for cohort effects”, with an allowance for future mortality 
improvement in line with medium cohort projection factors.  Such tables represent an average expected 
longevity of 85.2 years for men and 88.3 years for women (2006/07 84.2 years for men and 87.4 years for 
women) for those becoming 65 at the measurement date and an extra one year of longevity for both men  
and women becoming 65 in 15 years time.  The current mortality rates include prudent allowance for future 
improvements in longevity and also take account of historical experience.

(d)	 Other	 post	 employment	 benefits	 The Group offers other post employment benefits to employees in overseas locations, including the defined 
benefit schemes in the Nordic region which are referred to above.  At 3 May 2008 the net obligation in relation 
to these benefits was £15.2 million (28 April 2007 £13.3 million).  The net movement in the obligation 
comprises a charge to operating profit of £5.9 million (2006/07 £3.4 million) with the remaining movements 
relating to the benefits paid in the period and currency retranslation.  
(e)	 Sensitivities	 The value of scheme assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.  Changes in 
assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the 
income statement and the balance sheet.  The main financial assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of 
inflation and the assumed mortality rate.  The following table provides an estimate of the potential impacts  
of each of these variables.

To	 the	 members	 of	 DSG	 international	 plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of DSG international plc for the 53 weeks ended 
3 May 2008 which comprise the balance sheet and the related notes (a) to (m).  These individual company 
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of DSG international plc for the 53 weeks 
ended 3 May 2008 and on the information in the directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.   
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective	 responsibilities	 of	 directors	 and	 auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant United 
Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair  
view and whether the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies Act 1985.  We also report as to whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.  The information given in the 
Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business and Financial Review and  
the Corporate Responsibility Review that is cross referred from the Business and Operating Review section 
of the Directors’ Report.
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we 
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by 
law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.  
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and 
consider whether it is consistent with the parent company financial statements.  We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent 
company financial statements.  Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the 
Annual Report.  
Basis	 of	 audit	 opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued  
by the Auditing Practices Board.  An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to  
the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements.  It also includes an assessment  
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we 
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the

information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 3 May 2008 and  
of its profit for the year then ended; 
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

The unconsolidated financial statements for the Company have been prepared in accordance with UK law

of UITF 44 (IFRIC Interpretation 11) FRS 20 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions (UITF 44).  The  
principal accounting policies are set out below:
(i)	 Accounting	 convention	 The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation  
of certain derivative financial instruments to fair value.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 (IFRS 7) Financial Instruments: Disclosures 
and has not disclosed information required by that standard, as the consolidated financial statements for 
DSG international plc, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group  
under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
(ii)	 Change	 in	 accounting	 policy	 and	 presentation	 of	 financial	 information
Where the Company has granted rights over its equity to employees of subsidiary undertakings in relation  
to equity settled share-based payments arrangements, UITF 44 requires recognition of the contribution  
to subsidiary undertakings.  This contribution is recognised as a movement in the investment in  
subsidiary undertaking.
(iii)	 Operating	 leases
Rentals payable under property leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments up  
to each market rent review date throughout the lease term.  Rentals payable under leases for plant and 
machinery are charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over the total lease term.
(iv)	 Share-based	 payments	 The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees which are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant.  This fair value is expensed in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest as adjusted for 
any non-market conditions.
A liability equal to the portion of services received from employees is recognised at the current fair value 
determined at each balance sheet date for cash settled share-based payments.
(v)	 Translation	 of	 foreign	 currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date.  Exchange gains and losses arising on settlement or retranslation of 
monetary assets and liabilities are included in the profit and loss account.  
(vi)	 Tangible	 fixed	 assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and, where appropriate, provision  
for impairment or estimated loss on disposal.  Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets  
by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives.  The rates used are:
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – between 10% and 33¹∕3% per annum.
Notes	 to	 the	 Parent	 Company	 Financial	 Statements 	 	 DSG	 international	 plc	 129
Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 2007/08
(vii)	 Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
(viii)	 Taxation
Current taxation
Current taxation is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using prevailing tax rates 
and adjusted for any tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided for in full on all timing differences which have not reversed at the balance sheet date.  
No provision is made for tax which would become payable on the distribution of retained profits of overseas 
subsidiaries or associated undertakings, unless the distribution of such earnings has been accrued in the 
balance sheet.  Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely 
than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
(ix)	 Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.  
Transaction costs are amortised through the income statement using the effective interest method and the 
unamortised balance is included as part of the related borrowing at the balance sheet date.  A fair value 
adjustment is made to the borrowing where hedge accounting has been applied.  
(x)	 Post	 retirement	 benefits
The expected cost of providing pensions under the defined benefit pension scheme arrangements, as 
calculated periodically by qualified actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the 
pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members in such a way that the pension cost is a 
substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable payroll.
It is not practical to allocate the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit section to individual 
companies, on a consistent and reasonable basis.  Therefore, following full implementation of FRS 17, the 
Company has accounted for its contributions to the defined benefit section of the scheme as if it were a 
defined contribution scheme.  
The Company’s contributions to the defined contribution section of the pension scheme are charged to the 
profit and loss account on an accruals basis as they become payable.
(xi)	 Derivative	 financial	 instruments	 (“derivatives”)
Derivatives are classified as current assets or liabilities when they are deemed to be held for trading.  
Derivatives are classified as non-current assets or liabilities where a hedge relationship is identified and the 
remaining maturity of the hedged item is greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date.  
Fair values are derived from market values.  The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is 
based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.  
Hedge accounting
The Company’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks associated with changes in interest rates.  
The Company uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps to hedge these risks.  The Company does not use 
derivatives for speculative purposes.
Where hedge accounting is to be applied, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective 
and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, 
or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting.

(a)	 Accounting	 policies	 continued
The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting is dependent on how they are 
designated.  The designations and accounting treatments applicable to the Company are explained below:
Fair value hedges
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of  
recognised liabilities.
Derivatives that meet the “fair value” hedging requirements are recognised in the balance sheet at fair  
value with corresponding fair value movements recognised within interest in the income statement.  For an 
effective fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being 
hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement.  To the extent that the designated hedge 
relationship is fully effective, the amounts in the income statement offset each other.  As a result, only the 
ineffective element of any designated hedging relationship impacts the income statement.  If the hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for 
which the effective interest method is used, is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
(xii)	 Cash	 flow	 statement
As permitted by FRS 1 (Revised 1996) “Cash flow statements”, the Company has not prepared a cash flow 
statement because it has already produced a consolidated cash flow statement which is publicly available.  
(b)	 Directors’	 and	 auditors’	 remuneration
Details of directors’ remuneration, share interests, share options, pensions and other entitlements, which 
form part of these financial statements, are given in the parts of the directors’ Remuneration Report which 
are described as having been audited.  Fees paid to the auditors in respect of their audit of the Company 
were £0.1 million (2006/07 £0.1 million).

(l)	 Post	 retirement	 benefits
DSG international plc maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a 
defined benefit and defined contribution section.  The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets 
held in a separate trustee administered fund.  The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three 
years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries so  
as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.  The last valuation was 
carried out as at 5 April 2007, using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of 
funding to the scheme.  
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section showed the value of assets to be sufficient to  
cover 92% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.   
At 3 May 2008, the valuation of the defined benefit section for the purposes of FRS 17 showed a gross 
pension deficit of £51.0 million (28 April 2007 £38.4 million).  Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed 
in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, which although presented under IAS 19 “Employment 
Benefits” show figures and disclosures equivalent to those applicable under FRS 17.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the pension scheme has been closed to new 
entrants.  Membership of the defined contribution section is now offered to eligible employees.
(m)	 Related	 parties
The Company has applied the exemption allowed by FRS 8 regarding disclosure of transactions with other 
undertakings which are members of the DSG international plc Group.

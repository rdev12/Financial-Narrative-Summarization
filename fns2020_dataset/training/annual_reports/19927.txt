Group highlights
Improving production 
volumes at Copper India
Higher production volumes 
at Copper India, while 
maintenance work at 
Konkola reduced production 
in Zambia. An easing of 
documentation requirements 
for VAT refunds in Zambia 
will enable us to increase 
utilisation rates of the smelter. 
 see page 64
Resuming operations at 
Sesa Goa
Production recommenced 
at Karnataka and in Goa, 
environment restrictions were 
lifted, with Vedanta allocated 
an interim annual mining 
quantity of 5.5mt of saleable 
ore. We are implementing 
cost reductions to counter 
the low-price environment.
 see page 60
Ramping up aluminium
Production reached record 
levels at Lanjigarh and we 
have initiated a number of 
innovative, cost-saving projects. 
The new Korba-II smelter and 
Jharsuguda-II smelter started 
production with significant 
ramp up planned in 2016.

Resilient performance  
in falling crude  
oil environment
We have revised capex 
but continue to focus on 
opportunities, with Cairn 
delivering the largest 
exploration and appraisal 
programme in its history. 
We spent US$1.1 billion in 
FY2015 out of US$3 billion, 
retaining flexibility on 
spend going forward.

Essential to transforming India
Iron Ore
Aluminium
Iron ore, a key ingredient in steel 
making, is expected to benefit 
from increased demand in India 
as a result of higher consumption 
of consumer durables and the 
Government’s target to increase 
steel production to 300mt by 
2025 to match India’s growing 
infrastructure needs. Vedanta has 
large iron ore mines in Goa and 
Karnataka and a pig iron plant in 
Goa. It is a major supplier to the 
domestic market with the Goa iron 
ore mine also serving the Chinese 
and Japanese export markets.

Iron ore reserves & resources

Due to aluminium’s light weight and 
low cost, the metal is increasingly 
used in residences, buildings, 
automobiles and appliances. 
Aluminium demand is increasing 
in India, boosted by increased 
investment in infrastructure, power 
and transportation. In addition to 
aluminium ingots, Vedanta also 
produces a wide range of value-
added products and aluminium 
alloys with huge potential in 
aerospace and defence industries.

In 2014, the Indian Government launched 
a major national campaign, ‘Make in India’, 
to encourage companies to manufacture 
in India. The initiative is focused on 
25 sectors of the economy and aims 
to create jobs and enhance skills. Strategic

Power
The availability of power in India is 
increasing, but demand outstrips 
supply leading to a substantial 
power shortage. Around 280 
million people in India do not have 
basic electricity connections and 
the Government aims to supply 
power to all homes by 2019. 
Vedanta is one of India’s largest 
private power generators.

The Indian Government’s focus 
on infrastructure projects such as 
upgrading railway stations, building 
new airports and roads; developing 
100 smart cities; rural electrification 
projects and investment in 
transmission corridors will all boost 
the country’s zinc requirements.

Oil & Gas
Copper
Copper demand in India is expected 
to grow at 9%–10%, ahead of 
economic growth in India. Vedanta 
can contribute by ensuring 
availability of the right quality 
of copper to the manufacturing 
sector. Currently Vedanta not 
only serves over 800 small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs) in 
the downstream industry for the 
critical electrical sector, but is also 
the major supplier of copper to 
the country’s defence sector.

Oil & Gas contributes to 
approximately 37% of India’s 
primary energy consumption and 
the demand continues to rise, with 
77% of requirement being imported. 
Vedanta produced 27% of India’s 
domestic crude oil in FY2015 and 
is well-positioned to reduce the 
country’s energy import burden.

My vision for the future is to continue to fulfil 
Vedanta’s potential while helping to advance 
the world’s largest democratic developing 
nation economically, socially and sustainably. 
India is richly-endowed with the natural 
resources that will fuel its future growth and 
raise the living standards of its population of 
1.2 billion people. We are working with our 
employees, communities and Government to 
help unlock India’s vast resource potential.

Highlights of the year 
This year I was delighted to welcome Tom 
Albanese to his position as Vedanta’s Chief 
Executive. His strong industry experience 
is already making a difference and he has 
demonstrated that he shares my vision for 
building an ethical, sustainable business.
The election of a new government in India is 
also beginning to have a positive impact on the 
business environment we operate in and I believe 
that the country will benefit from the progressive 
reforms being proposed by the Government.  Strategic

This Government is firmly committed to supporting 
a fast-growing Indian economy, to shape business 
policy and make it easier for the private sector 
to create economic value. We are among the 
largest contributors to the exchequer in India 
and play a strong role in nation building. Vedanta 
makes important, long-term contributions to 
local and regional economies, paying around 
US$15 billion in taxes, royalties and other levies 
in total over the past three years alone. 
Reflecting on another productive year, we 
have proven that we are well-positioned to 
capitalise on India’s abundant natural resource 
opportunities. Despite the volatility in global 
commodity prices, we have delivered a sound 
financial and operating performance. To reflect 
this challenging market environment, we have 
implemented a series of initiatives aimed at 
reducing capital and operating costs across the 
Group, which will maintain our financial strength. 
Financial performance 
Throughout this year, we have remained focused 
on our stated strategic priorities. We have 
started to ease back on capital expenditure 
and concentrated on increasing production 
through optimising our core assets.
We’ve seen unprecedented declines in oil and 
iron ore prices, though zinc and aluminium 
prices were relatively more resilient. These 
affected Group EBITDA, which decreased by 
17% to US$3.7 billion (FY2014: US$4.5 billion). 
However, our diversified portfolio allowed us to 
maintain robust adjusted EBITDA margins of 
38% on the back of our diversified portfolio. 
The substantial drop in oil prices during the year 
has led to a revaluation of our Oil & Gas business 
and a US$4.5 billion (net of tax) writedown. This 
is a reflection on the reality of oil prices today 
and doesn’t affect our strategy in any way. 
We remain committed to being a diversified 
resources player, capitalising on our strengths.
Gross debt reduced by US$0.2 billion in FY2015 
and US$0.6 billion in H2 FY2015. However, net 
debt has increased by US$0.5 billion, mainly due 
to US$0.8 billion spent on increasing our stake in 
Vedanta Limited (formerly Sesa Sterlite) and Cairn 
India during H1 FY2015. Our final dividend of 40 
US cents per share, taking the full year dividend 
up by 3%, reflects our continued confidence in 
the strength and prospects of the business. 
The fundamentals for our business remain sound, 
but we have to navigate this downturn. We 
operate in cyclical markets and at this point in 
the cycle our focus is on productivity, efficiency 
and preserving value and I am confident that 
this will happen given the strength of our 
businesses and dedication of our people. 
We will continue to implement initiatives to 
contain capital expenditure and operating costs 
to maintain financial strength during this period 
of weaker commodity prices. At the same time we 
will preserve our portfolio of assets with attractive 
long-term growth prospects and a strong resource 
position. We also aim to maintain a strong balance 
sheet, with a focus on maximising free cash 
flows, deleveraging and returns to investors. 
We continue to 
contain capital 
expenditure and 
operating costs  
to maintain 
financial strength.
 1 Production growth
Since IPO in 2004, Vedanta has 
grown production across its 
portfolio supported by its 
well-invested expansion programme 
and continued focus on increasing 
R&R over production each year.
1 All commodity and power 
capacities rebased to copper 
equivalent capacity (defined as 
production X commodity price/
copper price) using average 
commodity prices for FY2015. 
Power rebased using FY2015 
realisations, copper custom 
smelting capacities rebased at 
TC/RC for FY2015, iron ore 
volumes refers to sales with 
prices rebased at average 
56/58% FOB prices for FY2015.
2 PF refers to pro forma for Cairn 
India acquisition. 
 2 Progressive dividends
Dividends have been paid out every 
year, across the commodity cycle, 
increasing progressively from 17.0 
US cents per share 11 years ago to 
63.0 US cents per share this year.
3 In FY2004, a single dividend of 
5.5 US cents per share was paid, 
for the four months since listing, 
equivalent to an annual payment 
of 16.5 US cents per share. 12 Strategic report We are Vedanta

Sustainability 
Sustainable development is at the core of 
Vedanta’s operations. Our Sustainability 
Framework comprises of four pillars: Responsible 
Stewardship, Building Strong Relationships, Adding 
and Sharing Value and Strategic Communications. 
Our Sustainability Framework has a set of policies, 
with technical and management standards aligned 
to international standards, to enable significant 
improvement in the way we do business. 
Social development is fundamental to any 
country’s growth and we are focused on platforms 
for education, healthcare, nutrition and sanitation 
that benefit around four million people every 
year. We work closely with local governments, 
NGOs and academic institutions to help ensure 
that our programmes benefit as many people 
as possible around our communities. I remain 
committed to collaborating on mutually beneficial 
partnerships that will further our positive impact 
on communities and uphold our licence to 
operate in all our areas of operations with rising 
expectations of corporate social responsibility. 
Vedanta now employs, either directly or indirectly, 
approximately 82,000 people globally. While we 
are encouraged that there is an improvement 
in the safety performance of the Group this 
year, I am saddened that we experienced 
eight fatalities. Our efforts across Vedanta, 
to achieve a ‘Zero Harm’ culture is a personal 
priority for our CEO, Mr Tom Albanese and me. 
Governance 
In 2014, we welcomed Katya Zotova, who joined 
the Vedanta Board as a Non-Executive Director, 
and became a member of the Nominations 
and Remuneration Committees. She brings a 
wealth of oil & gas sector experience to the 
Board and her perspective will be invaluable 
as we drive sustainable improvement 
and growth in our global business. 
Diversity is a business imperative as well as an 
expectation by society. We have set ourselves 
some challenging targets in this area and I 
am pleased with the progress we are making. 
Today, we have a strong management team 
with diverse backgrounds, including three 
female executives in front line positions.
I’d like to thank my energetic and hard-working 
Vedanta team – I am amazed at what we 
have achieved over the past 11 years and 
their contribution is immense. Together we 
have created a value-based and empowered 
organisation that is well-positioned for the 
next stage of its growth. I would also like 
to acknowledge all my fellow Directors for 
their sound guidance and contribution. 
Vedanta’s role in transforming India 
The winds of change for economic growth in India 
are blowing strongly. A country of almost 1.2 billion 
people, India is the largest democracy in the world, 
rich in human and natural resources. Vedanta has 
a very important role to play in ensuring that India 
is able to benefit from these resources and become 
self-sufficient in energy supply. India spends a 
significant proportion of its foreign exchange 
on importing oil, and local resources companies 
including Vedanta can help redress this balance.
The new Government has a mandate for 
economic growth and job creation. We support 
its reforms, such as the auctioning of natural 
resources and the ‘Make in India’ programme, 
which is designed to transform India into a global 
manufacturing hub. India has so much to offer, 
and by implementing important changes such 
as making it an easier place to do business, by 
opening up the country to foreign investment, and 
improving infrastructure and productivity, it will 
inevitably create jobs, particularly for our young 
people, and bring further prosperity to the country.
 
Outlook
Going forward, our overall strategic priorities 
remain the same, to build a resilient portfolio which 
enables us to withstand a volatile commodity 
environment and continue to deliver long-term 
value to our shareholders. Group simplification 
is key and looking forward over the next year, 
Tom Albanese and I will be putting greater 
focus on this. The recent name change of Sesa 
Sterlite Limited to Vedanta Limited is a significant 
milestone, which reflects Vedanta’s commitment 
to strengthen the linkage between our businesses, 
communities and stakeholders across the globe. 
In terms of market conditions, India is at an 
inflection point, with its metals and energy 
demand poised to explode as its GDP potentially 
doubles over the next decade. Vedanta is a vehicle 
for new potential investment opportunities in a fast 
growing economy. Over the next few years, we are 
likely to see the demand for all our commodities 
and commercial power increase substantially as 
the Government of India’s focus on ‘Make in India’ 
and infrastructure investments start yielding 
results. As a large and responsible corporation, 
Vedanta is well-positioned to participate in this 
journey, and I look forward to our future.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Making progress against our  
strategic priorities.
We have continued to focus on 
improving our operational performance 
and enhancing production, delivering 
record volumes of zinc and aluminium, 
and delivering free cash flow in volatile 
commodity markets.
Tom Albanese, Chief Executive Officer
At the end of my first year as Chief Executive, 
I am pleased with the progress we have made 
against the key operational priorities I set last year 
and the continued momentum of the Company 
towards its strategic objectives, against the 
backdrop of volatile global commodity markets.
Progress against operational priorities
The highlights for the year include the ramping up 
of our world-class aluminium assets, following the 
approximate US$8 billion investment programme, 
to reach record production levels. We are now 
well positioned for an accelerated growth in 2016 
with progressive ramp up of the new smelters at 
Korba and Jharsuguda. The total mined metal 
production for zinc and lead also reached a 
historic high, supported by strong performance 
of the Rampura Agucha mine, one of the largest 
and lowest cost zinc mines in the world.  14 Strategic report We are Vedanta

3 Free cash ﬂow after sustaining capex but before growth capex.
The year also saw significant progress being 
made in development of underground mines 
at Rampura Agucha and Sindesar Khurd (SK). 
Our Oil & Gas business delivered a robust 
performance with Mangala and Aishwariya 
fields performing as expected, and strong 
contributions coming from offshore assets. 
Our Oil & Gas business will now reap the benefits 
from the high-impact Enhanced Oil Recovery 
(EOR) project in Rajasthan. Looking ahead, 
increasing gas production in the Raageshwari 
Deep Gas field and development at Barmer Hill 
will continue to provide us with growth options.
Though our copper smelter in India recorded 
the highest-ever production and best-in-class 
operational efficiencies during the year, the 
turnaround at Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) in 
Zambia continues to present challenges. Volumes 
and ore grade were lower at the Nchanga mine 
complex and the rehabilitation programme of 
shafts have affected production in Konkola Deeps. 
However, with the new management team and 
operating strategy in place, we have already 
started seeing positive momentum in the last 
quarter. While it was disappointing that iron ore 
mining at Goa did not resume last year, this has 
had less of a material impact due to decline in 
iron ore prices globally. We have made some 
progress on this front during the year. Mining in 
Karnataka resumed in February 2015 and we 
have been allocated an interim annual capacity 
of 5.5mt of saleable ore in Goa where mining 
is expected to recommence post the monsoon 
season, after receipt of the remaining approvals 
from the Government. Export duty has now 
been reduced to 10% for <58% grade iron ore. 
Market environment
The volatility of global commodity prices has 
dampened our financial results, and this has 
slowed down the pace of our deleveraging 
programme. That said, I was pleased to 
see reduction in our gross and net debt in 
the second half, despite lower oil prices.
Recognising the current commodity environment 
we are implementing a series of initiatives 
to reduce capital and operating costs across 
all our businesses to maintain financial 
strength and a strong balance sheet. 
Looking forward we see demand and supply 
rebalancing with more robust pricing as a 
consequence. China’s slowdown is moving 
to a more sustainable level of growth and 
Vedanta’s position as low-cost operator of 
long-life mines will serve it well as global 
demand returns to more normal levels.
As a non-Indian, I had the privilege of being in 
India during the election campaign and I have 
great expectations that the new government will 
get India’s economy up and running, in contrast 
to the slowdown in China and stagnation in 
Europe. The pace of change has inevitably been 
slower than the early optimism suggested but 
progress on coal and energy policies and clarity 
on iron ore mining are encouraging. The step 
towards the auction of coal blocks, which we 
participated in, is a critical part of the journey 
to make India self-sufficient in coal. Today, 
India is one of the largest importers of coal, 
despite its huge reserves, and coal must be a key 
feature of the Government’s energy strategy.
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
 1 Diversified portfolio
A broad natural resources portfolio 
diversified across base metals,  
bulks and Oil & Gas has delivered 
consistent EBITDA margins in excess 
of 30% over the past 11 years.

 2 Cash flow and growth capex 
In a volatile commodity price 
environment, Vedanta is revising 
capex downwards and prioritising 
capital to high-return, low-risk 
projects. This will maximise cash 
flows, giving the flexibility to invest 
further as oil prices improve. Strategic

Vedanta is well-
positioned to meet 
India’s need for 
commodities, while 
operating at global 
standards of 
sustainable 
development.
Licence to operate
Safety has been a key priority at Vedanta  
as it is a weak link in our otherwise robust 
sustainability programme. The best businesses  
are the safest businesses and there has been a 
marked improvement in our results this year. 
Although I am encouraged by our progress,  
I am saddened by eight fatalities and there 
remains much more to do on our journey  
towards achieving a ‘Zero Harm’ culture.
My personal focus is on raising the levels 
of safety consciousness across the Group 
and ensuring that we invest more in safety 
management alongside raising standards, 
expectations and accountabilities.
Maintaining our licence to operate is at the 
heart of the Group strategy and essential 
for our access to resources, people and 
capital. I am a firm believer that being a 
responsible miner is critical to a sustainable 
future and our corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) programme must be world class.
In my first year as CEO, I have been struck by 
the sheer breadth and depth of our community 
development initiatives. We have very strong 
CSR programmes around child health care and 
education, water, sanitation, livelihood and the 
empowerment of women. The sector is now 
increasingly seeing ethics and integrity overlapping 
with the sustainable development agenda, and 
so we have added Strategic Communication 
as a fourth pillar to our sustainability model, 
to ensure transparent dialogue with our 
stakeholders. This reflects our commitment 
to become a corporate citizen who will not act 
without the consent of local communities.
Our long-term success is only partly attributable 
to our core facilities; people, performance and 
innovation are all equally important. This year 
we have made great strides in water and energy 
management, with various improvement initiatives 
including enhanced operating efficiencies resulting 
in water and energy savings surpassing our targets.
It is critical to our success that we have the 
highest quality of workforce and I have been 
incredibly impressed by the professional capability 
and leadership ability demonstrated by our 
employees – from our recent graduates to our 
senior executives. We have set up an innovation 
task force as part of our drive to encourage 
innovation across our business units. This includes 
the engineers within the Group and will extend 
to universities and other avenues. We have also 
invigorated the initiatives for developing high 
potential talents through our ‘ACT UP’ and Leaders 
Connect Programmes, to create leadership 
succession at all levels across the organisation.
Progress against strategic priorities
Our key strategic priorities remain unchanged. We 
have ramped up production and optimised opex 
and capex across our businesses and reduced 
gross debt by US$0.2 billion (US$16.7 billion in 
FY2015). We continue to focus on optimising 
our assets, maintaining positive free cash flows, 
efficiently refinancing upcoming maturities 
and deliver on our priority of deleveraging. 
The long-life nature of our resource base underpins 
our track record of adding more to our reserves 
and resources (R&R) than we extract and we 
continue to use our exploration skills to expand 
the potential of our ore bodies and petroleum 
reservoirs going forward. As we can only book 
reserves against the duration of our leases and 
our current oil & gas lease in Rajasthan expires 
in 2020, our oil & gas reserve schedule does 
not accurately reflect the strong exploration 
success and potential of the Rajasthan basin. 
The renewal of this lease is currently under 
consideration by the Government of India.
I acknowledge shareholder feedback that we 
need to simplify Vedanta’s Group structure 
and we intend to put greater focus on this in 
the coming year to make Vedanta easier to 
understand and more attractive to invest in. 
Looking forward
There is much to do on the operational front in 
FY2016; to move aluminium above its current 
operating level of 38% capacity, secure a local 
source of bauxite for our refineries and smelters, 
stabilise KCM, restart iron ore mining in Goa, 
and ensure our Oil & Gas business is positioned 
for robust performance notwithstanding weak 
oil prices. We need to continue strengthening 
our balance sheet through further deleveraging 
and delivering a simpler corporate structure.
We will continue to have a relentless focus on 
costs alongside rising capacity utilisation thus 
driving value growth. Looking forward over 
the next few years, we expect the worst of the 
sector oversupply to be behind us and Vedanta 
will be well placed to take advantage of future 
growth in India and globally, as a premier 
developer and innovator of choice. This will 
position the Company and its shareholders for 
a long period of profitable value creation.

Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
Market overview
Emerging markets 
continue to be key 
drivers of growth.
Global economy 
Global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 
2.6% in 2014, according to World Bank Global 
Prospect Report 2015. There was a notable 
divergence in performance, however, between 
the world’s major economies. The US started off 
weakly but the economy recovered through the 
spring and summer. The Chinese economy had a 
stronger start and slowed in the second half of 
the year, and growth dipped slightly below the 
government’s 7.5% target. Europe’s growth 
remained weak in 2014, and The European Central 
Bank announced significant easing measures 
in the summer. Activity remained fragile in 
emerging economies. 
According to the World Bank Global Prospects 
Report 2015, global growth is expected to rise 
moderately, to 3% in 2015 and average about 3.3% 
through 2017. High income countries are likely to 
see growth of 2.2% in 2015–17, up from 1.8% in 
2014, on the back of gradually recovering labour 
markets, ebbing fiscal consolidation, and still-low 
financing costs. In developing countries, as the 
domestic headwinds that held back growth in 2014 
ease and the recovery in high-income countries 
slowly strengthens, growth is projected to 
gradually accelerate, rising from 4.4% in 2015 and 
5.4% in 2017. Lower oil prices will contribute to 
diverging prospects for oil exporting and importing 
countries, particularly in 2015.
Indian economy
As the world economy faces subdued conditions 
and uncertainties, the Indian economy is 
poised to accelerate. Growth is expected to 
rebound given political certainty, positive policy 
measures, low commodity prices and improved 
business confidence. 
Internally, the decisive outcome of the national 
elections buoyed sentiment and boosted 
expectations of major economic reforms. 
The Government has already initiated reforms 
including diesel price deregulation, natural gas 
price reforms, steps towards more flexible labour 
markets and reforms in the coal, mining and 
telecommunication sector. In addition, the launch 
of the ‘Make in India’ campaign has further 
boosted sentiment.
The focus on infrastructure investment, aided by a 
focus on certain industries with significant impact 
on the overall economic growth, will drive demand 
for aluminium, zinc, copper and iron ore. 
As a large net importer of crude oil, the decline in 
crude prices has a positive impact in India. Going 
forward, this could improve growth prospects and 
ease inflation pressures increasing disposable 
incomes for consumers, lower input costs for 
energy-intensive sectors and lower current account 
deficit amongst others.

The IMF Survey in March 2015 estimates that real 
GDP growth will rise to 7.2% in 2014–2015, and 
continue at that level in 2015–2016, as a result of 
the revival in industrial and investment activity.
The Indian Government is now focused on 
improving the business climate and reviving 
manufacturing growth, with the target of 
improving India’s ranking in the World Bank’s 
Ease of Doing Business survey. Initiation of 
economic reforms and renewed optimism, 
together with low crude oil prices, augurs well 
for the Indian economy.
Zinc
The global demand for zinc increased by 4.3% in 
2014 to 13,881kt. Refined zinc production growth 
declined from 3.9% to 3.3% in 2014, highlighting 
the widening gap between the global zinc demand 
and its supply. Combined with reductions in LME 
stocks, this resulted in moderate price rises during 
the year. Global zinc consumption is expected to 
grow steadily by around 4%–5% in the coming 
years and the closure of some large mines such as 
Century and Lisheen, will create further shortage in 
supply. New mines and upcoming projects such as 
Vedanta’s Gamsberg project will help offset the 
gap to an extent. 
The outlook for demand in India remains positive 
with CAGR of around 6%, driven by a strong 
galvanising sector which accounts for 75% of 
demand. With a 78% share of the Indian market 
and a high quality rating for its LME registered 
brands, HZL is well positioned to take advantage 
of these positive developments.
Lead
During 2014, global lead demand increased to 
11,621kt, a growth of 3.7%, while primary refined 
lead production growth was 4.9%. Chinese 
demand which accounted for about 45% of global 
lead demand in 2014, grew by 4.5% in 2014 
compared to 6.6% in 2013.
In 2015, we expect a continued increase in 
demand, led by the Chinese expansion in 
automotive output and construction of mobile 
phone base stations, requiring lead-acid batteries 
for back-up power. Amid falling fuel prices and 
interest rates, as well as Government promotion 
for foreign investments, India is expected to be 
among the world’s top four auto-producers, 
leading to a substantial increase in lead 
consumption in the country. 
Copper 
World copper consumption is estimated to have 
totalled 22.6mt in 2014, 8% higher than 2013, 
despite slowing economic growth in key emerging 
economies. China remained the main driver of 
world copper consumption in 2014 accounting for 
46% of the world’s refined copper consumption.
The availability of copper concentrates increased 
during the year following the resumption of 
Indonesian exports and new mines such as 
Caserones and Sierra Gorda starting production 
and TC/RCs improved considerably over the year.
World refined production is forecast to increase 
by 4.8% to 23.5mt in 2015, with moderating growth 
rates in China thereafter leading to growth in 
demand softening to 3.9%. Vedanta is one of the 
major exporters to China and also holds the 
highest market share in India where demand is 
expected to grow at 6%–8%. With its LME 
registered copper, Vedanta is well positioned to 
meet increasing demand for refined copper in 
India’s critical electrical sector.

Annual report and accounts FY2015
Aluminium
Global aluminium consumption rose by 7.6% to 
54mt in 2014, primarily driven by China, which 
leads in supply as well as demand. World-wide 
aluminium supply is outpacing demand, with 
subsequent pressure on pricing and premiums. In 
2014 LME aluminium cash prices remained almost 
flat at US$1,866 but high LME stocks and lead time 
for delivery led to higher metal premiums. 
Looking forward, primary aluminium demand 
is forecast to grow by 5% per annum up to 2020, 
driven by the transport sector and substitutions 
in favour of aluminium, but the release of LME 
inventories and consistently high production in 
China will keep prices soft over the coming year.
Aluminium demand from India is growing strongly, 
spurred by large infrastructure investments. 
Government programmes such as ‘Make in India’ 
and ‘electricity and housing for all’ will drive 
increased demand from the electrical power, 
transport and construction industries. There are 
new opportunities for the downstream industry in 
India to develop value added products, including 
alloys for defence and automobile applications. 
Vedanta’s portfolio is focused more on the value 
added products and demand for its rods, billets and 
rolled products is likely to increase substantially.
Iron ore 
The global iron ore trade is estimated to have 
increased 9% in 2014 to 1.3 billion tonnes 
supported by increases in supply from Australia 
and Brazil. Record iron ore production in 2014, 
combined with weak demand fundamentals in 
China, put pressure on prices which dropped by 
47% during the calendar year.
This reflected the market shift into oversupply with 
high stocks building in Chinese ports in addition to 
resilient domestic production. For 2015, lacklustre 
Chinese steel consumption growth is likely to 
dampen prices and the major miners are turning 
their focus to cutting production costs and 
increasing productivity.
In India demand for steel is forecast to rise as the 
Indian Ministry of Steel plans to increase steel 
production to 300mt by 2025 and investment in 
new capacity is under way leading to a projected 
growth rate in demand for steel of 5.3%. As 
Vedanta iron ore mines come back into production, 
it will help service the projected demand growth.
Market overview continued
Aluminium demand in India is 
growing strongly, spurred by large 
infrastructure investments. 
Government programmes such as 
‘Make in India’ and electricity and 
housing for all, will drive increasing 
demand from the electrical sector.  Strategic

Oil & Gas 
Following three years of relative stability and 
averaging around US$100 per barrel, oil prices have 
fallen sharply since mid 2014, a result of supply side 
pressure. New supply sources, notably from North 
America, have added to this imbalance. For 2014, 
oil demand grew by just 0.7% vis-à-vis 2013 when 
it grew at 1.4%. However, 2015 is forecasted to see 
growth of 1.2%.
The Indian oil & gas market is characterised by very 
high dependence on oil & gas imports, importing 
over 75% of its domestic requirements. Petroleum 
imports constitute more than 35% of India’s total 
gross imports, leading the Government of India to 
drive for increased domestic production to reduce 
the energy import burden of the country by at least 
10% per annum, until 2022. As one of the largest 
crude oil producers in India, Vedanta is well-
positioned to support this vision.
Vedanta’s market position 
Vedanta is positioned well with a diversified spread 
across many commodity classes, enabling it to 
adjust to economic cycles and offset market 
downturns. The Government of India’s vision of 
higher domestic production to reduce India’s 
dependence on imports and the ‘Make in India’ 
programme are expected to accelerate demand 
in the Indian metal market, creating a positive 
environment for Vedanta in its domestic market in 
the near term and globally in the medium term. 20 Strategic report We are Vedanta

bureaucracy in doing business to attract new 
investments in infrastructure and to accelerate 
growth.
Vedanta is working to get easier access to raw 
materials (e.g. coal and bauxite) where the new 
Mining and Mineral Regulation will provide for 
auctions of natural resources. Coal block auctions 
already conducted during the year were a step 
towards addressing the country wide coal issue.
The Government is prioritising energy security and 
is taking steps in that direction including evaluation 
of revenue sharing models and uniform licensing 
policy for hydrocarbon reserves. Cairn India is 
currently working with the Government on the 
extension of the Profit Sharing Contract (PSC) 
in Rajasthan.
Relationships with State Governments are equally 
important and we continue to work with the 
Governments of the states where we operate. 
Africa
As a major employer in Zambia and Southern 
Africa, with nearly 16,000 employees and 
contractors, Vedanta is committed to working  
with the local Governments.
Employees
In addition to investing in training and 
development for its 82,000 employees, 
opportunities for employee engagement exist 
at every level within the Company. Over 2,000 
employees have attended the Chairman’s 
workshop in the last five years, the CEO visits sites 
around the Company on a regular basis and there 
are forums to cover local issues including welfare, 
gender diversity, sustainability and safety.
Customers and suppliers
Vedanta has strong relationships with its customers 
and suppliers and also contributes to the industry by 
participating in industry bodies. Vedanta aims to set 
high standards for contractual integrity and quality 
of product. Supply chain management is treated as 
a critical skill, underpinned by investment in IT and 
integrated systems. 
Strategic capabilities
World class assets
We have a diverse portfolio of high-quality assets 
that we invest in to secure long-term value delivery 
throughout the commodity cycle. Our long-life, 
low-cost assets have benefited from a significant 
investment programme over the last few years, 
with capital expenditure this year reduced to 
US$1 billion in line with subdued market conditions. 
This will maintain our competitive position in Tier 
one of the global cost curve for Zinc, Iron Ore and 
Oil & Gas and help move Aluminium and Copper 
into lower quartiles in the near term.
A skilled workforce 
Key to our operational excellence is our 82,000 
strong workforce, which includes over 11,000 
skilled professionals such as geologists, mining 
engineers, technicians and commercial managers. 
We provided 756,643 hours in health & safety 
training, to ensure we develop and protect our 
people. We attract and retain the talent we need 
through high quality programmes such as the  
STAR programme that aims to develop 800+ high 
potential employees; the Mining Academy set up 
at Rajasthan to develop an employee pool with 
enhanced underground mining skills and Technical 
Act Up, a structured programme to develop 
technically proficient employees.
Technology and innovation
We encourage a culture of innovation both 
internally and through collaboration with external 
networks to drive productivity and maintain 
our competitive position. We test out new ideas 
in our R&D laboratory and invest in pilot scale 
studies, followed by feasibility studies for 
commercial viability.
Financial strength 
We have a strong financial profile with cash 
and liquid investments of US$8.2 billion and a 
diversified, balanced debt portfolio with a net  
debt of US$8.5 billion. We are delivering positive 
free cash flow and continue to deleverage our 
balance sheet. 
Licence to operate 
Our investment in sustainability is key to our 
protecting and preserving our licence to operate. 
We promote a culture of transparency and integrity, 
focusing on protecting the health and safety of  
our employees, minimising our impact on the 
environment and investing in our local communities.

Communities 
Key to our license to operate is our relationship 
with the communities where we operate. We work 
with local community groups and village councils 
to discuss any grievances, for example in relation 
to land and resettlement issues. Our community 
programmes benefit over 4.1 million people in 
India and Africa and we invested US$43.0 million 
this year on these community initiatives including 
building and supporting schools, hospitals and on 
environmental projects to improve bio-diversity 
around our assets. 
Shareholders
The Company actively engages with shareholders 
to listen to their views with the Executive members 
of the Board undertaking an ongoing schedule of

US$1.6 billion to shareholders, an average return 
of 8% per annum.
Dividends have been paid out every year, across 
the commodity cycle, increasing progressively 
from 17.0 US cents per share 11 years ago to 
63.0 US cents per share this year.
Lenders
Vedanta has a balanced debt portfolio, with 
a diversified range of funding sources and a

Key performance indicators
Vedanta has identified the key performance indicators 
that it believes are useful in assessing how well the  
Group is performing against its strategic aims.
They encompass both financial and non-financial 
measures.
Revenue
Description
Revenue represents the value of goods and 
services provided to third parties during 
the year.
Commentary
Total revenue for the year FY2015 was 
US$12.9 billion, in line with the previous year 
despite a weaker commodity environment. 
Primarily, the fall in Oil & Gas revenue, as a 
result of lower Brent prices, has been offset 
by increased revenue in Zinc, Iron Ore, 
Copper, Aluminium and Power. Revenue was 
up in Zinc India 7.4% and Aluminium 16.6% 
due to higher prices and premia. Copper 
India volumes were higher. Lower volumes 
at our Copper Zambia and Zinc International 
businesses also reduced revenue. 
EBITDA
Description
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, 
Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) 
is a factor of volumes, prices and cost of 
production. This measure is calculated by 
adjusting operating profit for special items, 
and adding depreciation and amortisation.
Commentary
EBITDA for FY2015 was lower by 16.7% 
at US$3,741.2 million as compared to 
US$4,491.2 million in FY2014 primarily 
due to lower commodity and oil prices 
and a higher profit petroleum share to 
the Government of India. Whilst higher 
production volumes in Copper India, the 
recommencement of iron ore production 
ROCE
Description
This is calculated on the basis of operating 
profit before special items and net of tax 
as a ratio of capital invested in operations 
as at the balance sheet date, and excludes 
investment in project capital work in 
progress and exploration assets. The 
objective is to earn a post-tax return 
above the weighted average cost of 
capital consistently. To have consistency 
in comparison, the effect of one time 
non-cash impairment charges have been 
taken out in calculating ROCE for FY2015.
Commentary
ROCE without project capital work 
in progress and exploration assets 
in FY2015 was 8.7% as compared 
to 14.9% in the previous year.
in Karnataka and the commissioning 
of a new power plant at Talwandi Sabo 
helped EBITDA, this was more than offset 
by lower volumes in the Zinc businesses, 
Oil & Gas and Copper Zambia.
Free cash flow post capex
Description
This represents net cash flows before 
investing in expansion projects and 
dividends paid out by Vedanta. This 
measure ensures that the profit generated 
by our assets is reflected by cash flow 
in order to fund future growth.
Commentary
Free cash flow post capex was US$1.0 billion 
in FY2015 as compared to US$1.3 billion in 
FY2014 and reduced mainly due to a lower 
EBITDA as a result of weaker commodity 
prices, with a lower amount spent on 
sustaining and growth capex to preserve 
cash in the challenging environment.
Capex spent
Description
This represents the amount invested in 
our organic growth programme during 
the year.
Commentary
Expansion capital expenditure during the 
year was US$1,531 million as compared  
to US$1,425 million.  27

Underlying EPS
Description
This represents net profit attributable to 
equity shareholders and is stated before 
special items and their attributable tax 
(including taxes classified as special 
items) and minority interest impacts. 
By producing a stream of profits and 
EPS we will be able to pay a progressive 
dividend to our shareholders.
Commentary
Underlying EPS at (14.2) US cents per 
share was lower compared to the previous 
year of 14.7 US cents per share. This was 
reflected by weak commodity prices and 
lower volumes resulting in lower EBITDA, 
which includes one time provision of 7% 
Gridco receivables of US$44 million and 
LTIFR
Description
The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) is the number of lost-time injuries 
per million man-hours worked. This 
includes our employees and contractors 
working in our operations and projects.
Commentary
We have been able to continue reducing 
LTIFR with a 0.46 in FY2015. The continuous 
fall in LTIFR shows our commitment 
towards zero harm work environment.
US$88 million exploration costs written-
off at Cairn India pertaining to a deep 
gas well in the Ravva production block. 
Furthermore, it reduced due to the higher 
tax charge which was partially offset 
by lower depreciation and amortisation 
and the lower net interest expense.
Dividends
Description
Dividend per share is the total of final 
dividend recommended by the Board 
in relation to the year and interim 
dividend paid out during the year.
Commentary
We have been able to maintain our 
commitment to a progressive dividend 
policy, raising the total dividend to  
63 US cents per share this year, up 3%.
Gender Diversity
Description
The percentage of women in the total 
permanent employee workforce.
Commentary
We nurture passionate talent and  
provide equal opportunities to men  
and women. During FY2015, the ratio  
of female employees increased to 8.6%  
of total employees. We initiated special 
recruitment drives to provide career 
advancement for women, including  
planned rotation through corporate 
functions.
CSR footprint
Description
Total number of beneficiaries through 
our community development 
programmes across all our operations.
Commentary
We benefited around 4.0 million people  
this year through our community 
development projects comprising 
community health, nutrition, education, 
water and sanitation, sustainable livelihood, 
women empowerment and bio-investment. 28 Strategic report We are Vedanta

Annual report and accounts FY2015
Principal risks and uncertainties
Vedanta’s businesses are exposed to a variety of  
risks inherent to an international oil & gas mining 
and resources organisation. The nature of operations 
for resource companies operations is long-term, 
resulting in the identification of several ongoing risks. 
Resource companies also carry a significant element 
of constantly-evolving risks. 
Our risk 
management 
framework is 
designed to be a 
simple, consistent 
and clear format 
for managing and 
reporting risks 
from the Group’s 
businesses to 
the Board.
It is essential to have in place necessary 
systems to manage these risks, while balancing 
the relative risk/reward equations demanded 
by stakeholders. Our management systems, 
organisational structures, processes, standards, 
and code of conduct together form our internal 
control systems, which govern how we conduct 
the Group’s business and manage all associated 
risks. Materiality and tolerance for risk are 
key considerations in our decision-making.
Risk management is embedded in our critical 
business activities, functions and processes. 
It helps Vedanta meet its objectives through 
aligning operating controls with mission and 
vision. Our risk management framework is 
designed to be a simple, consistent and clear 
format for managing and reporting risks from the 
Group’s businesses to the Board. It is a multi-
layered risk management framework, aimed 
at effectively mitigating the various risks our 
businesses are exposed to over the course of 
their operations and in their strategic actions. 
We identify risk at the individual business level for 
existing operations as well as for ongoing projects 
through a consistently applied methodology, 
using the Turnbull risk matrix. At least once a 
quarter, formal discussions on risk management 
take place in business level review meetings 
throughout the Group. At these meetings, each 
business reviews its risks, and any change in 
the nature and extent of the major risks since 
the last assessment, also control measures 
established for the risk and further action plans. 
Control measures in the Turnbull risk matrix 
are also periodically reviewed by business 
management teams to verify their effectiveness.
All Vedanta risk management review meetings 
are chaired by business chief executive officers 
and attended by COO/CFO, senior management 
and functional heads. Risk officers are formally 
nominated at all operating businesses, and 
Group level. The role of the risk officer is to 
create awareness of risk at senior management 
level and to develop and nurture a risk 
management culture within all businesses. 
Risk mitigation plans form an integral part of the 
KRA/KPI process of process owners. Structured 
discussion on risk management also happens 
at SBU levels on their respective risk matrix 
and mitigation plans. Governance of the risk 
management framework in the businesses 
is anchored with their leadership team.
The Board of Directors has the ultimate 
responsibility for management of risks and for 
ensuring the effectiveness of internal control 
systems. The Audit Committee aids the Board 
in this process by identifying and assessing 
any changes in risk exposure, reviewing 
all risk control measures and approving 
remedial actions, where appropriate.
The Audit Committee is supported by the Risk 
Management Committee, which helps evaluate 
the design and operating effectiveness of the risk 
mitigation programme and control systems.
Additional key risk governance and oversight 
committees include:
• CFO Committee – has an oversight on any 
treasury-related risks. This committee comprises 
the Group Chief Financial Officer, business  
Chief Financial Officers and Treasury Heads at 
respective businesses.
• Group Capex Sub-Committee – evaluates capex 
risks while reviewing any capital investment 
decisions, and institutes a risk management 
framework in all expansion projects.
• Vedanta Board Level Sustainability Committee 
– looks at sustainability related risks. This 
committee is headed by a Non-Executive 
Director, and other members are the Group Chief 
Executive Officer and other business leaders.
Every business division in the Group has developed 
its own risk matrix of Top 20 risks, which are 
reviewed at Business Management Committee 
level. Business divisions have developed individual 
risk registers, depending on the size of their 
operations and the number of SBUs/locations. 
These risks are reviewed in SBU level meetings.
Our principal risks have been assessed 
according to impact and likelihood, and are 
described on the following pages. The order in 
which these risks appear does not necessarily 
reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or 
the relative magnitude of their impact on 
our business. While our risk management 
framework is designed to help Vedanta meet 
its objectives, there can be no guarantee that 
our risk management activities will mitigate or 
prevent these or other risks from occurring. 29

Delay in 
commencement of 
production facilities 
in aluminium 
business
Some of our projects have been completed (pending 
commissioning) or are nearing completion. The 
timing, implementation and cost of these expansion 
projects is subject to a number of risks, including a 
delay in obtaining necessary approvals, which may 
delay or prevent us from commencing commercial 
operations at some of these projects, availability 
of power at commercially reasonable rates etc.
We continue our efforts to secure key raw material 
linkages for our alumina/aluminium business. We are 
also pursuing multiple options for bauxite sourcing 
with the Government of Odisha. Volumes are gradually 
ramping up across our Aluminium and Power businesses 
and we have received the approval to start our 1,200MW 
power plant in Korba. We are pursuing the deemed CPP 
route under the Electricity Act to resolve availability of 
power at Jharsuguda on commercially viable terms.
Infrastructure-related challenges are being addressed, 
with requisite approvals for the commencement 
of production facilities being pursued.
A strong management team is in place and 
continues to work towards sustainable low 
production costs, operational excellence and 
securing key raw material linkages.
   
Challenges in 
resumption, 
continuation of  
Iron Ore business
The iron ore business has faced temporary suspension 
and Goa iron ore is yet to commence its operation.
The Honourable Supreme Court (The Court) in 
India lifted the ban on mining in the State of Goa, 
in April 2014, subject to certain conditions. 
The Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests 
has also revoked its earlier order, which had kept 
environment clearances for iron ore mines in 
Goa in abeyance. Vedanta has been allocated 
with an interim annual mining quantity of 5.5mt 
of saleable ore based on the state wide cap of 
20mtpa for FY2015 which the Group expects to be 
progressively increased in the coming years.
Mining is expected to commence post monsoons, 
after receipt of remaining approvals from the Indian 
Government. We are working towards securing the 
necessary permissions for commencement of operations. 
Aggressive cost reduction initiatives are also 
under way at our Iron Ore business.
   
Transitioning of zinc 
and lead mining 
operations from 
open pit to 
underground 
mining
Our zinc and lead mining operations in India are 
transitioning from an open pit mining operation to 
an underground mining operation. Difficulties in 
managing this transition may result in challenges 
in achieving stated business milestones.
We are working with internationally renowned 
engineering and technology partners towards ensuring 
a smooth transition from open pit to underground 
mining, with a major focus on safety aspects. 
Technical audits are being carried out 
by independent agencies. 
Reputed contractors have been engaged to ensure 
completion of the project on indicated time lines. 
These mines will be developed using best-in-
class technology and equipment, and ensuring 
the highest level of productivity and safety.
We are inducting employees and contractors in our 
system with underground mining expertise. Our 
employees are also gaining experience working abroad 
in underground mines to accentuate skill development.
Stage gate process is in place to ensure we frequently 
review risk and remedy. Robust quality control 
procedures have also been implemented to check safety 
and quality of services, design, and actual physical work. 
Additional output from cut V of the open pit 
as well as ramp up from some of the mines 
is expected to smoothen this transition.

resources industry and enabling faster approvals. 
Our focus is on improving equipment availability to 
increase extraction rates, and experienced operators 
are being introduced into critical positions. 
Several cost-saving initiatives and restructuring 
reviews are also under way at KCM to preserve cash.
   
Discovery risk
The increased production rates from our growth 
oriented operations places demand on exploration 
and prospecting initiatives to replace reserves and 
resources at a pace faster than depletion. A failure in 
our ability to discover new reserves, enhance existing 
reserves or develop new operations in sufficient 
quantities to maintain or grow the current level of our 
reserves could negatively affect our prospects. There 
are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating 
ore and oil & gas reserves, and geological, technical 
and economic assumptions that are valid at the 
time of estimation. These may change significantly 
when new information becomes available.
Our strategic priority is to add to our reserves 
and resources by extending resources at a faster 
rate than we deplete them, through continuous 
focus on drilling and exploration programmes.
In order to achieve this we have developed an 
appropriate organisation and allocated adequate 
financial resources for exploration. International 
technical experts and agencies are working closely 
with our exploration team to build on this target.
We continue to work towards long-term 
supply contracts with mines.
   
Extension of 
Production-Sharing 
Contract of Cairn 
beyond 2020 or 
extension at less 
favourable terms
Cairn India has 70% participating interest 
in Rajasthan Block. The Production-Sharing 
Contract (PSC) of Rajasthan Block runs till 2020. 
Challenges in extending Cairn’s Production-
Sharing Contract beyond 2020, or extension at 
less favourable terms, may have implications.
We are in continuous dialogue with the Indian 
Government and relevant stakeholders. The Production-
Sharing Contract has certain in-built options for 
extension; Cairn has already applied for an extension 
and the matter is being pursued with all stakeholders.
   
Reliability and 
predictability 
in operational 
performance 
Our operations are subject to conditions and events 
beyond our control that could, among other matters, 
increase our mining, transportation or production 
costs, disrupt or halt operations at our mines, smelters 
and power plants and production facilities for 
varying lengths of time or even permanently. These 
conditions and events include disruptions in mining 
and production due to equipment failures, unexpected 
maintenance problems and other interruptions, 
non-availability of raw materials of appropriate 
quantity and quality for our energy requirements, 
disruptions to or increased cost of transport services 
or strikes and industrial actions or disputes.
Asset utilisation and cost of production (CoP) continues 
to be a priority. We carry out periodic benchmarking of 
CoP and other operational efficiencies with the objective 
of being in the top decile in all the businesses on CoP. 
We have employed reputable consultancy firms to 
advise on improving overall operational efficiencies.
A structured asset optimisation programme operates 
in the Group, and the role of the asset optimisation 
function in each business has been enlarged 
and elevated in the organisation structure. 
We are also pursuing savings and synergy initiatives 
in procurement and marketing in order to reduce 
costs and improve performance of our operations. 
The procurement initiatives include aspects such 
as optimising supplier portfolio and combining 
purchasing at Group level, combining logistics activities, 
improve asset flexibility to process a wider range of 
commodities and develop closer relationships with 
key vendors to get benchmark performance.

Risk Impact Mitigation
Fluctuation in 
commodity prices 
(including oil)
Prices and demand for the Group’s products are 
expected to remain volatile/uncertain and strongly 
influenced by global economic conditions. Volatility 
in commodity prices and demand may adversely 
affect our earnings, cash flow and reserves.
The Group has a well-diversified portfolio which acts 
as a hedge against fluctuations in commodities 
and delivers cash flows through the cycle.
Vedanta considers exposure to commodity price 
fluctuations to be an integral part of the Group’s business 
and its usual policy is to sell its products at prevailing 
market prices and not to enter into price hedging 
arrangements other than for businesses of custom 
smelting and purchased alumina, where back-to-back 
hedging is used to mitigate pricing risks. In exceptional 
circumstances we may enter into strategic hedging but 
only with prior approval of the Executive Committee. 
The Group monitors the commodity markets closely to 
determine the effect of price fluctuations on earnings, 
capital expenditure and cash flows. The CFO Committee 
reviews all commodity-related risks and suggests 
necessary courses of action as needed by business 
divisions. Our focus is on cost control and cost reduction.
   
Currency exchange 
rate fluctuations
Our assets, earnings and cash flows are influenced by a 
variety of currencies due to the diversity of the countries 
in which we operate. Fluctuations in exchange rates of 
those currencies may have an impact on our financials.
Although the majority of the Group’s revenue is tied to 
commodity prices that are typically priced by reference 
to the US dollar, a significant part of its expenses are 
incurred and paid in local currency. Moreover Group 
borrowings are significantly denominated in US dollars 
while a large percentage of cash and liquid investments 
are held in other currencies, mainly in the Indian 
rupee. Any material fluctuations of these currencies 
against the US dollar could result in lower profitability 
or in higher cash outflows towards debt obligations.
Vedanta does not speculate in forex. We have 
developed robust controls in forex management to 
hedge currency risk liabilities on a back-to-back basis.
The CFO Committee reviews our forex-related matters 
periodically and suggests necessary courses of action 
as may be needed by businesses from time to time, 
and within the overall framework of our forex policy.
We seek to mitigate the impact of short-term 
movements in currency on the businesses by 
hedging short-term exposures progressively based 
on their maturity. However, large or prolonged 
movements in exchange rates may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s businesses, operating 
results, financial condition and/or prospects. 
   
Political, legal and 
regulatory risk
We have operations in many countries around 
the globe, which have varying degrees of 
political and commercial stability.
The political, legal and regulatory regimes in 
the countries we operate in may result in higher 
operating costs, restrictions such as the imposition 
or increase in royalties or taxation rates, export 
duty, impact on mining rights/ban and change in 
legislation pertaining to repatriation of money.
We may also be affected by the political 
acts of governments including resource 
nationalisation and legal cases in these 
countries over which we have no control.
Vedanta, together with its business divisions, monitors 
regulatory and political developments on a continuous 
basis. Our focus has been on communicating 
responsible mining credentials through representations 
to Government and industry associations.
We continue to demonstrate the Group’s commitment 
to sustainability through actively engaging with 
proactive environmental, safety and CSR practices, 
including local community, media and NGOs.
We are SOX and SEC-related compliant organisations. 
We have an online portal for compliance monitoring. 
Appropriate escalation and review mechanisms are in 
place. Competent in-house legal organisation exists at 
all the businesses. A framework for monitoring against 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption guidelines is also in place.
   
Tax related matters 
Our businesses are in a tax regime and change in 
any tax structure may impact our profitability.
Vedanta has a robust organisation in place at business 
and Group level to handle tax-related matters. We 
engage, consult and take opinion from reputed tax 
consulting firms. Reliance is placed on appropriate legal 
opinion and precedence. Recently the Government 
has taken an aggressive stance against some of our 
Group companies in regards to their tax matters.
We continue to take appropriate legal opinions and 
actions on these matters to mitigate the impact of 
these actions on the Group and its subsidiaries.

Risk Impact Mitigation
Breaches in 
information/
IT security
Like many other global organisations, our reliance 
on computers and network technology is increasing. 
These systems could be subject to security breaches 
resulting in theft, disclosure or corruption of key/
strategic information. Security breaches could also 
result in misappropriation of funds or disruptions 
to our business operations. A cyber security breach 
could have an impact on business operations.
Appropriate organisation is in place at 
respective businesses for information and IT 
security. IT security policies and procedures 
are defined at individual businesses.
We seek to manage cyber security risk through 
increased standards, ongoing monitoring of threats and 
awareness initiatives throughout the organisation. An 
IT system is in place to monitor logical access controls.
We continue to carry out IT security reviews by experts 
periodically and improve IT security standards.
   
Community 
relations
The continued success of our existing operations 
and future projects are in part dependent upon 
broad support and a healthy relationship with the 
respective local communities. Failure to identify 
and manage local concerns and expectations can 
have a negative impact on relations with local 
communities and therefore affect the organisation’s 
reputation and social licence to operate and grow.
Establishing and maintaining close links with 
stakeholders is an essential part of our journey as a 
sustainable business. Our endeavour is to integrate 
our sustainability objectives into long-term planning. 
Vedanta’s approach to community development is 
holistic, long-term, integrated and sustainable, and 
is governed by two key considerations; the needs 
of the local people, and the development plan in 
line with the UN Millennium Development Goals. 
The Board’s Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) Committee decides the focus areas of 
all CSR activities, budget and programmes 
to be undertaken by businesses. 
Our business leadership teams have periodic 
engagements with all local communities to establish 
relations based on trust and mutual benefit. Our focus 
is on local consent prior to accessing resources. We seek 
to identify and minimise potential negative operational 
impacts and risks through responsible behaviour – 
acting transparently and ethically, promoting dialogue 
and complying with commitments to stakeholders.
We implement sustainability controls through the 
Vedanta Sustainable Development Framework aligned 
to IFC, ICMM and OECD standards. We work with and 
partner with global think tanks and institutional bodies 
such as WBCSD, CII and IUCN, and have introduced 
structured community development programmes 
to reduce water, energy and carbon consumption. 
We help communities identify their priorities 
through need assessment programmes and then 
work closely with them to design programmes 
that seek to make progress towards improvement 
in quality of life of the local communities.

Health, safety and 
environment (HSE)
The resources sector is subject to extensive 
health, safety, and environmental laws, 
regulations and standards. Evolving regulations, 
standards and stakeholder expectations could 
result in increased cost, litigation or threaten 
the viability of operations in extreme cases.
Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) is a high 
priority for Vedanta. Compliance with international 
and local regulations and standards, and protecting 
our people, communities and the environment 
from harm and our operations from business 
interruptions, are our key focus areas. 
Vedanta’s Board Sustainability Committee is 
chaired by a Non-Executive Director and includes 
the Group Chief Executive Officer, and meets 
periodically to discuss HSE performance.
We have appropriate policies and standards in place to 
mitigate and minimise any HSE-related occurrences. 
Structured monitoring and a review mechanism and 
system of positive compliance reporting is in place.
We have implemented a set of standards to align our 
sustainability framework in line with international 
practices. A structured sustainability assurance 
programme continues to operate in all business 
divisions. It covers environment, health, safety, 
community relations and human rights aspects, 
and embeds our operational commitment to HSE. 
HSE experts are also inducted from reputed Indian and 
global organisations to bring in best-in-class practices.
Each business has an appropriate policy in place 
for occupational health-related matters, supported 
by structured processes, controls and technology. 
Our operations ensure the issue of operational 
health and consequential potential risk/obligations 
are carefully handled. Depending on the nature of 
the exposure and surrounding risk, our operations 
have different levels of processes, controls and 
monitoring mechanisms. There is a strong focus 
on safety during project planning/execution with 
adequate thrust on contract workmen safety.
Fatal accidents and injury rates have declined. We are 
implementing programmes to eliminate fatalities and 
control injuries. Our leadership remains focused on a 
zero-harm culture across the organisation. Consistent 
application of ‘Life-Saving’ performance standards 
and quantitative risk assessments for all the critical 
areas/formal identification of process safety risks 
and focusing on the management of controls. We 
continue to improve on our safety investigations and 
follow-up processes. Further details of our HSE-related 
activities are included in the Sustainability section.

Risk Impact Mitigation
Talent/skill shortage 
risk
The Company’s efforts to continue its growth and 
efficient operations will place significant demand on its 
management resources. Our highly skilled workforce 
and experienced management team is critical to 
maintaining its current operations, implementing its 
development projects and achieving longer-term growth. 
Any significant loss or diminution in the collective 
pool of Vedanta’s executive management or other 
key team members could have a material effect on its 
businesses, operating results and future prospects.
We continue to invest in initiatives to widen our 
talent pool. We have a talent management system 
in place to identify and develop internal candidates 
for critical management positions and processes 
to identify suitable external candidates.
Our performance management system is designed 
to provide reward and remuneration structures and 
personal development opportunities to attract and 
retain key employees. A structured programme 
maps critical positions and ensures all such 
positions are filled with competent resources.
Our progressive HR policies and strong HR leadership 
have ensured that career progression, job rotation and 
job enrichment are focus areas for our businesses. 
We have established the Mining Academy in Rajasthan to 
develop an employee pool with enhanced underground 
mining skills. We also have a structured programme 
to develop a technically proficient employee pool.
   
Loss of assets or 
profit due to natural 
calamities
Our operations may be subject to a number of 
circumstances not wholly within the Group’s 
control. These include damage to or breakdown of 
equipment or infrastructure, unexpected geological 
variations or technical issues, extreme weather 
conditions and natural disasters, any of which 
could adversely affect production and/or costs.
Vedanta has taken appropriate Group insurance 
cover to mitigate this risk. We have appointed 
an external agency to review the risk portfolio 
and adequacy of this cover and to assist us in our 
insurance portfolio. Our underwriters are reputed 
institutions and have capacity to underwrite 
our risk. There is an established mechanism of 
periodic insurance review in place at all entities. 
However, any occurrence not fully covered by insurance 
could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business.
   
The Group’s 
reported results 
could be adversely 
affected by the 
impairment of 
assets 
The change in carrying value of assets 
depends on various assumptions. The change 
in any of those assumptions may impact 
the useful life and its carrying value.
We maintain a close watch on various 
business drivers that could impact impairment 
assessment. There is continuous focus, 
monitoring and periodic review of our assets.
We also periodically review the assumptions, 
carry out testing and reassess the useful life of 
these assets with the help of reputable firms. 
Vedanta reviews the carrying value of its assets 
and long-term price assumptions. In view of the 
steep drop in oil prices, the Company has impaired 
US$4.5 billion (net of tax) of carrying values.

Liquidity risk
The Group may not be able to meet its payment 
obligations when due or be unable to borrow funds 
in the market at an acceptable price to fund actual 
or proposed commitments. A sustained adverse 
economic downturn and/or suspension of its operation 
in any business, effecting revenue and free cash flow 
generation, may cause some stress on the Company’s 
financing and covenant compliance and its ability to 
raise financing at competitive terms. Any constraints on 
upstreaming of funds from the subsidiaries to the Group 
may affect the liquidity position at the Group level.
The Group generates sufficient cash flows from 
current operations which, together with the available 
cash and cash equivalents and liquid financial asset 
investments, provide short-term and long-term liquidity.
The volume ramp up and our efforts to optimise opex 
and capex are expected to provide cash flow that will 
reduce gearing in the medium term. Cairn India has 
announced a reduction in capex, which will help to 
maintain positive free cash flows at current oil prices 
and retain the flexibility to invest in growth projects as 
oil price improves and costs are further optimised. 
Anticipated future cash flows and undrawn committed 
facilities are expected to be sufficient to meet the 
ongoing capital investment programme and liquidity 
requirement of the Group in the foreseeable future. 
The Group has sufficient experience in raising and 
refinancing debt (c.US$35 billion over the past 
decade) and has in the past been able to tap diverse 
sources of funding to meet its needs. This will help 
mitigate the execution risk around this risk.
The Group has a strong Balance Sheet 
that gives sufficient flexibility to raise 
further debt should the need arise. 
The Group is further committed to further 
simplify the structure which will help improve 
cash fungibility and hence lower liquidity risk.

Our strategy to sustainable development
Alongside delivering high-quality assets and 
low-cost operations, our Sustainable Development 
Model is integral to Vedanta’s core business 
strategy and helps us conduct our business in  
line with our values of trust, entrepreneurship, 
innovation, excellence, integrity and sustainability.
It is made up of three pillars Responsible Stewardship, 
Building Strong Relationships and Adding & Sharing 
Value, based on our strategy to deliver long-term 
sustainability as shown in the diagram. In FY2015  
we added a fourth pillar: Strategic Communications, 
this reflects our dedication to transparency and to 
engage with all stakeholders. All these pillars capture 
the steps we must take to ensure a long-term, 
successful future for our business – meeting our 
strategic goals of growth, long-term value and 
sustainable development. The development of our 
Sustainable Development Framework over the last 
few years provides us with a robust structure to 
deliver this supported by our Sustainable 
Development Model pillars.
Our model and framework is aligned to global  
best practice standards, including the United 
Nations Global Compact’s (UNGC) 10 principles,  
the International Finance Corporation, the 
International Council on Mining and Metals and 
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development. This consistently rigorous approach 
has helped us win over 40 awards from external 
agencies during the year, which are detailed in our 
Sustainable Development Report 2014–15.
Implementing our strategy
We have created a management framework  
to put our Sustainable Development Model  
into practice. We are committed to ensuring  
this Framework is followed and managed in  
all our operations and new projects as part  
of our sustainability journey. Our goal is for the 
Framework to be delivered by all employees and 
embedded in every decision we take, ensuring 
what we do is safe, ethical and transparent. 
Commit, Connect, Care. 
Our Approach to Sustainability
We are committed to partnering nations in their 
journey of growth, by exploring the potential of 
natural resources. In doing so, we are committed  
to ensure a zero harm culture for our planet  
and people. Our transparent and continuous 
engagement with our stakeholders connect 
working partnerships and builds long-lasting 
relationships with our stakeholders. We care  
by demonstrating a purpose beyond profits.

is fundamental to keeping us on track and the 
Vedanta Sustainability Assurance Programme 
(VSAP) drives compliance with the Framework. 
Results and action plans are reviewed by our 
Executive and Sustainability Committees. 
Going forward, global partnerships such as our 
involvement with the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development, UNGC and the Global 
Reporting Initiative will become increasingly 
important to challenge ourselves to go further. 
We also intend to share more experiences with 
sector peers and other global businesses.
Sustainability governance
Embedding sustainability into day-to-day business 
requires leadership from all levels, and ultimate 
accountability lies with the Vedanta Board. The Board 
oversees and reviews sustainability performance of 
the Group through its Sustainability Committee and 
Executive Committee. The committee’s Chairman 
and Group CEO regularly updates the Board on its 
progress. Our policies and guidance notes are 
available to all employees through the corporate 
website, subsidiary portals and through periodic 
awareness-training sessions.
Our business gives rise to a number of social and 
environmental impacts, both positive and negative. 
Along with our stakeholders, we prioritise which of 
these issues we will tackle, and when. The process 
by which we determine what is material, i.e. what 
is most significant to our stakeholders and our 
business is referred to as completing a materiality 
review, detailed in our Sustainable Development 
Report 2014–15. 
In FY2015, we repeated our materiality review to 
understand if stakeholder priorities had changed. 
We found that ethics and integrity, community 
engagement and impact, public policy and 
advocacy, child and forced labour have become 
more prominent issues over the year, while other 
priorities remain consistent with the previous year 
and therefore we have focused on providing 
greater detail on these issues in our SD Report.
A fair and transparent business
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code) 
provides a set of principles to guide our employees, 
while our Sustainable Development Framework 
outlines best practice standards that drive 
improvement consistently across all operations.
The Code covers issues from human rights, insider 
trading and political contributions; to competition, 
conflicts of interest and confidentiality. It provides 
guidelines for all businesses to assist employees 
in meeting high standards of personal and 
professional integrity. Training in our Code is 
mandatory for all new hires. In total 24,068 man 
hours of training in Human Rights and Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics was given to all our 
employee’s and contractors.
A key focus is absolute intolerance to fraud, bribery 
and corruption and we welcome the Indian 
Government’s policy in recent years to confront this. 
Despite our predominant presence being in India, 
we are held to account by laws in the United States, 
United Kingdom and Europe, due to our dual listing. 
Therefore, if we suspect malpractice anywhere in 
our operations, we undertake a rigorous 
investigation under the UK Fraud and Bribery Act. 
We report to global standards of excellence
In line with the Strategic Communications pillar 
of our Sustainable Development Model, our 
reporting is transparent, credible and rigorous.  
It covers the full scope of our operations; is aligned 
to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 and  
is externally verified. It also integrates all 10 
principles of the United Nations Global Compact 
and all eight Millennium Development Goals.

Safety and health 
Protecting the safety, health and wellbeing of 
those who work for us is a business imperative.  
Our stakeholders recognise this and have rated 
safety and health as our highest strategic priority. 
In a geographically diverse business like ours, 
where attitudes to health and safety can vary, 
fostering a culture of zero harm is no easy 
challenge. Our Sustainable Development 
Framework points us to the highest recognised 
global standards, while continuous auditing and 
decisive leadership drive compliance. 
In FY2015, 756,643 hours of safety training  
were delivered to employees and contractors  
on subjects including working at height, permit  
to work, job safety analysis, first aid, incident 
reporting and safe behaviour. 
We are seeing tangible outcomes of this  
safety drive, with fewer fatalities and lost time  
injuries. However, any unsafe incident is entirely 
unacceptable and tragically, eight employees  
died due to work-related causes over the year.  
Five were in India and three in Africa. Each fatality 
has been fully investigated with each subsidiary 
company’s Chief Executive or Chief Operating 
Officer presenting a detailed appraisal of the root 
causes of each fatality to the Board’s Sustainability 
Committee and updating them on action plans 
in response. 
During the reporting year, all sites conducted 
medical examinations for staff. In Liberia we 
conducted screenings for Ebola and supported 
employees and their communities with aid parcels. 
A further 87 sites became OHSAS 18001 certified 
(FY2014: 85%) for occupational health and safety 
management.

Environment 
We are conscious that our operations give rise to 
negative environmental impacts, from gas and 
particulate emissions and hazardous waste, to 
water extraction and landscape modification. We 
manage our footprint to the most stringent global 
standards throughout the project life cycle and, 
over FY2015, invested US$61.5 million to research 
new and innovative ways of protecting the 
environment and to bring efficiency savings to 
our bottom line.

We have developed specific environmental 
objectives and targets and review performance 
particularly with regard to energy and water 
management. We are proud to report zero serious 
environmental incidents over the year (compared 
to one in FY2014). Our goal is to obtain ISO 14001 
certification at all sites and 46/52 operations are 
now certified. All subsidiary businesses have been 
assessed with environmental gaps identified in 
energy, water management, greenhouse gas 
emissions and biodiversity management plans. 
Action plans are now in place to address these.
Water 
As well as championing the universal right to 
water, we also strive to reduce our operational 
consumption. Our mining, smelting and refining 
processes use considerable quantities of water, 
often in regions of drought. 
Our approach is outlined in our Water Policy  
and delivered through our Water Management 
Standard. We facilitate the integration of water 
management into decision-making processes for 
new and existing projects, which helps ensure all 
necessary measures to avoid, minimise or, in some 
cases, compensate for the impacts of our projects 
that are in place. This includes an obligation for  
all our subsidiary businesses to conduct a water 
screening assessment to identify sensitive water 
resources, aquatic habitats and any known or 
suspected water resource constraints in proximity 
to each operation. 
Most of our subsidiary businesses now have a 
Water Resources Management Plan in place to 
eliminate, minimise, mitigate and manage impacts 
on water resources. Total water conservation levels 
reached 7.38 million cubic meters (MCM), against a 
target of 2.49MCM for FY2015. 
Most of our operational processes have been 
designed to be ‘zero discharge’, where the 
generated waste water is treated and recycled 
for cooling and other applications. In addition to 
these initiatives, effluent and sewage treatment 
plants are installed at many locations for reusing 
water at primary locations.
Energy and climate change
As an extractive industry, we have a profound 
responsibility to address the planet’s undisputed 
warming and to adapt to future impacts. It 
remains a high-profile challenge, with many of our 
operating countries (such as India, Australia and 
African nations) predicted to experience the worst 
impacts of a changing climate. 
Our Energy and Carbon Policy mandates that all 
subsidiary businesses must apply global best practice 
to minimise greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 
energy use, looking to energy management 
standards such as ISO 50001, and deploying the 
latest technology to optimise efficiencies. Although 
reducing our GHG emissions is a challenge as the 
majority of our operating sites are in developing 
countries where sources of renewable energy are 
limited, we fully support the global campaign to 
reduce GHG emissions. The management plans and 
improvement projects are in place to address this 
challenge. We calculate and report Green House Gas 
inventory i.e. Scope 1 (process emissions and other 
direct emissions) and Scope 2 (purchased electricity) 
as defined under the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and World 
Resource Institute (WRI) GHG protocols.
During FY2015, we conducted internal 
benchmarking on energy consumption among 
all our subsidiaries, and we are pleased to report 
that we met our energy targets over the year, 
saving 0.92 million gigajoules.
The right to water
A staggering 1.8 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water, 
while 4 billion are without adequate sanitation. In India, the Government 
has announced that all households will have ‘complete’ sanitation by 2019.
In 2014–15, we pledged universal access to safe Water, Sanitation and 
Hygiene (WASH) in the workplace, an initiative of the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development, which brings businesses together to create a 
sustainable future. Going forward, we will be using a modified version of the 
WASH water tool appropriate to our operations.
“It has been highly valuable to have Vedanta Resources on board the 
WASH Pledge. The Company is at the forefront of leadership on WASH 
issues not only in the Indian business space but also in its industry. The 
Company is sending a strong message to the global business community 
that business can and should make a concrete contribution to the societal 
goals surrounding water, sanitation and hygiene.”

Building strong relationships
Our ongoing dialogue with those 
affected by our presence is now 
firmly embedded in our Sustainable 
Development Model. Two-way 
communication, humility and 
transparency help us connect with 
stakeholders and build a business fit 
for the future.
What we focus on:
Stakeholder engagement
We stand by our philosophy of transparency and 
believe that anyone should be able to voice their 
opinions; that they should be listened to; and that 
they can expect a considered and constructive 
response. This is the basis for connecting with 
others and building strong relationships.
To illustrate the importance we place in this, we 
have added Strategic Communications as a fourth 
pillar to our Sustainable Development Model. This 
reflects the emphasis we place on partnership-
working and also global trends of consumerism in 
emerging markets meaning that more people than 
ever have an interest in commodity production. 
We have identified six stakeholder groups that 
have a significant interest in our operations, 
formally consulting with every group on other 
issues throughout the year.
• Communities
• Shareholders and investors
• Industry (suppliers, customers, peers)
• Employees
• Civil society (non-governmental and other 
organisations)
• Governments
Looking ahead
• Conduct an externally-moderated 
stakeholder engagement workshop on 
sustainability
• Consolidate all stakeholder engagements 
through a centralised IT system
Human rights
Our Human Rights Policy is aligned to the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
and includes strict prohibition of child and forced 
labour – either directly or through contract labour. 
Additionally, our Code of Conduct commits us 
to comply with all relevant national laws and 
regulations, underpinning our approach to 
protecting the fundamental rights of our 
employees and contract workforce. 
Human rights training is an integral part of our 
Sustainable Development Framework with around 
27,068 man hours of training on Human Rights and 
the Code of Conduct given in FY2015. We support 
collective bargaining and recognise unions, with 
systems for employee development, remuneration 
and grievance redress. Our rigorous Environmental 
and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) include the 
obligation to undertake human rights screening 
in all new acquisition activities (none in FY2015). 
Under the leadership of the Vedanta Sustainability 
Committee, we carried out internal due diligence 
on the UN Human Rights principles for all Vedanta 
operations. This included risk assessments to

identify potential human rights and child labour 
related risks. The assessment confirmed that  
the Human Rights Policy is being effectively 
implemented by all units. The assessment further 
highlighted the need for periodic internal capacity 
building around implementing our human rights 
standards.
Protecting children and indigenous people
Despite operating in countries where the risk 
of child labour may be high, during FY2015 no 
instances of child labour in our operations came to 
the Group’s attention. We ensure that contractors 
and vendors understand our expectations with 
guidance provided to sites to eliminate any breach. 
We also carry out periodic inspections of our 
remote mine locations and require age proof 
identification for all contract workers.
The Group’s standards and guidance note on  
the subject was rolled out to support the 
implementation of our related technical standard. 
The core aim of the standard is to enable our 
project teams to engage, negotiate and partner 
with these vulnerable groups in a manner that 
avoids negative impacts and risks for all 
stakeholders, especially the indigenous peoples 
and vulnerable tribes. It also outlines our desire to 
create opportunities for positive economic and 
social development, within the context of the 
unique requirements of these groups.
Community engagement 
We are privileged visitors to some of the world’s 
most remote and underdeveloped regions. We 
have a duty to respect, learn from and create a 
shared understanding with those who host us. 
Connecting with our communities is not just the 
right thing to do, it is fundamental to our licence 
to operate.
We believe local communities, particularly 
indigenous peoples, have the right to participate in 
decision making about access to natural resources 
and engage with them through Group meetings, 
public hearings, grievance mechanisms, cultural 
events, and philanthropical activities via The 
Vedanta Foundation. 
Our community grievance processes are a key 
step in preventing concerns from escalating into 
significant issues or disputes, risking the viability 
of operations. 
Our community grievance processes are a key 
step in preventing concerns from escalating into 
significant issues or disputes, risking the viability 
of operations. All public grievances are resolved 
as per our Grievance Redressal Technical Standard. 
All community incidents and grievances are 
recorded and categorised as negligible (1), minor 
(2), moderate (3), serious (4) or disastrous (5), and 
captured on a monthly basis.

Vedanta’s biggest-ever community 
needs assessment, India
Understanding community needs and expectations is a complex and 
sensitive process. In FY2015, we completed our most comprehensive, 
structured and collaborative community engagement to date. In partnership 
with governmental and non-governmental organisations, a detailed needs 
assessment was carried out for every community adjacent to our sites.
Drawing on dedicated local personnel to act as conduits between business 
and community, we undertook around 3,500 village and community meetings 
and around 260 panchayat meetings (village self-governments). Each 
community group had the opportunity to voice their opinions; the main 
concerns we heard were around livelihoods and the environment (primarily 
water and soil quality).
Going forward, we will be working with communities to help them 
understand our business better, including a focus on environmental hazards. 
A challenge will be managing expectations arising from this consultation. For 
example, where we cannot provide employment we will explore vocational 
training, entrepreneurship options (focusing on women) and other 
employability routes. The needs assessment will be repeated in three to four 
years’ time. It will be followed with rigorous assessment of projects against 
the needs of the community.
No category 4 or 5 incidents were recorded in 
FY2015, although lower-level incidents such as 
village road blockages and strikes were recorded, 
particularly related to employment and contractor 
issues, infrastructure projects and some operational 
issues including land and traffic management.

Adding and sharing value
We care by demonstrating  
a purpose beyond profit.
What we focus on:
Economic value
We make an important contribution to socio-
economic development through job creation, 
taxes, access to commodities and infrastructure, 
community empowerment and social mobility. 
In doing so we demonstrate that our business has 
a purpose beyond profit.
Employees 
Around 82,000 people work hard at Vedanta every 
day to make it the success that it is. Every single 
employee can expect to be inspired to meet their 
potential; to feel empowered and united under 
shared values.
Our strategy is to build a culture of high-
performance, entrepreneurial innovation, while 
caring for and supporting everyone who works with 
us. To safeguard our future competitiveness, we 
also seek to identify and develop leadership skills; 
create a fair workplace free from discrimination; 
and respect human rights above all else. 
We are proud of the diversity of backgrounds we 
come from – different perspectives help us solve 
the complex challenges we face and make us 
more responsive to future risks and opportunities. 
Creating an inclusive workforce starts in the 
community and continues through our talent and 
development programmes. It means focusing 
specifically on equal opportunities for women, 
where we know we need to significantly improve 
our performance. 
It is beneficial for our business to hire people who 
understand the market and can engage effectively 
with contractors and suppliers. Ensuring managers 
are from the local area is particularly important 
in helping us relate to the issues faced by 
neighbouring communities, thus connecting 
our business and sustainability strategies. 
Over the reporting period, across our business, the 
total percentage of senior management who are 
locally hired is: India (87%), Australia (nil), Zambia 
(67%), Namibia (nil), Ireland (100%) and South 
Africa (75%). We believe that we must invest in 
developing and retaining key talent to drive 
innovation and efficiency within the business. In 
this regard, our attrition rate has remained stable 
and this year was reported at less than 5%.
Community impact
The communities in and around our operations 
should get a fair share of the benefits, whether 
through employment, trade and enhanced 
infrastructure, or greater empowerment to 
voice opinion. 
Our community investment strategy focuses on 
health, education, livelihoods and environment. 
In FY2015, we invested US$42m benefiting  
around 4.0m people globally through building 
hospitals, schools and infrastructure, developing 
employability skills, and engaging in community 
programmes. Please refer to our online Sustainable  43

activities on areas of focus over the year.
We believe that volunteering is a means of 
contributing to our local communities and a way 
to engage our employees, particularly when 
employees co-create community initiatives. 
Employee volunteering has brought many 
additional advantages: it has fostered a greater 
sense of responsibility among our staff and helped 
create a more motivated team and united culture. 
Our role in industry
As the largest producer of aluminium, crude oil, 
copper and zinc-lead in India we make a significant 
contribution to the development and maturity of 
many markets. Due to the scale of our operations, 
we generate opportunities for downstream 
industries and support services, which has led 
to the growth of other industries which are 
capitalising on the increased availability of 
domestic raw materials. 
Sourcing locally benefits local economies and 
governments, contributes to reducing our carbon 
footprint and can improve skills development and 
training in areas such as health and safety, as well 
as making improvements to local infrastructure. 
All our activities are focused on ensuring customer 
needs are met in an appropriate and timely 
manner, including assisting our customers with 
technical issues and product development for first 
use. Customer satisfaction surveys are conducted 
periodically by external third parties. 
In FY2014, SAP – Supplier Relation Management 
systems – were rolled out across the business. No 
cases of non-compliance with relevant regulations, 
anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust, monopoly 
and voluntary codes concerning the health and 
safety impacts of our products and services were 
reported. Similarly, no significant fines for non-
compliance with laws and regulations concerning 
the provision and use of products and services 
were reported. 
Our role in society
Positive relationships with our shareholders and 
lenders ensure that we are able, through access to 
finance, to expand and grow our business. As many 
lenders are aligned to the Equator Principles and 
International Finance Corporation standards, 
our Sustainable Development Framework and 
Model act as important tools. 
In order to meet the economic commitments 
that the business has with its finance providers,  
we invest in projects and businesses to drive the 
development of the Group asset base and increase 
production, and therefore sales. 
We have a progressive dividend policy and have 
returned US$1.6 billion in dividends to shareholders 
since the IPO in 2004. Since our IPO at 390 pence in 
December 2003, shareholders have seen a Total 
Shareholder Return of over 200% and we have paid 
a progressive dividend that was increased in nine 
out of 10 years and held constant for one year. 
At a broader level, we are committed to 
contributing to the development of democracy and 
democratic processes in the countries where we 
operate. We do this in a number of ways, including 
through membership of industry organisations and 
international bodies. In addition to contributing 
US$4.6 billion to host governments in tax revenue 
over the year and employing around 82,000 people 
directly and indirectly, we also supported 
governments in building infrastructure such as 
roads, housing, sanitation and healthcare facilities. 
Caption: ‘Sakhi’ – Women self-help group 
members at Sterlite Copper – Tuticorin
Championing women  
entrepreneurs, India
Sterlite Copper has been creating and supporting Sakhi (self-help groups) 
for rural women for 10 years and has formed 1,056 groups over this period, 
reaching 15,251 women participants. The Sakhis bring together 
governmental organisations and six non-governmental organisations  
(NGOs) under Vedanta’s vision of developing women entrepreneurs to  
create social mobility and economic empowerment.
Training is offered in book-keeping, leadership and decision-making, and 
members receive assistance to grow income-generating enterprises  
ranging from prawn pickle processing to dried flower production; candle 
making to rabbit rearing.
Groups are based on principles of fairness and democracy and are born  
out of a needs assessment to understand the issues and barriers facing 
women. For example, many women have reported a lack of access to  
credit as a barrier and thus microfinance has become a key focus of Sakhis.
As a result of these self-help groups, women are earning an average of 
US$48 a month more than they were previously, a relatively large sum in 
rural Tamil Nadu. Furthermore, many have secured loans ranging from 
US$800 to over US$6,000 to grow their enterprises. The collective savings  
of the Group during the reporting period was US$642,000, a milestone in  
the Sakhi goal of being self-sufficient in funding. 44 Strategic report We are Vedanta

Annual report and accounts FY2015
Finance review
Our total revenue for the year was US$12.9 billion, 
in line with the previous year and despite a  
weaker commodity environment. We believe  
this demonstrates the underlying strength of  
our diversified portfolio of assets. 
Vedanta delivered EBITDA of US$3.7 billion, a 
decrease of 17% due to the negative impact of the 
commodity price environment, lower volumes and 
consequently higher unit costs across a number of 
businesses, principally the Zinc operations, Cairn 
India and Copper Zambia. Average Brent for the 
year was down 21% and LME copper down 8%. 
Iron ore prices were down 39%, however this  
did not have a material impact on EBITDA given 
the low production volumes. Strong operational 
performances at Copper India and Aluminium and 
a better price environment for Zinc and Aluminium 
mitigated some of the downside. 
Average EBIDTA margin (excluding custom 
smelting) for the year continues to remain healthy 
at 38%, despite the weaker commodity prices 
largely due to continued strength in our Zinc 
businesses and improving margins in Aluminium 
and Copper India. 
Special items principally include asset impairments 
of US$4.5 billion (net of tax) in FY2015. This largely 
relates to the Oil & Gas business, and was triggered 
by a steep fall in Brent prices which were down 
50% in Q4 compared to the beginning of the year. 
Excluding special items, profit before tax was 
down only 12% despite a higher decline in EBITDA, 
largely owing to lower net interest and lower 
depreciation charges. Profit after tax at $751 
million, was down 32%. The tax charge was higher 
in FY2015 in comparison to FY2014 primarily due 
to the effect of a one-off tax credit in FY2014. 
Underlying EPS at loss (14.2) US cents was lower 
than FY2014 at 14.7 US cents.
Volumes
Whilst higher production volumes in Copper India, 
the recommencement of iron ore production in 
Karnataka and the commissioning of a new power 
plant at Talwandi Sabo helped increase operating 
profit, this was more than offset by lower volumes 
in our Zinc businesses, Oil & Gas and Copper 
Zambia.
In our Zinc International business, production was 
affected by a few unplanned maintenance shut 
downs and a fire at Skorpion in January 2015. 
Production also declined as the Lisheen mine nears 
the end of its life. 
In India, zinc production volumes in the first half 
of the year were affected by lower mined metal 
production and the temporary lower silver grades 
at Sindesar Khurd.
In our Oil & Gas business, volumes were marginally 
lower as a result of a 10-day planned maintenance 
shutdown in the first half, and a temporary 
disruption of gas production.
Production at Copper Zambia was primarily 
affected by remediation and critical maintenance 
being carried out on the shafts and lower grades 
at Nchanga. 
Together the above factors impacted operating 
profit before special items by US$153.2 million. 
CMT, our copper mines in Australia remains under 
care and maintenance following a mud rush 
incident in January 2014 reducing operating profit 
by US$37.2 million. 
Prices
The operating profit before special items of a 
number of our businesses have been significantly 
affected by the changes in commodity prices.
Oil & Gas: Brent prices fell sharply in the second 
half of FY2015 reducing operating profit by 
US$543 million.

Copper: Average LME copper prices were down 8% 
in FY2015 compared to the previous year adversely 
affecting Zambian operating profit by US$61 million.
Lead and Silver: Average lead prices were down 
3% and silver down 15%, together these reduced 
operating profit by US$40 million.
Power: Lower energy prices, following reduced 
short-term demand, had an adverse effect of 
US$38 million.
These negative impacts totalling US$682 million 
were partly offset by increases in the average zinc 
and aluminium prices of 14% and 7% respectively. 
This, in combination with stronger premia in both 
the businesses, resulted in a positive offset of 
US$439 million (zinc US$279 million, aluminium 
US$160 million). Stronger TcRc’s in Copper India 
contributed US$39 million, giving an overall 
adverse net price impact of US$182 million.
Foreign exchange fluctuation
Local currencies weakened versus the US dollar, 
increasing our profitability by reducing locally 
denominated costs in US dollar terms.
The Indian rupee: US$ exchange rate at the 
beginning of FY2015 was 60.10 Indian rupees 
per US$, closing at 62.59 Indian rupees per 
US$ at the year end. The average exchange 
rate for FY2015 was 61.15 Indian rupees per 
US$, a marginal increase of 1.1% compared 
to the average of 60.50 Indian rupees per US$ 
for FY2014. This improved operating profits by 
US$87 million. In FY2015 the movements in 
currencies other than the India rupee had a 
nil net impact compared to the prior year.
Costs of production
Unit costs across our businesses have been 
affected by lower volumes, regulatory headwinds 
in the form of higher royalties and coal availability:
• Oil & Gas: Costs were adversely affected by 
US$99 million due to higher processing and  
well maintenance costs and the expense of  
the 10 day planned shutdown.
• Zinc India: A negative effect of US$93 million, 
principally comprised higher royalty charges 
of US$56 million (including contributions to a 
new ‘District Mineral Fund’ at 33% of the royalty 
rate), together with long-term wage settlements 
and coal cost increases also driven by regulatory 
issues. 
• Aluminium: Whilst operating profit in our 
Aluminium business has improved on the back 
of stronger prices and premia, the business has 
suffered higher coal and alumina costs, due to 
regulatory sourcing issues leading to an overall 
adverse impact of US$75 million.
• Copper Zambia: The additional costs incurred in 
addressing the shaft and equipment availability 
issues, combined with the US$15 million effect 
of the higher royalty rate, reduced profitability 
by US$55 million. 
The adverse cost impacts above, were partially 
mitigated by US$33 million of positive unit cost 
variances. These included higher acid credits at 
the Copper smelter at Tuticorin leading to lower 
net costs and improved efficiency at our power 
plant in Jharsuguda.
The net effect of the above was an adverse impact 
of around US$301 million on the operating profit 
before special items.
Profit petroleum

petroleum in Rajasthan block at Cairn India  
from 30% to 40% in FY2015 resulted most of

Depreciation
The Oil & Gas business realised a lower 
depreciation charge of US$120 million in the year. 
The expense is based on production, divided by the 
Group’s economic interest, which has increased as 
the interest accruing to partners has fallen in line 
with lower prices.
In accordance with its accounting policy, the Group 
carried out a review of the useful life of its assets. 
This was based on technical studies performed by 
an independent external agency and applying their 
recommendations with effect from 1 October 2014 
resulted in a US$71 million lower net charge 
compared to FY2014. 
The capitalisation of one unit of TSPL and 84 pots 
at Korba-II contributed to an increase in 
depreciation of US$8 million. The further 
commissioning of pots in Aluminium and the 
continued staged commissioning of power plants 
at BALCO IPP and TSPL, will increase the 
depreciation charge in FY2016. 
Amortisation
The reduction in amortisation charges in FY2015 
compared to the previous year was US$42 million, 
mainly attributable to lower volumes at Cairn India 
and Zinc International.
Others
An exploratory asset write off of US$129 million, 
largely pertaining to a deep gas well in the Ravva 
production block, offset by higher profitability from 
our smaller businesses (pig iron, phosphoric acids 
and precious metal), leads to a net reduction in 
operating profit before special items of US$42 
million. 
Revenue
Overall revenues, as explained earlier, were stable 
in FY2015. The table below indicates the movement 
by segment. Primarily, the fall in Oil & Gas revenue, 
as a result of lower Brent prices, has been offset by 
increased revenue in Zinc, Iron Ore, Copper, 
Aluminium and Power.
EBITDA for FY2015 is lower by 16.7% at US$3,741 
million. This was primarily due to reduction in Oil & 
Gas, Copper Zambia, Zinc International and Power 
businesses.
Further detail on the year-on-year variations are 
provided in the operational review.
EBITDA margin
In FY2015 EBITDA margin was 29% as compared to 
35% in FY2014. EBITDA margin excluding custom 
smelting was 38.0% and reduced from 44.5% in 
FY2014. The main drivers across key businesses 
were:
• Oil & Gas: The sharp decline in crude oil prices 
and the Ravva exploration asset write off.  47

Additional
information
Despite lower 
EBITDA, our 
average EBITDA 
margin excluding 
custom smelting 
remained healthy 
at 38%.
Our net debt has 
reduced since 
FY2012 whilst our 
operating free cash 
flow in FY2015 was 
US$1 billion.
• Zinc India: Higher prices and premia offset by 
higher royalty and wage settlement costs. 
• Zinc International: Higher prices offset by unit 
cost increases.
• Copper: Improvement in smelting margins in 
Copper India with higher TcRc’s; higher per unit 
costs as well as lower prices in Copper Zambia; 
and the full year effect of Australian assets 
being under care and maintenance.
• Aluminium: Higher costs driven coal and bauxite 
sourcing offset by higher prices and premia. 
Special items
Special items of US$6,744 million include a 
non-cash impairment charge of US$6,642 
(US$4,504 million net of tax) relating to the Oil & 
Gas business and US$52 million in Copper Zambia. 
The impairment in Oil & Gas was triggered by the 
steep fall in Brent oil prices. The non-cash charge 
includes US$5,854 million (US$3,716 million net  
of tax) on the Rajasthan and other units which 
includes both producing and exploratory assets 
and US$788 million on the Sri Lankan exploratory 
block. Key assumptions include the short-term (five 
years) oil price and the long-term nominal oil price 
of US$84 per barrel increasing at 2.5% per annum. 
The assumptions selected were consistent with the 
various available analyst pricing. 
The charge at the Vedanta Resources plc level  
is greater than that announced previously by 
Vedanta Limited (formerly Sesa Sterlite Limited) 
as additional carrying value was previously 
recognised on the acquisition of Cairn India in 
FY2012, as under IFRS were on 100% basis with a 
corresponding non-controlling interest, whereas 
under Indian Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles the fair value uplift only arose on 
the economic interest acquired. This non-cash 
impairment charge will not have any impact in 
the future operating or earnings capacity of the 
underlying assets. 
Copper Zambia impairment charge arose on the 
underground assets at Nchanga where the Upper 
Ore Body project started in 2008 was suspended 
due to ground conditions and existing mine 
infrastructure constraints. 
Other special items include the provision in respect 
of an investment in the cancelled coal block of the 
Company pursuant to a Supreme Court decision in 
September 2014, and a US$8 million provision in 
respect of a contractor dispute in Copper Zambia.
Net interest
Finance costs decreased by 4% to US$1,387 million 
in FY2015 (FY2014: US$1,440 million). This is largely 
due to refinancing at lower interest rates. The 
average borrowing cost of the Group is 7.5% per 
annum (8.0% in FY2014). 
Investment revenue increased to US$833 million, 
(FY2014: US$688 million), mainly at Zinc India and 
Cairn India, driven by higher treasury income on 
account of mark-to-market (MTM) gains accruing in 
a falling interest rate environment in India where 
most of the Group’s cash and investments reside. 
The combination of significantly higher investment 
revenues and lower finance cost led to a decrease 
of US$198 million in net interest expense for 
the year.
Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses include the impact of 
mark-to-market (MTM) on foreign currency 
borrowings, primarily at our Indian businesses and 
dollar denominated cash deposits at the Oil & Gas 
business. Depreciation in the Indian rupee against 
the US dollar during FY2015 was only around 
1% against an unprecedented 10% in FY2014. 
The FY2015 MTM cost of US$77 million was thus 
significantly lower than US$280 million in FY2014.
Taxation
The Effective Tax Rate (ETR) in FY2014 was 
primarily lower as a result of a tax credit of US$176 
million which arose on the restructuring of the 
Indian subsidiary Vedanta Limited (formerly Sesa 
Sterlite Limited). 
The tax charge, excluding special items, in FY2015 
is US$352 million (effective tax rate 32%) compared 
with US$158 million (effect tax rate 13%) in FY2014. 
Tax charge (with special items) in FY2015 includes 
a credit of US$2,205 million relating to the 
corresponding non-cash impairment charge and 
other special items described earlier. 
Attributable (loss)/profit
Attributable loss (before special items) was  
US$(75) million as compared to US$(123) million  
in the previous year, mainly driven by the weak 
commodity prices resulting in lower EBITDA,  
which includes a one time provision of 7% Gridco 
receivables US$45 million and exploratory asset 
write off at Cairn India US$88 million pertaining to 
a deep gas well in the Ravva production block. 
Further, it reduced due to the higher tax which  
was partially offset by lower depreciation and 
amortisation and the lower net interest expense. 
The attributable loss (including special items) at 
US$(1,799) million (FY2014 at US$196 million) is 
significantly greater largely due to the non cash 
impairments in the Oil & Gas business. 
Earnings per share
Basic EPS at loss (654.5) US cents (FY2014 loss 
(71.7) US cents) decreased significantly primarily 
as a result of the special items described above. 
Excluding the impact of specials items and other 
gains and losses, the underlying EPS was loss (14.2) 
US cents per share (FY2014 14.7 US cents).  48 Strategic report We are Vedanta

Shareholder’s equity was US$1,603 million at 
31 March 2015 compared to US$4,010 million at 
31 March 2014 reflecting largely the impact of the 
impairments and other special items of US$4,539 
million, adverse currency translation impact due to 
depreciation of the operating currencies against US 
dollar (mainly, the Indian rupee) of US$291 million, 
a decrease in equity attributable to shareholders by 
US$175 million on account of both the Cairn share 
buyback and stake acquisition in Vedanta Limited 
(formerly Sesa Sterlite Limited) representing 
difference between acquisition price and book 
value and the US$171 million dividend payment.
Tangible fixed assets
During the year, we invested US$1,752 million 
in property, plant and equipment; comprising 
of US$1,531 million on our expansion and 
improvement projects and US$221 million spent on 
sustaining capital expenditure. Expansion project 
expenses were US$1,080 million in our Oil & Gas 
business at Cairn India; US$167 million at Zinc 
India; US$142 million in the Power business mainly 
at Talwandi Sabo, US$145 million in our Aluminium 
business. 
Net debt
Gross debt as at 31 March 2015 was US$16,668 
million (31 March 2014: US$16,871 million). This 
reduction was mainly driven by the repayment of 
maturing debt (c.US$500 million of FCCBs) in the 
Copper business out of operating cash flows and 
devaluation of rupee denominated debt largely 
offset by the increase in borrowings primarily to 
fund capital expenditure in projects and some 
short-term operational needs.
The average debt in FY2015 was US$17,074 million. 
Given the significant repayments of debt in the 
second half of the year and lower capex in general, 
the closing debt position was lower at US$16,668 
million. The debt reduction in the second half was 
approximately US$600 million, driven by strong 
capital rationing and working capital management 
in a difficult commodity price environment.
Of our total gross debt (excluding working capital 
loans) of US$16.2 billion debt at our subsidiaries 
is US$8.4 billion, with the balance in the holding 
company. The future maturity profile of debt (in 
US$ billion) of Vedanta Resources plc is as follows:
A US$350 million loan has been arranged with the 
State Bank of India (SBI) at Vedanta Resources plc 
(of which US$25 million had been drawn as at 
31 March 2015), to meet the upcoming debt 
maturities. 
Of the US$2.1 billion debt maturing in subsidiaries 
during FY2016, almost US$1.6 billion is in the 
Aluminium and Power businesses. These maturities 
mainly relate to short-term loans which are 
expected to be refinanced from long-term sources 
in view of the softer interest rate regime in the 
Indian market. Cash and liquid investments were 
US$8,210 million at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: 
US$8,938 million).
Net debt increased by US$540 million to US$8,460 
million at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: US$7,920 
million). This increase is mainly due to the outflow 
of US$820 million in first half of the year towards 
the share buyback by Cairn India and the acquisition 
of a 5% stake in Vedanta Limited (formerly Sesa 
Sterlite Limited) by Vedanta Resources plc.  49

Operations
Average gross production for FY2015 
was 211,671 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day (boepd), 3% lower than the previous 
year. This was largely on account of 
planned maintenance activity at Mangala 
Processing Terminal at Rajasthan, higher-
than-expected water cuts at Bhagyam 
in Rajasthan and suspension of gas sales 
at Ravva for around three months as 
a result of the breakdown of the OMGC 
gas pipeline. This was partially offset by 
higher production at Cambay and better 
performance of the Mangala field in 
Rajasthan. In the Rajasthan block, the 
Aishwariya field crossed a production 
threshold of 30,000boepd in Q4 2015.
Both offshore assets have performed 
exceptionally well during the year. The 
Ravva block achieved over 30,000bopd 
in Q4 FY2015 after three and a half 
years, driven by successful application 
of 4D seismic technology, better-than-
expected results from the infill drilling 
programme and the contribution from 
the RE-6 exploration well. Production at 
Cambay grew 8% year-on-year, driven by 
successful well interventions and ramp-up.
Gas development in the Raageshwari 
Deep Gas (RDG) field in Rajasthan 
continues to be a priority. Management 
Committee approval has been received 
for the RDG Field Development Plan 
for 100 million standard cubic feet per 
day (mmscfd) production and work on 
execution, planning and contracting is 
under way. In FY2015, RDG gas production 
was 16mmscfd and is expected to 
increase to 25mmscfd during FY2016.
Crude oil prices fell sharply in the second 
half of FY2015 as a result of increasing 
supply, a lower demand outlook and OPEC’s 
decision to maintain production levels. 
Average Brent prices for the year reduced 
21% to US$85.4/bbl compared to FY2014.

The coming year
Outlook
Despite the partial deferral of capex, we 
expect production volumes to increase in 
FY2016 driven by our planned investment 
in the polymer flood at Mangala, the infill 
drilling across the Mangala Bhagyam 
and Aishwariya fields, infrastructure 
debottlenecking and maintenance projects. 
Additionally, production upside in the 
near-term will come from other growth 
projects where we retain the flexibility and 
agility to switch on projects as they clear 
investment thresholds as oil prices improve.
In exploration, Cairn India will prioritise 
capital allocation for low-risk, high-
potential prospects. Cairn India plans 
to spend around 15% of next year’s 
capex on appraisal, testing and 
seismic activity across our assets. 
Our strategic priorities
• Rajasthan development.
• Sustaining production at MBA fields 
through EOR, drilling campaign and 
facilities upgrade.
• To target world-class recovery and next 
generation of resources at Barmer Hill.
• Leverage gas potential through phased 
development ramp-up.
• Increase recovery from mature assets 
through infill drilling, technology 
adoption and development of satellite 
fields.
• Continue exploration and appraisal 
programme across the portfolio, focusing 
on Rajasthan.
• Pursue extension of Production Sharing 
Contracts.
Financial performance
Revenue for the year was US$2,398 million, 
(after profit and royalty sharing with the 
Government of India), driven by weaker 
crude prices. As a result, EBITDA for  
FY2015 was lower by 37% at US$1,477 
million. Overall operating costs in Rajasthan 
were US$5.8/bbl, an increase compared with 
US$3.9/bbl in FY2014 due to higher 
processing and increased well maintenance 
costs.
In line with global peers, we have revised 
capex for FY2016 from US$1.2 billion to 
US$0.5 billion, while deferring the rest. 
Of this around 45% has been allocated 
to core fields, 40% to growth projects and 
remaining 15% for exploration. Further, 
we will undertake projects that are 
economically viable at current oil prices, 
while actively re-engineering projects 
and renegotiating contracts to improve 
viability. We have spent US$1.1 billion in 
FY2015 out of the announced programme 
of US$3.0 billion, thus retaining the flexibility 
to invest the remaining US$1.4 billion in 
the future as oil prices improve and more 
projects clear investment thresholds. 
In the core fields, our focus continues 
to be completing the polymer flood EOR 
project at Mangala, continued infill drilling 
in our onshore fields and maintenance 
projects at Mangala Port Terminal. 
The Management Committee approved 
the Raageshwari Deep Gas FDP for 
100mmscfd and contracting for this 
project is currently under way. The two key 
packages for this project will be the pipeline 
and the gas terminal EPCs. Likewise, an 
application has been submitted to PNGRB 
regarding the authorisation of a pipeline 
under their policy for Tie-in Provisions. 
The Terminal EPC is presently in the 
tendering process and the gas project is 
expected to be completed by the end of 
FY2017 subject to regulatory approvals. 
Exploration and development
Since the recommencement of exploration 
in the Rajasthan block in March 2013, across 
FY2014–FY2015, Cairn India has made 12 
new discoveries and has drilled and tested 
1.5 billion boe of in-place hydrocarbons 
with an additional 0.8 billion boe drilled 
but yet to be tested. Additionally, Cairn 
has discovered 2C of 183 million boe in 
Rajasthan since resuming exploration. An 
additional 166 million boe of Prospective 
2C has been drilled and awaits testing. 
In FY2015, Cairn delivered the largest 
Exploration and Appraisal programme 
in its history, with 12 exploration and 22 
appraisal wells drilled; totalling 34 wells 
during the year. Of the exploration wells 
drilled in the year, nine encountered 
hydrocarbons. In FY2015, six additional 
discoveries were announced taking 
the total number of discoveries since 
resuming exploration to 12. 
During the next financial year, activity will 
continue to be focused upon appraisal of 
the Raageshwari Deep Gas Field and the key 
oil discoveries at DP, NL and V&V, with the 
objective of progressing these discoveries 
to development. Future programmes will 
also focus on identification of additional 
prospects that will act to replenish the 
inventory of exploration prospects. 
At the KG offshore block, detailed planning 
for the exploration drilling campaign is 
under way and drilling is anticipated in 
the first half of FY2016. In South Africa, 
the Group continues to interpret the 3D 
and 2D seismic data across its block and 
add to Prospective inventory with parallel 
discussions ongoing with our joint venture 
partner on contractual terms. In Sri Lanka, 
whilst the Group has taken a non-cash 
impairment charge, it will continue to seek 
solutions and options to farm out interests. 54 Strategic report We are Vedanta

Annual report and accounts FY2015
Operations
Mined metal production for the full year 
was 887,000 tonnes, marginally higher 
than a year ago, achieving a new annual 
record. Production in the second half of 
FY2015 was higher than the first half. This 
increase is in line with the mine plans for 
Rampura Agucha and Sindesar Khurd. 
Integrated refined zinc, lead and silver 
metal production reduced by 3%, 5% 
and 11% respectively over FY2014 due 
to lower mined metal production in the 
first half and lower silver grades at the 
Sindesar Khurd mine. In accordance with 
its mine plan, silver grade is expected 
to improve in the next year. However, 
higher mined metal production volumes 
over the second half of FY2015 added to 
the mined metal inventory, a large part 
of which will be consumed in FY2016.
Zinc prices gathered strength during the 
year despite a weak start. This was driven 
by improving demand in India and the 
continued global demand-supply gap. LME 
zinc prices averaged US$2,177 per tonne 
compared to US$1,909 per tonne over 
the same period in FY2014, an increase of 
14%. Lead average prices weakened by 3% 
on the back of marginally higher supply 
and lower demand. Average silver prices 
reduced significantly by 15% in line with 
the general weakness in precious metals 
against the backdrop of a stronger US dollar.
Unit costs
The unit cost of zinc production increased 
by 12% to US$1,093 per tonne, compared 
to FY2014. This was due to a higher royalty, 
higher landed coal cost and increased 
employee expense due to long-term wage 
settlements partly offset by higher acid 
credits and lower fuel costs. In India the 
zinc and lead royalty rates were increased 
from 8.4% to 10.0% and from 12.7% to 
14.5% respectively, effective 1 September, 
2014. At these levels, these are amongst 
the highest in the world and higher than 
other base metals. In addition, an amount 
equal to 35% of royalty was provided 
with effect from 12 January 2015 for the 
contribution to the proposed District Mineral 
Fund (DMF) (33%) and National Mineral 
Exploration Trust (NMET) (2%), ahead of 
notification for these under the Mines 
and Mineral Development and Regulation 
(Amendment) Act 2015 (MMDRA).

Financial performance
EBITDA for FY2015 increased to US$1,193 
million, compared with US$1,145 million 
during FY2014. This increase was mainly 
due to higher zinc LME prices and premia, 
which were partially offset by a reduction 
in lead and silver prices, lower metal sales 
volumes and higher cost of production.
Projects
HZL is in the midst of a transition from open 
cast to underground mining. Historically, 
open cast mining has accounted for about 
80% of total MIC production, which in 
future will be replaced by underground 
mines. Open cast production will gradually 
taper off and by FY2021, all production 
will be from the underground mines. The 
announced expansion of Rampura Agucha 
open pit will extend open pit life giving 
a sufficient cushion for underground 
transition. The ultimate open pit depth 
will go down by 50 metres to 420 metres, 
with preparatory work having started in 
Q4 FY2015. Underground expansion is 
progressing well, and for FY2016, significant 
progress is expected in terms of mine 
development and ore production. 
HZL is enhancing its ore production capacity 
in Sindesar Khurd by 50%, from 2mt to 
3mt. The shaft sinking project at Sindesar 
Khurd is ahead of schedule with the main 
shaft sinking almost complete, having 
reached the depth of over 1km of the 
planned depth of 1.05km. Development 
of associated infrastructure is also 
progressing well and production from 
the shaft is planned to commence ahead 
of schedule, in the latter half of 2018.
The progress of the underground shaft 
project at Rampura Agucha is behind 
schedule and has reached a depth of 650 
metres of the planned depth of 950 metres. 
With the planned extension of the open 
cast mine, overall production from Rampura 
Agucha is expected to remain on track. 
Exploration
During the year, gross additions of 
19.4mt were made to reserves and 
resources (R&R), prior to a depletion of 
9.4mt. Total R&R at 31 March 2015 were 
375.1mt, containing 35.3mt of zinc-lead 
metal and 970moz of silver. Overall mine 
life continues to be over 25 years.
Outlook
Significant progress is expected in terms 
of mine development and ore production 
from the underground mine projects. 
Rampura Agucha will continue to provide 
the majority of mined metal in FY2016, 
although overall production from this 
mine will be less than in FY2015. The gap 
in production will be made up primarily 
by higher volumes from Sindesar Khurd.
In FY2016, mined metal production is 
expected to be higher from FY2015, 
while integrated refined metal 
production, including silver, will be 
significantly higher as the Company 
will process the available mined metal 
inventory from the previous year.
The cost of production excluding royalties 
is expected to remain stable. There 
would be an additional outflow to the 
District Mineral Fund and National Mineral 
Exploration Trust in accordance with the 
MMDRA 2015 as mentioned earlier. 
Our strategic priorities
• Progress on brown field expansion of 
mines to achieve 1.2mtpa of mined 
zinc-lead.
• Managing the transition from open-pit to 
underground mining at Rampura Agucha.
• Ramping up silver production volumes.
• Rampura Agucha open cast mine life 
extension.
• Asset optimisation and operational 
efficiencies to maintain cost leadership.
• And continuing focus on adding reserves 
and resources through exploration.

Annual report and accounts FY2015
Production performance
Mined metal output for FY2015 was 14% 
lower compared with FY2014, primarily 
due to lower production at Lisheen by 
22,000 tonnes, unplanned disruptions 
at Skorpion and lower ore grades. 
The Lisheen mine, which is near the end 
of its life, is expected to end production in 
mid-FY2016. At Skorpion, production was 
lower by 23,000 tonnes. This was primarily 
due to a fire incident in the cell house, 
resulting in the refinery shutting-down 
during January 2015 for 23 days, followed 
by a gradual ramp-up. The production 
loss was also due to a lower zinc feed 
grade (FY2015: 8.7% vs FY2014: 9.6%).
The production at BMM was 12% down 
due to lower ore grades and the change 
in mining methods.
Unit costs
The unit cost of production increased to 
US$1,393 per tonne, up from US$1,167 
per tonne in FY2014. This was mainly 
driven by reduced volumes and increasing 
treatment and refining charges. Due to 
unplanned disruptions, maintenance 
expenses were higher, resulting in 
increased cost of production.
Financial performance
EBITDA reduced by 15% to US$181 million 
for FY2015 due to lower volumes and higher 
costs, partially offset by higher zinc prices. 
Projects
Gamsberg will partially replace the loss 
of production from Lisheen and restore 
production to over 300ktpa. Project 
execution is in the final stages of planning. 
Capex has been rephased in line with 
the Group strategy of optimising capex 
and focusing on critical pre-stripping 
and associated activities. The first ore 
production is planned for FY2018, and 
the ramp-up to full production will be 
in line with the revised capex profile.

Outlook
In FY2016 production volume is expected to 
be c.220-230kt.
Cost of production is expected to be in 
the range of c.US$1,450/t-US$1,500/t 
despite the mines going deeper.
At Skorpion, plans are in place to extend 
the mine from FY2017 to FY2019. This 
is being achieved by deepening the 
current open pit to access additional 
reserves. Mine production will end in 
FY2019 and oxide ore processing will 
continue until FY2020 from stockpiles.
At BMM, near-mine resource potential 
remains high. The Company is taking a 
focused approach to improve confidence 
in other deposits within the mining licence, 
to firm up its plan for the next five years.
Our strategic priorities
• Execution of the Gamsberg project in a 
phased manner.
• Extending the mine life at Skorpion.
• Smooth closure of the Lisheen mine.

At Karnataka, production recommenced 
at an annual capacity of 2.29mtpa on 
28 February 2015, following receipt of 
all requisite clearances and approvals. 
About 0.3mt of saleable ore was 
produced during the quarter and the 
sales are expected to resume in Q1 
FY2016 through the existing e-auction 
procedures managed by the Government.
During the quarter, the Ministry of 
Environment and Forests revoked its earlier 
order which had kept the environment 
clearances for iron ore mines in Goa in 
abeyance. We have been allocated an 
interim annual mining quantity of 5.5mt 
of saleable ore. Mining is expected to 
commence after the monsoon season, 
following the expected receipt of the 
remaining approvals from the Government. 
With effect from 1 June 2015, the 
export duty on low grade iron ore 
(< 58% Fe) has been reduced from 
30% to 10% and it will improve the 
prospects for Goan iron ore prices in this 
cycle of depressed iron ore prices. 
Production of pig iron ramped up from 510kt 
in FY2014 to a record production of 611kt. In 
March 2015, further de-bottlenecking of the 
pig iron plant was completed resulting in an 
increase in capacity from 625kt to 700kt.
Iron ore spot prices averaged US$67.5 
(FOB) for 62% Fe grade a tonne 
over FY2015 and price pressures 
intensified as the year progressed.

Financial performance
EBITDA in FY2015 increased to US$31.4 
million, compared with a loss of US$(24.2) 
million in the previous year, due to higher 
volumes and improved margin from the pig 
iron business. In FY2015 operating losses 
were significantly lower at US$(10.9) million.
Outlook
Approval for commencing production 
at 5.5mt saleable ore capacity received 
and expect to resume operations 
post monsoons. An aggressive cost-
reduction agenda is being implemented 
to effectively counter the current 
low price environment.
The pace of the Liberia project execution 
has been impacted by the Ebola virus 
situation for most of the year. The Company 
expects to progress exploration and 
commission a feasibility study in early 
FY2017. 
Our strategic priorities 
• Ramping-up Karnataka mines to its 
capacity.
• Resuming mining operations in Goa and 
recommencing exports.
• Work with Government for removal of 
cap on mining capacity.
• Complete feasibility work at Western 
Cluster.

It has been a difficult year for Copper 
Zambia due to higher unit costs of 
production, lower volumes and lower  
metal prices. We are working hard to 
improve operational costs and realise cost 
efficiency. We are also planning for the 
future and will start to examine new  
mining options for the year ahead.
Steven Din
CEO, Copper Zambia
Results
During the year we achieved:
• Copper cathode production at 
Tuticorin record 362,000 tonnes.
• Cost of production at Tuticorin 
reduced due to higher volumes, 
lower input costs and higher 
by-product credits.
• Mined metal in Zambia reduced 
due to maintainence shutdowns.

Operations
FY2015 copper cathode production at 
Tuticorin was a record 362,000 tonnes, 
despite the 23-day planned maintenance 
shutdown in Q1. The 160MW power 
plant at Tuticorin continued to operate 
at a Plant Load Factor of 86%.
Our copper mine in Australia remains under 
care and maintenance and we continue to 
evaluate various options for its restart.
Over FY2015, average LME copper price 
fell by 8% while treatment and refining 
charges (TCs/RCs) increased by 29%.
Unit costs
At the Tuticorin smelter, the cost of 
production decreased from 9.7 US cents 
per lb to 4.2 US cents per lb, mainly due to 
higher volumes, lower input costs (fuel and 
power) and higher by-product credits.
Recently, we have seen some pressure 
on copper prices but treatment and 
refining charges are expected to remain 
relatively strong. Global treatment 
and refining charges for 2015 have so 
far settled at higher levels compared 
to 2014, and we expect to realise 
over 24 US cents per lb for FY2016. 
Financial performance
EBITDA for FY2015 was US$281.0 million, 
significantly higher compared with US$197.9 
million in the previous year. This increase 
was mainly driven by higher volumes, with 
improved operational efficiencies, higher 
treatment and refining charges, and lower 
cost of production. Operating profit was 
US$229.4 million in FY2015, an improvement 
from US$155.7 million in the previous year.
Outlook
Production is expected to be stable around 
400kt with no planned maintenance 
activities scheduled in FY2016. 
Our strategic priorities
• Sustaining operating efficiencies and 
reducing our cost profile.
• 400ktpa project to expand capacity along 
with the flexibility to handle multiple 
grades of concentrate.

On 23 February 2015, the Government 
amended the documentation requirements 
to reclaim VAT on future exports. This 
will enable us to resume purchase and 
treatment of third-party concentrate and 
thereby increase the smelter utilisation.
Unit costs (integrated production)
The unit cost of production without 
royalty, logistics, depreciation, interest 
and sustaining capex increased to 
257.7 US cents per lb in FY2015, 8.1% 
higher than the previous year. This 
was mainly due to the lower volumes 
and higher maintenance costs.
Financial performance
EBITDA in FY2015 was US$(4) million 
compared with US$156 million in the 
previous year, impacted by the lower 
volumes explained above, higher unit costs 
and lower metal prices. These factors also 
contributed to an operating loss before 
special items of US$191 million for FY2015.
Outlook
Konkola mine
KCM is focusing on running the Konkola 
mining operations efficiently through its 
Pivot strategy, which focuses on three 
key production areas, thereby resulting 
in improved equipment availability and 
productivity. There is also a programme 
under way to increase the number 
of underground workshops and the 
training of frontline employees.
Smelter and refinery
While the Konkola mine ramps 
up production levels, we have the 
opportunity to increase the utilisation 
rate of the smelter by treating third party 
concentrates, from both within Zambia 
and from other countries. This has been 
positively assisted by the decision of the 
Government of Zambia to amend Rule 
18, which has eased the documentation 
requirements for VAT refunds.
Nchanga operations
At Nchanga, we are focused on sustaining 
and improving the operations at the 
Tailings Leach Plant by treating copper 
refractory ore stockpiles and old tailings. 
Open pit and underground operations at 
Nchanga are approaching the end of their 
economic life, and therefore experiencing 
low grades and high unit costs.
Production is expected to ramp-up after 
first quarter. FY2016 total production 
is expected to be 190-210kt with 
integrated production of 120-130kt 
at C1 cost of 225 US cents per lb.
Our strategic priorities
• Focus on profitable production at 
Konkola, with the ‘Pivot strategy’ and 
maintenance work around the shaft 
infrastructure and mobile fleet to 
increase capacity.
• Ensure that Tailings Leach Plant 
operations continue reliably, and roll-out 
an effective preventative maintenance 
programme.
• Increase smelter utilisation by filling 
spare capacity with purchased 
concentrates.
• Realise cost efficiency, driven by volume 
growth and other measures
• Improve productivity.
Copper Zambia
Operations
FY2015 mined metal production was 10% 
lower at 116kt. Production at the Konkola 
underground mine was negatively affected 
as remediation and critical maintenance 
was being carried out at the shafts. Shaft 
#1 resumed partial hoisting in March 2015 
and work at Shaft #4 is expected to be 
completed by Q3 FY2016. At Nchanga, 
FY2015 mined production was affected by 
lower grades and a transformer failure at 
the Tailings Leach Plant (TLP). During the 
year, TLP primary copper production was at 
52,000 tonnes (56,000 tonnes in FY2014).
Production from the Upper Ore Body at the 
Nchanga underground was suspended in 
November 2014 pending a review of an 
appropriate mining method to exploit this 
ore body.
Copper custom production was marginally 
lower by 1%, constrained by blending 
challenges from concentrates available in 
the market.  68 Strategic report We are Vedanta

Operations
At the Lanjigarh Alumina refinery, FY2015 
production reached record levels, allowing 
us to achieve 98% of the permitted 
capacity of 1mt. Production numbers for 
FY2015 are not comparable to the previous 
year, due to the temporary suspension of 
production which was lifted in July 2013.
In FY2015, production was stable at the 500kt 
Jharsuguda I and 245kt Korba I smelters. 
We initiated a number of innovative 
and cost saving projects to increase 
operational efficiencies. Pot-lines and 
other facilities including billet and 
wire rods are now working at much 
higher than designed capacities, with 
improved recovery and quality.
Unit costs
In FY2015, alumina cost of production 
was US$356 per tonne, almost 
flat compared with FY2014. 
The cost of production of hot metal at 
Jharsuguda I was US$1,630 per tonne 
and increased by 2.0%, compared to 
US$1,602 per tonne in FY2014. The increase 
was due to higher purchased alumina 
prices and higher e-auction coal prices, 
partially offset by improved captive coal 
availability and lower power consumption.
The cost of production at the 245kt 
Korba I increased to US$1,904 per tonne 
from US$1,781 per tonne in FY2014. This 
increase was due to higher alumina and 
coal costs, as captive coal availability 
reduced by a further 25% this year. 
However, this was partially offset by the 
improved operational efficiencies.
Average LME prices for aluminium for the 
year were US$1,890, an increase of 7% 
on the previous year’s average price level 
of US$1,773.

Financial performance
FY2015 EBITDA was up 44.6% at US$416 
million, compared with US$287 million 
in the previous year. This was primarily 
due to higher LME prices and premia 
on metals, as well as additional volume 
from the new Korba II smelter.
Projects
During the year, progress was made in 
securing raw material for our alumina 
refinery, with the Government of Odisha 
granting Prospecting Licenses (PLs) for 
three laterite deposits. The exploration 
work is ongoing and we expect to start 
production in FY2016 after receipt of 
the Mining Leases (ML). The approval 
for expansion of the Lanjigarh Alumina 
refinery has reached the final stages and 
environmental clearance is expected soon. 
At the new 325kt Korba II smelter, 84 pots 
were commissioned during the year and 
produced 71,000 tonnes, which includes 
19,000 under trial run. Ramp-up to full 
capacity will take place during H1 FY2016, 
along with the ramp-up of the 1,200MW 
power plant. Out of the two captive 
power units of 300MW each, the first unit 
is expected to be commissioned in Q1 
FY2016. The BALCO 270MW power plant 
will be available for captive consumption 
as a back-up for pot ramp-up support.
We have also commenced the start-up of 
the first pot line of 312.5kt of the 1.25mtpa 
Jharsuguda II smelter, using surplus 
power from the 1,215MW power plant. 
82 pots have been started during the last 
quarter of FY2015 and are under trial run. 
Ramp-up of the remaining pots of the 
first pot-line is expected to commence in 
end of Q1 FY2016, using power from one 
600MW unit of the 2,400MW power plant.
In the recent coal block auctions conducted 
by the Government, BALCO was successful 
in securing two coal mines which are ready 
for production; Chotia Block with reserves 
of 15.5mt and annual production capacity 
of 1mtpa; and Gare Palma IV/1 Block with 
reserves of 44mt and capacity of 6mtpa. 
We will commence production at the 
Chotia mine over the next few months 
after transfer of the mining lease and 
other statutory approvals. BALCO has 
appealed regarding Government’s rejection 
of its winning bid for the Gare Palma IV/1 
block and the matter is sub judice.
Outlook
During FY2016, the Company will focus 
on ramping up production from the 
Korba II and Jharsuguda II smelters 
as well as increasing the alumina 
production at Lanjigarh Refinery beyond 
1mtpa post receipt of approvals.
The Company has Prospecting Licences 
for three laterite mines in Odisha and 
exploration is in progress. We expect to 
commence mining in the second half 
of FY2016.
Our strategic priorities
• Secure captive refinery feed to realise the 
full potential of cost efficiencies and 
increase capacity utilisation.
• Ramp-up Aluminium capacity.
• Laterite mining. 
• Commencement of coal block operations 
at BALCO.
• Lanjigarh refinery expansion to 4mpta. 72 Strategic report We are Vedanta

Operations
The Jharsuguda 2,400MW power plant 
operated at a lower Plant Load Factor (PLF) 
of 39% during FY2015 due to lower market 
demand and transmission constraints for 
some regions. However, during FY2016 
capacity utilisation is expected to go up 
significantly as we ramp-up the plant 
for additional aluminium pot-lines.
Out of the two 300MW units of the 
1,200MW Korba Power Plant destined 
for commercial power, one 300MW unit 
is currently under trial run, and will be 
commissioned during Q1 FY2016; the 
second commercial unit is expected to 
be commissioned during Q2 FY2016.
At the Talwandi Sabo power plant, the first

Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
Corporate governance report
Dear Shareholder,
I am delighted to introduce the Company’s 2015 Corporate 
Governance Report. I strongly believe that good corporate 
governance is a key driver of performance and is fundamental to  
the Group’s long-term success. We therefore endeavour to promote 
good corporate governance which is embedded within the culture  
of our organisation and underpins everything we do, rather than 
simply as the adherence to a set of rules. 
Vedanta business and brand alignment
The Company’s key operating subsidiary, Sesa Sterlite Limited was 
renamed Vedanta Limited to harness the value of the Vedanta 
brand and strengthen the links between our business, communities 
and stakeholders. The rebranding is a significant milestone and 
helps to promote a united and aligned identity to enable us to 
deliver world class excellence with low cost operations and greater 
value for our shareholders.
Sustainability and safety
We have made encouraging progress during the year on improving 
the Group’s safety record and reaching our goal of becoming a zero 
harm environment. Whilst there has been a step change in safety 
consciousness across the Group, it is disappointing that despite our 
efforts we had eight tragic fatalities during the year and advancing 
safety management across the Group remains a key priority of 
management for the year ahead.
Board composition
As Chairman, I am responsible for leading the Company’s Board of 
Directors (the Board or the Directors) and ensuring that it operates 
effectively to deliver long-term value for shareholders. During the 
year, we undertook a review of the balance of skills, knowledge  
and experience on the Board. As Messrs Aman Mehta and Euan 
Macdonald have both served as Non-Executive Directors on the 
Company’s Board for over nine years, succession planning has been 
a key priority. We have been focused on the search for suitable 
candidates with relevant experience in the natural resources 
industry to succeed them and successfully appointed Katya Zotova 
as a Non-Executive Director on 1 August 2014. Ms Zotova has a 
wealth of experience in the oil & gas industry having previously 
worked at Royal Dutch Shell and Citigroup’s oil & gas division. Her 
industry knowledge and experience will be highly beneficial to the 
Board in developing the Group’s strategy. I am pleased that the 
Company continues to have a strong, well balanced and diverse 
Board with a wide range of skills and experience including mining,  
oil & gas, corporate financial, legal and regulatory experience.
In line with our succession planning requirements, we continue to 
seek an additional candidate to join the Board with the relevant 
skills and experience to succeed Mr Mehta as the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. As the majority of our businesses are based in 
India, we feel it would be beneficial to the Company to find 
candidates who have some experience of doing business in India 
while maintaining diversity of thought on the Board. We have 
appointed a Board recruitment consultant to identify suitable 
candidates with the relevant criteria determined by the Board and 
we hope to announce further appointments in due course. However, 
in order to promote smooth transition and orderly succession, we 
recommend that Messers Mehta and Macdonald be reappointed  
as Non-Executive Directors for another year until no later than the 
conclusion of the Company’s 2016 Annual General Meeting. The 
Nominations Committee undertook a thorough review of Messrs 
Mehta and Macdonald and concluded that they remain independent 
and continue to provide rigorous objective and constructive 
challenge to Board discussions. 
We have made encouraging 
progress in improving the Group’s 
safety record and reaching our  
goal of becoming a zero harm 
environment. This is a key part  
of good corporate governance 
which is embedded within the 
Vedanta culture.

Diversity and inclusion
We have previously made a commitment to achieve a minimum 
25% female representation on the Board by 2015 as we believe that 
significant benefit can be achieved from a well-balanced and diverse 
board. We have made progress towards that objective with the 
appointment of Ms Zotova during the year. We are aware that we 
can do more in respect of this and it remains a key priority of the 
Board to make further appointments based on merit taking into 
account the diversity and other requirements of the Board and 
candidates’ skills and experience. 
The Board also recognises the importance of encouraging diversity 
in all forms including gender as well as developing employees  
across the Group to provide for future succession to management 
roles. We continue to address the historical gender imbalance in 
leadership roles within the natural resources sector and have made 
a number of senior female appointments during the year including 
the President – Group, Sustainability, Corporate Social Responsibility 
and Communications, the Chief Executive Officer of Zinc 
International and Group Head of Treasury. Further information on 
our progress is given in the Nominations Committee report on pages 
98 to 100.
Talent development and senior management succession planning
Our people are our biggest asset for the delivery of business  
results and long-term shareholder value. We have renewed  
our commitment to nurturing and developing talent within the 
Group and reviewed career growth opportunities, learning and 
development and reward and recognition programmes within the 
Group. The ‘Leadership Connect’ programme was started to build 
the Group’s leadership capability and ensure a pipeline of suitably 
qualified candidates for future succession to senior management 
positions within the Group. Another objective of the programme is  
to create leaders who can drive engagement within their teams to 
deliver superior performance for the Group. 
Board effectiveness and evaluation
Following the external facilitation of our Board evaluation last year, 
we carried out a detailed review of the Board’s effectiveness which 
was managed wholly in-house this year. This was done through the 
use of targeted questionnaires and we have produced an action 
plan to address the issues raised and strengthen our Board 
processes. Further information on the process and outcome of the 
evaluation exercise is provided within this report on pages 88 to 89.
 
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s 2015 Annual General Meeting will be held at 3.00pm

As a company with a premium listing on the London Stock 
Exchange, Vedanta is subject to and seeks to comply with the 2012 
edition of the Code which is available on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm. 
The Company is required to report on how it has applied the main 
principles of good governance in relation to leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board, remuneration, accountability and 
relations with shareholders as set out in the Code. This Corporate 
Governance Report provides details of our approach to governance, 
our policies, processes and structures and explains how we have 
complied with the main principles of the Code. Further details of how 
the Company has applied the provisions of the Code are also 
contained in the reports of each Board Committee and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Disclosures on share capital and related matters as required by the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 7.2.6) may be found in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 116 to 119. 
Statement of Compliance with the Code
It is the Board’s view that the Company has, throughout the 
financial year ended 31 March 2015, fully complied with all the 
provisions of the Code, with the exception of the following: 
Code Provision A.3.1
Mr Anil Agarwal was appointed as Executive Chairman in 2005.  
Mr Agarwal was the founder of the businesses of Vedanta Resources 
and steered the growth of the Group since its inception in 1976 
including the flotation of Vedanta Resources plc on the London  
Stock Exchange. This meant that Mr Agarwal did not meet the 
independence criteria as defined in the Code on his appointment in 
2005 because he was previously the Chief Executive and, through 
Volcan Investments Limited (Volcan), members of his family have a 
controlling interest in the Company. Mr Agarwal is pivotal in helping 
to achieve the strategic objectives of Vedanta through his skills in 
seeking out value creating acquisitions and projects. In addition,  
the fact that he dedicates himself full time to his role of Executive 
Chairman enables him to balance his executive duties with providing 
leadership to the Board. As Executive Chairman Mr Agarwal 
encourages debate and challenge and sets high ethical standards. 
For these reasons the Board is unanimously of the opinion that his 
continued involvement in an executive capacity is important to the 
success of the Group.
Code Provision B.1.1
Two of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors, Messrs Aman Mehta 
and Euan Macdonald have served on the Board for over nine years 
and Mr Mehta also serves as a non-executive director on the board 
of Cairn India Limited. As a consequence, the Board was mindful  
of the risk of their independence becoming compromised and 
undertook a particularly rigorous assessment of their independence 
and potential for conflicts of interest. Mr Mehta does not have  
any business relationship with the Group other than his directorship 
at Cairn India and Vedanta Resources plc. As he absents himself 
from discussions in the event of any conflict of interest and 
continues to actively participate in Board discussions and provide 
robust challenge to management, the Board concluded that his 
independent judgement was not compromised and he remained 
impartial. Mr Macdonald does not have any business relationship 
with the Group and is not involved in any transaction or 
circumstance that would interfere with the exercise of his 
independent judgement in carrying out the responsibilities of  
a Director. Accordingly, the Board is satisfied that the tenure of  
Messrs Mehta and Macdonald does not affect their ability to  
exercise independent judgement or act in the best interests of  
the Group and has determined them to be independent. 
Code Provision B.2.1
By virtue of the size of its shareholding in the Company, Volcan 
Investments Limited (Volcan) is a controlling shareholder for the 
purposes of the Listing Rules and was required to enter into an 
agreement with the Company to ensure compliance with the 
independence provisions set out in the Listing Rules (Relationship 
Agreement). Under the Relationship Agreement, Volcan will be 
consulted on all appointments to the Board. The Nominations 
Committee therefore works collaboratively with Volcan when 
making appointments to the Board and, to this extent, differs from 
the process set out in Code Provision B.2.1 which stipulates that the 
Nominations Committee should lead the process for Board 
appointments.
Leadership and the role of the Board
The Company is headed by a strong and effective Board of Directors 
which is collectively accountable to shareholders for promoting the 
long-term success of the Group through the creation and delivery  
of sustainable shareholder value. The Board does this by setting 
strategic priorities and risk appetite, ensuring that adequate 
resources are available for the attainment of the objectives and 
reviewing management’s performance in delivering the strategy.
As part of its decision making processes the Board considers the 
long-term consequences of its decisions, the interests of various 
stakeholders including employees, the impact of the Group’s 
operations on the environment and the need to maintain high 
standards of business. This is achieved through a prudent and robust 
risk management framework and internal controls and strong 
governance processes.
Duties of the Board
The duties of the Board are set out in its terms of reference including 
those matters specifically reserved for decision by the Board. The 
Board’s terms of reference were reviewed and updated during the 
year and in addition to the above include:
• Approval of the Group’s annual and half year reports and financial 
statements;
• Declaration of the interim dividend and the recommendation of 
the final dividend;
• Approval of any material restructuring or reorganisation of the 
Group;
• Approval of major capital expenditure projects in excess of 
defined thresholds; 
• Approval of major acquisitions and disposals of assets in excess  
of defined thresholds; 
• Approval of a variety of major decisions that are determined by 
their nature to have a significant likely impact for the Group;
• Approval of any appointments to or removals from the Board of 
Directors.
The Board’s terms of reference also set out those matters which 
must be reported to the Board such as details of fatalities within  
the Group and the adoption or material amendment to the Group 
policies relating to business conduct, environment and health and 
safety. Strategic

Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors;
• Acting as an intermediary for shareholders who wish to raise 
concerns that they have been unable to resolve through the 
normal channels of communication; 
• Acting as a sounding board for the Executive Chairman and

objectives by drawing on their own business and commercial

the strategy;
• Satisfying themselves on the integrity of financial information 
and ensuring that risk and control systems are robust; and
• Determining appropriate levels of remuneration, succession 
planning and participating in the appointment of Executive 
Directors.
Board Committees
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to Board Committees 
which operate within their defined terms of reference. The main 
Board Committees are the Audit, Nominations, Remuneration  
and Sustainability Committees (together, the Board Committees). 
All of the Board Committees are authorised to obtain legal or  
other professional advice as necessary at the expense of the 
Company, to secure the attendance of external advisers at their 
meetings and to seek information from any employee of the 
Company in order to perform their duties. Under the terms of 
reference of each of the Board Committees only the members of 
each committee have the right to attend committee meetings. 
However, other Directors, management and advisers may attend 
meetings at the invitation of the Committee chair. The Group 
Company Secretary acts as the secretary to the Board, Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees while the President-
Group Communications, Sustainability and Corporate Social 
Responsibility acts as the secretary to the Sustainability Committee. 
The terms of reference of each of the Board Committees was 
reviewed and updated during the year and are available on the 
Company’s website at www.vedantaresources.com or by request  
to the Company Secretary.
Details of the membership, terms of reference and attendance at 
the meetings of the Audit, Nominations, Remuneration and 
Sustainability Committees are given in their respective reports on 
pages 92 to 115.
The Executive Committee
The Executive Committee acts as a conduit between management 
and the Board and during the year ended 31 March 2015 comprised 
of the Executive Vice Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and 
members of senior management whose biographies are given on 
pages 78 to 79. The Executive Committee meets monthly and is 
responsible for implementing strategic plans formulated by the 
Board, allocating resources in line with delegated authorities and 
monitoring the operational and financial performance of the Group. 
The Executive Committee therefore has a key role in putting the 
Board’s plans and policies into action. The Chief Executive Officer,  
Mr Albanese, keeps the Board informed of the Executive 
Committee’s activities through his standing reports to the Board.
The Finance Standing Committee
The Finance Standing Committee is an ad-hoc sub-committee to 
which authority is delegated by the Board for approval of certain 
matters such as routine bank and financing issues. It comprises  
five members; Executive Chairman, Executive Vice Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director of Finance.  
The Company Secretary provides an update on the Finance Standing 
Committee meetings to the Board at the subsequent Board meeting 
and the minutes of all Finance Standing Committee meetings are 
reviewed by the Board.
Advisory Committees
The Company has established a number of Advisory Committees 
which meet monthly to review and make recommendations to the 
Executive Committee regarding matters which significantly shape 
each business function of the Group at an operational level. The 
recommendations from the Advisory Committees define the overall 
scope and strategy within which each business function develops 
policies, procedures and guidelines. The Advisory Committees 
include Procurement, Marketing, Human Resources, Sustainable 
Development and Communications, Finance and Technology and 
Innovation Advisory Committees.  86 Corporate governance and Directors’ reports

Chairman’s Committee
The Chairman’s Committee meets monthly and comprises of Messrs 
Anil Agarwal, who chairs the Chairman’s Committee, Navin Agarwal, 
Tom Albanese, Tarun Jain and DD Jalan. The Committee is a 
management committee which was established to support the 
functioning of the Board and ensure that the business of the Board 
and its Committees is properly planned and aligned with 
management. The Chairman’s Committee provides a forum for the 
Chief Executive Officer to report to the Executive Chairman on the 
Company’s operational performance and key issues impacting 
performance and for the members to deliberate on how best to 
align performance with the strategic objectives set by the Board.
How the Board operates
The Board meets on a regular basis and met formally on six 
occasions during the year, of which five were scheduled Board 
meetings and one was called at short notice. As well as formal 
meetings, written resolutions are passed with the approval of the 
whole Board on routine matters as required in order to facilitate 
efficient decision making. In addition ad-hoc discussions take place 
between the Directors on a variety of topics throughout the year. 
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director 
also met during the year without the Executive Directors present to 
appraise the Executive Chairman’s performance amongst other 
matters.
Strategy development
During the year, a separate meeting was held by the Directors to 
consider and test the long-term strategy of the Company. At this 
strategy meeting, the Board considered its strategic direction in light 
of external factors such as regulatory environments and commodity 
market developments and agreed its strategic focus and priorities 
for the year ahead. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors made 
site visits to the Group’s operations at Cairn India and Hindustan 
Zinc to enable them to get a better understanding of the operational 
and strategic issues facing the businesses.
The Executive Chairman, assisted by the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for ensuring that the Board receives accurate, timely 
and clear information on all relevant matters in order to make 
informed decisions and discharge its duties. Directors are provided 
with regular detailed briefings on the Group’s businesses, the 
markets within which it operates and the overall economic 
environment and updates on fiscal policy changes. Prior to a Board 
meeting the Board also routinely receives detailed information on 
business and financial performance, ongoing projects, fund raising 
initiatives, activities of the Board Committees and investor relations, 
with presentations and verbal updates given by the Executive 
Directors and senior management as appropriate. 
At the request of the Directors, the Chief Executive Officer also 
provides a monthly report to the Board on key operational issues 
and other matters of importance to the Group.

Board attendance
The Company requires its Directors to attend all meetings of the 
Board and any Board Committees on which they serve and to devote 
sufficient time to the Company’s business. The Directors are also 
required to disclose their other time commitments and seek the 
agreement of the Executive Chairman prior to accepting any 
additional appointments in order to ensure that they have sufficient 
time to fulfill their role as a Director. The Company’s Non-Executive 
Directors are expected to spend a minimum of 20 days per annum 
on the Company’s business with greater time commitment during 
periods of heightened strategic and commercial activity as set out in 
their letters of appointment. The Non-Executive Directors letters of 
appointment are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The attendance of the Directors at Board meetings held during the 
year is shown in the following table and the Directors’ attendance at

Board except one which was called at short notice.
3 Mr Parekh was unable to attend one meeting of the Board due to a prior 
commitment and the meeting being called at short notice.
Board independence
In accordance with the Code, it is the Company’s policy that at least 
half the Board comprises of independent Non-Executive Directors  
to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors for effective governance  
and no individual or small group of Directors can dominate the 
decision making process. The Board undertakes an evaluation of 
each Director’s independence on appointment, annually prior to 
recommending their re-election by shareholders as well as when 
any Director’s circumstances change and warrant a re-evaluation.
The Board undertook a detailed evaluation of Ms Katya Zotova’s 
independence prior to her appointment in August 2014. As Ms 
Zotova had no prior connections with the Group, the Board was 
satisfied of her independence and concluded that she could act as 
an Independent Non-Executive Director on the Company’s Board. 
During the year, the Board also considered the independence of  
Mr Geoffrey Green who carries out occasional consultancy work for 
Ashurst LLP, a leading international law firm that is engaged by the 
Group to provide legal advice on various matters. As Mr Green had 
no involvement in advising the Group over the last five years, the 
Board was satisfied that he remains independent of character and 
judgement. The Board also considered Mr Green’s appointment as 
Chair of the Financial Reporting Review Panel and determined that 
there were no conflicts of interest arising out of the appointment.
Two of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors, Messrs Aman Mehta 
and Euan Macdonald have served on the Board for over nine years 
and their independence was therefore subject to a particularly 
rigorous review. As Mr Mehta also serves as Non-Executive Director 
on the Board of Cairn India Limited, the Board considered the 
potential conflicts of interest arising from that appointment.  
As Mr Mehta absents himself from discussions in the event of any 
conflict of interest and continues to actively participate in Board 
discussions and provide robust challenge to management, the 
Board concluded that his independent judgement was not 
compromised and he remains impartial. Mr Macdonald does not 
have any business relationship with the Group and is not involved  
in any transaction or circumstance that would interfere with  
the exercise of his independent judgement in carrying out the 
responsibilities of a Director. Accordingly, the Board concluded that 
the tenure of Messrs Mehta and Macdonald does not materially 
affect their ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the 
best interests of the Group. 
Following the review of the Non-Executive Directors’ independence, 
the Board has determined that all of the current Non-Executive 
Directors are independent and free from any relationship or 
circumstance that could affect or appear to affect their independent 
judgement.
Board succession planning has been at the forefront of Board 
considerations during the year and the search for new Non-
Executive Directors to succeed Messrs Mehta and Macdonald  
is ongoing. While the Board is committed to refreshing the 
composition of the Board and the total length of appointments 
would not normally exceed nine years, in order to ensure a smooth 
transition the Board has invited Messrs Mehta and Macdonald to 
serve on the Board for up to a further year subject to approval by 
shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. It is anticipated 
that further appointments will be made during the year to allow 
Messrs Mehta and Macdonald to retire from the Board following a 
suitable transition period. 88 Corporate governance and Directors’ reports

Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Board has an established procedure for the disclosure of 
interests and other related matters in line with published guidance 
and the Companies Act 2006. Each Director must promptly disclose 
actual or potential conflicts and any changes to the Board which are 
noted at each Board meeting. The Board considers and authorises 
potential or actual conflicts as appropriate. Directors with a conflict 
do not participate in the discussion or vote on the matter in question. 
These procedures have proved to be effective during the year under 
review. Related party transactions, which include those in respect of 
any Director, are disclosed in Note 39 on pages 196 to 197.
The Board reviewed any potential conflict of interest for Mr Geoffrey 
Green arising from his previous role as a partner of and current 
consultancy role at Ashurst LLP. The fees paid to Ashurst LLP during 
the year amounted to US$344,179 (2014: US$195,037) and, as the 
value of the expenditure incurred was determined to be immaterial 
and Mr Green was not directly involved in advising the Group, the 
Board authorised the potential conflict of interest in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association.
Relationship Agreement
The Relationship Agreement which had originally been entered into 
at the time of admission of the Company’s shares to the premium 
listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority 
and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc’s main market for 
listed securities (Listing) in 2003 between the Company and its 
majority shareholder, Volcan and was subsequently amended in 
December 2011 was reviewed and updated again in November 2014 
in order to ensure compliance with the revised Listing Rules for the 
protection for minority shareholders which came into force in 
May 2014.
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure 
that the Group is able to carry on business independently of Volcan, 
the Agarwal family and their associates and that all agreements 
and transactions between the Company, on the one hand, and 
Volcan and/or any of its respective group undertakings and/or 
persons acting in concert with it or its group undertakings, on the 
other hand, will be at arm’s length and on a normal commercial 
basis. Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, Volcan, the 
Agarwal family and their associates will not take any action that 
would prevent the Company from complying with its obligations 
under the Listing Rules. Furthermore, the Board and Nominations 
Committee will at all times consist of a majority of Directors who  
are independent of Volcan and the Agarwal family. Whilst the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees shall at all times comprise 
solely of Non-Executive Directors, Volcan is entitled to nominate  
for appointment as Director such number of persons as is one less 
than the number of Directors who are independent of Volcan, 
the Agarwal family and their associates. As the Board is comprised 
of a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors and 
Vedanta’s ability to operate independently of Volcan is protected 
by the Relationship Agreement, the Board considers that there 
are adequate safeguards for the protection of minority 
shareholder interests.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing matters arising  
in relation to the Relationship Agreement and related party 
transactions on behalf of the Board. During the year, there were no 
contracts of significance between the Company, or its subsidiary 
undertakings, and the controlling shareholder. The Company has 
complied with the independence provisions in the Relationship 
Agreement and so far as the Company is aware, the controlling 
shareholder and any of its associates have complied with the 
independence provisions and the procurement obligation included 
in the Relationship Agreement.
Induction, training and development
The Board is committed to the ongoing development of its 
employees and Directors. On appointment to the Board, each 
Director undergoes a comprehensive induction programme which  
is tailored to their individual needs but is intended to provide an 
introduction to the Group’s operations and the challenges and risks 
faced. During the year, Ms Zotova attended the induction and 
orientation programme consisting of meetings with and 
presentations from senior management, meetings with the 
Non-Executive Directors and a site visit to the operations of Cairn 
India, Hindustan Zinc and some of the Group’s corporate social 
responsibility projects. She also received induction materials 
including the Company’s articles of association, Board charter and 
terms of reference, Share Dealing Code, Cairn India Prospectus,  
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Vedanta Values and an update 
on the implementation of the anti-bribery policy across the Group. 
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed. The Company Secretary is also responsible 
for advising the Board through the Chairman on governance 
matters. The Directors also have access to the Company’s 
professional advisers whom they can consult where necessary  
for the discharge of their duties. During the year, the Directors 
received legal and regulatory updates on corporate governance 
developments and presentations from the senior management of 
KCM, BALCO, Zinc International, Hindustan Zinc and Cairn India. 
Mr Albanese’s structured induction programme has continued 
during the year with further site visits to various Group operations 
to develop his understanding of the business environment and the 
markets in which the Group operates, as well as to engage with 
employees and other stakeholders. The Board receives information 
in a timely manner in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it 
to discharge its duties.
Following feedback from the Directors, a programme of site visits to 
the Group’s operations will form part of the Board induction for all 
future Board appointments.
Board evaluation
The effectiveness of the Board is of paramount importance to the 
overall success of the Group and the Company undertakes a formal 
and rigorous annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees, the 
Directors and the Chairman to assess their performance. Following 
the external facilitation of the Board and Board Committee 
evaluations by Prism in 2014, this year the performance evaluations 
were led by the Executive Chairman supported by the Company 
Secretary. The review consisted of detailed questionnaires tailored 
to the Board and each Committee.  Strategic

an active contribution to Board discussions and demonstrate full 
commitment to their role.
Executive Chairman’s performance
The Executive Chairman’s performance was evaluated by the 
Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director

Chairman with a number of actions to be completed over the 
year ahead.
Accountability 
Financial and business reporting
The Directors present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position and prospects.
The Group has a comprehensive financial reporting system, which is 
reviewed and modified in line with Accounting Standards to ensure 
that all published financial information is accurate. Vedanta’s 
financial reporting procedures are based on five main elements:
1) Financial information supplied by subsidiary companies and 
consolidated at central level:
 – Management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis and 
reviewed by the Executive Committee; 
 – Management accounts are reviewed by the Board at least 
quarterly; 
 – Performance is monitored against key performance indicators 
throughout the financial year and forecasts are updated as 
appropriate; and
 – Annual operational budgets are prepared by each operating 
subsidiary and consolidated into a Group Budget which is 
reviewed and approved by the Board. 
2) External auditor assurance:
 – Full year audit and interim review are carried out on the 
published financial statements. 
3) Review by the Audit Committee of: 
 – Year-end reporting plans; 
 – Legal, tax and accounting issues;
 – Consideration of the financial statements and disclosures in 
accordance with financial reporting standards; and
 – Going concern statements with supporting cash flow, liquidity 
and funding forecasts. 
4) The Internal Audit function provides an independent assurance  
in respect of processes, physical verification and management 
information system accuracy for operating companies. 
5) Review by the Audit Committee and the Board of the preliminary 
and half year announcements, the annual report and accounts 
and any other announcements including financial information.  90 Corporate governance and Directors’ reports

system 
• Reviews compliance with Group policies and procedures 
• Facilitates the update of the risk matrix
• Reviews findings in respect of the risk management and

• Investigates whistleblower cases
The head of MAS attends all the Vedanta Executive Committee  
and Audit Committee meetings. During the year, the MAS team 
supported the respective business teams at Vedanta Limited and  
its subsidiaries towards compliance with the US Sarbanes-Oxley  
Act 2002 requirements (the Act), including documenting internal 
controls as required by section 404 of the Act. The effectiveness of 
internal controls is assessed by Vedanta’s own administration and 
certified by independent auditors, as set forth in the Act. 
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s risk appetite and 
determining the nature and extent of the risks it is willing to take  
to achieve its strategic objectives. The Directors also have ultimate 
responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a robust system 
of internal control to provide them with reasonable assurance that 
all information within the business and for external publication is 
adequate. Authority for detailed monitoring of the internal control 
and risk management framework is delegated to the Audit 
Committee which reports to the Board regularly within the remit  
of its role.
The Group’s risk management framework is designed to be a simple, 
consistent and clear mechanism for managing and reporting risks of 
the Group’s businesses to the Board. Risk management is embedded 
in all critical business activities, functions and processes. The 
framework helps the organisation meet its objectives through 
alignment of operating controls to the mission and vision of 
the Group.
Management systems, organisational structures, processes, 
standards and code of conduct together form the system of  
internal control that govern how the Group conducts its business 
and manages the associated risks.
The Group has a multi-layered risk management framework aimed 
at effectively mitigating the various risks which its businesses  
are exposed to in the course of their operations as well as in their 
strategic actions. Risks are identified at the individual business level 
for existing operations as well as for ongoing projects through a 
consistently applied methodology, using the Turnbull matrix.
Risks are continually reviewed with formal discussion on risk 
management taking place at business level review meetings  
at least once in a quarter. The respective businesses review the risks, 
change in the nature and extent of the major risks since the last 
assessment, control measures established to mitigate the risk and 
further action plans. The control measures stated in the risk matrix 
are also periodically reviewed by the business management teams 
to verify their effectiveness.
These meetings are chaired by business chief executive officers  
and attended by chief risk officers, senior management and 
functional heads. Risk officers have been formally nominated at all 
operating businesses as well as Group level whose role is to create 
awareness of risks at senior management level and to develop risk 
management culture within the businesses. They play an important 
role in ensuring that the organisation sustains its risk management 
initiatives and that the Group’s risk management framework 
matures and grows with the organisation. Risk mitigation plans form 
an integral part of the key performance indicators for process 
owners. 
The Audit Committee aids the Board in this process by reviewing the 
actions taken by management to identify risks, assess any changes 
in the Group’s risk exposure, reviewing risk control measures and by 
approving remedial actions, where appropriate.
The Audit Committee is in turn supported by the Risk Management 
Committee which helps the Audit Committee in evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of the risk mitigation 
programme and the control systems.
In addition to the above structure, other key risk governance and 
oversight committees include the following:
• Group Treasury Risk Management Committee has an oversight  
on the treasury related risks. This committee comprises of Group 
Chief Financial Officer, business CFOs and Treasury Heads at 
respective businesses.
• Group Capex Sub-Committee which evaluates the risks while 
reviewing any capital investment decisions as well as institutes  
a risk management framework in expansion projects.
• Sustainability Committee which reviews sustainability related 
risks. This Committee is chaired by a Non-Executive Director  
and attended by the Chief Executive Officer, and other business 
leaders as its members. Strategic

As stated above, every business division in the Group has developed 
its own risk matrix of Top 20 risks which is reviewed at business 
management committee level. In addition, business divisions  
have also developed their own risk registers depending on size  
of operations and number of subsidiary business units/locations.  
Full details of principal risks and uncertainties are contained in the 
strategic report on pages 28 to 35.
A consistently applied methodology is used to identify risks to 
operations and projects at the operating subsidiary level. MAS have 
arrangements with leading international accounting and audit firms 
excluding the Group’s external auditor for carrying out internal audits 
within the Group.
This element has been an important component of the overall 
internal control process by which the Board obtains assurance.  
The scope of work, authority and resources of MAS are regularly 
reviewed by the Audit Committee. The responsibilities of MAS include 
recommending improvements in the control environment and 
reviewing compliance with the Group’s philosophy, policies  
and procedures. The planning of internal audit is approached from  
a risk perspective. In preparing the internal audit plan, reference  
is made to the Group’s risk matrix, inputs are sought from senior 
management, project managers and Audit Committee members and 
reference is made to past audit experience, financial analysis and the 
current economic and business environment.
Each of the Group’s principal subsidiaries has in place procedures  
to ensure that sufficient internal controls are maintained. These 
procedures include a monthly meeting of the relevant management 
committee and quarterly meeting of the Audit Committee of  
that subsidiary. Any adverse findings are reported to the Audit 
Committee. The Chairman of the Audit Committee may request MAS 
and/or the external auditor to focus their audit work and report to 
him on specific areas of risk identified by the risk management and 
internal control framework. At a Group level, the findings by MAS are 
presented monthly to the Executive Committee and to the Audit 
Committee periodically.
The Executive Committee and Audit Committee regularly review 
reports related to the Group’s internal control framework in order  
to satisfy the internal control requirements of the Code (Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors) and section 404 of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. Due to the limitations inherent in any 
system of internal control, this system is designed to meet the 
Group’s particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed rather 
than eliminate risk altogether. Consequently it can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
In line with best practice, the Board has reviewed the internal control 
system in place during the year and up to the date of the approval of 
this report. The Board’s review includes the Audit Committee’s report 
on the risk matrix, significant risks and actions put in place to mitigate 
these risks. This review ensures that the internal control system 
remains effective. Where weaknesses are identified as a result of the 
review, new procedures are put in place to strengthen controls and 
these are in turn reviewed at regular intervals. Every risk has an owner 
who is responsible for ensuring that controls are put in place to 
mitigate the risk.
Communications with shareholders
The Company values communication with its shareholders and 
actively engages with them on a wide range of issues to ascertain 
their views. The Company maintains an ongoing dialogue and 
schedule of meetings with institutional investors, analysts, brokers 
and fund managers which is attended by the Chief Executive Officer 
and managed by the Investor Relations team. During the year, in 
order to further promote engagement with the Company’s investor 
community, a Capital Markets Day was held in London and attended 
by several members of the Executive Committee and senior 
management to provide a corporate and financial overview of the 
Group and updates on the key businesses by the respective business 
leaders. This was followed by a site visit to the Group’s operations at 
Hindustan Zinc, Cairn India and Jharsuguda.
A Sustainable Development Investor Day has been planned for 
mid-2015 to enhance engagement with the Company’s stakeholders 
on sustainability and corporate social responsibility matters.
The main channels of communication with the investment 
community are through the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director, Investor Relations. Upon 
request the Senior Independent Director and other Non-Executive 
Directors are available to meet with major investors to discuss any 
specific issues. The Board is also kept abreast of shareholder 
sentiment and views on various issues through periodic detailed 
investor relations reports to the Board. 
Routine engagement activities include:
• Press releases to the market and media on key developments 
throughout the year;
• Regular meetings between the Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer and institutional investors, analysts and brokers;
• Site visits by institutional investor representatives, analysts and 
brokers to the Group’s major operations;
• Ongoing dialogue with shareholders and other interested parties 
by email, letters and meetings arranged through the Investor 
Relations and Group Communications teams; 
• A wide range of information on the Company and its operations 
which is made available on the Company’s website including the 
annual report and accounts, half yearly results, sustainability 
report, market announcements, press releases, share price and 
links to subsidiary company websites; and
The Board also welcomes the opportunity to communicate with  
the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, leading 
to full and frank discussions on a variety of topics of interest to 
shareholders. All of the Directors, including the chairs of the Audit, 
Remuneration, Nominations and Sustainability Committees attend 
the AGM in order to answer questions from shareholders. The 2015 
AGM will be held on at 3.00pm on 3 August 2015 at The Ironmongers 
Hall, Shaftesbury Place, London EC2Y 8AA. Further details are given 
in the Notice of Meeting accompanying this annual report including 
the business to be considered at the meeting. The notice is sent out 
at least 20 business days before the AGM. Voting at the AGM on all 
resolutions is by poll on a one share, one vote basis and the results 
of votes cast for, against and abstentions are available on the 
Group’s website following the meeting. The Board believes that 
voting by poll allows the views of all shareholders to be taken into 
account regardless of whether or not they can attend the meeting 
and shareholders are actively encouraged to register their votes 
electronically in advance of the meeting. 92 Corporate governance and Directors’ reports

Annual report review
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee considered 
whether the 2015 annual report and accounts was fair, balanced 
and understandable and whether it provided the necessary 
information for shareholders and stakeholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy. Such 
assessments are provided in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive 
Officer’s statement and the strategic report of this annual report. 
The Audit Committee and the Board are satisfied that the annual 
report and accounts meet this requirement as both positive and 
negative developments in the year were considered at length. In 
justifying this statement the Audit Committee has considered the 
robust process which operates in creating the annual report and 
accounts, including:

functions, to include the well-established financial reporting 
system within Vedanta to ensure accuracy and consistency;

key positions are required to complete the Annual Code of Conduct 
Certification form. The annual certification process reinforces our 
commitment to ethical practices and Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics, promoting an ethical culture.
The Group’s Whistleblower Policy forms part of the Code of Business

highest ethical standards. The policy allows employees of the 
Company, its subsidiaries and all external stakeholders to raise 
issues of concern in confidence.
As per the Whistleblower Policy adopted by various businesses in 
the Group, all complaints are reported to the Director – MAS who is 
independent of operating management and businesses. Dedicated 
email addressess and a centralised database have been created to 
facilitate the receipt of complaints and for ease of reporting. The 
Company has a 24x7 ethics helpline where employees can place 
anonymous complaints against ethics violations as per the policy

During the year, the composition of the Group Ethics Committee 
which reviews the Group’s whistleblower programme was also 
refreshed to strengthen the Committee to carry out its role in 
promoting an uncompromising approach to integrity, ethics, 
compliance and good corporate governance. The Group Ethics 
Committee is comprised of Mr Akhilesh Joshi, Mr Dilip Golani, 
Mr Rajesh Padmanabhan, Mr Abhijit Pati, Mr Mukesh Bhavnani  
and Ms A Sumathi, Head of Environment.
Fraud and UK Bribery Act
The Company is committed to the elimination of fraud, with each 
suspected case thoroughly investigated and concluded. The Audit 
Committee reviews the actions taken by management in the 
elimination of fraudulent practices and to promote ethical working 
practices. 
During the year, the Audit Committee was made aware that the 
government authorities in India were investigating allegations of 
corporate espionage against an employee of Cairn India and 
employees of some other companies not connected with the Group. 
Cairn India has in place a comprehensive compliance programme 
and controls and follows the highest levels of integrity in the conduct 
of its businesses. Nevertheless, Cairn India is undertaking a further 
review of its controls in light of the allegations made in the matter. 
During the year, the Vedanta Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
was also reviewed and updated to promote the zero tolerance 
approach and embed this within the culture of the Group.
External auditor
The Audit Committee is pivotal in monitoring the performance of  
the external auditor and the Group’s relationship with the external 
auditor. Details of how this is achieved are set out below:
The audit process
A detailed audit plan (the Audit Plan) is prepared by the external 
auditor, Deloitte LLP, (Deloitte) which is reviewed by the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Plan sets out the audit scope, key audit risks 
identified, materiality issues, the client team working on the audit 
and the audit timetable. The audit scope covers the significant 
components of the audit and audit plans for each component and 
geographical location. Each of the key audit risks and the external 
auditor’s response on how it will investigate these risks is considered 
by the Audit Committee. 
Significant issues
The preparation of financial statements requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions, that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amount of 
assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of contingent 
liabilities at the date of these financial statements and the reported 
amount of revenues and expenses for the years presented. The 
Committee reviews whether the Group’s accounting policies are 
appropriate, and management’s estimate and judgements applied 
in the financial statements are reasonable. The Committee also 
focused on the disclosures made in the financial statements. The 
views of statutory auditors on these significant issues were 
also considered by the Committee. 
The significant issues that were considered by the Audit Committee emerging from the audit process are outlined below:
Significant issues How these issues were addressed
Impairment assessment of: 
• Rajasthan producing assets in the Group’s Oil & Gas business
• Copper operations in Zambia
• Alumina refinery assets as Lanjigarh
• Iron ore business at Goa and Karnataka
More information is provided in Note 2(b) and Note 5 to the financial 
statements
Impairment assessment of Rajasthan producing assets within  
the Oil & Gas business was considered as a significant issue 
considering the significant decline in the crude oil prices. The 
Committee has reviewed the significant assumptions including the 
oil price and discount rate. An impairment charge of US$2,162.1 
million has been recognised against these assets.
Impairment assessment of copper operations in Zambia was 
considered as a significant issue considering the decline in copper 
prices and other operational challenges. The significant assumptions 
of commodity prices and discount rate were reviewed by the 
Committee. An impairment charge of US$52.3 million has been 
recognised against these assets.
Impairment assessment of alumina refinery assets at Lanjigarh was 
considered as a significant issue due to the pending environment 
clearances for the refinery expansion and delays in obtaining 
bauxite mining approvals. The significant assumptions of timing of 
approvals were put through a stress test by the Committee and 
other assumptions of discount rates and commodity prices were 
reviewed by the Committee.
The mining operations at Karnataka were resumed towards the end 
of February 2015. The State Government of Goa has renewed the 
mining leases and the business is awaiting other approvals for the 
commencement of mining operations at Goa. The Committee 
reviewed the timing of start-up of operations post regulatory 
approvals which was the key consideration.
The Committee was also informed that the impairment assessment 
approach and assumptions were consistent across all business 
segments. With the existence of sufficient headroom over carrying 
value of assets it was concluded that no impairment was required 
for Lanjigarh assets and Goa and Karnataka iron ore assets. 96 Corporate governance and Directors’ reports

Audit Committee report continued
Significant issues How these issues were addressed
Impairment assessment of evaluation and exploration (E&E) assets
More information is provided in Note 2(b) and Note 5 to the financial 
statements
Considering the significant downward pressure on oil and other 
commodity prices, the impairment of E&E assets is considered a 
significant issue. The significant assumptions of oil and iron ore 
prices and the discount rate were reviewed by the Committee. 
An impairment charge of US$3,691.9 million has been recognised 
against oil & gas E&E assets primarily relating to Rajasthan block. 
Further an impairment charge of US$788.1 million has been 
recognised relating to exploratory wells in Sri Lanka. Considering  
the excess of recoverable value over carrying value of assets it  
was concluded that that no impairment was required for the  
iron ore assets.
Revenue recognition across the business:
• provisional pricing for sale of goods;
• oil & gas revenue;
• power tariff with GRIDCO.
The Committee reviewed the process and compliance around the 
Group revenue recognition policy and its consistent application. The 
Committee also sought management’s view on revenue recognition 
principles. The Committee was satisfied that the cut off procedures, 
transfer of risks and process followed for the pricing of goods were 
consistent and it concluded that these risks have been mitigated. 
Further receivables from GRIDCO, (which is under appeal following a 
tariff determination assessment by the Orissa Electricity Regulatory 
Commission) was assessed by the Committee together with revenue 
recognition in terms of the requirements of IAS 18. The tariff 
determination basis was also supported by an opinion from external 
legal counsel.
Litigation, environmental and regulatory risks. Refer to Note 38 to 
the financial statements.
A comprehensive legal paper was reviewed by the Committee and 
the mitigating factors were discussed with senior management, 
including head of legal. The Committee also reviewed the probable, 
possible and remote analysis carried out by management and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities in the financial statements. In 
respect of all significant disputes, management’s assessment was 
supported by legal opinions from external legal counsel.
Taxation. Additional information on these matters are disclosed in 
Note 38 to the financial statements
A comprehensive tax paper outlining taxation disputes in respect of 
withholding taxes relating to past acquisitions, eligibility of tax 
incentives and output taxes and other matters was placed before the 
Committee for its consideration. The Committee discussed these tax 
issues and reviewed the assessment of probable, possible and remote 
analysis and the process followed by management. The contingent 
liability disclosure was also reviewed by the Committee. In certain 
cases, views of tax experts supporting the management assessment 
was also provided to the Committee.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the external 
auditor’s independence and assessing their continued effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee and the Board place great emphasis on the 
objectivity of the external auditor. The current external auditor, 
Deloitte LLP, has been the Company’s auditor since its listing in 2003. 
The rotation of the audit partner’s responsibilities within Deloitte is 
required by their profession’s ethical standards and there is also 
rotation of key members within the audit team. Deloitte are required 
to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group’s audit every 
five years and the last audit partner rotation was in 2010. 
Accordingly, Mr A Kelly will retire as the audit partner for the 
Company’s audit and will be succeeded by Mr Chris Thomas. The 
audit partner responsible for the audit of the Indian subsidiaries was 
rotated in 2012, and the next rotation will take place in 2017. 
A key part of ensuring the independence of the external auditor is to 
have in place robust policies concerning matters that may affect 
their independence. The Company has in place policies on:
• The independence and objectivity of the external auditor;
• Employment of former employees of the external auditor; and
• Appointment of the external auditor for non-audit services.
These policies are based on the APB Ethical Standards for Auditors 
and are regularly reviewed to ensure they are in line with best 
practice. These controls provide the Audit Committee with 
confidence that the independence of Deloitte in their audit function 
will be maintained. The Audit Committee was satisfied with the 
external audit process and that the independence of the external 
auditors was not compromised.
Performance of the external auditor
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of 
Deloitte LLP using a survey comprising a range of questions covering 
objectivity, quality and efficiency. The Audit Committee concluded 
that the results of the survey were positive and considered that they 
continue to provide a high quality audit.  Strategic

Reappointment of the external auditor
The Committee has concluded that Deloitte LLP remain objective, 
independent and effective and accordingly recommended to the 
Board that a resolution to reappoint them be considered at the 2015 
Annual General Meeting. Following approval by the Board, a 
resolution to reappoint the incumbent auditor, Deloitte LLP, has 
been proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The 
Audit Committee is also responsible for determining the auditors’ 
remuneration on behalf of the Board, subject to the approval of 
shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Provision of non-audit services by the external auditor 
The Group’s policy on the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor specifies certain services which the external auditor 
is prohibited from undertaking in order to safeguard their objectivity 
and independence. This includes work relating to the financial 
statements that will ultimately be subject to audit and the provision 
of internal audit services. The policy also identifies those services 
which the external auditor is permitted to deliver to the Group. 
These include tax advisory services, and work on mergers, 
acquisitions and disposals. Of the permitted services any 
assignment in excess of US$100,000 may only be awarded to the 
external auditor with the prior approval of the Audit Committee.
All other permitted non-audit services and the fees paid to the 
external auditor for non-audit work are reported to the Audit 
Committee on a six monthly basis. This report includes safeguards 
put into place to ensure that any threats to the independence of the 
external auditor are mitigated. The majority of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor are tax advisory services, corporate 
finance matters or transaction related work. A separate team within 
Deloitte LLP is used to carry out non-audit work and overseen by 
a separate partner. An analysis of non-audit fees can be found in 
Note 10 to the financial statements.
External audit tender
Vedanta recognises the current requirements of the Code and 
transitional guidance in relation to audit tendering and rotation 
under the European Union text on Audit Regulation and Directive 
and the UK Competition Markets Authority Order.
In order to ensure good corporate governance and that the services 
of the external auditor remained of the highest quality, the Audit 
Committee has recommended that the provision of external audit 
services be put to tender in 2015 in respect of the provision of 
external audit services for the financial year ending 31 March 2017. 
The timing of the tender process has been aligned with the rotation 
of the external audit contracts of the Group’s Indian subsidiaries in 
order to enhance the effectiveness and reduce any potential 
disruption of the tender process. Under the Indian Companies Act 
2013, companies are required to rotate their external audit contract 
on completion of two terms of five years. 
As Deloitte LLP has served as the Company’s external auditor for 
over ten years, in accordance with transition provisions of the 
Competition and Markets Authority order, Deloitte LLP will resign as 
the Company’s external auditor following the completion of the 
external audit for the year ending 31 March 2016.
The year ahead
The Committee will be overseeing the tender process for the 
appointment of the external auditor for the fiscal year commencing 
1 April 2016. The Committee is also focused on preparing for the 
new requirements that the Company will be expected to comply 
with under the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code including the 
requirement for a Viability Statement.
In addition, the Audit Committee’s objectives for the forthcoming 
year include:
• implement findings from Board evaluation process; and
• focus on oversight of anti-bribery policies and procedures.

Operation of the Nominations Committee
Other Executive Directors and members of the senior management 
team may attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee as 
appropriate. The Chairman of the Nominations Committee provides 
an update to the Board in respect of the Committee’s activities.
Nominations Committee activities during the year
The focus this year has continued to be on issues of diversity, 
succession planning and Board composition due to the Nominations 
Committee’s awareness of the tenure of its Non-Executive Directors. 
Both the Nominations Committee and Board have discussed at 
length the need for refreshing of the Board and at the 
recommendation of the Nominations Committee, one new Non-
Executive Director was appointed to the Board in 2014. 
The main areas of activity of the Nominations Committee during the 
year are summarised below:
Area of responsibility Item
Board composition and succession planning • Review of skills, experience and diversity and approving key 
search criteria for recruitment of new Non-Executive Directors;
• Continued engagement of search consultancy to aid in 
recruitment process;
• Review of candidates and recommendation of the appointment 
of a new Non-Executive Director;
• Keeping under review potential candidates to address gender 
balance on the Board;
• Review of succession planning for executive management.
Governance • Considering the results of the Nominations Committee’s annual 
evaluation;
• Approval of disclosures in the Nominations Committee report in 
the Company’s annual report. 
Non-Executive Director independence • Review of the independence of each of the Non-Executive 
Directors prior to recommending their reappointment by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Recruitment process
When considering new appointments to the Board, the Nominations 
Committee reviews the balance of skills, experience and diversity on 
the Board to identify those criteria which are determined to be key 
to strengthening the effectiveness of the Board. These criteria form 
the basis of the search for new appointments to the Board. During 
the year, the Nominations Committee continued its work with 
independent Board recruitment agency, Spencer Stuart to conduct  
a global search for new Non-Executive Directors to succeed Messrs 
Mehta and Macdonald who have served on the Board for over  
nine years. Spencer Stuart was provided with a brief to identify 
candidates that had relevant experience of the extractive industries. 
The brief also requested the inclusion of more female candidates on 
candidate shortlists to address the lack of gender diversity on the 
Board and meet the aspirational target of achieving 25% of women 
on the Board by 2015. While the Nominations Committee is 
committed to addressing the gender imbalance, the Board is of the 
view that any appointments to the Board should be based on merit 
rather than to fulfil targets. Following the recruitment drive, Ms 
Katya Zotova was appointed as a Non-Executive Director. Ms Zotova 
has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the oil & gas industry 
having previously spent over a decade at Royal Dutch Shell, working 
on a number of commercial upstream roles and as Head of 
International Acquisitions and Divestments for Citigroup’s oil & gas 
division. Ms Zotova’s experience is of significant benefit to the Group 
in developing its oil & gas strategy. Spencer Stuart has no other 
connection with the Group other than to provide recruitment 
consultancy services to the Nominations Committee. 
The search of additional Board candidates is ongoing and it is 
expected that further appointments will be made in due course.
Succession planning
As part of the Board’s succession planning arrangements, the 
Nominations Committee has initiated a review of the composition of 
the Board Committees and details will be announced in due course. 
In addition to ongoing Board succession planning, during the year 
there was also significant focus on succession planning for senior 
management roles across the Group. Tom Albanese, Chief Executive 
Officer has continued the leadership review to assess the current 
leadership of the businesses and identify potential successors as 
part of a drive to have the right leadership in place for the delivery  
of the Group’s strategic objectives. As Mr SK Roongta is expected to 
retire from the Group later in the year, Mr Abhijit Pati was appointed 
as CEO – Aluminium in March 2015. In May 2015, Mr Ajay Dixit was 
appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Power and will lead the 
consolidation of the Group’s entire Power operations and develop 
the Power vertical. Following the review, a number of changes were 
made to the senior management structure to help provide the 
necessary focus to grow our businesses and deliver superior value to 
all stakeholders. Mr Kishore Kumar was appointed as CEO-Iron Ore 
Business to lead the revival of the Group’s profitable low cost mining 
operations in Karnataka and Goa and to develop the Group’s 
Liberian Iron Ore project. In 2015, Ms Deshnee Naidoo was 
appointed as CEO, Zinc International. 100 Corporate governance and Directors’ reports

Annual report and accounts FY2015
Talent development and senior management succession planning
Our people are our biggest asset for the delivery of business  
results and long-term shareholder value. We have renewed  
our commitment to nurturing and developing talent within the 
Group and reviewed career growth opportunities, learning and 
development and reward and recognition programmes within the 
Group. The ‘Leadership Connect’ programme was started to build 
leadership capability and ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified 
candidates for future succession to senior management positions 
within the Group. Another objective of the programme is to create 
leaders who can drive engagement within their teams to deliver 
superior performance for the Group. 
Diversity
The Board supports the importance of having diversity of thought 
and representation on its Board and it is one of the Nominations 
Committee’s tasks to ensure that this is achieved. Board diversity 
has been considered from a number of aspects, including but  
not limited to age, gender, race and ethnic origin, cultural and 
educational background. The Board has a wide range of knowledge 
and expertise including mining, oil & gas, corporate finance, 
banking, diplomacy and governance and the law. In terms of 
gender, the Company’s diversity policy has an aspirational target  
of achieving a minimum of 25% women on the Board by 2015.  
While we have made some progress towards this target following 
Ms Zotova’s appointment, we acknowledge that more needs to be 
done and this remains a top priority for the Nominations Committee. 
The Nominations Committee is also addressing the lack of gender 
diversity across its employee population and feel that it is essential 
to overcome the reasons for lack of female representation to date. 
These have included the fact that Vedanta operates within a 
traditionally male dominated industry. Furthermore, due to cultural 
constraints and the remote geographical location of some of our 
operations, we face a number of challenges in addressing the 
gender balance within the Group. Women currently comprise 8.64% 
of the overall employee population within the Group whereas the 
percentage of female representation across the Group’s professional 
population is 11.24%. In order to achieve our target for women on 
the Board, we ensure that female candidates are considered 
routinely as part of the recruitment process. 
We also actively encourage and monitor the progress of women in 
senior positions throughout the Group. Initiatives this year included 
reviewing the barriers to women with children in returning to work. 
By supporting equal opportunities we will ensure that the pool  
of women from which management can be drawn will increase.  
Ms Roma Balwani joined the Group as President – Group 
Communications, Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibilty 
and Ms Deshnee Naidoo was appointed as the CEO of Zinc 
International.
The year ahead
The Nominations Committee objectives for the coming year are:
• Review progress made on nurturing talent and improving the 
gender balance within the Group; 
• Continued focus on succession planning for the Board in order to 
ensure a balance of skills, experience and diversity; 
• A commitment to increasing the participation of women across 
all levels of the business, not least the Board of Directors; and 
• Appointment of additional Non-Executive Directors to succeed 
Messers Mehta and Macdonald.

Sustainability Committee report 
The Vedanta Sustainability 
Framework has enabled significant 
improvements in the way we 
do business. 
This Report provides details of the role and responsibilities of the 
Sustainability Committee and the work it has undertaken during 
the year.
Vedanta’s business model is to deliver operational excellence while 
demonstrating world class standards for governance, safety and 
social responsibility in the locations of the operations. This approach 
is fundamental to gain and maintain our license to operate and  
is vital to capture loyalty and insulate the company against crisis. 
The Sustainability Model, comprising of three pillars: Responsible 
Stewardship, Building Strong Relationships and Adding & Sharing 
Value was further strengthened this year with the addition of  
a new fourth pillar – Strategic Communications, that reflects our 
commitment to complete transparency and emphasises our 
principles of community dialogue and mutual respect, including  
free prior informed consent to access natural resources. The 
Sustainability Model guides us to ensure a long-term, sustainable 
future of our business operations, meeting our growth targets, and 
creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.
The Vedanta Sustainability Framework has enabled significant 
improvements in the way we do business. The Group’s vastly 
improved safety performance is testament that robust practices 
and processes can have a direct impact on performance. In 2014-15, 
we began to see tangible outcomes of our safety drive, with far 
fewer fatalities and lost time injuries. However, any unsafe incident 
is entirely unacceptable and I am deeply saddened that eight people 
lost their lives while working at Vedanta. Each subsidiary company’s 
Chief Executive presented a detailed appraisal of the root causes 
and action plans to the Committee. We maintained our focus on 
containing our impact on air, water and land use, to achieve our 
target for Water savings and Energy savings this year. As the 
businesses have met many of our goals, we have set escalated 
benchmarks. 
As we enter a new phase of our sustainability journey, the 
Committee recommended businesses to join WBCSD – WASH  
pledge, Global Compact Network – Women Empowerment Principles 
and other charters, to contribute towards establishing formal 
partnerships with national and international bodies on the cause  
of Sustainable Development. The Committee also advocated the 
internal committee to review gap assessment against UN principles 
of Human Rights and recognised that the subsidiary businesses 
need to improve their stakeholder engagement and management 
processes. 
We are using the Vedanta Sustainability Assurance Programme 
(VSAP) as our internal sustainability risk management tool to ensure 
framework compliance. As a result of follow up audit process,  
review and implementation of action plans each of the business –  
operational sites and mines have made the SMART objectives  
in line with our framework requirements and now monitor the 
performance at a regular intervals. I take this opportunity to thank 
the management across our businesses for their commitment to 
VSAP, which has been a demanding exercise.

Statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2015. The report 
sets out details of the Remuneration Policy, which received 
shareholder approval in 2014 (and is restated here for ease of 
reference), together with our Annual Report on Remuneration which 
details the remuneration paid to the Directors last year and the 
intended application of the policy for the current financial year.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
Following a full and detailed review of the Remuneration Policy 
during 2014, this was a quieter year for the Committee, in which  
we focused on ensuring that the new Remuneration Policy was 
implemented diligently. Particular matters which the Committee 
considered were as follows:
• Introduction of the new PSP as set out in the policy last year; 
• Introduction of new share ownership guidelines of 200%;
• Introduction of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, requiring the 
deferral of 50% of the annual bonus for Executive Directors,  
and improvement to the structuring of the annual bonus plan 
including revision of its performance metrics;
• Introduction of withholding and recovery provisions (claw-back) 
in both the annual bonus and LTIP;
• Freezing of salary for 2015/16; 
• Introduction of a new subsidiary share plan for Vedanta Limited; 
and
• Consultation relating to bonus metrics. 
Performance and Reward in the year to 31 March 2015 
Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the Group’s 
performance on various financial and production parameters has 
been encouraging and noteworthy. Vedanta’s performance during 
2014 is largely impacted on account of headwinds faced due to  
the significant fall in global commodity prices. The fall in short to 
medium-term oil prices has impacted on our reported financial 
results in respect of carrying some goodwill value of certain oil  
and gas assets with impairment charges booked in the income 
statement as set out in the financial review. We fully recognise the 
impact of the overall decline in market conditions has had on our 
shareholders. We propose, for our Executive Directors, for 2015  
no increase to their fixed compensation. 
For determining bonus, the business performance for the year has 
been evaluated in terms of the metrics approved for the year 
2014-15. Following evaluation against the set metrics, the 
achievement of targets is 37.2% of the maximum, and subsequently 
a bonus of 55.8% of salary is proposed for the Executive Chairman 
and Vice Chairman. Mr Tom Albanese’s contract for the fiscal year 
1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, entitled him to an incentive bonus  
up to a maximum of 50% of salary. Considering his contributions 
and performance during the year, the Committee determined that 
he should receive a bonus payout of 37.20% of salary. Under the 
remuneration policy, all the Executive Directors’ bonuses will be  
paid half in cash, with the balance in deferred shares. 
Under the Company’s legacy Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),  
the final 2011 award lapsed in August 2014 as a result of the TSR 
performance condition not being met. 
Remuneration for the year ending 31 March 2016
Recognising the challenging market context, the Remuneration 
Committee has determined that there should be no salary increases 
for the Executive Directors for this year. No changes will be made to 
the fees of the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee intends to make limited changes to the proposed 
implementation of the Remuneration Policy for this year. Consistent 
with our policy, this means a bonus maximum of 150% of salary for 
the Executive Directors, accompanied by a scorecard of targets 
which will be linked to our financial, sustainability and strategic 
performance. 
The Executive Directors will receive Performance Share Plan awards 
valued at 150% of salary this year, with vesting based entirely on 
Vedanta’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative  
to a peer group of comparators. We have made some changes to 
the composition of the TSR comparators group to reflect those 
companies listed both in the UK and internationally, which are felt to 
be of most relevance to Vedanta’s diversified structure, and the new 
group is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Conclusion
Since we are not proposing any changes to our remuneration policy 
this year, there will only be an advisory vote on the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, which provides details of the remuneration earned 
by Directors in the past financial year as well as the way in which  
we propose to operate the policy in the coming year. However, for 
clarity, we have reproduced the Remuneration Policy which was 
approved by shareholders in 2014. 
We hope that we will receive your support the policy for the Annual 
Report on Remuneration at the forthcoming AGM.
Yours sincerely,
Euan Macdonald

Annual report and accounts FY2015
Directors’ Remuneration Policy report
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was put to a vote at the 2014 
AGM and was approved by 99.93% of shareholders which voted. 
There is no requirement to vote on the policy in 2015 unless any 
changes to the policy are proposed, and the Committee does not 
intend to make any such changes at this time. The policy is set out 
for information only; the charts showing remuneration scenarios on 
page 107 have been updated to reflect the intended 
implementation of the policy for 2015. 
Policy overview
The key objective of the Group’s broad remuneration policy is to 
ensure that competitive and fair awards are linked to key 
deliverables and are also aligned with market practice and 
shareholders’ expectations.
The Committee ensures that remuneration policies and practices 
are designed to attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors 
and the senior management group, while focusing on the delivery of 
the Group’s strategic and business objectives. The Committee is also 
focused on aligning the interests of the Executive Directors and the 
senior management group with those of shareholders, to build a 
sustainable performance culture.
When setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes into account the business performance, 
developments in the natural resources sector and, considering that 
the majority of the Group’s operations are based in India, similar 
information for high-performing Indian companies.
The Committee has set remuneration taking into consideration both 
UK and Indian market practice to ensure it is globally competitive  
as the Executive Directors are based in India (with the exception of 
Mr Anil Agarwal, who is UK-based), along with the majority of the 
Group’s professional management team. The Committee also 
considers the inflation rates prevalent in UK and India in the setting 
of remuneration.
The Committee recognises that financial performance of the 
Company is heavily influenced by macro-economic considerations 
such as commodity prices and exchange rate movements. These 
factors are therefore taken into consideration when setting 
executive remuneration.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The Committee considers the AGM to be an opportunity to meet and 
communicate with investors and considers shareholder feedback 
received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more generally. This feedback, 
plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from 
time to time, is then considered as part of the Company’s annual 
review of remuneration policy. 
In addition, the Committee will seek to engage directly with major 
shareholders and their representative bodies should any material 
changes be proposed to the remuneration policy. Details of votes 
cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s 
remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders 
during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
How the views of employees are taken into account
In setting the policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee considers the pay and employment conditions across 
the Group, including annual base compensation increases across 
the general employee population and the overall spend on annual 
bonuses. Employees may be eligible to participate in the annual 
bonus arrangement and receive awards under the ESOP or LTIP. 
Opportunities and performance metrics may vary by employee level 
with specific business metrics incorporated where possible. 
The Committee does not formally consult with employees in respect 
of the design of the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy, 
although the Committee will keep this under review. 105

Summary of the remuneration policy for Directors
The following table sets out the key aspects of the remuneration policy for Directors:
Element of pay Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base 
compensation
1
Reflects individual’s 
experience and role 
within the Group.
Reward for performance 
of everyday activities.
The Committee reviews base 
compensation annually, 
taking account of the 
scale of responsibilities, 
the individual’s experience 
and performance.
Changes are implemented 
with effect from 
1 April each year.
Base compensation is paid 
in cash on a monthly basis.
Base compensation is 
typically set with reference 
to a peer group of UK-
listed mining comparator 
companies. Comparisons 
are also made against 
positions of comparable 
status, skill and responsibility 
in the metals and mining 
industries globally, and in 
the manufacturing and 
engineering industries 
more generally.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase. 
Base compensation 
increases are applied in 
line with the annual review 
and are competitive within 
the UK and Indian market 
and internationally for 
comparable companies. The 
Committee is also guided 
by the general increase for 
the employee population 
but on occasions may need 
to recognise, for example, 
development in role and/
or change in responsibility.
Business and individual 
performance are 
considered when setting 
base compensation.
Taxable 
benefits
To provide market 
competitive benefits.
Benefits vary by role and 
are reviewed periodically. 
Benefits are set in line with 
local market practices.
The value of benefits is based 
on the cost to the Company 
and is not pre-determined.
n/a
Pension To provide for sustained 
contribution and contribute 
towards retirement planning.
Directors receive pension 
contributions into their 
personal pension plan or 
local provident scheme.
Contribution rates are 
set in line with local 
market practices.
Annual contribution of up to 
15% of base compensation 
for the Deputy Executive 
Chairman and 20% of

the remainder of the bonus 
potential will be based on 
operational, strategic and 
sustainability measures.

Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees
To attract and retain high 
calibre Non-Executive 
Directors through the 
provision of market 
competitive fees.
Fees are paid in cash.
Fees are determined based 
on the significant travel 
and time commitments, 
the risk profile of the 
Company and market 
practice for similar roles in 
international mining groups.
As for the Executive 
Directors, there is no 
prescribed maximum 
annual increase. The 
Committee is guided by 
the general increase for 
the employee population 
but on occasions may need 
to recognise, for example, 
development in role and/

Business and individual 
performance are considered 
when setting fees.
1 Base compensation includes base salary plus fixed cash allowances and statutory benefits, which are a normal part of the fixed remuneration package for employees in India.

Notes
1 Base compensation levels are based on those applying on 1 April 2015. In the case of 
Navin Agarwal, who receives most of his salary in INR, the salary is converted at a 
rate of INR98.5641: £1.
2 The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits 
(as disclosed) for the year ending 31 March 2015 in the case of all the 
Executive Directors.
3 The value of pension receivable by the Deputy Executive Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer in 2015/16 is taken to be 15% and 20% of base compensation 
respectively.
4 The on-target level of bonus assumed to be 2/3
rd
 of the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity.
5 The on-target level of the PSP assumed to be 50% of the face value of the award 
at grant.
6 Share price movement and dividend accrual have not been incorporated into the 
values shown above.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director – i.e. base 
compensation, taxable benefits, pension, annual bonus and 
long-term incentive awards – would be set in accordance with the 
terms of the Company’s prevailing approved remuneration policy at 
the time of appointment and would reflect the experience of the 
individual. 
The base compensation for a new executive may be set below the 
normal market rate, with phased increases over the first few years, 
as the executive gains experience in their new role. Annual bonus 
potential will be limited to 150% of base compensation and 
long-term incentives will be limited to 150% of base compensation 
per annum. 
Selection of performance metrics
The annual bonus is based against a balanced scorecard of financial, 
operational, sustainability and strategic metrics. The mix of targets 
will be reviewed each year by the Committee to ensure that they 
remain appropriate to reflect the priorities for the Group in the year 
ahead. A sliding scale of targets is set to encourage continuous 
improvement and challenge the delivery of stretch performance.
The PSP is based on relative TSR performance, which provides an 
external assessment of the Company’s performance against the 
market. It also aligns the rewards received by executives with the 
returns received by shareholders. A sliding scale of challenging 
performance targets is set. The Committee will review the choice of 
performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance 
targets prior to each PSP grant. The Committee reserves the 
discretion to set different targets for future awards, without 
consulting with shareholders, providing that, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the new targets are no less challenging in light of the 
circumstances at the time than those used previously. The targets 
for awards granted under this remuneration policy are set out for 
shareholder approval in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors 
The charts below illustrate how the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration packages vary at different levels of performance 
under the ongoing policy, which will apply from 1 April 2015.

In addition the Committee may offer additional cash and/or 
share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best 
interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders) to take 
account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former 
employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and 
performance requirements attaching to that remuneration. 
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay 
out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account 
the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided 
that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest 
opportunity. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree 
that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses and 
continuing allowances as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy at that time.
Service contracts for Executive Directors
The Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive 
Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
Mr Anil Agarwal is employed under a contract of employment with 
the Company for a rolling term but which may be terminated by not 
less than six months’ notice. Provision is made in Mr Anil Agarwal’s 
contract for payment to be made in lieu of notice on termination 
which is equal to base compensation.
Mr Navin Agarwal has a letter of appointment with the Company 
which is a rolling contract and may be terminated by giving six 
months’ notice. Mr Navin Agarwal has a service agreement with 
Vedanta Limited (Formerly known as (Sesa Sterlite Limited) which 
expires on 31 July 2018, with a notice period of three months or base 
compensation in lieu thereof.
Mr Tom Albanese has a separate letter of appointment with the 
Company and Vedanta Limited (Formerly known as Sesa Sterlite 
Limited) on a fixed three year term which expires on 31 March 2017, 
but which may be terminated by not less than three months’ notice. 
Provision is made in Mr Tom Albanese’s contract for payment to be 
made in lieu of notice on termination which is equal to three 
months’ base compensation and benefits.
It is the Group’s policy that the notice period in the Directors’ service 
contracts does not exceed 12 months.
Copies of all Executive Directors’ service contracts and the letters  
of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection during normal business hours at the registered office of 
the Company, and available for inspection at the AGM.
Payments for loss of office
The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide for pay in lieu of 
notice in respect of base compensation, as set out above.
The annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the 
financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time and paid 
at the normal payout date. Any share-based entitlements granted 
to an Executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be 
determined based on the relevant plan rules. 
The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards 
lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, ‘good 
leaver’ status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will 
normally vest on the original vesting date, subject to the satisfaction 
of the relevant performance conditions at that time and reduced 
pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually 
served. However, the Committee has discretion to determine that 
awards vest at an earlier date and/or to disapply time pro-rating, 
although it is envisaged that this would only be applied in 
exceptional circumstances. Any such incidents, where discretion is 
applied by the Committee, will be disclosed in the next year’s Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
The default treatment for deferred annual bonus awards is that any 
outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in 
certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (as described under the PSP 
above) awards will normally vest in full on the original vesting date.
In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good 
leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the performance 
of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
In the event of a change of control all unvested awards under the 
deferred annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements 
would vest, to the extent that any performance conditions attached 
to the relevant awards have been achieved. The award will, other 
than in exceptional circumstances, be pro-rated for the period of the 
financial year served. 
Letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment which may 
be terminated by either party by giving three months’ notice. The 
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment set out the time 
requirements expected of them in the performance of their duties. 
Non-Executive Directors are normally expected to spend at least 20 
days per year in the performance of their duties for the Company. 
There is no provision in the letters of appointment of the Non-
Executive Directors for compensation to be paid in the event of early 
termination. 
Legacy arrangements
For avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former Directors (such  
as the vesting of past share awards) that have been disclosed to  
and approved by shareholders in this and previous Remuneration 
Reports. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.

1 This refers to the number of meetings of the Remuneration Committee held during 
the year which the Director was entitled to attend following her appointment to 
the Committee.
The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its terms of 
reference, which are available on the Company’s website at  
www.vedantaresources.com or on request from the Company 
Secretary. The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed during 
the year, and no further amendments have been made in the year 
ended 31 March 2015. 
The Committee’s responsibilities primarily include:
• setting the Group’s overall policy on executive and senior 
management remuneration;
• determining the remuneration packages for individual Executive 
Directors, including base compensation, performance-based 
short- and long-term incentives, pensions and other benefits;
• approving the design and operation of the Company’s share 
incentive schemes; and
• reviewing and determining the terms of the service agreements 
of the Executive Directors.
Advisers to the Committee
The Committee retained New Bridge Street (NBS), a trading name  
of Aon plc, to provide independent advice on remuneration matters. 
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code  
of Conduct, which requires its advice to be objective and impartial. 
NBS does not provide any other services to the Company. Other pay 
information for employees below Board level is provided to the 
Company by Aon in India. The Committee considers that this 
enables a global perspective to be achieved. Where relevant,  
NBS reviews the work of Aon India to ensure that the advice is 
appropriate for a UK plc context and internally consistent. The 
Committee has reviewed the operating processes in place at  
NBS and is satisfied that the advice it receives is objective and 
independent. The Committee considers various external reports 
from NBS on remuneration in the UK as well as India to provide 
detailed insights that aid remuneration decisions. The fees paid to 
NBS in respect of work carried out in 2014/15 were £119,360 
(excluding VAT). This fee predominantly related to the development 
and roll out of the new Remuneration Policy and implementation of 
the new PSP and Deferred Bonus scheme, together with providing  
ad hoc advice to the Remuneration Committee. Other advisers to 
the Committee during the year and their roles are set out below.
• Mr Rajesh Padmanabhan (President – Group HR) advises the 
Committee on general remuneration policies and practices 
followed in India and the global market, Executive Directors’ 
remuneration and benefits and remuneration policy applicable  
to the wider employee population within the Group.
• The Executive Directors provide input on remuneration packages 
for the senior management group to ensure parity amongst 
senior management in different businesses but at similar roles. 
Executive Directors may attend meetings at the invitation of the 
Committee but no Director is present during discussions of their 
own remuneration.
• Ernst & Young LLP review and confirm the Company’s TSR 
performance in respect of the Long-Term Incentive Plan. Ernst & 
Young also provide tax and internal audit services to the Group.

zero bonus is paid for nil performance increasing to full payment at stretch performance.
2 Sustainability scorecard measures include resource use and management, stakeholder engagement and management, compliance and training, incident investigation and 
change management.

Duty and Bauxite Supply. 
The bonus payment in relation to performance in the 2014/15 financial year will be payable 50% on cash and 50% in shares. 
For determining a bonus, the business performance for the year has been evaluated in terms of the metrics approved for the year 2014-15. 
Following evaluation against the set metrics, the achievement of targets is 37.2% of the maximum, and subsequently a bonus of 55.8% of 
salary is proposed for the Executive Chairman and Vice Chairman. Mr Tom Albanese’s contract for the fiscal year 1 April 2014 to 31 March 
2015, entitled him to an incentive bonus up to a maximum of 50% of salary. Considering his contributions and performance during the year, 
the Committee determined that he should receive a bonus payout of 37.20% of salary. Under the remuneration policy, all the Executive 
Directors’ bonuses will be paid half in cash, with the balance in deferred shares.  112 Corporate governance and Directors’ reports

1 The 2011 LTIP awards were subject to a TSR performance condition, Vedanta’s performance fell short of the median of the comparator group (which represented the threshold 
level of performance required for a vesting), and thus all the awards lapsed. 
2 In respect of the ESOP awards made on 24 September 2012, as reported previously, the performance target was met and as a result 18% of the shares vested on 24 September 
2013. 10.8% and 7.2% of the shares will vest on 24 September 2014 and 24 September 2015 respectively, subject to continued employment. 
3 The vesting of PSP awards is subject to measurement of the Company’s performance in terms of TSR, as set out above
External appointments
The Board’s policy on external appointments is that an Executive Director may, only with the prior approval of the Board, accept an 
appointment external to the Group (other than any appointment as a Non-Executive Director to related parties or Volcan Investments 
Limited (Volcan) in the case of Messrs Anil Agarwal and Navin Agarwal) of a publicly listed company anywhere and that the fees for any such 
appointment may be retained by the individual.
Mr Tom Albanese is a Non-Executive Director at Franco-Nevada Corporation where he is entitled to retain any remuneration paid to him. His 
fees for this position in 2014/15 were $22,500. Tom was granted 75,000 stock options on 19 August 2013. They vest 1/3 on each of the first, 
second and third anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price is C$46.17 per option. None of the other Executive Directors currently 
receive fees for non-executive appointments with other companies.

The Directors’ report
Purpose of the Directors’ report
The Directors are pleased to present their annual report on the 
business of the Group, together with the financial statements and 
auditor’s report, for the year ended 31 March 2015. 
The purpose of the Directors’ report is to provide shareholders with 
certain statutory information about the Company, its Directors and 
operations. The strategic report informs shareholders and helps 
them assess how the Directors have performed their duty to 
promote the success of the Company. In addition, as a company 
listed on the London Stock Exchange, it is required to provide 
information which includes amongst other things, details of the 
Company’s share capital, voting rights, rules on Directors’ 
appointments and significant agreements that alter on change of 
control.
Strategic report
The strategic report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 which requires the Company to set out a fair 
review of the business of the Group during the financial year, 
including an analysis of the position of the Group at the end of the 
financial year and the trends and factors likely to affect the future 
development, performance and position of the business. The 
strategic report can be found on pages 1 to 75.
Corporate governance
In accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (DTR) 7.2.1 the disclosures required by DTR7.2.2R 
to DTR7.2.5 and DTR7.2.7 may be found in the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 80 to 115. The Corporate Governance Report is 
incorporated into this Directors’ report by reference. Information 
referred to in DTR7.2.6 is located in this Directors’ report. 
The strategic report and other sections of this annual report contain 
forward looking statements. By their nature, forward looking 
statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to 
events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in 
the future and may be beyond the Company’s ability to control or 
predict. Forward looking statements and past performance are 
therefore not guarantees of future performance. The information 
contained in the strategic report has been prepared on the basis of 
information and knowledge available to the Directors at the date of 
preparation and the Company does not undertake to update or 
revise the content during the year ahead.
Review of business, future developments and important post 
balance sheet events
A review of the business and future developments of the Group is 
presented in the strategic report. Events since the balance sheet 
date are summarised in Note 43 on page 198 of the financial

recommendation at the Annual General Meeting on 3 August 2015, 
the final dividend will be paid on 12 August 2015 to shareholders on 
the register of members as at 10 July 2015.
Taken together with the interim dividend of 23 US cents per ordinary 
share paid to shareholders on 22 December 2014, the total dividend 
for the year is 63.0 US cents per ordinary share (2014: 61.0 US cents 
per ordinary share).
Directors
The names, date of appointment, specific responsibilities and 
biographical details of the Company’s current Board of Directors are 
shown on pages 76 to 77 and details of the Directors who held office 
during the year ended 31 March 2015 are shown in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 87. Details of the remuneration of the 
Directors, their interests in the shares of the Company and service 
contracts are contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 103 to 115.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles) specify that the 
minimum number of Directors of the Company, unless determined 
by ordinary resolution, shall be two. There is no limit on the 
maximum number of Directors. The Company or the Board may 
appoint any person to be a Director. Any Director appointed by the 
Board shall hold office only until the next general meeting and is 
then eligible for election by the shareholders. The Articles specify 
that at least one-third of the Directors, or if their number is not three 
or multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third, shall retire 
from office at every Annual General Meeting. The Directors to retire 
by rotation are those who have been longest in office since 
appointment or reappointment. However, in accordance with the 
requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all of the 
Directors will retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and 
being eligible will offer themselves for re-election.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company’s Articles and to any directions given by special resolution, 
the business of the Company is to be managed by the Board which 
may exercise all the powers of the Company. Strategic

Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and indemnities
The Company purchases and maintains liability insurance for its 
Directors and officers and those of the subsidiaries of the Group, as 
permitted by the Companies Act 2006. The insurance policy does 
not provide cover where the Director has acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly. The Company believes that it is appropriate to provide 
such cover to protect Directors from innocent error as the Directors 
carry significant liability under criminal and civil law and under the 
UK Listing, Prospectus and Disclosure and Transparency Rules, and 
face a range of penalties.
In addition the Company’s Articles contain an indemnity provision in 
favour of the Directors against proceedings brought by third parties, 
subject to the Companies Act 2006, to allow the Company to pay 
legal defence costs for the Director where the Director is exonerated.
Employees
Information on the Group’s employees and its policies with respect 
to employees can be found in the Sustainable Development Report 
on page 42.
Political donations
It is the Board’s policy that neither Vedanta nor any of its subsidiary 
companies outside India may, under any circumstances, make 
donations or contributions to political organisations. Subsidiaries in 
India may make political donations or contributions as this is 
customary in India and permitted under local legislation. In 
exceptional circumstances, if political donations or contributions are 
deemed necessary in the United Kingdom and European Union for 
legitimate business reasons, they will not be made without the 
approval of the Board and shareholders at a general meeting. Any 
political donations made in India will be disclosed in the Company’s 
annual report. The Company and its subsidiaries did not make any 
political donations during the financial year ended 31 March 2015 
(2014: US$3.7 million).
Research and development
The Group’s business units carry out research and development 
activities necessary to further their operations.

Company’s articles of association (the Articles) and applicable 
English law concerning companies. This is a summary only and the 
relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006, (the Act) or the

Company’s registered office during normal business hours 
(Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted). They are also

Amendments to the Articles
The Company’s Articles may be amended only by special resolution 
passed by the Company’s shareholders.
Share capital
As at 31 March 2015 the issued share capital of the Company was 
comprised of 299,868,180 ordinary shares of US$0.10 each and 
50,000 deferred shares of £1 each.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary and deferred 
shares are set out in the Articles. Details of the authorised and 
issued share capital together with movements in the Company’s 
issued share capital during the year are shown in Note 35 of the 
financial statements.
6,904,995 ordinary shares of 10 US cents each were issued on the 
conversion of certain convertible bonds issued by one of the 
Company’s subsidiaries. These 6,904,995 ordinary shares are held 
through a global depository receipt and carry no voting rights. Apart 
from the above, each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at 
general meetings of the Company. Holders of deferred shares are 
not entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the 
Company, nor are they entitled to the payment of any dividend or to 
receive notice of general meetings.
Further details of the rights attaching to the deferred shares are set

Variation of rights
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the rights attached to any class 
may be varied with the consent of the holders of three-quarters in

of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general meeting 
of the holders of the shares of the class.

Votes may be exercised at general meetings in relation to the 
business being transacted either in person, by proxy or, in relation to

No member shall be entitled to vote at a general meeting or at a 
separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the capital 
of the Company, either in person or by proxy, in respect of any share 
held by him unless all monies payable by him in respect of that 
share have been fully paid. Furthermore, no shareholder shall be 
entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general 
meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of that class of 
shares or on a poll if he has been served with a notice after failing to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests in his 
shares that is required to be provided under the Act. 118 Corporate governance and Directors’ reports
Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
With the exception of restrictions on the transfer of unpaid shares 
and ordinary shares held under the Company’s employee share 
incentive plans whilst the shares are subject to the rules of the 
plans, there are no restrictions on the transfer rights attaching 
to the Company’s ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in 
the Company. 
No person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights 
with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of 
any agreements between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions in the transfer of securities or voting rights. 
Issue of shares
The powers of the Company’s Directors are subject to relevant 
legislation and, in certain circumstances (including in relation to the 
issue or buying back by the Company of its shares), are subject to 
authority being given to the Directors by shareholders in general 
meeting. At the Company’s 2015 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders will be asked to renew the Directors’ authority to allot 
new securities. Details are contained in the 2015 Notice of Annual 
General Meeting (Notice of AGM).
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company has authority 
under its Articles to allot new shares in the Company. Such authority 
would be exercised having regard to the Statement of Principles 
published by the Pre-emption Group.
Shares held in uncertificated form
Subject to the provisions of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 
2001, the Board may permit the holding of shares in any class of 
shares in uncertificated form and the transfer of title to shares in 
that class by means of a relevant system and may determine that 
any class of shares shall cease to be a participating security.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by ordinary 
resolution declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights 
of the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends if 
it appears to the Board that they are justified by the profits of the 
Company available for distribution. The treasury shares directly held 
by the Company are not entitled to receive a dividend.
Dividends may be declared and paid in any currency or currencies 
that the Board shall determine. The Board may also determine the 
exchange rate and the relevant date for determining the value of 
the dividend in any currency.
Dividend waiver
There have been no arrangements applicable under which a 
shareholder agreed to waive future dividends during the year ended 
31 March 2015.
Purchase of the Company’s own shares
The Directors had authority, under a shareholders’ resolution dated 
1 August 2014, to make market purchases of up to approximately 
10% of the Company’s ordinary shares.
The authority expires at the conclusion of the Company’s 2015 
Annual General Meeting or on 1 October 2015, whichever is the 
earlier. A resolution to obtain a further authority will be proposed at 
the 2015 Annual General Meeting. During the year the Company did 
not purchase any shares under its previously announced share 
buyback programme.
As at 31 March 2015, the Company held a total of 24,206,816 
ordinary shares in treasury equivalent to 8.07% (2014: 8.12%) of the 
issued share capital.
Agreements: change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as 
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, and capital market 
borrowing. The following are considered to be significant in terms of 
their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole:
1 The US$1.25 billion 5.50% guaranteed convertible bonds (current 
outstanding US$1,134.5 million) issued in July 2009 and the 
US$883 million 4.0% guaranteed convertible bonds (current 
outstanding US$8.1 million) issued in March 2010, where a change 
of control gives investors the option to require the issuer to 
redeem their bonds at the principal amount, together with any 
accrued and unpaid interest, or convert their bonds at an 
adjusted exchange price for a certain period following the 
relevant event. 
2 The US$750m 6.75% bonds due in 2016, US$750 million 9.5% 
bonds due 2018, US$1,200 million 6% bonds due in 2019, US$900 
million 8.25% bonds due in 2021, US$500 million 7.125% bonds 
due in 2023 where a change of control requires the Company to 
make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding bonds at 101% 
of the principal amount together with any accrued and unpaid 
interest with a rating decline. 
3 In the financing arrangements for the acquisition of Cairn India 
Limited and various other financing facilities entered into by the 
Group where a change of control gives the majority lenders the 
right to declare the loans immediately payable.
All of the Company’s employee share incentive plans contain 
provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and 
options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of 
control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions 
and pro rata reduction as may be applicable under the rules of the 
employee share incentive plans.
There are no agreements between the Company and any of its 
Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss of 
office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Disclosure of information to auditors
In accordance with section 418 of the Act, each Director who held 
office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirms that:
• so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
• he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as 
a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information. 
Reappointment of auditors
A resolution to reappoint the auditor, Deloitte LLP, will be proposed 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP has been approved by the Audit Committee, which will 
also be responsible for determining the auditors’ remuneration on 
behalf of the Board, subject to the approval of shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. In order to ensure good 
corporate governance and that the services of the external auditor 
remained of the highest quality, the Audit Committee has 
recommended that the provision of external audit services be put to 
tender in 2015 in respect of the provision of external audit services 
for the financial year ending 31 March 2017. As Deloitte LLP has 
served as the Company’s external auditor for over 10 years, in 
accordance with transition provisions of the Competition and 
Markets Authority (CMA) order, Deloitte LLP will resign as the 
Company’s external auditor following the completion of the external 
audit of the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2016.

An explanation of the Group’s financial management objectives and 
policies together with details of the Group’s exposure to price risk, 
credit risk, liquidity and cash flow risk and foreign currency risk 
appears in Note 29 to the financial statements.
Interest capitalisation 
The interest capitalised by the Group during the year and treatment 
of any related tax relief are found in Note 7.
Share allotments

equity securities otherwise than to holders of the Company’s equity 
shares and which has not been authorised by the Company’s 
shareholders. 
Share placing
The Company has not participated in any share placing during the 
year ended 31 March 2015.

Relationship Agreement with the Company’s controlling 
shareholder
Details of the Relationship Agreement between the Company and 
its controlling shareholder, Volcan Investments Limited are provided 
on page 88. During the year, there have been no contracts of 
significance between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and the 
controlling shareholder.
Going concern
The Group has a strong balance sheet that gives sufficient 
headroom to raise further debt should the need arise. The Group’s 
current ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch are BB, 
Ba1 and BB+ respectively, with Negative outlook from Standard and 
poor’s and Stable outlook from both Moody’s and Fitch . These 
ratings support the necessary financial leverage and access to debt 
or equity markets at competitive terms, taking into consideration 
current market conditions. The Group generally maintains a healthy 
liquidity, gearing ratio and retains flexibility in the financing 
structure to alter the ratio when the need arises. As a consequence, 
the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its 
financing risks.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and accounts.
Annual General Meeting
The 12th Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on 
3 August 2015 at 3pm at Ironmongers’ Hall, Shaftesbury Place,

Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Vedanta Resources plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 
2015 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated and parent Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, and the related Notes 1 to 59. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the parent Company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement contained within the strategic report that the Group is a 
going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements 
is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are 
those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.
Risk
Impairment of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets
There is a risk associated with the assessment of the recoverable 
amount of certain operating assets included within PP&E, 
specifically:
• the Rajasthan producing assets within the Oil & Gas business 
following a significant decrease in oil prices;
• the Lanjigarh expansionary program within the Aluminium 
business unit which remains on hold pending environmental 
clearances being obtained; 
• the operations in Goa and Karnataka within the Iron Ore business 
unit as a result of lower iron ore prices and mining approval 
pending in Goa following state-wide bans on iron ore mining; and
• the KCM operations in Zambia following lower copper prices and 
continuing operational challenges.
The Group has recognised PP&E assets with a net book value of 
US$17,937.9 million at 31 March 2015 and has recorded impairments 
against PP&E of US$2,214.4 million in 2015. 
For more information see Notes 2(b), 5 and 17 in the financial 
statements that provide further details and disclosures to this 
matter.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We have:
• audited management’s assessment as to whether indicators of 
impairment exist for operating assets, specifically, in relation to 
the Rajasthan producing assets, the Lanjigarh expansionary 
project, the iron ore operations in Goa and Karnataka and the 
KCM copper operations in Zambia;
• obtained and assessed the valuation models used to determine 
the higher of value in use or fair value less cost of disposal of the 
relevant asset by challenging the key assumptions made by 
management in relation to these models, including:
 – the expected timings of approvals and renewal of licences; 
 – source of reserve and production estimates;
 – resources to reserves conversion ratios where applicable;
 – exchange rates; and 
 – operating and capital expenditure estimates
by reference to independent third party evidence and consultation 
with operational management;
• benchmarking and analysis of commodity, oil and gas price 
assumptions against forward curves and analyst data;
• recalculated and benchmarked discount rates applied to third 
party evidence and involvement of Deloitte valuation specialists; 
• testing the mechanical accuracy of the models used;
• assessed whether assumptions had been determined and applied 
on a consistent basis across the Group; and
• assessed the procedures performed by management during the 
year to progress the approval of environmental clearances where 
these remain outstanding.
Impairment of evaluation and exploration (E&E) assets
Following significant downward pressure on oil, gas and other 
commodity prices, which are a key assumption in the valuation of 
the recoverable value of E&E assets, a new risk has been included in 
our audit opinion in 2015.
The assessment of the carrying value of E&E assets requires 
management to exercise judgement around complex areas, as 
described in the Group’s critical accounting judgements on page 
144. Economic value can often be difficult to determine given the 
relatively early stages of development. The areas of judgement 
include the group’s intention to proceed with a future work 
programme for a prospect or licence, the likelihood of licence 
renewal or extension and the success of drilling and geological 
analysis.
The net book value of E&E assets at 31 March 2015 is US$5,414.1 
million after the Group has written off E&E assets totalling 
US$4,480.0 million in the year. 
For more information see Notes 2(b), 5 and 17 in the financial 
statements that provide further details and disclosures to this 
matter.
Independent Auditor’s Report 
To the Members of Vedanta Resources plc 122 Financial statements
Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
We evaluated management’s assessment of the potential 
impairment indicators on its E&E assets with reference to the criteria 
of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources and 
the Group’s successful efforts accounting policy (see page 137). In 
2015, the Group has reconsidered its exploration strategy and 
locations for future exploration focus in the context of a lower oil 
and commodity price environment and the availability of capital in 
these circumstances.
Our procedures included understanding the Group’s ongoing E&E 
activity, by participating in meetings with operational and finance 
management at all key locations and obtaining evidence including 
reviewing minutes of board and executive committee meetings, 
confirmations of budget allocation, the results of on-going appraisal 
activity and the licensing status to assess E&E assets. 
Where indicators of impairment were identified, we determined 
whether management provided in full for the projects that are 
not expected to proceed or valuations were performed where the 
projects are progressing but the carrying value may not be fully 
recoverable.
Where valuations were prepared, we challenged the key 
assumptions using the same approach as described under the 
impairment of PPE assets above.
Revenue recognition
IAS 18 Revenue and the Group’s revenue recognition policy permits 
revenue to be recognised only when the risks and rewards of 
ownership have transferred from the seller to the buyer. 
The risk is related to:
• inappropriate recognition of sales made during the year on a bill 
and hold or consignment basis; 
• incorrect valuation of provisionally priced sales (where the pricing 
is only finalised based on market prices subsequent to the 
balance sheet date);
• the value of regulated sales, and the resulting year-end receivable 
of US$114.0 million, made to the Grid Corporation of Odisha 
Limited (“Gridco”) where a dispute regarding the interpretation of 
the tariff agreement is pending appellate tribunal resolution; and 
• the calculation of Cairn’s oil and gas sales on an entitlement 
basis.
For more information see Notes 2a and 4 in the financial statements 
that provide further details and disclosures to this matter.
We have reviewed the application of the Group’s revenue 
recognition policy and:
•  reviewed the terms of bill and hold agreements to conclude on 
the point at which risk and reward transfer takes place;
• recalculated the value of provisional pricing adjustments and 
validating the assumptions used to third party data where 
possible;
• challenged management in respect of whether the Gridco trade 
receivables are recoverable through the review of state regulatory 
commission and the appellate tribunal rulings, review of the 
underlying power purchase agreements and the external legal 
opinions received and the involvement of Deloitte power 
specialists to re-assess the tariff calculations; and
• reviewed the terms of Cairn’s profit sharing agreement and tested 
the underlying entitlement calculations.
Litigation, environmental and regulatory risk
As is the norm in extractive industries, there are a significant 
number of legal claims in the Group and a risk exists that the Group 
may not have provided adequately for liabilities. There is also a risk 
of the Group’s reputation being brought into disrepute resulting in 
financial and reputational damage. 
The Group continues to be involved in a high number of legal claims. 
It is not unusual for claims to remain outstanding for a number of 
years, with the regulatory environment becoming increasingly 
complex and regulators focusing on the environmental and social 
impacts. These ongoing claims, environmental and regulatory 
enquiries are a threat to the future operations as well as the Group’s 
current financial performance and reputation.
For more information see Notes 30, 38 and 42 in the financial 
statements that provide further details and disclosures to these 
matters.
 
We have: 
• reviewed management’s legal paper and challenged their 
assessment of the probability of success in these cases, the 
magnitude of any potential loss and their conclusions reached 
through discussions with the head of legal and operational 
management;
• inspected external legal opinions (where considered necessary) 
and other evidence that supports factual information in 
management’s responses; and
• focused our procedures on the terms and conditions of mining 
licenses and performed procedures to gain assurance over the 
compliance and validity of all mining licences and environmental 
clearances. 
We have assessed the appropriateness of provisions and considered 
the impact of the procedures performed above on the financial 
statements and whether the disclosures therein are in accordance 
with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Taxation
There is a risk that the Group’s aggregated taxation exposure in all 
jurisdictions, including the exposure to withholding taxes following 
past acquisitions, financing and transfer pricing arrangements, sales 
taxes and recognition of deferred taxation assets and liabilities, may 
not have been adequately valued and disclosed in the financial 
statements due to the complexities, timescales for resolution and 
the need to negotiate with various tax authorities.
In the current year, Cairn India received an order form the Indian Tax 
Authority for an amount of US$3,274.4 million relating to 
withholding taxes not paid on the acquisition of Cairn India by the 
previous owner, Cairn Energy plc.
At 31 March 2015, US$2,588.7 million has been recognised as a 
deferred taxation liability, US$1,252.6 million has been recognised as 
a deferred taxation asset and US$34.1 million has been recognised 
as a net current tax payable, with a total tax credit of US$1,852.5 
million recorded in the consolidated income statement. 
For more information see Notes 12, 31 and 38 in the financial 
statements that provide further details and disclosures to these 
matters.

Annual report and accounts FY2015

We reviewed the potential taxation exposures within the Group and, 
through discussions with the Group’s taxation department, the tax 
specialists within the audit team and review of relevant 
documentation, including external legal advice and correspondence 
with tax authorities, we evaluated the appropriateness of the 
provisions raised and contingent liability disclosures. 
We considered, in the context of our tax specialists’ prior experience 
of similar issues, the Group‘s exposure to withholding taxes following 
past acquisitions, the current tax exposure following the Group’s 
internal restructuring, transfer pricing arrangements and deferred 
taxation assets and liabilities recognised to assess whether these 
matters were appropriately reflected and disclosed in the financial 
statements.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the 
significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on 
page 95.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not 
to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our 
opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to 
any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion 
on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$50 million (2014: 
US$75 million), which is approximately 5% (2014: 5%) of normalised 
profit before tax, and below 1% (2014: 1%) of equity. Profit before tax 
has been normalised by adjusting for specific one-off items: the 
impairment charges recognised on the PP&E and E&E assets during 
the year following a significant decrease in commodity and oil and 
gas prices. Normalised profit before tax is considered a more 
appropriate and less volatile measure reflecting the underlying scale 
of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of US$1.0 million (2014: 
US$1.5 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in 
our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report 
to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified 
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Annual report and accounts FY2015
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at 16 locations. 12 of these were subject 
to a full audit, whilst the remaining four were subject to an audit of 
specified account balances where the extent of our testing was 
based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and 
of the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. These 
16 locations represent the principal business units and account for 
94% (2014: 100%) of the Group’s net assets, 99% (2014: 100%) of the 
Group’s revenue and 91% (2014: 100%) of the Group’s profit before 
tax offset on consolidation by losses elsewhere in the Group. They 
were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking 
audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified 
above. Our audit work at the 16 locations was executed at levels of 
materiality applicable to each individual entity and which were 
lower than Group materiality. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process 
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or 
a senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the locations 
where the Group audit scope was focused at least once every five 
years. At each six month reporting date we include the component 
audit partners and teams in our team briefing, discuss their risk 
assessment, and review documentation of the findings from their 
work.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in 
our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of  
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the annual report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual 
Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the  
Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we 
communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should 
have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any 
such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International 
Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit 
methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality 
controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards 
review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.

Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

2 Under Indian law, a general reserve is created through an annual transfer of net income to general reserves at a specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations. 
The purpose of these transfers is to ensure that the total dividend distribution is less than the total distributable results for that year. Transfer to general reserves also includes 
US$30 million of debenture redemption reserve and US$4.5 million of remeasurement reserve. 
3 The merger reserve arose on incorporation of the Company during the year ended 31 March 2004. The investment in Twin Star had a carrying amount value of US$20.0 million in 
the accounts of Volcan. As required by the Companies Act 1985, Section 132, upon issue of 156,000,000 ordinary shares to Volcan, Twin Star’s issued share capital and share 
premium account have been eliminated and a merger reserve of US$4.4 million arose, being the difference between the carrying value of the investment in Twin Star in Volcan’s 
accounts and the nominal value of the shares issued to Volcan.

The Group has revised the presentation of forward premium on the forward covers within finance costs rather than other gains and losses, as 
these more appropriately reflects the substance of the transaction. US$84.1 million for the comparative year ended 31 March 2014 have 
been reclassified.
The following Standards have been issued but not yet effective up to the date of authorisation of these financial statements (and in some 
cases had not yet been adopted by EU):
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board issued the final version of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. The standard reduces 
the complexity of the current rules on financial instruments as mandated in IAS 39. IFRS 9 has fewer classification and measurement 
categories as compared to IAS 39 and has eliminated the categories of held to maturity, available-for-sale and loans and receivables. Further 
it eliminates the rule based requirement of segregating embedded derivatives and tainting rules pertaining to held to maturity investments. 
For an investment in an equity instrument which is not held for trading, IFRS 9 permits an irrevocable election, on initial recognition, on an 
individual share-by-share basis, to present all fair value changes from the investment in other comprehensive income. No amount recognised 
in other comprehensive income would ever be reclassified to profit or loss. It requires the entity, which chooses to measure a liability at fair 
value, to present the portion of the fair value change attributable to the entity’s own credit risk in the other comprehensive income. IFRS 9 
replaces the ‘incurred loss model’ in IAS 39 with an ‘expected credit loss’ model. The measurement uses a dual measurement approach, 
under which the loss allowance is measured as either 12 month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses. The standard also 
introduces new presentation and disclosure requirements. The effective date for adoption of IFRS 9 is annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018, though early adoption is permitted.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising 
from contracts with customers. The standard replaces most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The 
core principle of the new standard is for companies to recognise revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts 
that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also 
will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively 
including service revenues and contract modifications and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The new Standard will 
come into effect on 1 January 2017 with early application permitted.
Following other standard, improvements and amendments to the standards have been issued up to the date of authorisation of these 
financial statements.
a) IFRS 14 – Regulatory Deferral Accounts
b) Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative
c) Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012–2014 Cycle
d) Amendments to IAS 27: Equity method in separate financial statements
e) Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41: Bearer plants
f) Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
g) Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
h) Amendments to IAS 19: Defined benefit plans: Employee Contributions
The Group is evaluating the requirements of these standards, improvements and amendments and has not yet determined the impact on 
the consolidated financial statements.

1. Presentation of financial statements continued
Adoption of new and revised standards
The Group has adopted with effect from 1 April 2014, the following new and revised standards and interpretations. Their adoption has not 
had any significant impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
Accounting pronouncements that became effective in the current year:
Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: Recoverable amount disclosure for Non-Financial Assets
The amendment requires the disclosure of the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) only in periods in which impairment is recorded or 
reversed in respect of that asset (or CGU). The amendment also expands and requires the disclosure when an asset’s (CGUs) recoverable 
amount is determined on the basis of fair value less cost of disposal.
Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge 
accounting
The amendment states that the novation of hedging instrument should not be considered an expiration or termination giving rise to 
discontinuation of hedge accounting when a hedging derivative is novated. It provides relief from discontinuing an existing hedging 
relationship when a novation that is not contemplated in the original hedging documentation meets specific criteria.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The amendments to IAS 32 (amended) – offsetting financial assets and liabilities do not change the current offsetting model in IAS 32. The 
current offsetting model requires an entity to offset a financial asset and financial liability in the statement of financial position only when 
the entity currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off and intends either to settle the asset and liability on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Through these amendments, IASB has clarified the meaning of ‘currently have a legally 
enforceable right to set-off’ and ‘simultaneous realisation and settlement’.
The amendments clarify that to result in offset of a financial asset and financial liability, a right to set off must be available today rather than 
being contingent on a future event and must be exercisable by any of the counterparties. It must be legally enforceable in the normal course 
of business.
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 (October 2012) Investment entities
The amendments define an investment entity and introduce an exception to consolidating the investment entities. These amendments 
require an investment entity to measure those subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
in its consolidated and separate financial statements. The amendments also introduce new disclosure requirements for investment entities 
in IFRS 12 and IAS 27. The amendments also introduce new disclosure requirements related to investment entities and provide scope 
exemption for investment entities from IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The Group has early adopted IFRIC 21 Levies which has been endorsed by the EU but is effective for the annual periods beginning on or 
after 17 June 2014
IFRIC 21 provides guidance for recognition of a liability for a levy imposed by a government, both for levies that are accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and those where the timing and amount of the levy is 
certain. This interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a government levy is the activity that triggers 
the payment of levy as set out in the relevant legislation. An entity does not have constructive obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered 
by operating in a future period. However, it does not include income taxes, fines and other penalties, liabilities arising from emissions trading 
schemes and outflows within the scope of other Standards.
This did not have any significant impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
The Group has not early adopted any other amendments, standards or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting. The use of this basis of accounting 
takes into consideration the Group’s current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the Going Concern 
section of the strategic report.
Parent Company financial statements
The financial statements of the parent Company, Vedanta Resources plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom, have been prepared in 
accordance with UK GAAP and UK company law. The Company Balance Sheet is presented in Note 47.

2(a) Accounting policies
(i) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries:
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of the Company and all its subsidiaries (the Group), being the companies that 
it controls. Control is evidenced where the Company has power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Power is demonstrated through 
existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, which significantly affect the entity returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with accounting policies used by the Group.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a share of the profit for the financial year and net assets is attributed to the non-controlling interests as 
shown in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated balance sheet.
For acquisitions of additional interests in subsidiaries, where there is no change in control, the Group recognises a reduction to the non-
controlling interest of the respective subsidiary with the difference between this figure and the cash paid, inclusive of transaction fees, being 
recognised in equity. In addition, upon dilution of controlling interests the difference between the cash received from sale or listing of the 
subsidiary shares and the increase to non-controlling interest is also recognised in equity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of 
disposal, as appropriate.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Joint arrangements
A Joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is considered when there is 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group has joint operations within its Oil & Gas segment, the Group participates in several unincorporated joint operations which involve 
the joint control of assets used in oil & gas exploration and producing activities. The Group accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenditure of joint ventures in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate balance sheet and income statement 
headings. In addition, where the Group acts as operator to the joint venture, the gross liabilities and receivables (including amounts due to or 
from non-operating partners) of the joint operations are included in the Group balance sheet.
(ii) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents the net invoice value of goods and services 
provided to third parties after deducting discounts, volume rebates, outgoing sales taxes and duties, and are recognised when all significant 
risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer or services have been provided. This is usually when the title 
passes to the customer as per the contract.
Certain of the Group’s sales contracts provide for provisional pricing based on the price on the London Metal Exchange Limited (LME), as 
specified in the contract, when shipped. Final settlement of the prices is based on the applicable price for a specified future period. The 
Company’s provisionally priced sales are marked to market using the relevant forward prices for the future period specified in the contract 
with a corresponding adjustment to revenue.
Revenue from oil, gas and condensate sales represent the Group’s share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct 
entitlement basis, and tariff income received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
• Revenue from holding certificate contracts is recognised when goods have been delivered to a distribution warehouse or has been 
identified and kept separately, have been inspected by a nominee of the buyer and cash has been received. Under these arrangements, 
revenue is recognised once legal title has passed and all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the 
customer.
• Revenue from the sale of power is recognised when the electricity is supplied and measured based on contractually agreed tariff rates as 
approved by the electricity regulatory authorities.
• Revenues from sale of material by-products are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods sold are 
transferred to the customer.
• Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
• Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis in the income statement. 136 Financial statements

(iii) Special items
Special items are those items that management considers, by virtue of their size or incidence (including but not limited to impairment 
charges and acquisition and restructuring related costs), should be disclosed separately to ensure that the financial information allows an 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods. Also tax charges 
related to Special items and certain one-time tax effects are considered Special. Such items are material by nature or amount to the year’s 
result and require separate disclosure in accordance with IAS 1 paragraph 97. The determination as to which items should be disclosed 
separately requires a degree of judgement.
(iv) Business combinations
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed. 
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The acquirer’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet 
the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except certain assets and liabilities required to be 
measured as per the applicable standards.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, a joint arrangement or an associate, which can be measured 
reliably, are recorded at their provisional fair values at the date of acquisition. The difference between the fair value of the consideration 
transferred (including contingent consideration and previously held non-controlling interests) and the Group’s share of the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets on acquisition is recognised as Goodwill. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Where the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, the surplus is credited to the income statement in 
the period of acquisition.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-acquisition financial statements are 
approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the 
corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Any non-controlling interest in an acquiree is measured at fair value or as the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets, excluding goodwill. This accounting choice is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
Acquisition expenses are charged to the income statement.
If the Group acquires a group of assets or equity in a company that does not constitute a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 
Business Combinations, the cost of the acquired group of assets or equity is allocated to the individual identifiable assets acquired based on 
their relative fair value.
(v) Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The Group determines 
the amortisation period as the period over which the future economic benefits will flow to the Group after taking into account all relevant 
facts and circumstances. Amortisation method, residual values and estimated useful life of intangible assets are reviewed annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Group does not have any indefinite life intangible 
assets.
Intangible assets arising out of service concession arrangements are accounted for as intangible assets where the Company has a 
contractual right to charge users of services when the projects are completed and is measured at the cost of such construction services 
completed. Such assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the balance of license period, usually between three to 30 years.
(vi) Property, plant and equipment
Relating to mineral assets – mining properties and leases
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are 
capitalised as property, plant and equipment under the heading ‘Mining properties and leases’ in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production (i.e. when the Group determines that the mining 
property will provide sufficient and sustainable returns relative to the risk and decides to proceed with the development), all further pre-
production primary development expenditure other than land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised as part of the cost of the mining 
property until the mining property is capable of commercial production. From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are 
amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
Exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition subject to meeting the commercial 
production criteria mentioned above and are subject to an impairment review on an annual basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred after obtaining the right to mine or the legal right to explore, is capitalised as property, plant 
and equipment and stated at cost less any impairment. Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to the appropriate category of 
property, plant and equipment when the technical feasibility and commercial viability has been determined. Exploration and evaluation 
assets are assessed for impairment and impairment loss, if any, is recognised prior to reclassification. Exploration and evaluation expenditure 
incurred prior to obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are expensed as incurred.

2(a) Accounting policies continued
Exploration expenditure includes all direct and allocated indirect expenditure associated with finding specific mineral resources which 
includes depreciation and applicable operating costs of related support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities:
a. Acquisition costs – costs associated with acquisition of licences and rights to explore, including related professional fees.
b. General exploration costs – costs of surveys and studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies (e.g. costs incurred for 
environment clearance, defence clearance, etc.), and salaries and other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews and other personnel 
conducting those studies.
c. Costs of exploratory drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal wells.
The stripping cost incurred during the production phase of a surface mine is deferred to the extent the current period stripping cost exceeds 
the average period stripping cost over the life of the mine and recognised as an asset if such cost provides a benefit in terms of improved 
access to ore in future periods and certain criteria are met. Deferred stripping costs are included in mining properties within property, plant 
and equipment and disclosed as a part of mining properties. After initial recognition, the stripping activity asset is depreciated on a unit of 
production method over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body.
In circumstances where a mining property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the 
period in which it occurs i.e. when the Group determines that the mining property will not provide sufficient and sustainable returns relative 
to the risks and the Group decides not to proceed with the mine development.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves as defined by the ‘JORC’ Code and ‘SAMREC’ Code. Changes in the commercial 
reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Relating to oil & gas assets – Exploration & evaluation assets and developing/producing assets
For oil & gas assets a successful efforts based accounting policy is followed. Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an 
area are expensed immediately to the income statement. Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised 
on a licence-by-licence basis. Costs are held, are not amortised or depreciated, within exploration and evaluation assets until such time as 
the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil & gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within property, plant and 
equipment – exploration and evaluation assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities (under oil & gas properties and/or exploration 
and evaluation assets as appropriate). Exploration drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise 
of the well has been established. The success or failure of each exploration effort is judged on a well-by-well basis. Drilling costs are written 
off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves 
are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction 
demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant and 
equipment – development/producing assets (oil & gas properties) after testing for impairment. Where results of exploration drilling indicate 
the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the income 
statement.
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised 
within property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets (oil & gas properties) on a field-by-field basis. Subsequent expenditure 
is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces part of the existing 
development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. Any surplus proceeds are 
credited to the income statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets are credited against the previously 
capitalised cost. A gain or loss on disposal of a development/producing asset is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the 
net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
Other property, plant and equipment
The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, 
and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing 
costs and any expected costs of decommissioning. Expenditure incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into 
operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are charged to the income statement in the period in which the costs are incurred. Major 
shut-down and overhaul expenditure is capitalised as the activities undertaken improve the economic benefits expected to arise from the 
asset. 138 Financial statements
Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
2(a) Accounting policies continued
(vii) Assets in the course of construction
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the assets under construction account. At the point when an asset is operating at 
management’s intended use, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment and 
depreciation commences (see below). Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset and any obligatory decommissioning costs are 
capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been 
completed. Revenue generated from production during the trial period is capitalised. Borrowing costs and certain foreign exchange gains or 
losses are in certain circumstances capitalised in the cost of the asset under construction. This policy is set out under ‘Borrowing Costs’.
(viii) Depreciation and amortisation
Relating to mining properties
Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, freehold land and goodwill are not depreciated or 
amortised. Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production commences, as described in ‘Property, 
plant and equipment – mining properties and leases’. Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease or, if shorter, 
their useful economic life.
Relating to oil & gas assets
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio 
of oil & gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus the production in the 
period, generally on a field-by-field basis or group of fields which are reliant on common infrastructure.
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil & gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and 
natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in 
future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible. There should be a 50% statistical probability that the 
actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical 
probability that it will be less.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development 
costs required to access commercial reserves. Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt 
with prospectively.
Others
Other buildings, plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Depreciation is provided  
at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life,  
as follows:
Buildings operations and administration 30–60 years
Plant and machinery
– Continuous process plant 15 years
– Other than Continuous process plant 40 years
– Used in manufacture of non-ferrous metals 25 years
Office equipment and fixtures 5–10 years
Motor vehicles 8–10 years
The Group reviews the residual value and useful life of an asset annually and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change is 
accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.
Major overhaul costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the economic benefit to be derived from the overhaul. The carrying amount 
of the remaining previous overhaul cost is charged to the income statement if the next overhaul is undertaken earlier than the previously 
estimated life of the economic benefit.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale or which is part of a disposal group held for sale is not depreciated. Property, plant and 
equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its carrying value and fair value less disposal cost and is presented separately on the face of 
the balance sheet.
During the year ended 31 March 2015, in line with its accounting policy, the Group has carried out the review of the useful life of its assets. 
Considering the physical condition of the assets and benchmarking analysis, the Group has revised the useful life. The carrying value of the 
assets has been depreciated over the revised remaining useful life effective 1 October 2014.
As a result the net depreciation charge for the year is lower by US$67.4 million and profit after tax is higher by US$44.5 million (net of deferred 
tax impact of US$22.9 million). The changes made to the useful economic lives is expected to have an impact on the depreciation charge 
going forward, although the quantum per asset class will vary depending on whether the useful life has increased or decreased.

(ix) Impairment
Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset 
is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash 
flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, 
and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect of 
an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its fair value.
Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in 
groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated statements of income. Any 
cumulative loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset recognised previously in the consolidated statements of comprehensive 
income is transferred to the consolidated statements of income on recognition of impairment. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal 
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost 
and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognised in the consolidated statements of income. For 
available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the change in fair value is recognised directly in the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income.
The allowance accounts in respect of trade and other receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Company is satisfied that 
no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are written off against the financial 
asset directly.
Non-financial assets
Impairment charges and reversals are assessed at the level of cash-generating units. A cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
Formal impairment tests are carried out annually for goodwill. In addition, formal impairment tests for all assets are performed when there 
is an indication of impairment. The Group conducts an internal review of asset values annually, which is used as a source of information to 
assess for any indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses. External factors, such as changes in 
expected future prices, costs and other market factors are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment or reversal of previously 
recognised impairment losses.
If any such indication exists then an impairment review is undertaken, the recoverable amount is calculated, as the higher of fair value less 
costs of disposal and the asset’s value in use.
Fair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and 
does not reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the entity and not applicable to entities in general. Fair value for mineral and oil 
& gas assets is generally determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the 
asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent market participant may take 
into account. These cash flows are discounted at an appropriate post tax discount rate to arrive at the net present value.
Value in use is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its 
present form and its eventual disposal. The cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Value in use is 
determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group’s continued use and cannot take into account future development. These 
assumptions are different to those used in calculating fair value and consequently the value in use calculation is likely to give a different 
result to a fair value calculation.
The carrying amount of the CGU is determined on a basis consistent with the way the recoverable amount of the CGU is determined. The 
carrying amount includes the deferred tax liability recognised in the fair value of the assets acquired in a business combination.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Any reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is limited to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had previously been recognised. 140 Financial statements
Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
2(a) Accounting policies continued
Exploration and evaluation assets:
In assessing whether there is any indication that an exploration and evaluation asset may be impaired, the Company considers, as a 
minimum, the following indications:
• the period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the near future, 
and is not expected to be renewed;
• substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor 
planned;
• exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of 
mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area;
• sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the 
exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale; and
• reserve information prepared annually by external experts.
When a potential impairment is identified, an assessment is performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the Group of operating 
assets (representing a cash-generating unit) to which the exploration and evaluation assets is attributed. Exploration areas in which reserves 
have been discovered but require major capital expenditure before production can begin, are continually evaluated to ensure that 
commercial quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that additional exploration work is under way or planned. To the extent that capitalised 
expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement.
(x) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when a sale is highly probable from the date of classification, 
management are committed to the sale and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Non-current assets are 
classified as held for sale from the date these conditions are met and are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value (less 
costs to sell). Any resulting impairment loss is recognised in the income statement as a special item. On classification as held for sale the 
assets are no longer depreciated.
(xi) Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over 
the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. Other grants are credited to the income statement as and when the related expenditure 
is incurred.
(xii) Inventories
Inventories and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the following basis:
• Purchased copper concentrate is recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis; all other materials including stores and spares are 
valued on weighted average basis; except at Cairn where stores and spares are valued on a FIFO basis.
• Finished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an attributable proportion of 
manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity; and by-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value.
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
(xiii) Taxation
Tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Exceptions to this principle are:
• Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can 
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future;
• Deferred income tax is not recognised on the impairment of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes or on the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, which at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Tax relating 
to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.

2(a) Accounting policies continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against 
current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on acquisitions that are categorised as Business Combinations. Deferred tax is 
recognised at acquisition as part of the assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. Any deferred tax is charged or credited 
in the income statement as the underlying temporary difference is reversed.
(xiv) Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates or participates in a number of defined benefits and contribution schemes, the assets of which are (where funded) held in 
separately administered funds.
For defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined each year separately for each plan using the 
projected unit credit method by independent qualified actuaries.
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and are not recycled to the income statement.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into current 
service cost, past service cost, net interest expense or income and remeasurement.
Current service cost and past service cost is recognised within cost of sales and administrative expenses. Net interest expense or income is 
recognised within finance costs.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement 
benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
(xv) Share-based payments
Certain employees (including Executive Directors) of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share 
awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined with the assistance of an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The estimate of 
the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to 
reflect the current expectations. 
(xvi) Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of past events, and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding 
of the discount is recognised in the income statement as a finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted 
to reflect the current best estimate.
(xvii) Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the 
development or ongoing production of a mine or oil field. Costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work 
are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The 
amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the income statement 
over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The cost estimates 
are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to reflect known developments which may have an impact on the cost estimates or life of 
operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new 
disturbance and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which 
they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a finance cost in the income statement.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present 
values and charged to the income statement as extraction progresses. Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be 
significant, they are expensed as incurred.
(xviii) Operating leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis. 142 Financial statements
Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
2(a) Accounting policies continued
(xix) Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease 
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s policy on borrowing costs.
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with 
the Group and has therefore accounted for the contracts as finance leases.
(xx) Foreign currency translation
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
For all principal operating subsidiaries, the functional currency is the local currency of the country in which it operates with the exception of 
KCM and Cairn which has a US dollar functional currency as that is the currency of primary economic environment in which it operates. In the 
financial statements of individual Group companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies 
are translated into the functional currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are included in the income statement, except, where the monetary item is designated as an effective hedging 
instrument of the currency risk of designated forecast sales, where exchange differences are recognised in equity and exchange differences 
on foreign currency borrowings relating to asset under construction, and for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those 
assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.
For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement items of those entities for which the US dollar is not the functional currency are 
translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period. The related balance sheets are translated at the rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign 
currency borrowings to the extent that they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations, are reported in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity.
On disposal of entities with a different functional currency to the Company’s functional currency, the deferred cumulative exchange 
differences recognised in equity relating to that particular operation is reclassified to the income statement.
(xxi) Financial asset investments
Financial asset investments are classified as available for sale under IAS 39 and are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured at 
subsequent reporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity. 
On disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement.
Investments in unquoted equity instruments that do not have a market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are 
measured at cost.
Investments in equity instruments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year.
(xxii) Liquid investments
Liquid investments represent short-term investments that do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents for one or more of the 
following reasons:
• They have a maturity profile greater than 90 days.
• They may be subject to a greater risk of changes in value than cash.
• They are held for investment purposes.
The value of trading investments incorporates any dividend and interest earned on the held for trading investments.
(xxiii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks and short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the 
purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.
(xxiv) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. An allowance 
for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an event, which based on previous experience, is an indication of a reduction in 
the recoverability of the carrying value of the trade receivables.

(xxv) Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
(xxvi) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(xxvii) Borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the income statement using the effective interest 
method. They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
(xxviii) Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds denominated in the functional currency of the issuing entity are accounted for as compound instruments. The equity 
components and the liability components are separated out on the date of the issue. The equity component is recognised in a separate 
reserve and is not subsequently remeasured. The liability component is held at amortised cost. The interest expense on the liability 
component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate, being the prevailing market interest rate at the date of issuance for similar 
non-convertible debt. The difference between this amount and interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability component.
Convertible bonds not denominated in the functional currency of the issuing entity or where a cash conversion option exists, are split into 
two components: a debt component and a component representing the embedded derivative in the convertible bond. The debt component 
represents a liability for future coupon payments and the redemption of the principal amount. The embedded derivative, a financial liability, 
represents the value of the option that bondholders have to convert into ordinary shares. At inception the embedded derivative is recorded 
at fair value and the remaining balance, after deducting a share of issue costs, is recorded as the debt component. Subsequently, the debt 
component is measured at amortised cost and the embedded derivative is measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with the 
change in the fair value recognised in the income statement. The embedded derivative and the debt component are disclosed together and 
the current/non-current classification follows the classification of the debt component which is the host contract.
(xxix) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are 
capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time that the assets are substantially ready for their intended use in 
accordance with the Group policy which is when they are capable of commercial production. Where funds are borrowed specifically to 
finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available out of money 
borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from such short-term investments is also capitalised to reduce the total 
capitalised borrowing cost.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Capitalisation of interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects is ceased when substantially all the activities that 
are necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use are complete or when delays occur outside of the normal course of business.
(xxx) Available for sale financial assets
Listed equity shares and debt instruments held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available for sale 
(AFS) financial assets and are stated at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in 
equity. On disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement. Dividends 
received from investees accounted for as equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive the payment 
is established.
(xxxi) Financial instruments fair valued through profit and loss
Held for trading financial assets
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term. The change 
in fair value of trading investments incorporates any dividend and interest earned on the held for trading investments and is accounted for in 
the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward contracts, option 
contracts, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments. The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are remeasured at their 
fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates. The resultant gains or losses are recognised in the income statement unless these are 
designated as effective hedging instruments. 144 Financial statements
Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
2(a) Accounting policies continued
(xxxii) Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as 
either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are 
recorded in the income statement. The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the income statement and is 
offset by the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in equity. This includes certain 
non-derivative liabilities that are designated as a hedge of the foreign currency risk on future, highly probable, forecast sales. Amounts 
deferred in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
The gain or loss on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of a net investment hedge is recognised in equity. The ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains or losses accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement 
on disposal of the foreign operations to which they relate.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. 
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income 
statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains 
or losses recognised in the income statement.
(xxxiii) Held-to-maturity financial assets
Financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold 
to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
2(b) Critical accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions, 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
for the years presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and future periods affected. Vedanta considers the following areas as the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty:
(i) Oil & Gas reserves
Oil & Gas reserves are estimated on a proved and probable entitlement interest basis. Proven and probable reserves are estimated using 
standard recognised evaluation techniques. The estimate is reviewed regularly. Future development costs are estimated taking into account 
the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Net entitlement reserves estimates are subsequently calculated using the Group’s current oil price and cost recovery assumptions, in line 
with the relevant agreements.
Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or commodity prices could impact the 
depreciation rates, carrying value of assets and environmental and restoration provisions.
(ii) Carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets
Where a project is sufficiently advanced the recoverability of IFRS 6 Exploration assets are assessed by comparing the carrying value to 
higher of fair value less cost of disposal or value in use. Exploration assets are inherently judgemental to value and further details on the 
accounting policy are included in accounting note above. The amounts for exploration and evaluation assets represent active exploration 
projects. These amounts will be written off to the income statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the 
determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore 
whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Details of impairment charge and the assumptions used are disclosed in Note 5.

2(b) Critical accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty continued
(iii) Carrying value of developing/producing oil & gas assets
Management perform impairment tests on the Group’s developing/producing oil & gas assets at least annually with reference to indicators in 
IAS 36.
The impairment assessments are based on a range of estimates and assumptions, including:
Estimates/assumptions Basis
Future production proved and probable reserves, resource estimates and, in certain cases, expansion projects
Commodity prices management’s best estimate benchmarked with external sources of information, to ensure they are within the 
range of available analyst forecast
Exchange rates management best estimate benchmarked with external sources of information
Discount rates cost of capital risk-adjusted for the risk specific to the asset/CGU
Extension of PSC assumed that PSC for Rajasthan block would be extended until 2030 on the same commercial terms
Other key assumptions in the impairment models based on management expectations are that government approval will be received to 
further increase production rates and that the Enhanced Oil Recovery programme will be successfully implemented.
Any subsequent changes to cash flows due to changes in the above mentioned factors could impact the carrying value of the assets.
Details of impairment charge and the assumptions used are disclosed in Note 5.
(iv) Mining properties and leases
The carrying value of mining property and leases is arrived at by depreciating the assets over the life of the mine using the unit of production 
method based on proved and probable reserves. The estimate of reserves is subject to assumptions relating to life of the mine and may change 
when new information becomes available. Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or 
commodity prices could thus impact the carrying values of mining properties and leases and environmental and restoration provisions.
Details of impairment charge are disclosed in Note 5.
(v) Useful economic lives and impairment of other assets
Property, plant and equipment other than mining properties, oil & gas properties, and leases are depreciated over their useful economic lives. 
Management reviews the useful economic lives at least once a year and any changes could affect the depreciation rates prospectively and 
hence the asset carrying values. The Group also reviews its property, plant and equipment, including mining properties and leases, for 
possible impairment if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. 
In assessing the property, plant and equipment for impairment, factors leading to significant reduction in profits such as changes in 
commodity prices, the Group’s business plans and changes in regulatory environment are taken into consideration. The carrying value of the 
assets of a cash generating unit (CGU) is compared with the recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the higher of fair value less costs of 
disposal and value in use. Recoverable value is based on the management estimates of commodity prices, market demand and supply, 
economic and regulatory climates, long-term plan, discount rates and other factors. Any subsequent changes to cash flow due to changes in 
the above-mentioned factors could impact the carrying value of the assets.
(vi) Assessment of impairment at Lanjigarh Refinery
The Group has considered that the delay in obtaining environment clearances for the expansion of the alumina refinery at Lanjigarh and 
regulatory approval for bauxite mining as an indication of impairment. Hence, the Group have reviewed the carrying value of its property, 
plant and equipments at Lanjigarh as at balance sheet date, estimated the recoverable amounts of these assets and concluded that there 
was no impairment because the recoverable amount (estimated based on value in use) exceeded the carrying amounts.
The key assumptions and estimates used in determining the value in use of these assets were:
• The State of Odisha has abundant bauxite resources and under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the 
Government of Odisha, management is confident that bauxite will be made available in the short to medium term. The Company has 
entered into agreements with various suppliers internationally and domestically to ensure the availability of bauxite to run its refinery.  
In the initial years, the Company has assumed that bauxite will be purchased from third party suppliers in India and other countries, until 
the bauxite is sourced from its own mines.
• The State of Odisha has taken certain measures including reservation of areas for mining operations or undertaking prospecting and the 
constitution of the Ministerial Committee for formulation of a policy for supply of ores to Odisha-based industries on a long-term basis.  
On 12 January 2015, the Government of India came out with an ordinance to amend the existing MMDR act. The major change is in the 
process of grant of concessions i.e. from a first come first served basis to a more transparent process of auction and to expedite the grant 
process.
• The management expects that the conditions for construction of the alumina refinery will be fulfilled and it is assumed that the approval 
for the expansion of the refinery would be received for commencement of production by fiscal 2018.
Management expects that approvals for mining and the statutory approvals for the expansion project will be received as anticipated. 
Additionally the Group carries out impairment assessment for carrying value of these assets every half year and challenges these assumptions. 146 Financial statements
Vedanta Resources plc 
Annual report and accounts FY2015
2(b) Critical accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty continued
As at 31 March 2015, the carrying amount of property plant and equipment related to alumina refinery operations at Lanjigarh and related 
mining assets is US$1,165 million (31 March 2014: US$1,231 million).
(vii) Assessment of Impairment of Karnataka and Goa iron ore mines:
Karnataka mining
The mining ban in Karnataka was lifted on 17 April 2013 and the mining operations resumed in December 2013. The mining operations 
were suspended since August 2014 for want of environment clearances. On execution of the Mining Lease Deed and final forest clearance, 
the operations were resumed towards the end of February 2015. The carrying value of assets as at 31 March 2015 is US$168.1 million (31 
March 2014: US$180.3 million).
Goa mining
The Ministry of Environment and Forests revoked its earlier order which had kept the environment clearances for iron ore mines in Goa in 
abeyance. The State Government has issued a mining policy and has lifted the ban on iron ore mining in Goa. We have been allocated with 
an interim annual mining quantity of 5.5mt (out of the total cap of 20mt for FY2015) of saleable ore which is expected to progressively 
increase in coming years.
The State Government of Goa, has renewed the mining leases and Vedanta expects to start mining activities at iron ore mines at Goa in the 
second half of fiscal 2016, after receipt of all other regulatory clearances. The carrying value of assets affected as at 31 March 2015 is 
US$736.3 million (31 March 2014: US$709.9 million).
Management has reviewed the carrying value of the assets as at the balance sheet date, estimated the recoverable amounts of these assets 
and concluded that there was no impairment as the recoverable amount (estimated based on fair value less costs of disposal) exceeded the 
carrying amounts.
(viii) Assessment of Impairment at Western Cluster Limited (WCL)
The Project in Liberia is at the exploratory stage and the Group has considered the suspension of exploration in Liberia due to the Ebola 
epidemic and falling iron ore prices as an indication for impairment. The Group expects to start mining activities at iron ore mines in Liberia 
during fiscal 2020, after receipt of all regulatory clearances and approval of mining leases. Hence, the Group has reviewed the carrying value 
of its property, plant and equipment at WCL as at balance sheet date, estimated the recoverable amounts of these assets and concluded 
that there was no impairment because the recoverable amount (estimated based on fair value less costs of disposal) exceeded the carrying 
amounts. The carrying value of assets as at 31 March 2015 is US$224.8 million.
(ix) Assessment of Impairment at Konkola Copper Mines (KCM)
The KCM operations in Zambia have experienced operational challenges, a more challenging price environment, combined with rising 
electricity costs and increases in mining royalties. Due to these factors, the Group has reviewed the carrying value of its property, plant and 
equipment at KCM as at the balance sheet date, estimated the recoverable amounts of the assets and concluded that other than the specific 
assets identified and disclosed in Note 5, there was no impairment because the recoverable amount (estimated based on fair value less costs 
of disposal) exceeded the carrying amounts. The carrying value of assets as at 31 March 2015 is US$2,010.3 million.
(x) Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
Provision is made for costs associated with restoration and rehabilitation of mining sites as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. 
Such restoration and closure costs are typical of extractive industries and they are normally incurred at the end of the life of the mine. The 
costs are estimated on the basis of closure plans and the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities and the 
costs of restoration are capitalised as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. A corresponding provision is created on the liability 
side. The capitalised asset is charged to the income statement over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the 
provision is increased each period via unwinding the discount on the provision. Management estimates are based on local legislation and/or 
other agreements. The actual costs and cash outflows may differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, changes in 
prices, analysis of site conditions and changes in restoration technology.
(xi) Provisions and liabilities
Provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds resulting from 
past operations or events that can be reasonably estimated. The timing of recognition requires the application of judgement to existing facts 
and circumstances which may be subject to change especially when taken in the context of the legal environment in India. The actual cash 
outflows may take place over many years in the future and hence the carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are regularly reviewed 
and adjusted to take into account the changing circumstances and other factors that influence the provisions and liabilities.

(xii) Contingencies and commitments
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation, taxation and other claims against the Group. Where it is 
management’s assessment that the outcome cannot be reliably quantified or is uncertain the claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities 
unless the likelihood of an adverse outcome is remote. Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the financial 
statements.
While considering the possible, probable and remote analysis of taxation, legal and other claims, there is always a certain degree of 
judgement involved pertaining to the application of the legislation which in certain cases is supported by views of tax experts and/or earlier 
precedents in similar matters. Although there can be no assurance regarding the final outcome of the legal proceedings, the Group does not 
expect them to have a materially adverse impact on the Group’s financial position or profitability. These are set out in Note 38 and Note 42.
(xiii) The HZL and BALCO call options
The Group had exercised its call option to acquire the remaining 49% interest in BALCO and 29.5% interest in HZL. The Government of India 
has however, contested the validity of the options and disputed their valuation performed in terms of the relevant agreements the details of 
which are set out in Note 39. In view of the lack of resolution on the options, the non-response to the exercise and valuation request from the 
Government of India, the resultant uncertainty surrounding the potential transaction and the valuation of the consideration payable, the 
Group considers the strike price of the options to be at fair value, accordingly, the value of the option would be nil, and hence, the call options 
have not been recognised in the financial statements.
3. Segment information
The Group is a diversified natural resources group engaged in exploring, extracting and processing minerals and oil & gas. We produce zinc, 
lead, silver, copper, aluminium, iron ore, oil & gas and commercial power and have presence across India, Zambia, South Africa, Namibia, 
Ireland, Australia, Liberia, UAE and Sri Lanka. The Group is also in the business of port operations in India.
The Group’s reportable segments defined in accordance with IFRS 8 are as follows:
• Zinc-India
• Zinc-International
• Oil & Gas
• Iron Ore
• Copper-India/Australia
• Copper-Zambia
• Aluminium
• Power
The components not meeting the quantitative threshold for reporting are being reported as ‘Others’.
Management monitors the operating results of reportable segments for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated 
and for assessing performance. Segment performance is evaluated based on the EBITDA of each segment. Business segment financial data 
includes certain corporate costs, which have been allocated on an appropriate basis. Inter-segment sales are charged based on prevailing 
market prices.
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding the Group’s reportable

5. Special items continued
1 Impairment charge
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group has recognised:
a) Impairment charge on its oil & gas assets of US$6,642.1 million mainly relating to the Rajasthan block and Sri Lanka block, triggered by the 
significant fall in crude oil prices. Of this charge, US$2,162.1 million has been recorded against oil & gas properties and US$4,480.0 million 
against exploratory and evaluation assets. The valuation remains sensitive to price and further deterioration in long-term prices may 
result in additional impairment.
 For oil & gas properties, CGUs identified are on the basis of a PSC (Production Sharing Contract) level as it is the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. 
 The recoverable amount of the CGU, US$5,825.5 million, was determined based on the fair value less costs of disposal approach, a level-3 
valuation technique in the fair value hierarchy, as it more accurately reflect the recoverable amount based on our view of the assumptions 
that would be used by a market participant. This is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas 
production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production sharing contract (PSC)/cessation of production from each 
producing field based on current estimates of reserves and risked resources. Reserves assumptions for fair value less costs of disposal 
discounted cash flow tests consider all reserves that a market participant would consider when valuing the asset, which are usually 
broader in scope than the reserves used in a value-in-use test. Discounted cash flow analysis, used to calculate fair value less costs of 
disposal uses assumption for short-term (five years) oil price and the long-term nominal price of US$84 per barrel derived from a 
consensus of various analyst recommendations. Thereafter, these have been inflated at a rate of 2.5%. The cash flows are discounted 
using the post-tax nominal discount rate of 10.32% derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital. 
 The impairment loss relates to the ‘Oil & Gas’ business reportable segments, however this has been shown as special items and does not 
form part of the segment result for the purpose of segment reporting.
 The impairment charge of US$4,480.0 million of exploratory and evaluation assets also includes a US$788.1 million impairment charge 
relating to exploratory wells in Sri Lanka, as the development of hydrocarbons in the said block is not commercially viable at the current 
prices.
b) US$52.3 million impairment charge relating to underground assets in Nchanga in Konkola Copper Mines Plc on account suspension of 
operations and the fall in copper prices. Of this charge, US$47.2 million has been recorded against mining property and leases and US$5.1 
million against plant and equipment.
Impairment for the year ended 31 March 2014 includes:
• US$47.5 million, impairment of mining reserve and Land assets at Lisheen. This is as a result of fall in the forecasted LME prices of Zinc and 
Lead.
• US$11.0 million, impairment of mining assets of Jharsuguda Aluminium at Lanjigarh as the MOEF has rejected the Stage II forest 
clearance for the Niyamgiri mining project.
• US$23.1 million, impairment of COP F&D mining assets of KCM at Nchanga, Zambia as the mine has been put under maintenance following 
a dispute with the mining contractor.
2 During the year ended 31 March 2014, voluntary retirement schemes were considered by management to be a one off in nature and 
therefore classified as special items. Following management’s review, non-material voluntary retirement scheme costs incurred during 
the year have been deemed as operational costs not classified as special items.
3 In respect of iron ore mining at Goa, the Supreme Court has ruled that, out of the sale proceeds of inventory of excavated ore lying unsold, 
the leaseholder would be paid only the average cost of excavation. However, the carrying value includes the amortisation based on the 
fair value of mining reserves determined at the time of acquisition. Consequently, the excess of the carrying value of receivables over the 
net realisable value has been written off.
4 Relates to the provision recognised in respect of expenditure incurred on cancelled coal blocks allotted to Company’s subsidiaries, 
pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court of India.
5 Acquisition related costs include costs of Group simplification and restructuring and other acquisition related costs.
6 Payments made pursuant to amendment during the year ended 31 March 2014 under the Land Revenue Code for regulating mining 
dumps at Goa.
7 Relates to a provision recognised following a dispute with a mining contractor at KCM Zambia.
8 As a result of amendments to the Zambian Mining Tax regime, effective from 1 January 2015, the tax rate on mining operations (excluding 
‘mineral processing’ activities) was reduced from 30% to 0%. The deferred tax liability in relation to mining operations was therefore 
reversed in the period, resulting in a credit to the income statement of US$52.8 million. An announcement from the Zambian cabinet on 
20 April 2015 stated that further amendments will be made to the Zambian Mining Tax regime, effective from 1 July 2015. The changes 
will include reinstating the tax rate on mining operations from 0% to 30%, and increasing the tax rate on mineral processing to 35%. These 
rates were not enacted as at 31 March 2015 and therefore have not been used to measure deferred tax balances at 31 March 2015. 
Further guidance is being sought from the Government to determine the impact of the proposed amendment. 152 Financial statements

12. Tax continued
During year ended 31 March 2014, consequent to Group restructuring (Note 45), the income tax returns of the Indian subsidiaries subject to 
the merger were refiled on a combined basis as the newly amalgamated Indian subsidiary, Vedanta Limited (formerly known as Sesa Sterlite 
Limited). The effective date of the merger was 1 January 2011 and refiling the tax returns from this date resulted in a lower tax liability 
through offsetting previously unutilised losses which arose in some merged entities in these years against taxable profits which arose in 
other merged entities. This resulted in a reversal of the current tax provision of US$257 million partially offset by the related net reversal of 
deferred tax assets of US$81.1 million. Since this was not directly related to the equity restructuring, the net tax credit of US$175.9 million 
was recognised in the income statement.

foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries is represented by the 
contribution of those investments to the Group’s retained earnings and amounted to US$5,768.3 million (2014: US$6,662.7 million).

12. Tax continued
Certain businesses of the Group within India are eligible for specified tax incentives in the form of tax exemptions. Most of such tax 
exemptions are relevant for the companies operating in India. These are briefly described as under:
The location-based exemption
In order to boost industrial and economic development in undeveloped regions, provided certain conditions are met, profits of newly 
established undertakings located in certain areas in India may benefit from a tax holiday. Such a tax holiday works to exempt 100% of the 
profits for the first five years from the commencement of the tax holiday, and 30% of profits for the subsequent five years. This deduction is 
available only for units established up to 31 March 2012. However, such undertaking would continue to be subject to the Minimum Alternative 
Tax (MAT).
The Group has such types of undertakings at Haridwar and Pantnagar, which are part of Hindustan Zinc Limited (Zinc India).
Sectoral benefit – power plants
To encourage the establishment of certain power plants, provided certain conditions are met, tax incentives exist to exempt 100% of profits 
and gains for any 10 consecutive years within the 15-year period following commencement of the power plant’s operation. The Group 
currently has total operational capacity of 5,039MW of thermal based power generation facilities and wind power capacity of 273MW. 
However, such undertakings generating power would continue to be subject to the MAT provisions.
The Group has power plants which benefit from such deductions, at the various locations of Hindustan Zinc Limited and Bharat Aluminium 
Company Limited (where such benefits have been drawn) and Vedanta Limited (where no benefits have been drawn).
Sectoral benefit – oil & gas
Provided certain conditions are met, profits of newly constructed industrial undertakings engaged in the oil & gas sector may benefit from a 
deduction of 100% of the profits of the undertaking for a period of seven consecutive years. This deduction is only available to blocks licensed 
prior to 31 March 2011. However, such businesses would continue to be subject to the MAT provisions.
In the Group, Cairn India Limited benefits from such deductions.
In addition, the subsidiaries incorporated in Mauritius are eligible for tax credit to the extent of 80% of the applicable tax rate on foreign 
source income.
The total effect of such tax holidays and exemptions was US$238.8 million for the year ended 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: 
US$642.0 million).
13. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
24,206,816 treasury shares are excluded from the total outstanding shares for the calculation of EPS.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year (adjusted for the effects of dilutive options and the Group’s convertible bonds). The 
following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

The effect of 4 million (2014: 8 million) potential ordinary shares, which relate to share option awards under the LTIP scheme, on the 
attributable loss for the year is anti-dilutive and thus these shares are not considered in determining diluted loss per share. However, the 
effect of these awards on underlying attributable earnings is dilutive for the year ended 31 March 2014, and hence the potential ordinary 
shares are considered in determining underlying EPS below.
The loss for the year would be decreased if holders of the convertible bonds in Vedanta exercised their right to convert their bond holdings 
into Vedanta equity. The impact on loss for the year of this conversion would be the reduction in interest payable on the convertible bond.
The adjustment in respect of convertible bonds has an anti-dilutive impact on earnings and is thus not considered in determining diluted EPS.
Earnings/(loss) per share based on underlying profit/(loss) for the year (non-GAAP)
Underlying earnings is an alternative earnings measure, which the management considers to be a useful additional measure of the Group’s 
performance. The Group’s underlying profit/(loss) is the profit/(loss) for the year after adding back special items, other losses/(gains) net  
(Note 8) and their resultant tax (including taxes classified as special items) and non-controlling interest effects. This is a non-GAAP measure.

Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following Cash Generating Units (CGUs). The allocation of goodwill to CGUs is as 
follows:
• US$12.2 million Copper India.
• US$4.4 million arising on acquisition of Goa Energy Limited.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Company has undertaken an impairment review of goodwill of US$16.6 million as at 31 March 2015. The carrying amount of goodwill 
allocated to the relevant cash generating unit is considered to be insignificant in comparison with the total carrying value of the cash 
generating unit. The carrying amount of goodwill was evaluated using the higher of fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) or value in use 
based on discounted future cash flows of the entities to which the goodwill pertains and comparing this to the total carrying value of the 
relevant cash generating units. It was determined that the carrying amount of goodwill is not impaired.

currency of Vedanta Limited is INR, the conversion of the convertible bonds (which are denominated in US dollars) would not result in the 
settlement and exchange of a fixed amount of cash in INR terms, for a fixed number of its shares respectively. Accordingly, the convertible 
bond must be separated into two component elements: a derivative component consisting of the conversion option (carried at fair value) 
and a liability component consisting of the debt element of the bonds. Further details of the accounting for such instruments are provided 
in the Group accounting policies (Note 2a).

IFRS 13 requires additional information regarding the methodologies employed to measure the fair value of financial instruments which are 
recognised or disclosed in the accounts. These methodologies are categorised per the standard as:
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The below table summarises the categories of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value:

The fair value of borrowings is US$16,790.9 million (2014: US$16,973.8 million), classified under Level 2 of fair value hierarchy. For all other 
financial instruments, the carrying amount is either the fair value, or approximates to the fair value.
The fair value of financial asset investments represents the market value of the quoted investments and other traded instruments. For other 
financials assets the carrying value is considered to approximate to fair value.
The fair value of financial liabilities is the market value of the traded instruments, where applicable. Otherwise fair value is calculated using a 
discounted cash flow model with market assumptions, unless the carrying value is considered to approximate to fair value.
The fair value of the embedded derivative liability of the convertible bond has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model with market 
assumptions.
Derivative instruments and risk management
The Group’s businesses are subject to several risks and uncertainties including financial risks.
The Group’s documented risk management policies act as an effective tool in mitigating the various financial risks to which the businesses 
are exposed in the course of their daily operations. The risk management policies cover areas such as liquidity risk, commodity price risk, 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and capital management (the latter covered in Note 34).
Risks are identified through a formal risk management programme with active involvement of senior management personnel and business 
managers at both the corporate and individual subsidiary level. Each operating subsidiary in the Group has in place risk management 
processes which are in line with the Group’s policy. Each significant risk has a designated ‘owner’ within the Group at an appropriate senior 
level. The potential financial impact of the risk and its likelihood of a negative outcome are regularly updated. The risk management process 
is coordinated by the Management Assurance function and is regularly reviewed by the Group’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is 
aided by the GRMC, which meets every quarter to review risks as well as the progress against the planned actions. Key business decisions are 
discussed at the monthly meetings of the Executive Committee. The overall internal control environment and risk management programme 
including financial risk management is reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board.
Treasury management
Treasury management focuses on capital protection, liquidity maintenance and yield maximisation. The treasury policies are approved by 
the Board and adherence to these policies is strictly monitored at the Executive Committee meetings. Day-to-day treasury operations of the 
subsidiary companies are managed by their respective finance teams within the framework of the overall Group treasury policies. Long-term 
fund raising including strategic treasury initiatives are handled by a central team while short-term funding for routine working capital 
requirements is delegated to subsidiary companies. A monthly reporting system exists to inform senior management of investments, debt, 
currency, commodity and interest rate derivatives. The Group has a strong system of internal control which enables effective monitoring of 
adherence to Group policies. The internal control measures are supplemented by regular internal audits.
The investment portfolio is independently reviewed by CRISIL Limited and our portfolio has been rated as ‘Very Good’ meaning 
highest safety. 174 Financial statements

29. Financial instruments continued
The Group uses derivative instruments as part of its management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest 
rates and commodity prices. The Group does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The 
Group does not enter into complex derivative transactions to manage the treasury and commodity risks. Both treasury and commodities 
derivative transactions are normally in the form of forward contracts and interest rate and currency swaps and these are subject to the 
Group guidelines and policies. Interest rate swaps are taken to achieve a balance between fixed and floating rates (as described below under 
‘Interest risk’) and currency swaps are taken primarily to convert the Group’s exposure to non-US dollar currencies to US dollar currencies.
Commodity risk
The Group is exposed to the movement of base metal commodity prices on the London Metal Exchange. Any decline in the prices of the base 
metals that the Group produces and sells will have an immediate and direct impact on the profitability of the businesses. As a general policy, 
the Group aims to sell the products at prevailing market prices. As much as possible, the Group tries to mitigate price risk through favourable 
contractual terms. The Group undertakes hedging activity in commodities to a limited degree. Hedging is used primarily as a risk 
management tool and, in some cases, to secure future cash flows in cases of high volatility by entering into forward contracts or similar 
instruments. The hedging activities are subject to strict limits set out by the Board and to a strictly defined internal control and monitoring 
mechanism. Decisions relating to hedging of commodities are taken at the Executive Committee level and with clearly laid down guidelines 
for their implementation by the subsidiaries.
Whilst the Group aims to achieve average LME prices for a month or a year, average realised prices may not necessarily reflect the LME price 
movements because of a variety of reasons such as uneven sales during the year and timing of shipments.
The Group is also exposed to the movement of international crude oil price and the discount in the price of Rajasthan crude oil to Brent price.
Copper
The Group’s custom smelting copper operations at Tuticorin is benefited by a natural hedge except to the extent of a possible mismatch in 
quotational periods between the purchase of concentrate and the sale of finished copper. The Group’s policy on custom smelting is to 
generate margins from TC/RCs, improving operational efficiencies, minimising conversion cost, generating a premium over LME on sale of 
finished copper, sale of by-products and from achieving import parity on domestic sales. Hence, mismatches in quotational periods are 
managed to ensure that the gains or losses are minimised. The Group hedges this variability of LME prices through forward contracts and 
tries to make the LME price a pass-through cost between purchases of copper concentrate and sales of finished products, both of which are 
linked to the LME price. The Group also benefits from the difference between the amounts paid for quantities of copper content received and 
recovered in the manufacturing process, also known as ‘free copper’. The Group hedges on a selective basis the free copper by entering into 
future contracts.
TC/RCs are a major source of income for the Indian copper smelting operations. Fluctuations in TC/RCs are influenced by factors including 
demand and supply conditions prevailing in the market for mine output. The Group’s copper business has a strategy of securing a majority of 
its concentrate feed requirement under long-term contracts with mines.
KCM is largely an integrated copper producer and whenever hedging is done it is with an intention to protect the Group from price 
fluctuations in copper. KCM also does hedging for its custom smelting operations, where back to back hedging is used to mitigate 
pricing risks.
For the mining assets in Australia and Zambia, part of the production may be hedged to secure cash flows on a selective basis.
Aluminium
The requirement of the primary raw material, alumina, is partly met from own sources and the rest is purchased primarily on negotiated 
price terms. Sales prices are linked to the LME prices. At present the Group on selective basis hedges the aluminium content in outsourced 
alumina to protect its margins.
The Group also enters into hedging arrangements for its aluminium sales to realise month of sale LME prices.
Zinc and lead
The sales prices are linked to the LME prices. The Group has some long-term volume contracts with some customers where the prices are 
linked to prevailing LME prices at the time of shipment. The Group hedges custom production of Indian operations through forward contracts 
or other instruments.
Iron ore
The Group sells iron ore production through e-auction route as mandated by the State Government of Karnataka in India.
Provisionally priced financial instruments
On 31 March 2015, the value of net financial liabilities linked to commodities (excluding derivatives) accounted for on provisional prices was a 
liability of US$689.9 million (2014: liability of US$454.1 million). These instruments are subject to price movements at the time of final 
settlement and the final price of these instruments will be determined in the financial year beginning 1 April 2015.

Further, the impact of a 10% increase in closing copper LME for provisionally priced copper concentrate purchased at Vedanta Limited Copper 
division custom smelting operations is US$69.2 million (2014: US$54.2 million), which is a pass through in nature and as such will not have any 
impact on the profitability.
Financial risk and sensitivities
The Group’s Board approved financial risk policies comprise liquidity, currency, interest rate and counterparty risk. The Group does not engage 
in speculative treasury activity but seeks to manage risk and optimise interest and commodity pricing through proven financial instruments.
(a) Liquidity
The Group requires funds both for short-term operational needs as well as for long-term investment programmes mainly in growth projects. 
The Group generates sufficient cash flows from the current operations which together with the available cash and cash equivalents, and 
liquid financial asset investments provide liquidity both in the short-term as well as in the long-term. Anticipated future cash flows, together 
with undrawn fund based committed facilities of US$1,208.2 million, and cash and liquid investments of US$8,209.8 million as at 31 March 
2015, are expected to be sufficient to meet the ongoing capital investment programme and liquidity requirement of the Group in the near 
future.
The Group has a strong balance sheet that gives sufficient headroom to raise further debt should the need arise. The Group’s current ratings 
from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s are BB- and Ba1 respectively (2014: BB and Ba1 respectively). These ratings support the necessary 
financial leverage and access to debt or equity markets at competitive terms. The Group generally maintains a healthy net gearing ratio and 
retains flexibility in the financing structure to alter the ratio when the need arises (see Note 34 for further details).
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity 
date is given in the table below. The figures reflect the contractual undiscounted cash obligation of the Group:

At 31 March 2015, the Group had access to funding facilities (both fund based and non-fund based) of US$18,981.5 million of which 
US$2,177.9 million was not yet drawn, as set out below.

‘Fund based’ facilities represent contractual agreements for financial institutions to provide cash, such as cash credit limits and term loans, 
whereas ‘non-fund based’ facilities only give rise to an obligation to provide cash in certain circumstances, such as bank guarantees and 
letters of credit.
(b) Foreign currency
The Group’s presentation currency is the US dollar. The majority of the assets are located in India and the Indian rupee is the functional 
currency for the Indian operating subsidiaries. Exposures on foreign currency loans are managed through the Group-wide hedging policy, 
which is reviewed periodically to ensure that the risk from fluctuating currency exchange rates is appropriately managed. Natural hedges 
available in the business are identified at each entity level and hedges are placed only for the net exposure. Short-term net exposures are 
hedged progressively based on their maturity. Longer exposures beyond one year are normally unhedged. However all new long-term 
borrowing exposures are being hedged. Vedanta has hedged some of its non-US dollar borrowings into US dollar borrowings by entering into 
cross-currency swaps.

The sensitivities are based on financial assets and liabilities held at 31 March 2015 where balances are not denominated in the functional 
currency of the respective subsidiaries. The sensitivities do not take into account the Group’s sales and costs, and the results of the 
sensitivities could change due to other factors such as changes in the value of financial assets and liabilities as a result of non-foreign 
exchange influenced factors.
(c) Interest rate risk
At 31 March 2015, the Group’s net debt of US$8,460.3 million (2014: US$7,919.5 million net debt) comprised cash, cash equivalents and liquid 
investments of US$8,209.8 million (2014: US$8,937.9 million) offset by debt of US$16,667.8 million (2014: US$16,871.2 million) and debt 
derivative liability of US$2.3 million (2014: asset of US$13.8 million).
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on short-term and long-term floating rate instruments and on the refinancing of fixed rate debt. 
The Group’s policy is to maintain a balance of fixed and floating interest rate borrowings and the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt is 
determined by current market interest rates. As at 31 March 2015, 50.2% (2014: 48.7%) of the total debt was at a fixed rate and the balance 
was at a floating rate. The floating rate debt is largely linked to US dollar LIBOR. The Group also aims to minimise its average interest rates on 
borrowings by opting for a higher proportion of long-term debt to fund growth projects. The Group invests cash and liquid investments in 
short-term deposits and debt mutual funds, some of which generate a tax-free return, to achieve the Group’s goal of maintaining liquidity, 
carrying manageable risk and achieving satisfactory returns.
Floating rate financial assets are largely mutual fund investments which have debt securities as underlying assets. The returns from these 
financial assets are linked to market interest rate movements; however the counterparty invests in the agreed securities with known 
maturity tenure and return and hence has manageable risk. Additionally, the investments portfolio is independently reviewed by CRISIL 
Limited, and our investment portfolio has been rated as ‘Very Good’ meaning highest safety. 178 Financial statements

Total financial liabilities 8,714.2  9,506.7  3,300.9 8,996.0 9,478.4 3,315.5
The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate financial liabilities is 8.3% (2014: 8.0%) and the weighted average period for which the 
rate is fixed is 3.0 years (2014: 4.5 years).
Considering the net debt position as at 31 March 2015 and the investment in bank deposits, corporate bonds and debt mutual funds, any 
increase in interest rates would result in a net loss and any decrease in interest rates would result in a net gain. The sensitivity analyses below 
have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The below table illustrates the impact of a 0.5% to 2.0% change in interest rate of borrowings on profit/(loss) and equity and represents

(d) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk from trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, liquid investments and other financial instruments.
The Group has clearly defined policies to mitigate counterparty risks. Cash and liquid investments are held primarily in debt schemes of 
mutual funds, bonds and bank deposits with good credit ratings. Defined limits are in place for exposure to individual counterparties in case 
of mutual fund houses and banks.
The large majority of receivables due from third parties are secured. Moreover, given the diverse nature of the Group’s businesses trade 
receivables are spread over a number of customers with no significant concentration of credit risk. During the year ended 31 March 2015 and 
31 March 2014 other than the exception of a single customer in our oil & gas business, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of the 
Group’s net sales or for any of the Group’s primary businesses. The history of trade receivables shows a negligible provision for bad and 
doubtful debts. Therefore, the Group does not expect any material risk on account of non-performance by any of our counterparties.
The Group’s maximum gross exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2015 is US$9,493.2 million (2014: US$10,420.0 million).
Of the year end trade and other receivable balance the following, though overdue, are expected to be realised in the normal course of 
business and hence, are not considered impaired as at 31 March 2015:
(US$ million) 2015 2014
Less than 1 month 39.1 44.7
Between 1–3 months 49.1 79.8
Between 3–12 months 40.3 23.0
Greater than 12 months 62.5 96.6
Total 191.0 244.1
Receivables amounting to US$43.8 million (31 March 2014: US$35.5 million), of the Power division of the Group have been impaired primarily 
as a result of an ongoing dispute in relation to a tariff agreement with a power supply company.
Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of all derivatives is separately recorded on the balance sheet within other financial assets (derivatives) and other financial 
liabilities (derivatives), current and non-current. In addition, the derivative component of certain convertible bonds is shown as part of the 
overall convertible bond liability (Note 28). Derivatives that are designated as hedges are classified as current or non-current depending on 
the maturity of the derivative.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other contracts are treated as separate derivative contracts, when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts.
Cash flow hedges
The Group also enters into forward exchange and commodity price contracts for hedging highly probable forecast transactions and accounts 
for them as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged 
transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the income statement. 180 Financial statements

The majority of cash flow hedges taken out by the Group during the year comprises commodity contracts and foreign currency forward 
contracts for firm future commitments.
The cash flows related to the majority of cash flow hedges above are expected to occur during the year ended 31 March 2016 and 
consequently may impact the income statements for that year depending upon the change in the commodity prices and foreign exchange 
rate movements.
Non-qualifying hedges
The majority of these derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts which are economic hedges but which 
do not fulfil the requirements for hedge accounting of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Fair value hedges
The fair value hedges relate to foreign currency forward contracts taken to hedge currency exposure on purchase of raw materials 
and capital imports.

Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental
The provisions for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental liabilities represent the Management’s best estimate of the costs which will 
be incurred in the future to meet the Group’s obligations under existing Indian, Australian, Zambian, Namibian, South African and Irish law 
and the terms of the Group’s mining and other licences and contractual arrangements. These amounts, calculated by considering discount 
rates within the range of 2%–9%, become payable on closure of mines and are expected to be incurred over a period of one to 15 years. 
Within India, the principal restoration and rehabilitation provisions are recorded within Cairn India where a legal obligation exists relating to 
the oil & gas fields, where costs are expected to be incurred in restoring the site of production facilities at the end of the producing life of an 
oil field. The Group recognises the full cost of site restoration as a liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the 
development or ongoing production from a producing field.
During the year ended 31 March 2015, based on the decommissioning studies the provision for restoration, rehabilitation and environment 
has been revised downwards by US$66.1 million, mainly related to the Rajasthan block at Cairn India. 182 Financial statements

30. Provisions continued
KCM Copper Price Participation
KCM Copper Price Participation relates to a provision in respect of a price participation agreement in Zambia which requires KCM to pay ZCCM 
an agreed annual sum when copper price exceeds specified levels and specific triggers. In the previous years the timing of the outflow was 
dependent on future copper prices as well as dividends paid.
KCM and ZCCM agreed for final settlement of Copper Price Participation liability. The total amount that to be paid was US$119.7 million to 
be settled in 16 instalments with the first instalment starting on 31 December 2012 and last instalment on 30 September 2016. The provision 
recognised has been discounted at 10.3% to take into account the expected timings of the various payments and recognised as a liability at 
US$91.9 million as at 31 March 2015.
Other
Other includes provision on post retirement medical benefits. The expected period of utilisation is 18 years.
31. Deferred tax
The Group has accrued significant amounts of deferred tax. The majority of the deferred tax liability represents accelerated tax relief for the 
depreciation of capital expenditure and the depreciation on fair value uplifts created on acquisitions, net of losses carried forward by Vedanta 
Limited (post the reorganisation) and MAT credits carried forward in Cairn India and Hindustan Zinc.
The amounts of deferred taxation on temporary differences, provided and not provided, in the accounts are as follows:

The above relates to the tax effect on US$1,088.3 million (2014: US$750.9 million) of unutilised tax losses of the Company, VRHL, VRJL and 
VRJ2 which have no expiry period; US$827.2 million (2014: US$642 million) unutilised tax losses of Twin Star Mauritius Holdings Limited which 
is subject to the Mauritius tax regime and can be carried forward for a period of five years; US$39.4 million of unutilised tax losses and 
non-refundable R&D tax credits of CMT, which can be carried forward indefinitely under the Australian tax regime; and US$344.3 million 
(2014: US$371.1 million) of unutilised tax losses and capital allowances for Malco Energy Limited (MEL) and Talwandi Sabo Power Limited 
which are subject to the Indian tax regime. Pursuant to the Indian tax regime, unutilised business tax losses expire eight years from the 
period in which the losses arise and, unabsorbed depreciation can be carried forward indefinitely. No deferred tax asset has been recognised 
on these unutilised tax losses and tax credits as there is no evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future against which 
they can be utilised by the respective entities.

32. Share-based payments
Employee share schemes
The Group aims to provide superior rewards for outstanding performance and a high proportion of ‘at risk’ remuneration for Executive 
Directors. Three employee share schemes were approved by shareholders on Listing. In 2014, the Board introduced a Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) which is the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives are provided to the Executive Directors and the wider 
management group.
The Vedanta Resources Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) and Employee Share Ownership Plan (the ESOP) and Performance Share Plan 
(the PSP)
The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 150% of annual salary. In respect of 
Mr Navin Agarwal and Mr Tom Albanese, salary means the aggregate of their salary payable by the Company and their CTC payable by 
Vedanta Limited. The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members of the wider management group is calculated by reference 
to the grade average CTC and individual grade of the employee. The performance conditions attaching to outstanding awards are as follows:
• PSP – measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (being the movement in a company’s share price plus reinvested dividends), is 
compared over the performance period with the performance of the companies as defined in the scheme from the grant date. The extent 
to which an award vests will depend on the Company’s TSR rank against a group of peer companies at the end of the performance period 
and as moderated by the Remuneration Committee. Furthermore, a certain percentage of the vesting is based on continued employment 
with the Group until the end of the third year. 
• The vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to 
the nearest whole share:  184 Financial statements

Vedanta’s TSR performance against comparator group

Below median –
At median 30
At or above upper quartile 100
The performance condition is measured by taking the Company’s TSR over the three months immediately preceding the date of grant and 
over the three months immediately preceding the end of the performance period, and comparing its performance with that of the 
comparator group. The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is 
provided by the Company’s advisers. The Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the Company’s total 
return has out-performed a group of companies chosen to represent the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of 
the Executive Directors and the wider management group with those of the shareholders.
Initial awards under the PSP were granted on 17 November 2014. The exercise price of the awards is 10 US cents per share and the 
performance period is three years, with no retesting being allowed.
• ESOP – measured in terms of business performance set against business plan for the financial year comprising operational deliverables, 
enabler parameters and sustainability performance specific to each company. The vesting schedule is graded over three years and varies 
from company to company with a minimum vesting of 30% triggering at either 80% or 85% business score. In another tranche, the 
vesting schedule is staggered over a period of three years from the date of grant, with 70% vesting based on the achievement of business 
performance and the remaining 30% based on continued employment with the Group until the end of the third year.
 Initial awards under ESOP were granted on 24 September 2012 with further awards being made on 16 May 2013. The exercise price of the 
awards is 10 US cents per share and the performance period is one year.
 The exercise period is six months from the date of vesting.
• LTIP – measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (being the movement in a company’s share price plus reinvested dividends), is 
compared over the performance period with the performance of the companies as defined in the scheme from the grant date. The extent 
to which an award vests will depend on the Company’s TSR rank against a group of peer companies (Adapted Comparator Group) at the 
end of the performance period and as moderated by the Remuneration Committee. The vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with 
adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounded down to the nearest whole share.
Vedanta’s TSR performance against Adapted Comparator Group

group described above. The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) is provided by the Company’s advisers. The Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the 
Company’s total return has out-performed a group of companies chosen to represent the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of 
the interests of the Executive Directors and the wider management group with those of the shareholders.
Initial awards under the LTIP were granted on 26 February 2004. As on 31 March 2015 the awards outstanding are the awards issued on 
1 August 2011, 1 October 2011, 1 January 2012 and 1 April 2012. The exercise price of the awards is 10 US cents per share and the 
performance period is three years, with no retesting being allowed.
Further details on the LTIP are available in the Remuneration Report of the annual report.

remained outstanding and 269,282 options were exercisable at the year end. The weighted average share price for the share options 
exercised during the year ended 31 March 2015 was GBP8.9 (year ended 31 March 2014: GBP8.5). The weighted average maturity period for 
the options outstanding as on 31 March 2015 is 33 months (31 March 2014: 17 months).
All share-based awards of the Group are equity-settled as defined by IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. The fair value of these awards has been 
determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions. This fair value, adjusted by 
the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed uniformly over the 
vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using the Stochastic valuation model with suitable modifications to allow for the specific performance 
conditions of the respective schemes. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, 
expected dividends, expected term and the risk free rate of interest. A progressive dividend growth policy is assumed in all fair value 
calculations. Expected volatility has been calculated using historical return indices over the period to date of grant that is commensurate 
with the performance period of the award. The return indices of the mining companies in the Adapted Comparator Group have been 
modelled based on historical movements over the period to date of grant which is also commensurate with the performance period for the 
option. The history of return indices is used to determine the volatility and correlation of share prices for the companies in the Adapted 
Comparator Group and is needed for the Stochastic valuation model of their future TSR performance relative to the Company’s TSR 
performance. All options are assumed to be exercised immediately after vesting. 186 Financial statements

33. Retirement benefits
The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in India, Australia, Africa and Ireland.
(a) Defined contribution schemes
Indian pension schemes
Central Recognised Provident Fund
The Central Recognised Provident Fund relates to all full-time Indian employees of the Group. The amount contributed by the Group is a 
designated percentage of 12% of basic salary less contributions made as part of the Pension Fund (see below), together with an additional 
contribution of 12% (limited to a maximum contribution of 30% in case of Iron Ore Segment) of the salary of the employee.
The benefit is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation
Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable in India, is applicable only to executives in grade M4 and above. However, in case of the 
Cairn India Group and Iron Ore Segment, the benefit is applicable to all executives. In Cairn India, it is applicable from the second year of 
employment. Certain companies hold policies with the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), to which they contribute a fixed amount 
relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by the LIC as required, taking into consideration the contributions made. 
Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income 
statement.
Pension Fund
The Pension Fund was established in 1995 and is managed by the Government of India. The employee makes no contribution to this fund but 
the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month subject to a specified ceiling per employee. This must be provided for 
every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of superannuation, contributions cease and the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contributions through 
the years, and on their salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level. The Government funds these 
payments, thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the central fund is in 
surplus or deficit.
Australian pension scheme
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes in Australia. The contribution of a proportion of an employee’s salary into a 
superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia. The employer contributes 9.5% of the employee’s gross remuneration 
where the employee is covered by the industrial agreement and 12.5% of the basic remuneration for all other employees, into the employee’s 
fund of choice. All employees have the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
Zambian pension scheme
The KCM Pension Scheme is applicable to full-time permanent employees of KCM (subject to the fulfilment of certain eligibility criteria). The 
management of the scheme is vested in the trustees consisting of representatives of the employer and the members. The employer makes a 
monthly contribution to the KCM Pension Scheme and the member makes monthly contributions.

33. Retirement benefits continued
All contributions to the KCM Pension Scheme in respect of a member cease to be payable when the member attains normal retirement age 
of 55 years, or upon leaving the service of the employer, or when the member is permanently medically incapable of performing duties in the 
service of the employer. Upon such cessation of contribution on the grounds of normal retirement, or being rendered medically incapable of 
performing duties, or early voluntary retirement, the member is entitled to receive his accrued pension. The member is allowed to commute 
his/her accrued pension subject to certain rules and regulations.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined 
contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
Skorpion Zinc Provident Fund, Namibia
The Skorpion Zinc Provident Fund is a defined contribution fund and is compulsory to all full time employees under the age of 60. Company 
contribution to the fund is a fixed percentage of 9% per month of pensionable salary, whilst the employee contributes 7% with the option of 
making additional contributions, over and above the normal contribution, up to a maximum of 12%.
Normal retirement age is 60 years and benefit payable is the member’s fund credit which is equal to all employer and employee 
contributions plus interest. The same applies when an employee resigns from Skorpion Zinc. The Fund provides disability cover which is 
equal to the member’s fund credit and a death cover of two times annual salary in the event of death before retirement. Current membership 
total is 810.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined 
contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
Black Mountain Mining (Pty) Limited, South Africa pension and provident funds
Black Mountain Mining (Pty) Ltd has two retirement funds, both administered by Alexander Forbes, a registered financial service provider. 
Both funds form part of the Alexander Forbes umbrella fund and are defined contribution funds.
Membership of both funds is compulsory for all permanent employees under the age of 60.
Lisheen Mine, Ireland pension funds
Lisheen Pension Plan is for all employees. Lisheen pays 5% and employees pay 5% with the option to make Additional Voluntary 
Contributions (AVCs) if desired. Executive contributions are 15% by Lisheen and a minimum of 5% by the employee with the option to make 
AVCs if desired. Death benefit is three times salary for employees and four times salary for executives. Pension and life cover ceases at 65. On 
wind up of the pension schemes, the benefits will be paid out to the remaining members in accordance with the scheme rules and Irish 
Revenue tax regulations.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined 
contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
(b) Defined benefit schemes
India
The Gratuity schemes are defined benefit schemes which are open to all Group employees in India who have a minimum of five years of 
service with their employing company. These schemes are funded in some subsidiaries. Based on actuarial valuation, a provision is 
recognised in full for the projected obligation over and above the funds held in scheme. In case where there is no funding held by the 
scheme, full provision is recognised in the balance sheet. Under these schemes, benefits are provided based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds and a full actuarial valuation of the schemes is carried out on an annual basis.
Vedanta Limited
The Iron Ore, Aluminium and Copper divisions of Vedanta Limited contributed to the LIC Fund based on an actuarial valuation every year. 
Vedanta Limited’s Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a defined benefit basis. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 
2015 using the projected unit credit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deficit.
BALCO
All employees who are scheduled to retire on or before 31 March 2015 are being paid by BALCO. The Gratuity scheme is accounted for as a 
defined benefit scheme for all employees scheduled to retire after 31 March 2015. A provision is recognised based on the latest actuarial 
valuation which was performed as at 31 March 2015 using the projected unit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deficit.
HZL
HZL contributes to the LIC fund based on an actuarial valuation every year. HZL ’s Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a defined benefit 
basis. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2015 using the projected unit actuarial method. At that date the fund was 
in deficit. 188 Financial statements

Specified permanent employees of KCM are entitled to receive medical and retirement severance benefits. This comprises two months’ basic 
pay for every completed year of service with an earliest service start date of 1 July 2004. Under this scheme, benefits are provided based on 
final pensionable pay and a full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out on an annual basis. The accruals are not contributed to any 
fund and are in the form of provisions in KCM’s accounts.
On the death of an employee during service, a lump sum amount is paid to his or her dependants. This amount is equal to 60 months’ basic 
pay for employees who joined before 1 April 2000 and 30 months’ basic pay for employees who joined on or after 1 April 2000. For fixed term 
contract employees, the benefit payable on death is 30 months’ basic pay.
As at 31 March 2015, membership of pension schemes across Vedanta Limited, BALCO, HZL, MEL, TSPL, KCM and Cairn stood at 24,456 
employees (31 March 2014: 25,286). The deficits, principal actuarial assumptions and other aspects of these schemes are disclosed in further

In India, the mortality tables used, assume that a person aged 60 at the end of the balance sheet date has a future life expectancy of 
19 years.
Assumptions regarding mortality for Indian entities are based on mortality table of ‘Indian Assured Lives Mortality (2006-2008)’ published by 
the Institute of Actuaries of India.
Assumptions regarding mortality for KCM are based on World Health Organisation Life Tables for 1999 applicable to Zambia which has been 
taken as a reference point. Based on this a mortality table which is appropriate for the workers of Konkola Copper Mines plc has been derived.

(k) Sensitivity analysis
Below is the sensitivity analysis determined for significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of defined benefit obligations and 
based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period while holding all other 
assumptions constant.
(US$ million) 
Increase/
(decrease) 
in defined 
benefit 
obligation
Discount rate
Increase by 0.50% (2.6)
Decrease by 0.50% 2.7 
Salary increase 
Increase by 0.50% 2.3 
Decrease by 0.50% (2.2)
The above sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions 
would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
(l) Risk analysis
Group is exposed to a number of risks in the defined benefit plans. Most significant risks pertaining to defined benefits plans and 
management estimation of the impact of these risks are as follows:
Investment risk
Most of the Indian defined benefit plans are funded with Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Group does not have any liberty to manage 
the funds provided to Life Insurance Corporation of India.
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to the Government of India 
bonds for Group’s Indian operations. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Interest risk
A decrease in the interest rate on plan assets will increase the plan liability.
Longevity risk/life expectancy
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both 
during and at the end of the employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan liability.
Salary growth risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. An increase in the 
salary of the plan participants will increase the plan liability.
34. Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard continuity, maintain a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order 
to support its business and provide adequate return to shareholders through continuing growth.
The Group sets the amount of capital required on the basis of annual business and long-term operating plans which include capital and other 
strategic investments. The funding requirement is met through a mixture of equity, internal accruals, convertible bonds and other long-term 
and short-term borrowings.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt as a percentage of total capital.
(US$ million) 
As at 
31 March 
2015
As at 
31 March

Total equity 12,257.4 17,974.8
Net debt 8,458.0 7,919.5
Total capital 20,715.4 25,894.3
Gearing 40.8% 30.6%
The increase in the gearing ratio compared to 2014 ratio is primarily due to decrease in total equity pursuant to one-time impairment charge 
on oil & gas assets of US$4,504.1 (net of deferred tax of US$2,138 million) (Note 5). 192 Financial statements

US$234.9 million). The Group has also entered into guarantees and bonds advanced to the customs authorities in India of US$228.9 million 
relating to the export and payment of import duties on purchases of raw material and capital goods including export obligations (2014:

proportion to actual exports, plus applicable interest.
Contingencies
MEL claims with Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB)
TNEB is claiming US$16.3 million from MEL for an electricity self-generation levy for the period from May 1999 to June 2003. This claim has 
arisen since the commissioning of MEL ’s captive power plant in 1999. The Company has sought an exemption from the application of this levy 
from the Government of Tamil Nadu. The application is under consideration. Meanwhile, the Madras High Court has in its recent order, 
remitted back the case to the State of Tamil Nadu, to take a decision afresh on the representation for grant of tax exemption on consumption 
of electricity and directed to pass a detailed speaking order. MEL has accordingly represented before the Government of Tamil Nadu Energy 
Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu avide of his letter dated 20 March 2013 denied the exemption citing various reasons and asked MEL to 
remit US$15.7 million. MEL moved to the High Court of Madras and a stay was granted on the same.

HZL: Department of Mines and Geology
The Department of Mines and Geology of the State of Rajasthan issued several show cause notices in August, September and October 2006 
to HZL, totalling US$53.3 million. These notices alleged unlawful occupation and unauthorised mining of associated minerals other than zinc 
and lead at HZL ’s Rampura Agucha, Rajpura Dariba and Zawar mines in Rajasthan during the period from July 1968 to March 2006. HZL 
believes that the claim becoming an obligation of the Company is unlikely and thus no provision has been made in the financial statements. 
HZL has filed writ petitions in the High Court of Rajasthan in Jodhpur and has obtained a stay in respect of these demands.
Richter and Westglobe: income tax
The Group through its subsidiaries Richter Holdings Limited (Richter) and Westglobe Limited (Westglobe) in 2007 acquired the entire stake in 
Finsider International Company Limited based in the United Kingdom. Finsider at that point in time held 51% stake in Vedanta Limited 
(formerly Sesa Sterlite Limited). In October 2013, the Indian Tax Authorities (Tax Authorities) have served an order on Richter and Westglobe 
for alleged failure to deduct withholding tax on capital gain on the indirect acquisition of shares in April 2007. The Tax Authorities held that 
Richter and Westglobe were assessed in default for non-deduction of tax while making payment for acquiring the shares in 2007. The Tax 
Authorities determined the liability for such non-deduction of tax as US$140.0 million in the case of Richter and US$93.2 million in the case of 
Westglobe, comprising tax and interest. Being aggrieved, Richter and Westglobe filed appeals before the first appellate authority. Writ 
petitions were filed in the High Court of Karnataka challenging the constitutional validity of retrospective amendments made by the Finance 
Act 2012 and in particular the imposition of obligations to deduct tax on payments made against an already concluded transaction. These 
Writs are pending for disposal. In the interim, the Tax Authorities disposed of the petition filed for stay for demand arising out of impugned 
orders. Consequent to an order received from the Tax Authorities in March 2015, any amounts payable from Vedanta Limited to Westglobe, 
including dividends as and when declared, must instead be paid to the Tax Authorities (up to the amount of tax assessment). Richter and 
Westglobe sought intervention by the High Court by filing an application. The aforementioned Writ as well as connected application are due 
to be heard during June 2015. Richter and Westglobe believe that they are not liable for such withholding tax and intend to defend the 
proceedings.
Cairn India: income tax
In March 2014, Cairn India received a show cause notice from the Indian Tax Authorities (Tax Authorities) for not deducting withholding tax 
on the payments made to Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL) UK, for acquiring shares of Cairn India Holdings Limited (CIHL), as part of their 
internal reorganisation. Tax Authorities have stated in the said notice that a short-term capital gain has accrued to CUHL on transfer of the 
shares of CIHL to Cairn India, in financial year 2006–2007, on which tax should have been withheld by the Company. Pursuant to this various 
replies were filed with the Tax Authorities. After hearings, the Income Tax Authority, during March 2015, have issued an order by holding Cairn 
India as ‘assessee in default’ and asked to pay such demand totalling US$3,274.4 million (US$1,637.1 million being the tax element and 
US$1,637.1 million on account of interest). The Company has filed a Notice of Claim by invoking the Bilateral Investment Promotion Treaty 
between the UK and India. Cairn India has filed its appeal before the CIT (A) and filed a fresh Writ petition before Delhi High Court wherein it 
raised several points for assailing the aforementioned order. The hearing of the said Writ is due on 18 May 2015.
Vedanta Limited: contractor claim
Shenzhen Shandong Nuclear Power Construction Co. Limited (SSNP) subsequent to terminating the EPC contract invoked arbitration as per 
the contract alleging non-payment of their dues towards construction of a 210MW co-generation power plant for 6MTPA expansion project, 
and filed a claim of US$248.1 million. SSNP also filed a petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before the 
Bombay High Court praying for interim relief. The Bombay High Court initially dismissed their petition, but on a further appeal by SSNP, the 
Division Bench of the Bombay High Court directed Jharsuguda Aluminium to deposit a bank guarantee for an amount of US$27.8 million as a 
security, being a prima facie representation of the claim, until arbitration proceedings are completed. Jharsuguda Aluminium has deposited 
a bank guarantee of an equivalent amount. Management is of the opinion that this claim is not valid under the terms of the contract with 
SSNP and it is unlikely that SSNP can legally sustain the claim and accordingly, no provision is considered necessary.
Miscellaneous disputes – Vedanta Limited, HZL, MEL, BALCO, Cairn, Lisheen, VRJL and VRJL-II
The Group is subject to various claims and exposures which arise in the ordinary course of conducting and financing its business from the 
income tax, excise, indirect tax authorities and others. These claims and exposures mostly relate to the assessable values of sales and 
purchases or to incomplete documentation supporting the companies’ returns or other claims.
The approximate value of claims against the Group companies total US$1,370.7 million (2014: US$1,150.1 million), of which US$29.3 million 
(2014: US$30.2 million) is included as a provision in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2015 (including claims of US$583.1 million in respect of 
income tax assessments out of which US$2.3 million is included as a provision in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2015).
The Group considers that it can take steps such that the risks can be mitigated and that there are no significant unprovided liabilities arising.

40. Share transactions
(a) Call option – HZL
In pursuance to the Government of India’s policy of disinvestment and the Share Purchase Agreement and a Shareholder’s Agreement (SHA) 
both dated 4 April 2002 entered into with the Government of India, the Company acquired 26% equity interest in HZL. Under the terms of the 
SHA, the Group had two call options to purchase all of the Government of India’s shares in HZL at fair market value. The Group exercised the 
first call option on 29 August 2003 and acquired an additional 18.9% of HZL ’s issued share capital. The Company also acquired an additional 
20% of the equity capital in HZL through an open offer, increasing its shareholding to 64.9%. The second call option provides the Group the 
right to acquire the Government of India’s remaining 29.5% share in HZL. This call option is subject to the right of the Government of India to 
sell 3.5% of HZL shares to HZL employees. The Group exercised the second call option via its letter dated 21 July 2009. The Government of 
India disputed the validity of call option and has refused to act upon the second call option. Consequently the Company invoked arbitration 
and filed a statement of claim. The arbitration proceedings are under progress in early stages. The next date of hearing is fixed for 8 August 
2015.
(b) Call option – BALCO
The Group purchased a 51.0% holding in BALCO from the Government of India on 2 March 2001. Under the terms of the shareholder’s 
agreement (SHA) for BALCO, the Group has a call option that allows it to purchase the Government of India’s remaining ownership interest in 
BALCO at any point from 2 March 2004. The Group exercised this option on 19 March 2004. However, the Government of India has contested 
the valuation and validity of the option and contended that the clauses of the SHA violate the provision of Section 111A of the (Indian) 
Companies Act, 1956 by restricting the rights of the Government of India to transfer its shares and that as a result such provisions of the SHA 
were null and void. Subsequently the Group referred the matter to arbitration as provided in the SHA and the majority award of the arbitral 
tribunal rejected the claims of the Group on the grounds that the clauses relating to the call option, the right of first refusal, the ‘tag-along’ 
rights and the restriction on the transfer of shares violate the (Indian) Companies Act, 1956 and are not enforceable.
The Group challenged the validity of the majority award under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in the High Court of 
Delhi and sought for setting aside the arbitration award to the extent that it holds these clauses ineffective and inoperative. The Government 
of India also filed an application before the High Court of Delhi to partially set aside the arbitral award in respect of certain matters involving 
valuation. The High Court of Delhi passed an order dated 10 August 2011 directing our application and the application by the Government of 
India to be heard together as they arise from a common arbitral award. The matter is currently pending before the High Court of Delhi and 
scheduled for final hearing on 3 August 2015.
On 9 January 2012, the Group offered to acquire the Government of India’s interests in HZL and BALCO for US$2,577.7 million and US$296.5 
million, respectively. The Group has, by way of letters dated 10 April 2012 and 6 July 2012, sought to engage with the Government of India on 
the same terms as the offer. This offer was separate from the contested exercise of the call options, and the Group proposed to withdraw the 
ongoing litigations in relation to the contested exercise of the options should the offer be accepted. To date, the offer has not been accepted 
by the Government of India and therefore there is no certainty that the acquisition will proceed.
The Group continues to include the shareholding in the two companies HZL and BALCO, in respect of which the Group has a call option as 
non-controlling interest.
41. Share purchases
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group increased its holding in one of its subsidiaries Vedanta Limited through open market 
purchases. The Group purchased 135,373,715 shares of Vedanta Limited for US$629.4 million accounting for 4.55% of its equity share capital. 
Also during the year ended 31 March 2015, Cairn India bought back and cancelled its 33,433,290 shares through open market purchases for 
US$189.7 million accounting for 1.75% of its equity share capital. The total outflow of US$819.1 on account of investment and share buy-back 
have been reflected as a reduction to total equity in the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended 31 March 2015.
42. Konkola Copper Mines: value added tax
An assessment of output tax amounting to US$600 million has been raised by the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) covering the years 2011, 
2012 and the first quarter of 2013. The basis of assessment is that KCM has not provided all the documentary evidence that is required under 
Rule 18 of the Value Added Tax Rules to prove an export and as a consequence, all sales of product that were zero rated in the returns have 
been standard rated by assessment. KCM has filed for judicial review of the ZRA’s decision to standard rate the export products. After legally 
analysing the interpretation of Rule 18, management believes that KCM has got a reasonably strong arguable defense in the case.
Additionally KCM has US$169 million receivable on account of value added tax on Inputs that are yet to be recovered from the Zambian 
Government. KCM has submitted the complete documentation and got it reviewed by ZRA as per the previous Rule 18 for the period between 
August 2013 and December 2013. There are precedents where other companies have received refunds of such amounts from the 
Government on submission of documents. KCM is in the process of submitting the required documentation for the remaining months. 
Further, effective February 2015, Rule 18 has been amended by allowing exporters to submit transit documents issued by the customs 
authority in the country of transit of the goods instead of import certificates from the country of destination, as proof of export for purposes 
of VAT zero rating. This will make it easier to collect the refunds. The Group believes that it will receive a refund of the entire amount and 
there is no objective evidence of uncertainty around collectability.

45. Group restructuring
During the year ended 31 March 2014, pursuant to the Scheme of Amalgamation (the Scheme) sanctioned by the Indian and Mauritius 
Courts, the Group’s subsidiary companies viz. Sterlite Energy Limited, Sterlite Industries (India) Limited (SIIL), Aluminium Business of Vedanta 
Aluminium Limited, Ekaterina Limited and the Residual business of Madras Aluminium Company Limited merged with Sesa Goa Limited (SGL) 
(A subsidiary of the Group). Bloom Fountain Limited, a subsidiary of Sesa Goa Limited acquired a 38.7% stake in Cairn India Limited (Cairn). 
Consequent to this, Cairn became a subsidiary of SGL. By way of a slump sale agreement dated 19 August 2013 between Vedanta Aluminium 
Limited (VAL) and Vedanta Limited, the power business consisting of 1,215MW thermal power facility situated at Jharsuguda and 300MW 
co-generation facility (90MW operational and 210MW under development) at Lanjigarh, was transferred on a going concern basis at its 
carrying value to Vedanta Limited.
Subsequently, the name of SGL was changed to Sesa Sterlite Limited during the year ended 31 March 2014. The name of Sesa Sterlite Limited 
was further changed to Vedanta Limited during the year ended 31 March 2015.
These transactions are within subsidiaries of the Company and will not have any acquisition accounting impact other than a change in the 
economic shareholding percentage. The simplification exercise has resulted in simplifying the structure, cross holding and aligning the debt 
with cash flow and change in economic holding percentage mainly in VAL and Cairn. VAL ’s effective holding has changed from 87.6% to 
58.3% whereas Cairn’s reduced from 49.8% to 34.3%.
46. Ultimate controlling party
At 31 March 2015, the ultimate controlling party of the Group was Volcan, which is controlled by persons related to the Executive Chairman, 
Mr Anil Agarwal. Volcan is incorporated in the Bahamas, and does not produce Group accounts.

48. Company accounting policies
The Vedanta Resources plc (the Company) balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and UK company law (UK GAAP). The financial information has been prepared on an historical cost 
basis except preference shares, financial asset investments and derivative financial instruments which are stated at fair value.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as part of these 
financial statements. The profit after tax for the year of the Company amounted to US$284.7 million (2014: loss of US$128.3 million).
These financial statements are presented in US dollars being the functional currency of the Company.
Significant accounting policies
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries except preference shares, valued at cost less any provision for 
impairment. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable.
Investment in preference shares of subsidiaries
Investments in preference shares of subsidiaries are stated at fair value. The fair value is represented by the face value of the preference 
shares as the investments are redeemable at any time for their face value at the option of the Company.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks and short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the 
purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.
Financial asset investments
Financial asset investments are classified as available for sale under FRS 26 and are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured at 
subsequent reporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity. On 
disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement.
Currency translation
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company, being US dollars, are translated into US dollars at the spot 
exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies at the balance sheet date 
are translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right 
to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share 
awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The estimate of the number 
of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the 
current expectations. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised. 
Amounts recharged to subsidiaries in respect of awards granted to employees of subsidiaries are recognised as intercompany debtors until 
repaid.
Borrowings
Interest bearing loans are recorded at the net proceeds received i.e. net of direct transaction costs. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on accruals basis and charged to the profit and loss account 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.

48. Company accounting policies continued
Convertible bonds
The convertible bond issued by VRJL and VRJL -II (Note 55) are accounted for as a compound instrument. The gross proceeds (net of issue 
costs) were lent to the Company by VRJL and VRJL -II. The equity component has been recognised in a separate reserve of the Company and 
is not subsequently remeasured. The recognition of the equity component by the Company acts to reduce the payable to VRJL and VRJL -II 
which arises once the gross proceeds are borrowed. The liability component is held at amortised cost. The interest expensed on the liability 
component is calculated by applying an effective interest rate. The difference between interest expensed and interest paid is added to the 
carrying amount of the liability component.
The bonds are first convertible into preference shares of the issuer having a principal value of US$100,000 per Preference share, which are 
exchanged immediately for ordinary shares of the Company.
Financial instruments
The Company has elected to take the exemption provided in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 in respect of these parent Company financial 
statements. Full disclosures are provided in Note 29 to the financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 March 2015.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are remeasured at their 
fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account. The 
hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the profit and loss account and is offset by the gain or loss from the 
change in the fair value of the derivative.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses 
are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. 
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss 
for the year.
Cash flow statement
The Company’s individual financial statements are outside the scope of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements because the Company prepares publicly 
available Group financial statements, which include a Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. Accordingly, the Company does not present an 
individual Company Cash Flow Statement.
Related party disclosures
The Company’s individual financial statements are exempt from the requirements of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures because its individual 
financial statements are presented together with its Group financial statements. Accordingly, the individual financial statements do not 
include related party disclosures.
Financial guarantees
Guarantees issued by the Company on behalf of other Group companies are designated as ‘Insurance Contracts’. Accordingly these are 
shown as contingent liabilities (Note 58).
Debtors
Debtors are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts. An allowance for 
impairment for debtors is made where there is an indication of a reduction in the recoverability of the carrying value of the debtor.
Creditors
Creditors are stated at their nominal value. 206 Financial statements

220 Additional information
Source of information
In respect of all businesses, the information has been certified by an in-house geologist on behalf of the Group management.
Basis of preparation
Ore reserves and mineral resources reported herein comply with the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves’, other than those relating to Konkola Copper Mines plc (KCM) which complies with the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral 
Reserves and Mineral Resources (the SAMREC Code). The former code is prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian 
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists, and Minerals Council of Australia, and is commonly referred to as the 
‘JORC Code’. As at the date of this document, the editions of the JORC and SAMREC Codes in force are dated December 2004 and March 2000, 
respectively. The JORC and SAMREC Codes recognise a fundamental distinction between resources and reserves.
The terms and definitions in the SAMREC Code are consistent with those used in the JORC Code with minor differences in terminology – the 
JORC Code uses the term Ore Reserve whilst the SAMREC Code uses the term Mineral Reserve. For the purposes of ore and mineral resources 
reported herein, the term ore resources have been used throughout.
Oil & gas reserves and resources have been prepared according to the Petroleum Resources Management Systems (PRMS) approved in March 
2007 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the world Petroleum Council, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, and the Society 
of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
Mineral resources are based on mineral occurrences quantified on the basis of geological data and an assumed cut-off grade, and are divided 
into Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories reflecting decreasing confidence in geological and/or grade continuity. The reporting of 
resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic exploitation. An Ore or Mineral Reserve 
is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes the effect of dilution and losses which may occur 
when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments, which may include feasibility studies, need to have been carried out and include 
consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and 
governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could be reasonably justified. Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order 
of decreasing confidence into Proved Ore Reserves and Probable Ore Reserves.
The Measured and Indicated mineral resources have been reported as being inclusive of those mineral resources modified to produce the ore 
reserves, in addition to the ore reserves. The resource and reserve estimates provided herein comply with the resource and reserve 
definitions of the JORC Code, other than those relating to KCM which comply with the SAMREC Code.

2 Results and dividend
I am delighted to report that despite the on-going difficulties in the global civil aviation
market the Group has continued its recovery since suffering the significant downturn in its
operations as a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. 
Annual turnover was only moderately down, and pre-tax profits were marginally ahead
of the prior year. Furthermore, second half turnover was 6% higher than in the first,
and slightly higher than in the second half of the prior year, the period immediately
following the September 11 terrorist actions.  Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items in the second half of the year was 15% ahead of that achieved in the first
half year, and 22% ahead of the second half of the prior year.
These improvements reflect the benefits of new contracts being implemented and existing
relationships being extended, including our long-term agreement with Rolls-Royce plc,
together with on-going actions to improve gross margins and control costs.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, turnover fell to £181.1 million (2002: £191.0 million).
Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was £10.2 million (2002:
£10.1 million). The Group continues to be cash generative and net borrowings reduced by
£10.1 million during the year to £20.7 million.
Earnings per share, excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, were 27.7p
(2002: 28.8p). The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 8.5p, making the total
dividend for the year of 12.5p per ordinary share (2002: 12.0p). The final dividend is payable
on 8 August 2003 to shareholders on the register on 11 July 2003.
Management and employees
On behalf of the Board I wish to express our sincere thanks to all of our employees for their
exceptional efforts in what remains a very difficult and rapidly changing market place. Our
success in winning new business is a testament to the very high level of service we continue
to deliver to our growing customer base.
Prospects
The civil aerospace market is facing an unprecedented level of challenges. Demand
for new aircraft has fallen significantly in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist
actions, the impact of which has been particularly severe on US carriers with several
major operators going into Chapter 11. Towards the end of the financial year passenger
numbers decreased again because of the war in Iraq and the SARS outbreak in the Far
East. It is clear the combined effect of these factors will delay any meaningful recovery in
the civil OEM market for some time to come.
It is therefore encouraging to report that demand for the Group’s products and outsourcing
services remains at a high level as customers seek to improve their operating performance.
With increasingly large scale contracts being implemented, our growing international
presence and sophisticated infrastructure are proving strategically important.
UMECO remains profitable and cash generative. This strong financial base will enable
the Group to continue to expand through winning new business and by making strategic
acquisitions.
I am therefore confident that the actions we continue to take will enhance our medium
and long-term prospects and financial performance.
Brian McGowan, Chairman
3 June 2003
Chairman’s Statement
3 Operations
Turnover for the year of £181.1 million (2002: £191.0 million)
includes a full year contribution from Abscoa compared
with ten months in the prior year, and the inclusion of
Titanox Aerospace from January 2003 as a result of the
Group taking control of the company from that date.
These two transactions account for additional turnover of
£5.2 million. Against this, adverse foreign exchange rate
movements, principally the weakening of the US dollar
against sterling, had the effect of reducing reported
turnover by £2.6 million.
On a like for like basis turnover reduced in the year by
6%; this compares favourably with the overall fall in the
aerospace market of some 25%. During the second half year
the Group began to benefit from the new contracts won in
prior periods and from the extension of our contract with
Rolls-Royce plc. Turnover in the second half year was 
£93.0 million, an increase of 6% over the first half year.
Operating profits, before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items, at £11.3 million (2002: £12.4 million) have
followed the same pattern as sales with second half profit
of £5.9 million increasing by 11% over the first half year. As
a result of the action taken to sustain profitability during
this very difficult trading period it is encouraging to report
that gross profit margins at 22.6% are some 1.3 percentage
points ahead of last year. 
Divisional operating profits referred to in this Review
are before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
which provides a more consistent measure of operating
performance.
Components division
Sales of £107.6 million (2002: £110.7 million); Operating
profits of £4.7 million (2002: £5.5 million).
The division is a leading international provider of value-
added distribution and supply chain outsourcing services to
OEM customers in the aerospace and defence industries.
The division specialises in the supply of small components
and through its increasingly sophisticated systems can
facilitate significant cost and working capital savings for its
growing customer base.
Sales in the second half year were 12% ahead of those in
the first half year, reflecting the extension of our long-
term contract with Rolls-Royce plc and the benefits of
new contracts secured during the year. Operating profits
increased by 15% during the second half year as a result of
efficiency and other operating improvements. 
The on-going difficulties facing the division’s customer base
in the civil OEM market are driving demand for our supply
chain outsourcing services. Existing relationships are being
expanded (Goodrich Aerospace, ITP , Lockheed Martin) and
new customers have been secured including Eaton
Aerospace. The significant increase in the US defence
budget is also providing additional opportunities for growth
and will, over the medium-term, provide a more balanced
sales mix between the civil and defence segments.
Prior year investments in IT systems have helped the
division to reduce its working capital requirements and
improve its already high level of customer service. During
the year the division acquired a 50% stake in Wesupply
Aerospace, a web based fulfilment software company, and
is now actively marketing this product to its customer base
as well as integrating the software into its own IT platforms.
Pattonair continues its European development plans both
through Titanox Aerospace in France and by expanding its
customer base in the key German and Spanish markets.
Ulogistics has successfully extended its activities with Rolls-
Royce plc with further projects being actively considered
by both parties. The senior management team has been
strengthened during the year to ensure that customer
service remains at a very high level whilst other major OEM
contracts are reviewed and negotiated.
Abscoa, the division’s North American operation, continues
to trade successfully despite the damaging strike at
Bombardier in the early part of the year and the general
weakness in the US market. New business has been
secured and further opportunities for growth have been
identified.
Chemicals division
Sales of £59.2 million (2002: £66.7 million);  Operating
profits of £5.0 million (2002: £5.2 million).
The division distributes a broad range of specialist chemical
products principally to the international aerospace market;
other markets served include manufacturers of wind turbine
blades and the plastic structures industry. A full range of
outsourcing services is provided to major customers.
Sales levels across the division have now stabilised after
the significant fall during the second half of last year, and
operating profits continue to improve as a result of the
actions taken to enhance gross margins and reduce costs.
Aeropia successfully negotiated a five year extension to
its major contract with British Airways in October 2002
and has won a number of exciting contracts, including
Eurofighter initial provisioning and two outsourcing projects
for aerospace OEM customers.
Aerovac Systems continues to secure new customers
and a significant investment is being made at its French
subsidiary to enable it to fully service its rapidly growing
moulding tool activity. Many of these moulds are for
customers involved in the development of the Airbus A380
aircraft. In March 2003 a sales and service subsidiary was
established in Italy.
Richmond Aircraft Products won an important contract
with The Boeing Company during the year and has also
expanded its facilities as customers are increasingly looking
to purchase “ready to use” products rather than just the
basic materials.
Chief Executive’s Review
4 Repair and overhaul division
Sales of £14.3 million (2002: £13.6 million);  Operating profits of £1.6 million 
(2002: £1.7 million).
The division currently comprises a single company, AEM, which is one of Europe’s largest
independent overhaul companies providing maintenance services for over 2,000 components
over a broadening range of aircraft types.
The company continues to deliver encouraging sales growth, primarily as a result of the
investments made to extend its capabilities and the steps taken to broaden its geographic
customer base. Operating profits were modestly behind those of the prior year due to sales
mix.
During the year £0.2 million was spent to extend the company’s capability to overhaul
integrated drive generators to enable it to service both regional jets and the Boeing 737 NG
aircraft. 
AEM is continuing to increase its customer base and growing range of capabilities, and
suitable acquisitions are being sought in both Europe and the Far East.
Summary
We remain committed to the action programme we implemented following September 2001 of:
• Increasing our market share through winning new contracts and extending relationships 
with existing customers;
• Improving gross margins by eliminating activities that have become marginal due to 
market changes;
• Initiating cost reductions; and
• Maximising cash flow through tight control of working capital.
Despite increasingly challenging market conditions the Group delivered sales and profit
growth in the second half of the year and continued to be highly cash generative.
We have demonstrated our ability to implement large-scale contracts successfully and we
remain very active in seeking additional contracts in our key European and North American
markets.  We are also reviewing a number of acquisition possibilities that fit our strategic
plans. With our strong management team and robust financial position we are confident of
furthering our long-term growth plans in the current financial year.

Chief Executive’s Review
5  Operating results
Sales for the year at £181.1 million were 5% below last year’s figure of £191.0 million.  As
reported in the Chairman’s Statement second half sales were higher than in the equivalent
period in the prior year.  Before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, operating profit
was 9% lower than last year primarily reflecting reduced sales.
As part of its normal activities, the Group increasingly incurs expenditure in making bids
for potential new business and long-term contracts. The bidding process often takes a
considerable period of time to conclude and all related costs are fully written off to the profit
and loss account as they are incurred.
Interest
Lower interest rates and strong cash flow have resulted in a considerably reduced interest
charge of £1.1 million compared with £2.3 million in 2002.  Average interest rates in the year
were 4.3% and average debt was £26.7 million compared with 5.7% and £40.5 million last year.
Interest was covered 10.0 times by profits before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
(2002: 5.4 times).
Goodwill amortisation
Goodwill amortisation of £2.2 million (2002: £2.2 million) included a full year charge relating
to the acquisition of Abscoa, and a modest effect from the additional investment in Titanox
Aerospace. The charge for the year was reduced as a result of the weakening in the US dollar.
Exceptional items
An exceptional credit of £0.2 million arose in the year as a result of the disposal of surplus
property at GRP , net of redundancy and other restructuring costs of £0.2 million. In the prior
year the Group incurred an exceptional cost of £1.1 million relating to restructuring costs of
£0.2 million and stock provisions of £0.9 million.
Profit before tax
After the much lower interest charge, profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items of £10.2 million was marginally ahead of last year’s profit of £10.1 million.
Tax
The tax charge on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 32.7% (2002:
32.6%).  The tax rate reflects the mix of profits earned in the US and France, both of which
have higher rates than the UK.
Earnings per share
Before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items basic earnings per share were 27.7p, 4%
lower than last year, due to the higher average number of shares in issue following the rights
issue in June 2001.  Including goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, basic earnings per
share of 20.9p were 22% higher than last year.
Dividends
As reported in our Interim results the Directors have reduced the disparity between the interim
and final dividends. An interim dividend of 4.0p (2002: 3.25p) was paid in December 2002 and
a final dividend of 8.5p (2002: 8.75p) is proposed making a total payment of 12.5p (2002: 12.0p).
The increase in the total dividend reflects the improvement in profitability during the second
half year and the Group’s strong financial position. The total dividend for the year is covered
2.2 times (2002: 2.4 times) by basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items.
Finance Director’s Review
6 Operating cash flow
Operating cash flow of £17.1 million was £8.3 million
higher than operating profit.  The difference comprises
depreciation and amortisation totalling £4.1 million and a
working capital net inflow of £4.2 million.  Stocks increased
by £1.5 million due mainly to the increasing scope of our
contract with Rolls-Royce plc.  Debtors and creditors both
increased as a result of a re-alignment of payment terms
and stock funding arrangements on the Rolls-Royce plc
contract.
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure at £1.9 million (2002: £1.9 million)
was again equal to depreciation. Additions mainly comprise
routine replacements and IT enhancements and include
£0.2 million to further develop AEM’s repair and overhaul
capability.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow comprising operating cash flow less interest,
tax and capital expenditure was £12.7 million 
(2002: £4.5 million).  Tax payments in the year of 
£2.5 million were reduced by a £0.7 million tax rebate at
Abscoa following the realisation of fair value provisions on
the disposal of obsolete stock in the previous year.
Acquisitions
During the year the balance due, £0.4 million, on the
acquisition of Abscoa in June 2001 was paid. In addition
the Group acquired the remaining 60% of Titanox
Aerospace in January 2003 for £0.8 million, of which 
£0.2 million was paid after the year end. The balance of the
acquisition expenditure in the year relates to the
establishment of the Wesupply Aerospace joint venture of
which the Group owns 50%.
Net indebtedness and gearing
Net debt at the year end was £20.7 million 
(2002: £30.8 million) which represents gearing of 32%
(2002: 48%) of shareholders’ funds. Since the year end, the
Group’s banking facilities have been increased to 
£35.0 million including term loans of £21.0 million
repayable in equal half yearly instalments over seven years.
Finance Director’s Review
Shareholders’ funds
Shareholders’ funds remained at £64.1 million, with
retained earnings of £2.1 million being offset by translation
differences of £2.1 million on the Group’s net investment in
its overseas subsidiaries.
Pensions
The majority of employee pensions are provided under
defined contribution pension schemes but the Group also
operates a defined benefit scheme that has been closed
to new members since 2000.  The FRS 17 valuation of the
defined benefit scheme at 31 March 2003 showed assets of
£3.6 million and liabilities of £6.8 million.  The shortfall
represents 5% of the Group’s net asset value and employer
and employee contributions were increased in November
2002 with the objective of funding the shortfall over the
remaining working lives of the scheme members.  The
additional cash cost to the Group is less than £0.1million
per year.
Currency exchange risk
A large element of aerospace transactions are conducted
in US dollars.  The Group is able, particularly on major
contracts, to match purchases and sales in dollars and
seeks to match transactions in euros wherever possible
thereby providing a significant hedge against currency risks.
Approximately £0.6 million of transactions were unmatched
at the year end.  Where the value of these transactions is
certain, the Group may hedge the exposure by taking out
forward exchange contracts.
The Group seeks to finance the net investment in overseas
subsidiaries by debt denominated in the relevant local
currency to reduce the translation risk on its investments.

Directors’ Report
2. Front continued [c87586]  10/6/03  4:17 pm  Page 10 STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTORS ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE COMBINED CODE
The policy of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance with the principles of Good Governance and Code of Best
Practice as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code annexed to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Company considers that it
has been in full compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year, subject to the matters described in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report, and the following comments relating to particular provisions of the Code: 
A 2.1 The Board has considered the proposal that a senior independent director be identified in the Annual Report and concluded that this
would be inappropriate given that the Chairman of the Company, and the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees are
already identified in the Report.
A 5.1 The Board’s view is that no nomination committee need be established, given the size of the Board at present. Appointments to the
Board are considered by all of the Directors.
INTERNAL CONTROL
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied with the Combined Code provisions on internal control having established
the procedures necessary to implement the guidance contained in the ICAEW publication ‘Internal control: Guidance for directors on the
Combined Code’, and by reporting in accordance with that guidance.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role of
management is to implement Board policies on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or
loss.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which has been in place for
the year under review and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls during the year, including strategic, operational, legal and
compliance, risk management and financial controls. The processes used by the Board for their review included the following:
l The Board receives regular reports from management which highlight any material control weaknesses, and discusses actions taken on
weaknesses identified by management;
l The audit committee, based on reports provided by the external auditors, reviews the effectiveness of the internal financial control system,
and any significant matters are referred to the Board for consideration;
l The Chairman of the audit committee reports the outcome of the audit committee meetings to the Board;
l The Board considers all significant financing and investment opportunities relating to the Group, including the granting of guarantees,
and monitors policy in respect of managing treasury and exchange risks;
l The Board reviews the role of insurance in managing risks across the Group.
The Group’s management operates a risk management process which identifies the key risks facing each of the Group’s businesses and
reports to the Board on how those risks are being addressed. This is based on each business producing a report on risk assessment and
business development policy, which identifies the key risks facing the business, the probability of those risks occurring and the actions being
taken to mitigate those risks to the desired level. These reports are combined to provide the Board with a report of the significant risks faced by
the Group as a whole, together with details of the controls in place over those risks.
The Group does not have an internal audit function. However the Board periodically reviews the need for such a function and has done so
during the year. The current conclusion of the Board is that an internal audit function is not necessary given the scale and complexity of the
Group’s operations. 
THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES
The Board
The Board has reserved certain matters for its approval. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, and the appointment and removal
of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors have full and timely
access to all relevant information and there is a procedure for all Directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional
advice, if necessary, at the expense of the Company.

Audit committee
The committee meets at least twice annually and provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors. Meetings are also attended,
by invitation, by executive Directors, however the committee meets at least annually with the auditors without executive Directors being
present. The committee advises the Board on the appointment of auditors and on their remuneration, and discusses the nature and scope of
the audit work undertaken by the auditors.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s
framework of executive remuneration and its cost. The committee determines the remuneration and other benefits for each of the executive
Directors, including performance related bonus schemes and pension entitlements.
GOING CONCERN
After making appropriate enquiries, based on the strength of the Group’s balance sheet and on the facilities currently available to the Group,
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. As in prior years the Directors therefore believe that it is appropriate that the financial statements are prepared on a
going concern basis.

The remuneration policy is set by the Board as a whole with the remuneration committee then working within the policy to set individual levels
of remuneration. The aim of the policy is for the Group to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives by rewarding them with
competitive salary, benefit and incentive packages which are linked to performance and which are designed to enhance the business and the
creation of shareholder value. The elements of the remuneration package are as follows:
Basic salaries and benefits in kind
Basic salaries are determined by the remuneration committee, taking into account the performance of each individual and salary levels
prevailing in the market for executives of comparable status and skills. The salaries are reviewed annually with effect from 1 April or when a
change of responsibilities occurs. Benefits in kind provided are primarily a company car and fuel and private medical insurance. Executives
may choose to forego the company car and fuel benefit in return for an additional payment of salary, such payment being calculated so as to
leave the Company no worse off from the change.
Performance related bonus
Clive Snowdon and John Beaumont participate in a cash bonus scheme under which entitlement to any bonus is dependent upon the increase
in the Group’s earnings per share. Bonuses paid are non-pensionable and are capped at 100% of basic salary.
In view of the performance of the Group in the face of adverse conditions in the global aerospace market, the remuneration committee decided
to award discretionary bonuses to Clive Snowdon and John Beaumont for the year ended 31 March 2003.
Share options
Executive options
Each executive Director is eligible to participate in the UMECO 2001 Share Option Plan under which, at the discretion of the remuneration
committee, options may be granted to employees and directors of UMECO and its subsidiaries. Options are granted under the Plan at the
prevailing market price at the time of grant, and are not normally exercisable before the expiry of three years from the date of grant and not
after ten years from the date of grant. 
All options granted under the UMECO 2001 Share Option Plan are subject to performance targets, the achievement of which is a condition
precedent to the exercise of the options. The performance target attaching to the options granted to executive Directors is based on the
Company’s growth in earnings per share over a three year period as shown below. This measure has been chosen because it reflects real
improvement in earnings and is considered an appropriate measure for executive share options.
Average real annual growth Percentage of
over the three year period option vesting
Below 5% 0%
Over 5% 25%
Over 7.5% 50%
Over 10% 75%
Over 12.5% 100%
No options may be exercised if the average real annual growth in earnings per share is below 5%. For performance between any two levels over
5%, the options will be exercisable on a straight line basis. Real growth in earnings per share is defined as the amount by which the
Company’s growth in earnings per share exceeds the rate of inflation over the same period.
In granting options under the Plan, the remuneration committee takes into account the salary level of the individuals concerned. Details of the
options under the UMECO 2001 Share Option Plan granted to executive Directors of UMECO are set out on page 16.
Save as you earn scheme
The Group’s savings related share option (SAYE) scheme is open to Directors spending at least 25 hours per week on Group business and to all
other employees paying PAYE on earnings from their employment within the Group. Options granted under the scheme are exercisable three
years from the date of grant.
2. Front continued [c87586]  10/6/03  4:17 pm  Page 13 Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
LTIP awards were made to senior executives between 1998 and 2000. As a consequence of the establishment of the UMECO 2001 Share Option
Plan, no further awards will be made under the LTIP . 
The value of the shares awarded to participants in the LTIP was subject to an upper annual limit of 90% of an executive’s basic salary for the
year of operation. Ownership of shares under the awards vested with participants subject to achievement of the following performance criteria:
a. earnings per share growth exceeding inflation by a minimum of 2.5% per annum over the three year performance period, and
b. the amount of the award vesting at the end of the performance period was subject to performance ranked against companies forming the
FTSE mid-250 index (excluding investment trusts, financial and utility companies). Performance in the top quartile measured against the
comparator group would vest awards in full. Performance ranked between 55% and 75% of the group would vest awards on a sliding scale
from 25% to 100% of their value. For performance ranked below 55%, the shares would be forfeited.
Awards are non-pensionable and the plan is administered by Bacon & Woodrow Trust Company (CI) Limited as trustees under a trust deed
dated 11 February 1998. 
It has been confirmed by the remuneration committee that the conditions required for vesting of the awards made to Clive Snowdon and John
Beaumont in June 1999 have not been met, and these awards have therefore lapsed.
Directors’ pension entitlement
Clive Snowdon
Clive Snowdon is entitled to employer’s pension contributions equivalent to 39% of basic salary. At the executive’s discretion, a proportion of
the pension contribution may be converted into salary. The Company has established the UMECO plc Executive Retirement Benefits Scheme,
an individual defined contribution scheme in respect of Clive Snowdon. In addition the Company is the principal employer under a funded
unapproved retirement benefits scheme (FURBS) in respect of Clive Snowdon. Both schemes are non-contributory by the employee. 
John Beaumont
John Beaumont is a member of the UMECO plc Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which is Inland Revenue approved. Until normal
retirement date members currently contribute 6.5% of salary and the Group currently contributes 14.2%. The scheme provides members with a
pension of up to two thirds of pensionable salary on retirement. It also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and pensions for
dependents of members on their death in service or following retirement.
There are no pension arrangements in place for other Directors.
Remuneration of non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Chairman’s remuneration committee, which comprises all members of the Board
apart from the Chairman. The remuneration of the other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board following recommendations made
by the Chairman.
Service contracts
The Company has agreed service contracts with the executive Directors which are considered consistent with normal practice in smaller
quoted companies wishing to attract and retain suitably qualified executives, and has agreed letters of appointment with the non-executive
Directors. The dates of these contracts are as follows:
BD McGowan 21 April 1997
CJ Snowdon 21 April 1997
RJK Beaumont 20 September 1993
O Abdullah 25 March 1994
JM Harper 5 June 2002
JS Harper 6 July 1995
DR Porter 21 December 2000
Clive Snowdon has a contract which is terminable by the Company giving one year’s notice, or by Clive Snowdon giving six months’ notice.
There is no obligation on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice other than basic salary and pension contributions.
John Beaumont has a contract which is terminable by the Company giving two years’ notice, or by John Beaumont giving six months’ notice.
As part of the terms of this contract, he is entitled to terminate the contract within 12 months of his becoming aware that, as a result of a

hostile take-over, any person has acquired shares in the Company which, taken together with shares held or acquired by persons acting in
concert with that person, carry 50% or more of the voting rights for the time being of the Company. In that event, John Beaumont would
receive compensation equal to the amount to which he would have been entitled under the relevant legislation if he had been wrongfully
dismissed.
None of the letters of appointment of the non-executive Directors provides either for a fixed notice period or for the payment of compensation
on termination.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
The graph below compares the Company’s total shareholder return over the five years ended 31 March 2003 with that for the FTSE Small-cap
share index and the FTSE Aerospace and Defence Sector Index. The base for the three data series has been taken as 100 on 31 March 1998.
The FTSE Small-cap share index was chosen as it is a relevant broad equity market index for smaller quoted companies.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS
The Directors who held office at the end of the financial year and their interests in the 25p ordinary shares of the Company at the start of the
year (or date of appointment where later) and end of the year were as follows:

Statement of T otal Recognised Gains and Losses
For the year ended 31 March 2003
3. Accounts [c87586]  10/6/03  4:17 pm  Page 21 The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the
financial statements:
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under historical cost accounting rules.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of UMECO plc and all of its subsidiaries. Acquisitions are
accounted for using acquisition accounting rules. An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term interest, and is able to
exercise significant influence. The Group’s share of profits or losses of associates is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and
its interest in their net assets is included within investments in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, Titanox Aerospace SA (‘Titanox’) was accounted for as an associated undertaking. In accordance
with FRS 2 ‘Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings’, and in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill has been calculated as the
sum of the goodwill arising on each purchase of shares in Titanox, being the difference at the date of each purchase between the fair value of
the consideration given and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased. This represents a
departure from the statutory method, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that Titanox
became a subsidiary undertaking. The statutory method would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the Group’s share of
Titanox’s retained reserves, during the period that it was an associated undertaking, being recharacterised as goodwill. The effect of this
departure is to decrease retained profits by £289,000 and to decrease the cost of purchased goodwill recognised on the acquisition by
£289,000. The effect of this departure from the statutory method on profits for the year is not material.
The Group treats investments in undertakings that are jointly controlled as joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross
equity method.
A profit and loss account is not presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Goodwill
From 1 April 1998, the difference between the fair values of consideration given and net assets acquired is capitalised in the consolidated
financial statements as goodwill. The Directors consider each acquisition separately for the purpose of determining the amortisation period of
any goodwill that arises. Currently, all such goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of 20 years. Fair value
adjustments are considered to be provisional at the first balance sheet date after acquisition to allow time to elapse for any adjustments to be
accurately quantified.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 had been written off against reserves on acquisition. In accordance with FRS 10, this
goodwill has now been eliminated against the profit and loss reserve. On any subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired
business, the profit or loss on disposal is to be calculated after charging the amount of any related goodwill previously taken to reserves.
T urnover
Turnover represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the provision of goods and services to customers during the year.
Pension costs
The Group operates pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable salaries and on contributions made by members. The
assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. Contributions to the schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so
as to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ working lives with the Group. The Group has made the transitional disclosures required by
FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ in note 26 to these financial statements.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives on a straight
line basis as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold property 50 years
Short leasehold property period of lease
Plant, machinery, fixtures & IT equipment 3-10 years
Motor vehicles 3-4 years
No depreciation is charged on freehold land.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Accounting Policies UMECO plc Annual Report 2003
22
Accounting Policies
3. Accounts [c87586]  10/6/03  4:17 pm  Page 22 T axation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Leases
Where the Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is
treated as a finance lease. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over the shorter of its
estimated useful life and the lease term. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors. Rentals
payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account as interest, and the capital element,
which reduces the outstanding obligation for further instalments. All other leases are operating leases and the rental charges are taken to the
profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on
translation are included in the profit and loss account. Profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries are consolidated at the average rate of
exchange for the year. Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation into sterling of equity interests in overseas subsidiary
undertakings are treated as movements in reserves. Foreign exchange differences arising on borrowings considered to finance, or provide a
hedge against, foreign equity investments, are taken directly to reserves.

26 Pensions
As explained in the accounting policies set out on page 22 the Group operates several pension schemes, the assets of which are held
separately from those of the Group. The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures
given in section (a) of this note are those required by that standard. In accordance with FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the phased
transitional disclosures required in relation to defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are set out in section (b) of this note.
(a) UMECO Group pension schemes
The UMECO plc Group scheme has two sections. The defined benefit section, which is closed to new entrants, provides benefits based on
final pensionable pay with contributions being charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees’
working lives with the Group. The contributions are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of valuations, conducted
at least every three years, using the projected unit method. The most recent valuation was at 1 April 2002. The assumptions which have
the most significant effects on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments (7% per annum) and the
rates of increase in salaries (4.5 – 5.75% per annum) and pensions (3.25 – 3.5% per annum). The 1 April 2002 valuation showed that the
actuarial value of the defined benefit section’s assets was £4,372,000 which represented 85% of the actuarial value of benefits that had
accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The contributions of the Group and employees are currently
14.2% and 4.5% to 6.5% of earnings respectively. Contributions amounting to £234,000 (2002: £247,000) were payable to the defined benefit
section of the scheme in the year, of which £21,000 (2002: £23,000) was outstanding at the year end. 
The UMECO plc Group scheme also has a defined contribution section. Members of this section contribute between 2% and 6% of
pensionable earnings, with the Group making contributions of between 4% and 10%. Contributions amounting to £366,000 (2002:
£341,000) were payable to this section of the scheme in the year, of which £21,000 was outstanding at the year end (2002: £31,000).
The trustees of the UMECO plc Group scheme are chaired by one of the Company’s non–executive Directors and an independent expert in
pension matters is normally in attendance at meetings of the trustees. Responsibility for investment of the scheme’s funds has been
delegated by the trustees to professional investment managers. In accordance with best practice the Company’s pension scheme
investment managers are not permitted to invest funds in the Group’s own assets or shares.
As described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 13 to 17 the Company operates a defined contribution scheme in
respect of Clive Snowdon, and similar arrangements are operated for one other executive. Total contributions of £61,000 were payable to
these schemes for the year, of which none were outstanding at the year end (2002: £2,000).
G.R.P . Material Supplies, Med-Lab and RD Taylor operate defined contribution schemes for qualifying employees. Employer contributions
are a maximum of 10% and employees are encouraged to contribute at similar rates. Total contributions of £86,000 were payable in
respect of the year. Aeropia and Aerovac Systems contribute amounts to the personal pension schemes of certain employees. The total of
such contributions paid in the year was £14,000 and there were no outstanding payments of contributions at the year end.
The Group operates defined contribution schemes in respect of certain businesses in the United States and France. Contributions to these
schemes during the year totalled £149,000.
(b) FRS 17 disclosures
The information required for these disclosures has been obtained by an updating of the actuarial valuation referred to above, which was
carried out by an independent qualified actuary.
The assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities for the purposes of these disclosures are as follows: 
2003 2002
% %
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries:
– executive members 4.75 5.00
– staff members 3.75 4.00
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.60 2.80
Discount rate 5.30 5.90
Inflation 2.60 2.80

5. Notes_End [c87586]  10/6/03  4:16 pm  Page 36 Had the Group adopted the full requirements of FRS 17 in the preparation of these financial statements, the amounts disclosed for net
assets and the profit and loss account reserve would have been as follows:
2003 2002
£000 £000
Net assets
Excluding net pension liability 64,101 64,115
Net pension liability (2,228) (575)
Restated to include net pension liability 61,873 63,540
Profit and loss reserve
Excluding net pension liability 8,357 8,372
Net pension liability (2,228) (575)
Restated to include net pension liability 6,129 7,797
The Company is a member of the defined benefit section of the Group pension scheme. Since the Company is unable to identify its share
of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, when FRS 17 is fully adopted, the scheme will be accounted for
by the Company as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
27 Contingent liabilities
The contingent liability of the Group for bank guarantees and liabilities for bills of exchange discounted in the normal course of business
at 31 March 2003 amounted to £497,000 (2002: £563,000). Under a Group registration the Company is jointly and severally liable for value
added tax due by other Group companies. At 31 March 2003 this contingent liability amounted to £1,013,000 (2002: £978,000).
28 Financial instruments
The Directors review and agree the broad policies for all significant areas of financial management. As the Group’s operations are centred
on the aerospace industry, which is primarily US dollar based, a natural hedge is in place for most foreign currency transactions. The
Group puts in place forward foreign exchange contracts and other hedging instruments where it is thought necessary to use such
instruments to manage the exposure to foreign exchange movements. There were no hedging instruments in place at the end of the
financial year.
The currency and interest rate exposure of net debt at 31 March 2003 was:

The maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities is set out in notes 15 and 16.
At 31 March 2003, the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments was the same as the book value of the instruments. Interest rates are
managed using fixed and floating rate debt. Fixed rate debt primarily comprises bank loans, on which interest is based on LIBOR. Floating
rate debt comprises cash at bank and overdrafts, on which interest is related to bank base rates.
As at 31 March 2003, the principal borrowing facilities available to the Group were committed term loans of £18.7 million and a £10.0
million overdraft facility. As set out in the Finance Director’s Review, the Group has agreed total facilities of £35.0 million since the year
end, including term loans of £21.0 million repayable in equal half yearly instalments over seven years.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2003
5. Notes_End [c87586]  10/6/03  4:16 pm  Page 38 Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss for that year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
l select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
l make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
l state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements;
l prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will remain in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have a
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.

We have audited the financial statements on pages 18 to 38. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company
and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the Directors’ Remuneration Report. As described on page 39, this
includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on pages 11 and 12 reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk
and control procedures.
We read the other information accompanying the Annual Report, including the Corporate Governance statement and the unaudited part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 March 2003 and of the profit
of the Group for the year then ended; and
l the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985.

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
It gives me pleasure to present the results for 
the year ended 30 June 2010 in what has been 
a good year for Ashmore Group plc (“Ashmore” , 
or the “Group”). The Group has made significant 
progress in financial terms, with strong growth 
in assets under management (AuM) and good 
investment performance producing management 
and performance fee growth. Through the 
maintenance of a robust and efficient business 
model, overall this results in an increase of 
36% in profit before tax to £217.2 million 
(FY2008/09: £159.8 million).
The Group has also made further progress 
in operational terms with the development 
of new funds and investment themes, 
increased scale and geographical reach 
to its distribution team, and, as part of 
the third phase of its strategy – mobilising 
emerging market capital – by developing 
further local asset management businesses 
in some of the key emerging markets. 
In recognition of this financial 
performance and underlining the Board’s 
confidence in the future prospects of the 
Group, the Directors are recommending 
an increased final dividend of 9.34 pence 
per share for the year ended 30 June 
2010 which, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 3 December 
2010 to shareholders on the register 
on 5 November 2010. This makes a 
total dividend for the year of 13 pence 
per share (FY2008/09: 12.0 pence), an 
increase of 8.3%.
The Board continues to maintain 
its focus on good corporate governance 
and recognises the year has seen a new 
Corporate Governance Code released in 
May 2010 (“the 2010 Code”). Whilst the 
2010 Code does not apply to Ashmore 
until the next financial year the Company 
intends to adopt it with immediate effect. 
The team at Ashmore has had a 
year they can be proud of and I should 
like to thank them all for the efforts 
they have made in contributing to the 
achievement of these results. These remain 
challenging times in the global financial 
markets but the events of last year have 
emphasised the increasing importance 
of emerging markets within the global 
order. I am confident that Ashmore, with 
its long history and excellent track record 
of investment in emerging markets, is 
extremely well positioned to benefit from 
the growing opportunity.

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
I am pleased to be able to report that in the 
year ended 30 June 2010 Ashmore Group plc 
performed well in respect of its key targets 
of overall investment performance of assets 
managed, growth of assets under management 
and the financial performance of the company. 
The Group also made good progress in its plans 
to deepen and broaden its distribution capability, 
and in advancing its local asset management 
ventures in key emerging markets. Meanwhile, 
the investment world is steadily getting our 
messages that emerging markets must become 
a core part of an investment portfolio in the 
future and that few have enough of their 
investable assets committed to those regions.
The year has been marked by 
further enhancement of the 
relative positioning of emerging 
markets over developed markets
Chief Executive  
Officer’s statement
Assets under management and 
financial performance
AuM development
The Group’s AuM increased by 42% 
from an opening level of US$24.9 billion 
to reach US$35.3 billion at the year 
end. This was achieved through net 
subscriptions of US$7.6 billion and 
positive investment performance of 
US$2.8 billion. Gross subscriptions were 
significantly higher than the prior year at 
US$11.3 billion (FY2008/09: US$3.8 billion) 
with the majority of the inflows going 
to the Group’s most liquid investment 
themes of external debt and local currency, 
much as predicted at the time of last 
year’s annual report and in line with our 
previous experience at this stage of the 
cycle after crisis. The principal sources of 
funds were larger segregated account 
mandates, including significant new funds 
from governments/reserve managers and 
sovereign wealth funds from the emerging 
markets themselves. In line with the overall 
secular shift that we have been predicting, 
such accounts are no longer moving simply 
into dollar-denominated instruments, but 
into local currency assets in emerging 
markets, and which now include currency 
overlay and hedging products in addition 
to active mandates in both currencies and 
bonds. Levels of gross redemptions were 
reduced sharply from the prior period at 
US$3.7 billion (FY2008/09: US$11.3 billion). 
Financial performance
The Group achieved good growth in 
revenue in the year, with a 41% increase in 
net revenue to £286.2 million (FY2008/09: 
£203.5 million). Management fee income 
in sterling terms increased by 3% to 
£192.1 million (FY2008/09: £186.8 million) 
as a result of increased average AuM and 
improved foreign exchange conversion 
rates, offset by reduced average fee 
margins. This reduction in margins is as 
a result of the mix of subscriptions as 
the business and its asset classes grow 
and evolve, with larger segregated client 
inflows and the most liquid investment 
themes attracting lower pricing. 
Performance fee income grew strongly 
by 58% to £82.9 million (FY2008/09: 
£52.5 million), as a result of strong 
investment performance from funds 
across investment themes, principally 
this year from annual fees of funds with 
31 December and 30 April year end dates. 
This again demonstrates the benefits of 
our performance fee model where annual 
fees are staggered across the financial 
year. Profit before tax increased 36%

Annual report and accounts 2010
overall with 97% by AuM of those 
accounts managed to benchmarks 
outperforming their benchmarks over 
one year, and 53% outperforming over 
three years. Hence the Group’s well-
established active investment processes, 
which have been tested during a number 
of cycles, continued to generate alpha. 
Importantly, this alpha also came from 
where we expected and had predicted to 
clients, in the roll-down of risk through 
our investment themes from sovereign 
investment grade through non-investment 
grade to local currency, corporate debt, 
equity and, just beginning in this year 
and expected to continue over the next 
1-2 years, special situations/private equity.
Recognising developments within 
emerging markets, availability of assets 
for investment and providing routes 
to invest in them is our core function. 
As more investors realise the opportunity 
of emerging market investing, and those 
markets grow and provide more diversified 
opportunities, our challenge is to provide 
suitable products to each potential client. 
This year saw us establish a variety of new 
products as we saw increasing opportunity 
to provide investors differing slices of 
emerging markets risk with different target 
returns and liquidity profiles. 
As a result, and as our existing 
investors will know, we now provide 
sub-themes within each of the major 
public markets investment themes of 
external debt, local currency and corporate 
debt, with different liquidity and risk 
characteristics. If an investor wants a 
highly liquid, plain vanilla, single theme, 
daily dealing product, with lower targeted 
returns than the strategies that accept less 
liquidity, or than the more blended and 
complex investment packages, then we 
can now provide it, both in UK and Europe 
(and to some extent Asia), through a full 
suite of SICAV products. We also expect 
to be able to do so in the USA in this 
financial year.
from £159.8 million to £217.2 million with 
earnings per share increasing to 23.9 pence 
(FY2008/09: 17.1 pence). In line with the 
increase in earnings per share, and in view 
of the positive outlook for the business, 
whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet 
to support seed capital for new products, 
we are delighted to be able to recommend 
an increase in the total dividend to 
13.0 pence (FY2008/09: 12.0 pence).
Emerging markets: 
Developments and opportunities
The year has been marked by the further 
enhancement of the relative positioning of 
emerging markets over developed markets 
in several ways. Firstly, the forecast for 
economic growth in emerging markets 
remains a credible 6-7% in both 2010 and 
2011, significantly outstripping the forecast 
growth levels for the developed world 
of just over 2% in each year. Developed 
markets will only recover slowly from the 
credit crisis as the effects of deleveraging 
will still be felt for some time and policy 
has to adjust to reflect the much less 
levered environment. Secondly, balance of 
payment fundamentals in many emerging 
markets remain strong and improving. 
A number of emerging economies already 
have the theoretical capacity to use 
reserves to pay off all of their debt and still 
be left with surpluses; an impossible dream 
for any major developed country. Thirdly, 
despite home country bias, the historic 
prejudices of investors towards the “safer” 
developed world over “riskier” emerging 
markets are steadily being dispelled by 
the recent events in the Eurozone, where 
downgrades have begun to contrast with 
the steady upgrades expected in emerging 
markets over coming years. Finally, the 
role of the emerging markets, and their 
importance within the G20 as it sets 
international policy, continues to expand, 
particularly in exploring the longer term 
reform of the international monetary 
system and the likely increased role of 
emerging markets’ currencies.
In summary, there is a new structure 
to the global economy and in particular the 
bargaining power of the emerging world. 
Ashmore has a long history of successful 
investment across emerging markets 
and regards this long-term structural 
opportunity, coupled with an inexorable 
shift of investors’ allocations to the 
emerging markets, as providing a platform 
for further development in shareholder 
value through the execution of our stated 
three-phase strategy.

Capitalising on increasing 
investor allocations into and 
between emerging markets
An external debt investor can now 
access the sub-themes of a) sovereign 
investment grade only; b) sovereign and/
or c) blended mandates incorporating 
differing proportions of external debt, 
local currency and corporate debt and in 
some cases special situations. In all cases 
this can now be done on a daily dealing 
basis. The local currency investment 
theme also now sees increasing levels of 
investor interest and understanding of the 
diversity of the opportunity set, ranging 
from purely foreign exchange (short-term/
money markets) to local currency bonds 
(long-term/interest rate duration) to a 
blend of both, optimising risk/return 
and liquidity. Again, we have established 
funds and accounts including SICAVs on 
a daily dealing basis for each. This variety 
of sub-themes of investment grade, non-
investment grade or a blend is also now 
available in corporate debt, except where 
there is lesser liquidity, and, in addition, 
our global public equity investment theme 
is now available on a daily dealing basis 
in SICAV form, alongside the sub-theme 
investing in closed end funds. We are 
also delighted to have received QFII 
status from China during the year to run 
a monthly dealing set of funds providing 
China A share, domestic fixed income and 
blended products. Obtaining such scarce 
capacity from the Chinese authorities both 
provides our investors with access to the 
onshore market and demonstrates our 
growing involvement within the local asset 
management market.
We have made progress on building 
a broader distribution platform during the 
year and, in line with the plans we outlined 
last year, added headcount in institutional 
business development, client relationship 
management and marketing services. 
Total headcount across the three areas 
at year end has increased by 62% to 21. 
This additional resource was added in 
existing offices in London and New York, 
and through the recruitment of dedicated 
distribution resources in Beijing and 
Tokyo by year end and Melbourne shortly 
thereafter, as well as within the local asset 
management ventures in Brazil and Turkey. 
We have now begun to focus on the global 
retail markets as the next stage in the 
development of our distribution platform, 
and are finalising the establishment and 
infrastructure associated with our new 
geographic locations, so we expect to add 
further resources and product conduits 
globally in the current year. 
The Group’s local asset management 
operations in Turkey, Brazil and India were 
enhanced during the year and we expect 
that one or two additional local asset 
management platforms will be opened 
in the current year. In all such locations 
we are currently actively undertaking 
processes to raise AuM through a range 
of open-ended fixed income and equity 
products as well as infrastructure, private 
equity, real estate and distressed debt 
asset classes where we see talent and 
opportunity. Whilst these businesses 
are currently a small percentage of the 
overall Group AuM, we believe that the 
development of a network of domestic 
asset management businesses operating 
in a number of the world’s key emerging 
markets gives us direct access to the 
extraordinary growth potential arising both 
within these markets and across border 
and are seeds planted for the Group’s 
future growth.
People and culture
A core part of Ashmore’s culture is the 
focus on, and a deep understanding of, 
all aspects of the emerging markets in a 
team-based approach. The year just past 
has seen significant events both within 
the emerging markets and within markets 
traditionally viewed as developed. Ashmore 
tries to capture value from its view of 
the world and the markets’ reactions 
from such events, both impacting on 
and arising from the emerging markets, 
and the demographic, macroeconomic, 
political and cultural trends in operation 
across the globe. This means maximising 
the advantage our broad Ashmore 
platform can give us, encompassing our 
track record, history, product range and 
scale, the exchange of ideas within the 
investment processes as well as across 
the business from distribution to support 
areas, and within both global and local 
asset management businesses. Our 
headcount has grown further in the year 
to 165 at 30 June 2010 (30 June 2009: 
142) and our geographical and cultural 
diversity continues to broaden as a result, 
but we all focus on emerging markets and 
are determined to maintain our ability 
to maximise the Ashmore advantage. 
This absolute focus on the emerging 
markets is our primary alignment with 
our clients. We believe it also aligns us 
with our shareholders, whose investment 
rationale ultimately relates back to the 
emerging market investment opportunity. 
It continues to be a pleasure to work with 
everyone at Ashmore and I should like

Outlook
In the new financial year, unaudited 
annual performance fees for the funds 
with performance years ended 31 August 
2010 were £43.5 million (August 2009: 
£5.1 million) which will be recognised in 
the financial year ended 30 June 2011.
The opportunities for investment 
continue to be good across our investment 
themes although probably in a lower 
absolute return world than the last year in 
the more liquid markets. External and local 
currency debt benefit from the ongoing 
recognition by investors of the relative 
attractiveness of sovereign emerging 
market issuers over their developed 
world counterparts. Recent local currency 
volatility simply means that it is a trader’s 
market for the moment and we are happy 
to adjust for that, whilst in the medium 
term we expect continued euro weakness 
and the structural decline of the dollar 
to strengthen the case for investing in 
emerging market currencies. Meanwhile 
currency nervousness and overstated 
predictions of near-term emerging markets 
inflation, without proper recognition of 
improved policy management by local 
monetary authorities, will provide great 
opportunities to add local currency bonds 
and interest rate exposure in the coming 
year. Corporate debt and equities both 
benefit from the strong fundamentals of 
many of the emerging markets companies, 
with steady growth of both debt and 
equity issuance creating deeper markets 
and more scope to add capital. Of these 
two themes, we expect corporate debt 
to have stronger near-term performance, 
and it is one of our more favoured themes. 
We believe equity markets will be held 
back somewhat by the outlook for equity 
in low growth developed world markets, 
and as fundamental investors take time to 
increase their weightings to the emerging 
markets until they finally see the impact 
of domestic growth. Special situations 
assets within our portfolio continue to see 
increased realisations from investments 
made in 2004-2006 at attractive premia to 
historic valuations. We expect more over 
the next couple of years as strategies reach 
maturity as usual at this time in the cycle. 
In terms of asset raising, the last 
year has seen an increase in the levels of 
AuM sourced from the emerging markets 
themselves and their largest sources of 
capital ie central banks/reserve managers, 
governments and sovereign wealth 
managers, and this is a trend we expect 
to continue. It is likely that over the long-
term the local currency asset class will 
be of steadily increasing focus to these 
institutions and Ashmore continues to 
pride itself on gaining early, direct access 
to trading in the local market instruments 
directly for both the globally and locally 
managed funds we provide. Our local 
custodial network and hence ability to 
invest without complete dependence 
on international bank balance sheets 
is another benefit of diversification in 
which we invest significant time. We will 
continue this focus as we continue to see 
this asset class growing over time to be our 
biggest volume theme. The steps taken 
in the past year toward enhancing and 
broadening the distribution of Ashmore’s 
funds will continue, and we expect to 
undertake further product development 
and organisational alignment to develop 
a greater proportion of business from 
the retail distribution channel, alongside 
our established institutional business 
development team. 
Although the problem of home 
country bias in investment will never be 
completely eliminated as it has strong tribal 
roots, it is at its weakest in the developed 
world after crisis and in recovery mode. 
Hence, this is a strong current positive for 
Ashmore as our continued and consistent 
message receives a broader hearing. 
However, an even stronger positive is that 
our growth target market for capital flows 
is from the emerging markets themselves, 
and so when these investors exhibit home 
country bias, we will be there to encourage 
it and channel it into their own markets 
and away from the developed world.
In summary, we believe we are 
steadily better positioned in emerging 
markets investing and well set to deal 
with the greater competition that a 
growing investable universe inevitably 
brings. Our investment and business thesis 
remains on track and we look forward to 
developing it further in the coming year.

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
New funds and accounts
The year saw a marked increase in the 
level of new funds launched from earlier 
years in terms of both number and levels 
of AuM. In the public funds category 
14 funds were launched including 8 sub-
funds of the Ashmore SICAV within the 
external debt theme (Sovereign Investment 
Grade Debt Fund, Sovereign Debt Fund); 
local currency theme (Emerging Markets 
Local Markets Fund, Local Currency Bond 
Fund); corporate debt theme (Investment 
Grade Corporate Debt Fund, Corporate 
Debt Fund); and equity theme (Equity 
Fund, Equity Select Fund). The Ashmore 
SICAV 3 and Ashmore Institutional Multi-
Strategy Fund were launched within the 
multi-strategy theme. In real estate the 
Ashmore Russian Real Estate Recovery 
Fund and Everbright Ashmore China Real 
Estate Fund. The Ashmore Greater China 
Fund focusing on equities and fixed income 
investing principally within the domestic 
Chinese market utilising the QFII quota 
and a local currency fund managed by 
our Brazilian local asset management 
subsidiary.
Additionally 10 new segregated 
and dual-branded mandates were 
won in the period within the external 
debt, local currency, special situations, 
multi-strategy and local currency hedging/
overlay strategies.
The Group recorded an operating profit 
before tax for the year ended 30 June 2010 
of £209.3 million (FY2008/09: £150.6 million), 
giving rise to an operating margin of 73 per cent 
(FY2008/09: 74 per cent); a profit before tax of 
£217.2 million (FY2008/09: £159.8 million); and 
a profit after tax of £160.6 million (FY2008/09: 
£1 15.5 million). The financial results are analysed 
further below.

Assets under management and

Gross subscriptions in the year increased 
significantly from the previous period to a 
level of US$11.3 billion, these subscriptions 
being received almost equally between 
the first and second half concentrated 
particularly in the first and fourth 
quarters. Subscriptions were weighted 
predominantly to the most liquid themes, 
external debt and local currency as well 
as currency hedging/overlay. The majority 
of subscriptions were into segregated 
mandates with a number of further 
subscriptions from existing clients.
Other notable gross subscriptions 
on a smaller scale were those into the 
corporate debt theme, as investors’ 
appetite for this asset class began to 
gather momentum through the year, 
and at the end of the year, into a new 
segregated mandate in the special 
situations theme.
Gross redemptions declined 
sharply to US$3.7 billion and in line with 
our statement at the interims, these 
continue to arise principally from clients’ 
continued needs for liquidity. Often, 
these are undertaken by clients through 
a rebalancing process following periods 
of strong emerging market performance 
relative to other asset classes. Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010

The Group’s progress towards achieving its strategic objectives is monitored 
by reference to a number of key performance indicators, as set out below:
Measure Definition
Year-end AuM/ 
Average AuM 
The movement between opening and closing assets under 
management provides a good indication of the overall 
success of the business during the period, both in terms of 
net subscriptions/redemptions and investment performance. 
The average AuM balance during the period, along with 
the average margins achieved, determine the level of 
management fee revenues. The AuM and margin trends 
are lead indicators for short-term profitability.
Average net management 
fee margins
(bps) 
The average net management fee margin is calculated in 
US dollars, and is assessed after management fee rebates. 
The average is affected by changes in the product and 
investor mix. Certain themes attract higher gross fee levels, 
generally where investment return opportunities are higher.
Operating profit margin
The operating profit margin measures total operating profits 
against net revenues. Net revenues are calculated after 
deducting distribution costs and any rebates. Included within 
total operating costs are both fixed and variable personnel 
expenses, and other operating expenses.  
Variable compensation  
(VC)/EBVCIT
The Group’s variable compensation represents the majority 
of the overall personnel expenses payable, and is assessed 
as a percentage of profit before variable compensation, 
interest and tax. The amount includes performance-related 
bonuses, and share-based payments and associated social 
security costs.  
Year-end headcount
The Group analyses its headcount by function (investment vs 
support), and by business (global asset management vs local 
asset management subsidiaries).

The increase in AuM in the period reflects the strong net inflows in the year 
with positive investment performance. Further subscriptions were received 
from existing clients and new segregated mandates and fund launches in the 
period. Inflows peaked in the first quarter before modest levels in the second 
and third quarters before a strong fourth quarter – reaching a closing level of 
AuM of US$35.3 billion at 30 June 2010.

During the period average net management fee margins decreased from 
107bps in FY2008/09, largely driven by theme and client mix effects with the 
majority of new AuM being achieved within the lower margin liquid 
investment themes mainly from larger segregated mandates which typically 
have a lower management fee. The maintenance of high revenue margins, 
reflecting the specialist characteristics of many of the themes we manage 
and the active nature of our investment process, remains our aim.

The Group has maintained a market-leading operating margin position. 
Whilst we have remained focused on growing our platform, we retain a 
significant degree of flexibility in our cost base, restricting fixed costs where 
possible. As we have outlined previously, we do expect this to normalise in 
the 60s over the long-term.

The VC/EBVCIT percentage was increased in FY2009/10 to 18.0%

performance and raising of AuM in contrast with the negative performance 
for the prior period.

The alternative analysis of AuM, “as invested by underlying asset class”, adjusts the “classified by mandate” to take account of 
cross-over investment, the allocations into underlying themes of the multi-strategy funds and, where possible, the other investment 
theme. This analysis demonstrates the significance of the local currency asset class which has grown further in the period, the 
allocation of funds invested into corporate debt and the reduction of the percentage of special situations assets over the last year 
reflecting the strong inflows into the liquid themes. The charts below illustrate the impact of moving between the “as mandated” 
and the “as invested” analysis as at 30 June 2010, and the previous year:

Investor profile – type and geography
The Group’s AuM are sourced from a diverse range of investors, which are predominantly institutional in type (30 June 2010: 92%; 
30 June 2009: 91%), including pension providers, government agencies, banks and insurers. The balance is retail in nature including 
high net worth individuals and some distributed products.
Within the institutional investor profile, the most significant trend during the period has been the increase in the government category 
of investors which include central banks, treasurers/reserve managers and sovereign wealth funds which have increased from 21% to 
34% as a result of strong inflows from these investors.

The regions demonstrating the strongest growth in AuM are Asia and the Middle East in line with the strong inflows outlined above 
from government type investors, most of which have been from emerging markets within these geographies, in line with the third 
phase of the Group’s strategy – mobilising emerging market capital.
Management fees and performance fees
As the Group’s AuM is predominantly US dollar-based, the majority of management and performance fees are also US dollar-
denominated. The table below sets out AuM, net management fees, net management fee margins and performance fees, by theme in 
US dollars:

Total (GBP) 15.1 23.6 189.9 95 82.9
Management fees
Management fee income in sterling terms increased by 4% to £189.9 million as a function of increased levels of average AuM 
(FY2009/10: US$31.3 billion; FY2008/09: US$27.7 billion), improved GBP:USD foreign exchange rates (FY2009/10: 1.57 effective; 
FY2008/09: 1.62 effective) offset by a reduction in average management fee margins (FY2009/10: 95bps; FY2008/09: 107bps).
Management fee margins were reduced in line with the receipt of the strongest inflows within the most liquid themes, external 
debt and local currency, which have the lower margins. In addition the majority of inflows into these themes were received in the 
form of larger segregated mandates which are lower margin in nature. Likewise those flows into the currency hedging/overlay strategy 
attract a lower management fee in line with the hedging rather than active management nature of the mandate. 22
Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Performance fees
Total performance fee income for the year increased by 58% to 
£82.9 million (FY2008/09: £52.5 million) being earned across 
the investment themes. The majority of these fees were annual 
performance fees from funds having December and April 
year ends with the balance being made up of other annual 
performance fees and crystallised fees arising on redemptions 
during the period.
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a good balance between 
those funds where the Group is eligible to earn performance fees 
and those that generate revenues for the Group solely through 
management fees. At the year end the Group was eligible to earn 
performance fees on 56% of AuM (30 June 2009: 67%), and 
63% of funds (30 June 2009: 61%). Within those funds that are 
eligible to generate performance fees, 10% were ineligible in the 
year under review, either because such fees are earned at the end 
of the multi-year fund life or are subject to rebate agreements. 
Operating costs and operating margin
The Group has maintained its tightly controlled cost structure, 
with a low proportion of recurring costs and a large proportion 
of variable performance related costs. Headcount increased from 
142 at 30 June 2009 to 165 at 30 June 2010, in line with which 
is the increase in wages and salaries to £9.7 million (FY2008/09: 
£8.9 million). There is continued recruitment to support the 
future growth of the business, principally within the distribution 
and investment teams and within the local asset management 
subsidiaries and associates.
Variable compensation costs represent the majority of 
overall personnel expenses and consists of performance related 
bonuses, share-based payments and associated social security 
costs. Variable compensation is calculated as a percentage of 
profit before tax, interest and variable compensation. The rate 
of variable compensation applied in the year to 30 June 2010 
was increased to 18.0% (FY2008/09: 14.0%) in recognition of 
the growth in AuM, good investment performance and financial 
results.
The Group continues to increase the number of geographic 
locations in which it has a presence through a combination of 
organic growth, which included the establishment of new offices 
in Colombia, Japan, China and Russia and through the investment 
in an associate in China, Everbright Ashmore.
The overall total for other expenses for the year to 30 June 
2010 was £18.1 million (FY2008/09: £16.9 million) with key 
drivers for the year on year rise being increased travel costs 
of £4.1 million (2009: £3.3 million) and professional fees of 
£3.5 million (FY2008/09: £3.0 million), in line with the geographic 
expansion of the business and increased distribution activity. It is 
expected that other costs in aggregate will increase ahead of rate 
of growth of headcount over the next period taking into account 
a number of smaller locations being established for the first time.
The five year trend graphs of total employee numbers and total 
employment costs are shown below. These demonstrate how the 
Group’s operating model has been maintained during a period of

T axation
The vast majority of the Group’s profit is subject to UK 
taxation. The Group’s effective tax rate for the year is 26.1% 
(FY2008/09: 27.7%). The tax rate for the year is less than the UK 
corporation tax rate (currently 28.0%) as a result of deductions in 
respect of share-based payments and movements in provisions.
There is a £14.4 million deferred tax asset on the Group’s 
balance sheet at 30 June 2010, as a result of timing differences 
in the recognition of the accounting expense and actual tax 
deductions in connection with share price appreciation on share-
based awards. 
Balance sheet management and cash flow
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a strong balance sheet in 
order to support regulatory capital requirements, to meet the 
commercial demands of current and prospective investors, and to 
fulfil the development needs across the business which include 
funding establishment costs of distribution offices and local asset 
management ventures, seeding new funds, trading or investment 
in funds or other assets and other strategic initiatives.
Regulatory capital requirements as outlined below and in 
the Group’s Pillar III disclosures have increased reflecting the 
growth of the business and the increased levels of seeding capital 
investment.
As at 30 June 2010, total equity attributable to shareholders 
of the parent was £370.5 million, as compared to £308.5 million 
at 30 June 2009. There is no debt on the Group’s balance sheet.

Annual report and accounts 2010
Cash
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents balance increased 
by £56.0 million in the year to £344.4 million. The Group 
continues to generate significant cash from operations, totalling 
£250.9 million in the year (FY2008/09: £150.9 million), from 
which it paid the following significant items: £82.6 million in 
cash dividends (FY2008/09: £81.9 million); £52.9 million of 
taxation (FY2008/09: £47.7 million); £26.9 million for new seed 
capital investments (FY2008/09: £11.6 million); £34.0 million 
for purchase of our own shares (FY2008/09: £0.9 million); and 
£2.3 million to acquire a new associate (FY2008/09: nil).
The Group’s cash balances are invested with the objective 
of optimising returns within a strict framework which emphasises 
capital preservation, security, liquidity and counterparty risk. 
Cash is invested only in institutions with approved credit ratings 
of A or better. Typically, during the financial year, investments 
have been in short-term cash deposits. Based on the level of cash 
balances at 30 June 2010, a 1 per cent change in UK interest rates 
would have a £3.4 million impact on the Group’s profit before tax.
Seed capital investments
As at 30 June 2010 the amount invested was £61.0 million (at 
cost), with a market value of £68.6 million. During the period 
seed capital investments were made in funds managed by the 
Group’s local asset management subsidiaries and associates and 
in the global asset management business to facilitate the launch 
of new funds.
Purchase of own shares
The Group purchases and holds shares through an Employee 
Benefit Trust (EBT) in anticipation of the exercise of outstanding 
share options and variable compensation share awards. At 
30 June 2010 the EBT owned 36,007,445 (30 June 2009: 
34,293,185) ordinary shares.
Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)
As in prior years, the Group carries on its balance sheet 
unamortised DAC of £9.3 million (FY2008/09: £11.3 million) in 
respect of the launch of Ashmore Global Opportunities Limited 
(AGOL), a publicly listed closed-ended investment company, 
incorporated in 2007. This vehicle raised €500 million capital, 
for the purpose of investing in Ashmore funds, with a focus on 
special situations. During 2010, the shares of the Company have 
traded at a discount to the net asset value of its balance sheet.
Where this discount is in excess of 10 per cent for 
12 consecutive months, an EGM is required to consider 
whether AGOL should be wound up. Such an EGM was held on 
26 May 2010, with 99 per cent of the voting shareholders voting 
against the resolution. Should the discount continue to exceed 
10 per cent for a further 12 consecutive months, an EGM would 
once again be required. 
If as a result of any future vote, AGOL were to be wound 
up this would not result in full acceleration of the recognition 
of these costs, as an early termination of the Company would 
trigger the full recovery of the set-up costs including the portion 
previously amortised – £5.3 million cumulative to 30 June 2010.
Foreign exchange management 
The Group’s long-standing policy is to hedge up to two-thirds 
of the foreign exchange exposure in connection with its net 
management fee cash flows, using either forward foreign 
exchange contracts or options for up to two years forward. 
The GBP/USD exchange rate to 30 June 2010 was relatively stable 
in comparison to the prior year, with the GBP/USD exchange rate 
ranging between GBP1.00:1.42 – 1.70USD.
The Group experienced an overall foreign exchange gain for 
the year to 30 June 2010 of £7.0m (FY2008/09: £38.6m loss), 
comprising a gain of £11.8 million (FY2008/09: £3.8 million) on 
translation of non-sterling denominated assets and liabilities, 
partially offset by a loss of £4.8m (FY2008/09: £42.4 million) on 
realised and unrealised hedging transactions. 
The level of foreign exchange hedges in place at 30 June 
2010 is US$85 million. This consists entirely of options in respect 
of 2010/11 net management fee cash flows. The options 
effectively operate as a collar, protecting the sterling value of 
US$85 million of the Group’s forecast management fee revenue 
cash flows for 2010/11 from being impacted by currency 
movements outside the contracted ranges. The options have been 
marked-to-market at the year-end rate of GBP1:1.49USD. Lower 
levels of hedging transactions were undertaken in the year as a 
result of the less attractive GBP/USD rates available compared 
with those forecast.
As designated hedges the mark-to-market movement in the 
value of the options will be taken through reserves, until such 
time as they and the associated hedged revenues mature, so 
long as the hedges are assessed as being effective. If assessed 
as ineffective, the mark-to-market of the options will be taken 
through the income statement.
Dividend
In recognition of the financial performance during the period, and 
our confidence in the Group’s future prospects, the Directors are 
recommending a final dividend of 9.34 pence per share for the 
year ended 30 June 2010 which, subject to shareholder approval, 
will be paid on 5 December 2010 to all shareholders who are on 
the register on 3 November 2010. 
An interim dividend for the six-month period to 31 December 
2009 of 3.66 pence (FY2008/09: 3.66 pence) was paid on 1 April 
2010. Together, these result in a full-year dividend of 13.0 pence 
(FY2008/09: 12.0 pence), an increase of 8.3%. 24

Regulatory capital
As a UK listed asset management 
group, Ashmore is subject to regulatory 
supervision by the Financial Services 
Authority (FSA) under the Prudential 
Sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies 
and Investment Firms. The Group has one 
UK-regulated entity, Ashmore Investment 
Management Limited (AIML), on behalf 
of which half-yearly capital adequacy 
returns are filed. AIML held surplus capital 
resources relative to its requirements at all 
times during the period under review.
Further, since 1 January 2007, the 
Group has been subject to consolidated 
regulatory capital requirements, whereby 
the Board is required to assess the degree 
of risk across the Group’s business, and 
hold sufficient capital against these.
The Board has assessed the amount 
of capital required to cover such risks as 
£65.0 million. Thus, given the considerable 
balance sheet resources available to the 
Group, the Board is satisfied that the 
Group is adequately capitalised to continue 
its operations effectively. 
Further information regarding the 
Group’s capital adequacy status can be 
found in the Group’s Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and 
Pillar III disclosures, which are available on 
our website at www.ashmoregroup.com
During the year the Group’s risk 
control framework has been enhanced to 
take account of changing business and 
market conditions. This included reviews 
conducted by the Group’s Internal Audit 
function which was established during the 
year. There has also been specific focus on 
the further refinement of the Group risk 
matrix, which seeks to identify the key risks 
to the Group, as well as current mitigants 
and forward-looking action plans.
Business review

Risk
Risk is inherent in all businesses and is 
therefore present within the Group’s 
activities. The Group seeks to effectively 
identify, monitor and manage each 
of its risks and actively promotes a 
risk awareness culture throughout the 
organisation. The ultimate responsibility 
for risk management rests with the Board. 
However, from a practical perspective 
some of this activity is delegated.
The key risks, their mitigants, and 
their delegated owners are set out on 
the facing page for each of the four 
risk categories that Ashmore considers 
most important: strategic and business, 
investment, operational, and treasury – 
with reputational risk being a common 
characteristic across all four categories.
Risk management and control
Risk management and control is one 
element of the Group’s overall system 
of internal controls within its corporate 
governance framework – incorporating 
Risk, Compliance and Internal Audit. 
Further details of the Group’s internal 
control environment are described in the 
Corporate governance report on pages 38 
and 39.

Key risks and mitigants
Risk type/owner Description of risk Mitigation
Strategic and business risks
The risk that the medium and 
long-term profitability of the 
Group could be adversely 
impacted by the failure to 
identify and implement the 
correct strategy, and to react 
smartly to changes in the 
business environment.
Delegated to:
Ashmore Group plc Board
These include:
 > A long-term downturn in the 
fundamental and technical 
dynamics of emerging markets.
 > Reputational damage to Ashmore 
impacting marketing and 
distribution capabilities.
 > Market capacity issues constrain 
growth.
These include:
 > Board’s long investment management experience.
 > Clearly defined Group strategy, understood throughout the 
organisation and actively monitored.
 > Diversification of investment capabilities to reduce single event/
product exposure.
 > Committee-based investment methodology creates a scalable 
business model.
Investment risks
The risk that long-term 
investment outperformance is 
not delivered and/or manager 
non-performance, damaging 
prospects for winning and 
retaining clients, and putting 
average management fee 
margins under pressure.
Delegated to:
Ashmore Group Investment 
Committee
These include:
 > A downturn in investment 
performance.
 > Inadequate due diligence on an 
investment/deal.
 > Lack of financing, or an exit 
strategy for privately held 
investments.
 > Limited number of counterparties 
which may restrict access to market 
liquidity.
These include:
 > Experienced Investment Committee (IC) meets weekly ensuring 
consistent core investment processes are applied.
 > Dedicated emerging markets research and investment focus, 
with frequent country visits.
 > Dedicated investment teams with expertise centred around 
structuring of special situations deals.
 > Strong professional relationships developed with major 
counterparties over the years.
 > Compensation structure links investment professionals’ 
remuneration to long-term performance of funds they manage, 
and the wider Group.
Operational risks
Risks in this category are broad 
in nature and inherent in all 
businesses. They include the 
risk that operational flaws 
result in business losses –

In May 2010 the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) published a new edition of 
the Combined Code (the Code) which 
will apply to financial years beginning 
on or after 29 June 2010. Although 
provision B.7.1 of the Code applies to 
the first annual general meeting falling 
after the first accounting period to which 
the revised Code applies, the Board of 
Ashmore will nevertheless be adopting this 
provision immediately and the Directors 
will therefore retire and seek re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting on 
28 October 2010.
Details of the constitution and 
powers of the Board and its committees 
are set out in the Corporate governance 
report on pages 36 to 37. The Corporate 
governance report also summarises the 
Company’s rules concerning appointment 
and replacement of directors.
Directors’ conflicts of interests
Since October 2008, the Companies Act 
2006 has imposed upon directors a new 
statutory duty to avoid unauthorised 
conflicts of interest with the Company. 
The Company has adopted revisions to 
its Articles of Association which enable 
Directors to approve conflicts of interest 
and which also include other conflict 
of interest provisions. The Company 
has implemented processes to identify 
potential and actual conflicts of interest. 
Such conflicts are then considered for 
approval by the Board, subject, where 
necessary, to appropriate conditions.
Executive Directors do not presently 
hold any external appointments with any 
non-Ashmore-related companies. 
Directors’ share interests
The interests of Directors in the Company’s 
shares and in options over the Company’s 
shares are shown on page 48 within the 
Remuneration report.
Directors’ report

Restrictions on transfer of shares
Employees of the Company who held

held options in respect of ordinary shares 
at the time of Admission were, subject to 
certain exceptions, restricted by lock-in 
arrangements from selling, pledging or 
otherwise disposing of their holding of or 
options in respect of such shares at the 
time immediately following Admission 
(“Lock-in Shares”). These restrictions came 
to an end in September 2009 and, save 
as described below, no other restrictions 
now exist.
Dealings in the Company’s ordinary 
shares by persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities, employees of the Company 
and, in each case, their connected persons, 
are subject to the Group’s Dealing Code 
which adopts the Model Code of the 
Listing Rules contained in the Financial 
Services Authority’s Handbook.
Certain restrictions, customary for a 
listed company, apply to transfers of shares 
in the Company. 
The Board may, in its absolute 
discretion, decline to register any transfer 
of a share which is not fully paid or where 
there are more than four joint holders. 
In the case of certificated shares, 
registration of a transfer may also be 
refused where (i) the instrument of transfer 
is not duly stamped (unless exempt from 
stamping); (ii) insufficient evidence of title 
is produced in respect of a transfer; and 
(iii) the transferor has been served with a 
restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) 
after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Acts, unless the transfer is 
shown to the Board to be pursuant to an 
arm’s length sale. Registration of a transfer 
of shares may be refused in the case of 
uncertificated shares in the circumstances 
set out in the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations (as defined in the Articles).

Power to issue and allot shares
The Directors are generally and 
unconditionally authorised to allot 
unissued shares in the Company up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £23,451.89

A further authority has been granted 
to the Directors to allot the Company’s 
shares for cash, up to a maximum nominal 
amount of £3,540.00, without regard 
to the pre-emption provisions of the

issued or allotted under these authorities, 
nor is there any current intention to do 
so, other than to satisfy outstanding 
obligations under the employee share 
schemes where necessary.
These authorities are valid until the 
date of the next Annual General Meeting. 
A resolution for the renewal of such 
authorities will be proposed at the 2010 
Annual General Meeting.
Amendment of Articles of 
Association
Any amendments to the Articles of the 
Company may be made in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies 
Acts by way of a special resolution of the

resolution recommending a number of 
amendments to the Articles to bring them 
into line with best practice. 
Employees
Details of the Company’s employment 
practices (including the employment of 
disabled persons) can be found in the 
Corporate governance report on page 34.
Carey Pensions and Benefits Limited 
as trustee of the Ashmore 2004 Employee 
Benefit Trust (EBT) has discretion as to 
the exercise of voting rights over shares 
which it holds in respect of employee 
share options that have not vested and 
other restricted share awards. The current 
arrangement is that the EBT considers the 
Company’s recommendation(s) before 
voting such shares at a general meeting of 
the Company, subject to an overriding duty 
to act in the interests of the EBT. 
Corporate governance
The Company is governed according to 
the applicable provisions of company 
law and by the Company’s Articles. As a 
listed company, the Company must also 
comply with the Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules issued 
by the United Kingdom Listing Authority 
(UKLA). Listed companies are expected to 
comply as far as possible with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance, and to state how 
its principles have been applied. A report 
on corporate governance and compliance 
with the provisions of the Combined Code 
is set out on pages 34 to 39. 
Charitable and political 
contributions
During the year, the Group made charitable

Foundation is described on page 40 in the 
Corporate social responsibility section of 
this report. It is the Group’s policy not to

of payment and to make payment in 
accordance with those terms subject to 
receipt of satisfactory invoicing. Unless 
otherwise agreed payments to creditors 
are made within 30 days of receipt of an 
invoice. At 30 June 2010, the amount 
owed to the Group’s trade creditors 
in the UK represented approximately 
30 days’ average purchases from suppliers 
(FY2008/09: 30 days).
Auditors and the disclosure of 
information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date 
of approval of this Directors’ report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware, and each 
Director has taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as directors to make 
himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information.
Resolutions will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting to reappoint 
KPMG Audit Plc as auditors and to 
authorise the Directors to agree their 
remuneration. Note 6 to the financial 
statements sets out details of the auditors’ 
remuneration.
2010 Annual General Meeting

are given in the separate circular and 
Notice of Meeting.
Going concern
The Company and Group have 
considerable financial resources and 
the Directors believe that both are well 
placed to manage their business risks 
successfully. Further information regarding 
the Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position is 
set out on pages 12 to 27.
After making enquiries, the Directors 
are satisfied that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to 
continue to operate for the foreseeable 
future and confirm that the Company and 
the Group are going concerns. For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing these financial 
statements.

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent Company 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and parent Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 > make judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU; and
 > prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the parent 
Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group and parent 
Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ 
Remuneration report and Corporate 
governance statement that comply with 
that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the 
Directors in respect of the annual 
financial report
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
 > the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
 > the Directors’ report includes a 
fair review of the development 
and performance of the business 
and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
The Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance 2008 (“the 2008 Code”) 
applies to listed companies with reporting 
years beginning on or after 29 June 2008. 
The Company adopted the principles of the 
predecessor 2006 Code from its admission 
to listing on the London Stock Exchange 
on 17 October 2006 (“Admission”) 
and the principles of the 2008 Code 
thereafter. In May 2010 the FRC published 
a new edition of the Code (“the 2010 
Code”) which will apply to financial years 
beginning on or after 29 June 2010, the 
provisions of which will accordingly not 
apply until the Company’s next financial 
year. The Company nevertheless intends 
to adopt the 2010 Code with immediate 
effect. Reference herein to the “Combined 
Code” means the 2006, 2008 and 2010 
Codes, as applicable. 
The Company has been in compliance 
with the Combined Code since Admission, 
except where the Directors consider 
that in particular limited circumstances 
departure may be justified and explained. 
No departures from the Combined Code 
occurred during the year under review.
This report describes the Company’s 
corporate governance arrangements, 
explaining how it has applied the principles 
of the Combined Code.
The Company’s corporate governance 
structure detailed further in this report is

Directors
The Board of Directors comprises two 
executive Directors and four non-executive 
Directors. The two executive Directors are 
Mark Coombs, the Chief Executive Officer, 
and Graeme Dell, the Group Finance 
Director. The non-executive Directors are 
Michael Benson, Chairman, Nick Land, 
Senior Independent Director, Jonathan 
Asquith and Melda Donnelly. All Directors 
served throughout the year. 
The Board has a schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decision 
and approval, which include, but are not 
limited to:
 > the Group’s long-term commercial 
objectives and strategy;
 > major acquisitions, disposals and 
investments;
 > the Group’s annual and interim reports 
and financial statements;
 > interim dividend and recommendation 
of final dividend;
 > annual budgets and forecast updates;
 > significant capital expenditure; and
 > effectiveness of internal controls. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer are separate, clearly 
defined and have been approved by the 
Board. The Chairman is responsible for the 
effective conduct of the Board, while the 
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for 
execution of strategy and for the day-to-
day management of the Group. 
In considering non-executive director 
independence, the Board has taken into 
consideration the guidance provided 
by the Combined Code. The Board 
considers Michael Benson, Nick Land, 
Jonathan Asquith and Melda Donnelly to 
be independent. Nick Land is the Senior 
Independent Director.
During the year under review the 
Group complied with the Combined Code 
requirement that at least half of the Board 
consist of independent directors (excluding 
the Chairman).
Biographical details of the Directors 
are given on page 29.
The Board met six times during the 
year to review financial performance and 
strategy and to follow the formal schedule 
of matters reserved for its decision. 
Comprehensive Board papers, comprising 
an agenda and formal reports and briefing 
papers, are sent to Directors in advance of 
each meeting. Throughout their period in 
office, Directors are continually updated 
by means of written and oral reports from 
senior executives and external advisors on 
the Group’s business, and the competitive 
and regulatory environments in which it 
operates, as well as on legal, corporate 
governance, corporate social responsibility 
and other relevant matters. Overview

Annual report and accounts 2010
In addition to its formal business, 
the Board received a number of briefings 
and presentations from executive 
management during the year covering a 
wide range of topics across the range of 
the Group’s business. All Directors have 
access to independent professional advice, 
if required, at the Company’s expense, 
as well as to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary. New Directors 
appointed to the Board will receive 
advice as to the legal and other duties 
and obligations arising from the role of 
a director of a UK listed company within 
a full, formal and tailored induction 
programme. The Company Secretary, 
under the direction of the Chairman, 
is responsible for maintaining an adequate 
continuing education programme, 
reminding the directors of their duties and 
obligations on a regular basis, ensuring 
good information flows between the 
Board, its committees and management 
and assisting with Directors’ continuing 
professional development needs. 
The Company’s nominations 
committee considers the appointment and 
replacement of directors subject to the 
rules set out in the Articles, a summary of 
which is set out below. 
Under the Articles, the minimum 
number of Directors shall be two and the 
maximum shall be nine. Directors may be 
appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. A Director 
appointed by the Board must offer himself 
for election at the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company following his 
appointment but he is not taken into 
account in determining the Directors 
or the number of Directors who are to 
retire by rotation at that meeting. The 
Directors to retire by rotation must be 
those who held office at the time of the 
two preceding Annual General Meetings 
and did not retire at either of them, or if 
they have held office with the Company 
for a continuous period of nine years or 
more at the date of the Annual General 
Meeting. The office of Director shall be 
vacated in other circumstances, including 
where (i) that Director resigns or is asked to 
resign; (ii) they are or have been suffering 
from mental ill health; (iii) they are absent 
without permission of the Board from 
meetings of the Board for six consecutive 
months; (iv) they become bankrupt or 
compound with their creditors generally; 
or (v) they are prohibited by law from 
being a Director. Notwithstanding these 
provisions the Board will be immediately 
adopting provision B.7.1 of the 2010 Code  
and the Directors will therefore all retire 
and seek re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting on 28 October 2010. 
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles, the 
Companies Acts and any directions given 
by the Company by special resolution, the 
business of the Company is managed by 
the Board, who may exercise all powers 
of the Company, whether relating to 
the management of the business of the 
Company or not.
Annual performance evaluation
The Board has established a formal 
process, led by the Chairman and assisted 
by the Company Secretary, for the annual 
evaluation of the performance of the 
Board, its appointed committees and each 
Director, to ensure that they continue to 
act effectively and efficiently and to fulfil 
their respective duties, and to identify 
any training requirements. In doing so 
the Board has concluded that both the 
Board and its committees are functioning 
effectively.
Meetings were held between the 
Chairman and each individual Director in 
which issues and developments over the 
year were discussed and performance 
was considered by reference to the 
objectives of the Board and its committees. 
Each Director also completed a formal 
questionnaire and responses were collated 
by the Company Secretary. The results 
and issues raised were subsequently 
discussed by the Board together with 
progress against last year’s evaluation. 
The Board also evaluated the Chairman’s 
performance. 36

Relations with shareholders
The Company places great importance on 
communication with its investors and aims 
to keep shareholders informed by means 
of regular communication with institutional 
shareholders, analysts and the financial 
press throughout the year. 
Annual and interim reports and 
trading updates are widely distributed to 
other parties who may have an interest 
in the Group’s performance. These 
documents are also made available 
on the Company’s website where 
formal Regulatory Information Service 
announcements are also posted. The 
Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance 
Director make regular reports to the 
Board on investor relations and on specific 
discussions with major shareholders and 
the Board receives copies of all research 
published on the Company. 
The 2010 Annual General Meeting 
will be attended by all Directors, and the 
Chairmen of the audit, nominations and 
remuneration committees will be available 
to answer questions. Private investors are 
encouraged to attend the Annual General 
Meeting.
The Senior Independent Director 
is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which contact through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer or Group Finance Director 
has failed to resolve or for which such 
contact is inappropriate. The Company 
continues to offer major shareholders 
the opportunity to meet any or all of the 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Director 
and any new Directors. 
The Group will announce via a 
Regulatory Information Service the number 
of proxy votes cast on resolutions at the 
Annual General Meeting and any other 
general meetings.
Internal control and risk 
management
In accordance with the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2010, the Board is ultimately responsible 
for the Group’s risk management and  38
Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
internal control systems and for reviewing 
their effectiveness. Such systems and their 
review are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Within the Group’s over arching 
corporate governance framework, through 
which the Board aims to maintain full and 
effective control over appropriate strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance 
issues, an internal control framework 
has been established, against which the 
Company is able to assess the effectiveness 
of its risk management and internal control 
systems. The Group’s system of internal 
control is embedded within its routine 
operations, and a strong control culture 
is combined with clear management 
responsibility and accountabilities for 
individual control. The internal control 
framework provides an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the Group’s significant risks, and has 
been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the 
annual report and accounts. The process 
is regularly reviewed by the Board, and 
accords with the guidance in the document 
Internal Control: Revised Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code, October 
2005 (“Turnbull Guidance”) published by 
the Financial Reporting Council.
The executive Directors oversee 
the key risks and controls and the risk 
management process on a day-to-
day basis, and have put in place an 
organisational structure with clearly 
defined lines of responsibility and 
delegation of authority. 
The Group’s risk and compliance 
committee (RCC) which meets monthly, 
is responsible for maintaining a sound 
risk management and internal control 
environment and for assessing the impact 
of the Group’s ongoing activities on its 
regulatory and operational exposures. 
The RCC is chaired by the Head of Risk 
Management and Control – the other 
members are the Chief Executive, the 
Group Finance Director, the Head of 
Operations, the Head of Compliance, the 
Head of Information Technology, the Head 
of Legal and Transaction Management 
and the Group Financial Controller. 
Responsibility for risk identification is 
shared amongst these senior management 
personnel, with each such individual being 
responsible for day-to-day control of risk in 
their business area.
There are established policies and 
procedures to enable the Board, through 
its regular meetings, to monitor the 
effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control systems which cover all 
significant identified internal and external 
strategic, operational, financial, compliance 
and other risks, including the Group’s 
ability to comply with all applicable laws, 
regulations and clients’ requirements. 
The Board has continued to receive 
regular financial and other management 
information related to the control of 
expenditure against budget and the 
making of investments, and for monitoring 
the Group’s business and its performance, 
and regular compliance and risk reports. 
Through the audit committee, the 
Board has conducted an annual review 
and assessment of the effectiveness of 
the risk management and internal control 
systems, and has identified no significant 
failings or weaknesses during this review. 
In conducting this review, the Board has 
considered the periodic reports received 
throughout the year on compliance and 
risk matters, including reports provided 
by the Internal Audit function, and the 
annual report on risk management and 
internal control processes from the risk 
and compliance committee. The Board is 
satisfied that appropriate planned actions 
continue to be effective in improving 
controls as the Group develops, and 
its overall assessment of the control 
framework continues to be satisfactory.
The main features of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
are as follows:
Policies
 > core values and policies together 
comprising the Group’s high-level 
principles and controls, with which all 
staff are expected to comply;
 > manuals of policies and procedures, 
applicable to all business units, with 
procedures for reporting weaknesses 
and for monitoring corrective action;
 > a code of business conduct, with 
procedures for reporting compliance 
therewith;
 > a defined operational framework 
and organisational structure with 
appropriate delegation of authority 
with accountability that has regard to 
acceptable levels of risk.
Processes
 > a planning framework is maintained, 
which incorporates a Board-approved 
strategic plan, with objectives for each 
business unit;
 > regular business reviews of the 
Company and its subsidiaries are 
performed by senior management, 
which consider the ongoing effects of 
change and the short-, medium- and 
long-term operational requirements;
 > quarterly senior management systems 
and controls reviews are undertaken 
by the Group Finance Director with 
the Head of Compliance, and Head of 
Risk Management and Control (from 
June 2010) in which the Chief Executive 
Officer participates at least annually, 
which include evaluation of the potential 
impact and likelihood of identified risks 
and possible new risk areas;
 > a matrix of top risks identifies key 
business, operational, financial and 
compliance risks, and considers the 
likelihood of those risks crystallising 
and the resultant impact. The inherent 
risk within each business activity has 
been identified, with the adequacy and 
mitigating effect of existing processes 
being assessed to determine a current 
residual risk level for each such activity. 
On the basis that further mitigants may 
be employed over time, a target residual 
risk for each activity after one to two 
years has been defined;

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
The Group recognises the importance 
of corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
incorporating transparency, fairness, 
accountability and integrity, and believes 
that these principles are fundamental 
to the Group’s operations. The Group 
continues to monitor developments 
in all relevant areas of CSR, including 
environmental management, employees, 
health and safety, suppliers and the 
community to ensure that it meets best 
practice and sees CSR as a continually 
evolving process. 
Investment
The Group believes that its reputation 
as an ethical, trustworthy provider of 
investment services is essential to its 
core purpose of helping its clients to 
build their financial security. Ashmore 
seeks to establish and maintain long-
term relationships with its clients and 
intermediaries. The Group believes this 
to be a fundamental pre-requisite for the 
growth of the business. 
Ashmore’s Board of Directors seeks 
to maintain a strong corporate culture 
employing high standards of integrity 
and fair dealing in the conduct of the 
firm’s activities, compliance with both the 
letter and the spirit of relevant laws and 
regulations, and standards of good market 
practice in all jurisdictions where the firm’s 
business is carried out. The Board’s aim is 
to enable Ashmore to demonstrate that 
the firm is fit and proper to undertake 
its business, to safeguard the legitimate 
interests of Ashmore clients and protect 
Ashmore’s reputation.
Social, ethical and environmental (SEE) 
criteria tend to be focused primarily on 
equity investing because of the influence 
which shareholder interests are able to 
exert on the management of a particular 
company. Ashmore’s exposure to equity 
investments amounts to less than 15 per 
cent of total assets under management, 
whereas the majority of assets are invested 
in either external debt (the majority of 
which is sovereign) or local currency and 
local currency debt. In the case of external 
debt investments, the Group’s ability to 
have an influence is generally limited to a 
decision whether or not to invest; however, 
at a country level. Ashmore believes that it 
may be able to exert an influence through 
dialogue with governments and central 
banks. 
Corporate social responsibility
Ashmore’s public equities business is 
a small part of its overall business and 
its shareholdings are unlikely ever to be 
large enough to have an influence over 
the policies of management in these 
companies. 
Ashmore’s special situations business 
involves its funds taking significant 
controlling stakes in investee companies 
and in such circumstances Ashmore is 
in a position to positively engage with 
the management of these companies. 
In many cases Ashmore believes it to be 
beneficial to its investors to be proactive in 
promoting the Ashmore brand locally by 
improving the livelihoods of the employees 
in the companies where the Group has a 
controlling stake.
Ashmore aims to avoid investing in 
companies that do not:
 > respect human rights; and
 > comply with local environmental, ethical 
or social legislation.
Ashmore does not invest in companies 
that manufacture or trade arms.
Ashmore also aims to ensure that 
any investments which it makes comply 
with the relevant industry standards and 
best practice, treat their employees fairly, 
have active community programmes and 
operate with sensitivity to the environment. 
Ashmore has made investments 
in a number of renewable energy 
projects in different countries including 
hydro-electricity, geothermal energy and 
sugar-based ethanol production, which 
reflects its overall approach to combining 
ethical investing with sound business 
practice on behalf of clients. 
Additionally, Ashmore funds and 
segregated accounts each have a specific 
investment mandate which sets out 
the parameters for investment which 
may include requirements to screen for 
geographic, sector and stock-specific 
restrictions. Stock-specific restrictions may 
include securities which meet clients’ own 
CSR criteria. 
The Ashmore Foundation
Consistent with the Group’s commitment 
to responsible corporate citizenship, the 
Ashmore Foundation was created in 
2008 and is funded by personal financial 
contributions from employees of the 
Group. The Foundation reflects Ashmore’s 
overall philosophy that it can make a 
difference and seeks to provide financial 
grants to worthwhile causes within the 
emerging markets in which Ashmore 
operates with a view to putting something 
back into the countries and communities 
in which it invests and which contribute 
to Ashmore’s income and profitability. 
The Foundation’s grant-making policy is 
wide-ranging but has a particular focus 
on education and healthcare, the former 
in particular being seen as the best way 
to help the long-term self-development of 
emerging market countries.
Employees
At year end Ashmore employed 
165 people in ten countries worldwide. 
Ashmore’s people have always been its 
most important asset, at the heart of 
everything it does. Ashmore has many 
talented people and it remains a priority 
to develop, manage and retain this talent 
in order to deliver the potential of the 
organisation. Ashmore wants to be an 
employer which the most talented people 
aspire to join wherever it operates.
Ashmore seeks to ensure that its 
workforce reflects, as far as practicable, 
the diversity of the many communities 
in which it is located. Ashmore also 
recognises the diverse needs of its 
employees in managing the responsibilities 
of their work and personal lives, and 
believes that achieving an effective balance 
in these areas is beneficial to both the 
Company and the individual. 
Ashmore encourages employees to 
act ethically and to clearly uphold the 
standards of practice which its clients have 
come to expect. It also means ensuring 
that its employees understand the strategic 
aims and objectives of the Group and are 
clear about their role in achieving them.
The Group recognises that the 
involvement of its employees is key to the 
future success of the business and adopts 
a practice of keeping employees informed 
on significant matters affecting them, 
via email and in meetings arranged for 
the purpose. The Group has consistently 
operated a remuneration strategy that 
recognises both corporate and individual 
performance. Overview

The Group is also committed to 
following good practice in employment 
matters, recognising the part this plays 
in attracting and retaining staff. The 
Group promotes the importance of high 
ethical standards to all employees and 
staff have the opportunity to voice any 
concerns they may have, either direct with 
management or on a confidential basis via 
the whistle-blowing process.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to ensuring that 
all employees are treated fairly and with 
dignity and respect. This commitment is 
reflected in the Staff Handbook that all 
employees receive on joining. 
The policies and practices in place 
within the Group to deter acts of 
harassment and discrimination are regularly 
monitored. 
It is the Group’s policy that 
no employee shall be treated less 
favourably on the grounds of their age, 
sex, sexual orientation, race, religion, 
nationality or marital status or on the 
grounds of disability. This policy applies, 
without limitation, to promotion, 
training, placement, transfer, dismissal, 
remuneration, grievance and disciplinary 
procedures and decisions. This policy 
also applies to persons from outside the 
workplace and the treatment of contract 
workers.
Health and safety
The Group has in place a global health and 
safety policy which can be accessed by 
all staff via an internal database. The aim 
of this policy is to provide both staff and 
visitors with a safe and healthy working 
environment. The Group is committed to 
adhering to the high standards of health 
and safety set out in its policies and 
procedures and to providing training as 
necessary.
Environment
As an investment manager, Ashmore has a 
limited direct impact upon the environment 
and there are few environmental risks 
associated with the Group’s activities. 
Ashmore moved into its premises at 
61 Aldwych, London in May 2008 and 
occupies a single floor of approximately 
19,000 square feet in a nine-storey 
multi-tenanted building. Water and gas 
supplied into the building are metered 
centrally by the building management and 
costs apportioned to each tenant pro rata 
according to floor occupancy.
As part of its ongoing commitment 
to the environment, Ashmore throughout 
its operations has adopted policies 
and programmes to promote energy 
conservation and the avoidance of waste 
through a number of initiatives, such as the 
recycling of paper, glass and other waste 
and the use of “green” energy. Electricity 
usage is separately monitored by floor 
with renewable energy accounting for a 
minimum of 10 per cent of supply. Energy-
efficient lighting is installed in the building 
with sensors which turn lights off when no 
movement is detected. The building has 
received an Energy Performance Certificate 
with an Asset Rating of 98. Utilities are not 
monitored by the building management in 
terms of carbon emissions as no accurate 
data is available on the consumptive 
quality of each item. The registration and 
reporting obligations under the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy 
Efficient Scheme do not apply to the 
Company.
Ashmore endeavours to make 
maximum use of available technology 
such as video conferencing; however, 
its business model as an investor in 
emerging markets inevitably requires that 
its investment professionals and other 
members of staff travel frequently to 
these countries to assess and monitor 
opportunities. During 2009/10, our 
monitored staff air travel usage amounted 
to a total of 7.1 million kilometres 
(FY2008/09: 6.8 million kilometres). 
Using the DEFRA guidelines for company 
reporting on greenhouse gas emissions 
we have calculated that this amounted 
to 1,739.74 tonnes of CO2 (FY2008/09: 
1,722.77 tonnes of CO2). 
Ashmore has published a separate 
Corporate responsibility report 
which can be found on its website at

Annual report and accounts 2010
Report from the Chairman of 
the audit committee
The composition and summary terms of 
reference of the audit committee are set 
out on page 36.
The principal activities of the audit 
committee through the year were as 
follows:
Financial statements 
The audit committee reviewed the 2010 
annual report, interim results, preliminary 
results and reports from the external 
auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, on the outcome 
of their reviews and audits in 2010.
External auditors 
The committee met with the external 
auditors during the year to review the 
scope of their audit and findings thereon 
for the interim and year-end financial 
statements.
The committee received a 
comprehensive presentation from the 
auditors demonstrating to its satisfaction 
how their independence and objectivity 
is maintained when providing non-audit 
services. 
The committee has agreed the types 
of permitted and non-permitted service 
and those which require explicit prior 
approval. All contracts for non-audit 
services in excess of £25,000 must be 
notified to the Chairman of the audit 
committee and approved by him. 
During the year the value of non-audit 
services provided by KPMG amounted 
to £0.4 million (FY2009: £0.5 million). 
The range of permitted non-audit services 
included the provision of tax compliance 
services, acting as reporting accountant in 
appropriate circumstances provided there 
is no element of valuation work involved, 
and reports on internal controls as required 
under SAS 70 pursuant to investment 
management industry standards. The 
provision of tax advisory services, due 
diligence/transaction services and litigation 
services may be permitted with the 
committee’s prior approval. The provision 
of internal audit services, valuation work 
and any other activity that may give rise 
to any possibility of self-review are not 
permitted under any circumstance. During 
the year there were no circumstances 
where KPMG were engaged to provide 
services which might have led to a conflict 
of interests. 
The committee is satisfied that the 
external auditors remain independent 
and recommended to the Board that a 
resolution be put to shareholders for the 
reappointment of the auditors, and their 
remuneration and terms of engagement, 
at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company.
From time to time during the year 
the non-executives met with the external 
and internal auditors without the executive 
Directors being present so as to provide a 
forum to raise any matters of concern in 
confidence.
Internal controls and risk 
management
The committee reviewed and evaluated 
the system of internal controls and 
risk management operated within the 
Company. 
Further details can be found on pages 
26 and 27 and 38 and 39.
Internal audit
Ernst & Young were appointed as internal 
auditors effective 1 July 2009 reporting 
directly to the committee. The committee 
has received regular reports on its findings 
and programme of reviews at each of 
its meetings during the course of the 
year. Further details can be found in the 
Internal control section of the Corporate 
governance report on pages 38 and 39. 
Audit committee effectiveness
The members of the committee conducted 
a review of its effectiveness and concluded 
that it was working effectively.

Annual report and accounts 2010
Remuneration report
Unaudited information
Introduction
This report has been prepared on behalf of 
the Board in accordance with Schedule 8 
to the Large and Medium Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 and the Combined Code 
2008 (the 2008 Code). This report sets 
out the Company’s remuneration policy 
and gives details of the compensation of 
Directors for the year ended 30 June 2010.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises 
three non-executive Directors. Throughout 
the year Jonathan Asquith served as 
Chairman with Michael Benson and 
Nick Land as members. 
The remuneration committee meets 
as often as required to discharge its 
duties and met four times during the 
period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. 
Details of attendance at all meetings 
for the financial year under review are 
contained in the table on page 36 of 
the Corporate governance report. The 
Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance 
Director, Company Secretary and the 
Head of Human Resources attended all 
or part of the meetings at the invitation 
of the remuneration committee but took 
no part in the determination of their own 
remuneration.
The primary role of the remuneration 
committee is to make recommendations to 
the Board as to the Company’s framework 
or broad policy for the remuneration of the 
Chairman, the executive Directors of the 
Board and the Company Secretary, as well 
as decide on total individual remuneration 
packages for these positions. 
Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the Company’s 
remuneration policy are to ensure that:
 > levels of remuneration are relative to 
the Company’s market and sufficient to 
attract and retain executive Directors of 
the quality required to run the Company 
successfully;
 > the executive Directors and the Company 
Secretary receive sufficient incentives to 
motivate enhanced performance; 
 > executive Directors and the Company 
Secretary are fairly rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the Company’s 
overall performance; and 
 > effective risk management is promoted 
and encouraged by executive Directors 
and the Company Secretary.
In determining this policy, the 
remuneration committee takes into 
account a broad range of factors including 
the interests of the shareholders and the 
financial and commercial health of the 
Company. 
In addition, the Heads of Risk and 
Compliance actively contribute to the 
annual reviews of all employees, and their 
feedback is taken into consideration when 
determining employee remuneration.
The terms of reference of 
the remuneration committee are 
available on the Company website at 
www.ashmoregroup.com
Advisors
The remuneration committee was advised, 
when considered appropriate, by Mercer 
Limited until 1 January 2010 and by 
Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name 
of Hewitt Associates Limited) from that 
date on. The Company participates in the 
McLagan Partners compensation survey 
from which relevant data is provided to the 
remuneration committee.
Neither of the above has any 
connection with the Company other than 
providing compensation advice and/or 
information.
Service agreements
Each executive Director has entered into a 
service agreement with the Company. The 
service agreements do not have a fixed 
term but include provisions for termination 
on 12 months’ notice by either party. 
Service agreements contain no contractual 
entitlement to receive bonus payments 
or to participate in the Company’s share 
plans. Participation in these arrangements 
is discretionary and subject to approval by 
the remuneration committee.
Non-executive Directors are appointed 
for an initial three-year period. Their 
continued engagement is subject to the 
requirements of the Company’s Articles 
relating to the retirement of Directors by 
rotation.
The Company has maintained 
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
cover throughout the period.
The table below provides details of the Directors’ service agreements/letters of appointment for current Directors and Directors who 
served during the year.

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Executive Directors are permitted to 
serve as non-executive Directors of other 
companies where there is no competition 
to the Company’s business activities and 
where these duties do not interfere with 
the individual’s ability to perform his duties 
for the Company. In the reporting year 
neither Mark Coombs nor Graeme Dell 
held any non-executive Directorships. 
There are no provisions for 
compensation of executive Directors on 
early termination save as described below:
(a)   the contracts for Mr Coombs and 
Mr Dell contain provisions entitling the 
Company to terminate employment 
without notice subject to making 
12 monthly payments thereafter 
equivalent to monthly basic pay and 
benefits; and
(b)   all Directors’ contracts entitle the 
Company to give pay in lieu of notice.
Executive remuneration 
components
The Company rewards exceptional 
performance and so emphasises the 
variable components of the remuneration 
package.
The pay model adopted for the 
executive Directors is similar to that of 
employees more generally within the 
Group. All employees are subject to 
the same set salary cap and participate 
in a Group-wide bonus pool. Since 
performance related pay is based on the 
principle of profit sharing, all employees 
share in the success of the business with 
remuneration rising and falling as a result 
of Group profit performance. The extent 
that each individual shares in the actual 
profit of the Group varies by individual 
performance and the role undertaken 
within the business. Part of individual’s 
bonuses are deferred for a period of 
5 years for the majority of employees 
through participation in the Company’s 
long-term incentive plans.
Fixed compensation
Fixed compensation components comprise 
basic salary and benefits in kind. Basic 
salaries are capped, as it is the Company’s 
policy to maintain its fixed cost base at a 
low level.
Periodic reviews are undertaken in 
terms of an appropriate level at which 
to cap maximum annual salary. Both the 
Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance 
Director earn a basic salary of £100,000. 
There have been no increases to their base 
salary levels during the year under review.
Variable compensation
The Company’s discretionary variable 
compensation provides for both an annual 
cash bonus, which is non-pensionable, 
and deferred share awards. The total 
variable compensation is determined by 
reference to the individual’s performance 
against agreed criteria, the profitability of 
the Company and the external market. 
Performance criteria are established 
appropriate to the individual’s role, to 
include such measures as growth in assets 
under management (AuM) and profitability 
where appropriate and other key areas of 
individual performance.
The Company’s intention is to pay 
to members of staff an amount in total 
of up to 25% of earnings before variable 
compensation, interest and tax (EBVCIT) in 
respect of its total variable compensation 
comprising cash bonus, including social 
security obligations thereon, and share-
based payments, including fair value and 
social security costs in this respect. For the 
financial year ending 30 June 2010 the 
provision for variable compensation is at 
18% of EBVCIT. In view of the stringent 
salary controls which the Group operates 
the remuneration committee does not 
consider it necessary or appropriate to set 
a cap on individual discretionary bonus 
awards, although such awards will be 
made within the overall provision for 
variable compensation as set out above.
40% of any discretionary variable 
compensation earned by executive 
Directors is received in the form of a 
restricted share award (at the prevailing 
share price without enhancement) which 
is deferred and cliff vests after a period of 
five years subject to achieving a relative 
total shareholder return performance 
target. In addition, the opportunity exists 
to commute up to 50% of the annual cash 
bonus earned into the Company’s shares 
(also at the prevailing share price without 
enhancement). If a deferral of bonus is 
voluntarily elected, the deferral period 
is also five years with deferred shares 
then subject to a matching award that 
is currently of equal value to the bonus 
deferred. Matching awards are subject 
to the same relative total shareholder 
return performance condition. Full details 
of restricted share awards, matching 
shares and the total shareholder return 
performance target are set out on pages 
45 to 47.
The remuneration committee has 
considered the current guidance on 
remuneration in financial companies issued 
by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), 
Sir David Walker and the Financial Stability 
Board and in particular its emphasis on the 
need to ensure that remuneration plans 
do not incentivise excessive risk taking and 
short termism. The committee believe that 
the nature of the variable remuneration 
plans in place have been structured 
appropriately in light of the Company’s 
business model and risk profile in light 
of these guidelines in regard to (i) the 
proportion of variable remuneration of 
executive Directors and senior staff across 
the business which is deferred (a minimum 
of 40% of any bonus earned for a five 
year period), (ii) the length of the deferral 
period (five years being well ahead of the 
period specified by the FSA and other 
relevant guidance) and (iii) the performance 
conditions attached to the deferred awards 
(ie the part of the bonus that is converted 
into a restricted share award is subject to 
a total shareholder return performance 
condition for executive Directors that acts 
as a form of ‘claw-back’ in that the shares 
will not ultimately vest in full unless the 
Company’s total shareholder return is at 
upper quartile measured against other 
global investment management firms over 
a five year period). Since the remuneration 
committee set the pay arrangements for 
the year ending 30 June 2010, the FSA has 
proposed extending its Remuneration Code 
to asset management businesses from 
1 January 2011 (and is currently consulting 
on potential changes to that Code). The 
committee will clearly comply with any 
additional obligations which it imposes.

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
To date, for reasons related to Rule 9 
of the Takeover Code, Mark Coombs has 
chosen to waive any shares offered to him 
as part of his variable remuneration as the 
issuance of further shares to him would 
increase his existing shareholdings to the 
extent that it would trigger a mandatory 
bid for all shares. During prior years he 
has therefore asked the remuneration 
committee to consider an appropriate 
equivalent donation to be made to a 
charity or charities nominated by him and 
the remuneration committee has agreed to 
this. Any such equivalent donation made 
to a charity is paid to the charity annually 
in instalments of one fifth of the value 
of the award over a period equivalent to 
the five year vesting period which would 
have otherwise applied to a share award. 
Ongoing payments to the charity are 
dependent on Mark Coombs continued 
employment. 
Mark Coombs’ performance 
measures include targets for EBIT and 
AuM growth as well as the progression 
of strategic opportunities and operational 
development. The committee is fully 
satisfied that these performance 
measurements were met or exceeded 
in the year ended 30 June 2010. Similar 
measurements will be applied in the 
financial year ending 30 June 2011.
Graeme Dell’s performance 
measurements are a basket of operational, 
strategic and compliance related targets 
pertaining to his areas of responsibility, 
including finance, technology, compliance, 
operations, Ashmore’s overseas operations 
and investor relations. The committee 
is satisfied that key targets were met in 
the year ended 30 June 2010. Similar 
performance measures will be applied to 
the financial year ending 30 June 2011.
The balance between the fixed and 
variable elements of total compensation for 
each of the executive Directors for the year 
ending 30 June 2010 is shown in the table 
opposite.
Mark Coombs has requested to 
waive 30% of any total bonus awarded 
to him. He asked the remuneration 
committee to consider an appropriate 
equivalent donation to be made to a 
charity or charities nominated by him and 
the remuneration committee has agreed 
to this. 50% of the amount waived will 
be donated to the Ashmore Foundation, 
more details of which can be found in 
the Corporate social responsibility section 
of this report on page 40, and 50% to a 
charity or charities of his choice.
Long-term share award plans
As a business which is completely reliant 
upon the intellectual capital of its people 
the Board considers it essential to have in 
place share incentive arrangements which 
provide a significant element of “at risk” 
compensation and which are designed to 
attract, motivate and retain highly qualified 
executives, investment management 
professionals, and other key employees 
who are critical to our long-term success 
and to align their interests with those of 
our clients and shareholders. 
The overall limits operated under 
the live plans described below, which 
were established prior to the listing of 
the Company, are designed to fulfil these 
objectives. The number of shares which 
may be issued in aggregate under any 
employee share plan of the Company over 
any ten-year period following Admission 
is limited to 15% of the Company’s issued 
share capital at that time. The Company’s 
obligations under the share plans can 
be met by newly issued shares in the 
Company or shares purchased in the 
market by the trustees of an Employee 
Benefit Trust (“EBT”). During the period 
all of the awards that vested were met by 
shares from the EBT. As detailed in note 
22 of the accounts, the EBT continues to 
make market purchases of shares to satisfy 
current and future awards.
At 30 June 2010 the Company had 
issued 2.5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital under employee share plans to its 
staff. 
The Company operates three share 
award plans. All employees, including 
executive Directors, are eligible to receive 
awards under the share award plans. 
Deferred compensation 
The Company Executive Omnibus 
Incentive Plan (“Omnibus Plan”)
This plan was adopted on 11 October 
2006.
As described in the Variable 
compensation section above, senior 
employees routinely receive a proportion 
of their remuneration in the form of 
restricted shares, which vest after five years 
but qualify for dividends from the date of 
award. Employees who receive an award 
of restricted shares under the Omnibus 
Plan may also be given the opportunity 
to commute cash bonus awarded into 
bonus shares. Should employees take up 
this option, the Company may match the 
award with matching shares. Bonus and 
matching awards are eligible for dividends 
or equivalent from the date of award. 
All share awards for employees who 
remain employed by the Company cliff 
vest at five years.
In the case of executive Directors, 
restricted and matching share awards 
will be subject to Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) performance conditions. 
Bonus shares will not be subject to a TSR 
performance condition as the executive 
Directors will have waived cash bonus in 
order to receive them.
Awards under the Omnibus Plan are 
subject to good and bad leaver provisions. 
Should an award holder leave employment 
for reasons that would categorise them as 
a bad leaver, all restricted and matching 
share awards will be forfeited. Should 
an award holder leave employment for 
reasons that would categorise them 
as a good leaver, then restricted and 
matching share awards would vest on a 
pro-rated basis. Bonus shares will vest 
and be transferred to the award holder 
free of restrictions upon termination of 
employment for any reason other than 
dismissal for cause or personal bankruptcy.
The plan also allows the issue of 
option and share awards of different types. 
No options have been issued under this 
plan during the year and this is not current 
policy for executive Directors.
The Omnibus Plan includes individual 
limits in respect of option and share 
awards made to executive Directors in 
any annual period whereby an award will 
be limited and take effect so that (a) no 
participant who is an executive Director 
of the Company is granted market value 
options, discounted options or premium 
cost options in any annual period over 
more than 2,000,000 ordinary shares of 
0.01 pence each, and (b) no participant 
who is an executive Director of the 
Company is granted share awards in any 
annual period over more than 1,000,000 
ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each. If 
there are exceptional circumstances that 
the remuneration committee considers 
justify making awards in excess of these 
limits, the remuneration committee may,  46
Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
in respect of the relevant participant, apply 
double the limits above. 
In order to allow awards to be 
made to executive Directors and Group 
employees to whom share awards cannot 
be made and better facilitate the wider 
operation of the Company’s share plans 
in certain overseas countries where use of 
securities is complicated, the remuneration 
committee wishes to enable the making of 
phantom awards as well as actual shares. 
To date deferred awards for 
employees have taken the form of 
restricted shares, and as noted above for 
reasons related to Rule 9 of the Takeover 
Code, Mark Coombs has waived any 
shares offered to him as part of his 
variable remuneration as the issue of 
further shares to him would increase his 
existing shareholdings to the extent that 
it would trigger a mandatory bid for all 
shares. This change will enable awards to 
be made to Mark Coombs in a manner 
which is consistent with other employees, 
and which it is anticipated complies 
with the planned changes to the FSA’s 
Remuneration Code.
As a result of Ashmore’s 
establishment of operating entities and 
the employment of associated personnel 
in a number of emerging market countries 
it has become apparent that making 
awards of restricted, bonus or matching 
shares to employees in certain jurisdictions 
is difficult due to the local regulatory 
treatment of share awards, exchange 
control issues or local tax treatment of such 
awards. Ashmore wish to be able to treat 
its global employees consistently from a 
remuneration perspective and value equally 
the retention and incentivisation of staff 
irrespective of the jurisdiction in which they 
are employed.
To overcome these restrictions, 
the remuneration committee will seek 
shareholders approval, at the AGM 
scheduled for 28 October 2010, for a 
change to be made to the Omnibus Plan to 
introduce phantom awards. 
Phantom awards will only give a 
participant an entitlement to a cash 
amount equal to the market value of the 
shares that would have been issued or 
transferred to them if they had received 
the equivalent form of share award. In no 
circumstances will a holder of a phantom 
award have any entitlement to shares. The 
equivalent cash amount due on the vesting 
of a phantom award shall be the market 
value of the vested phantom shares on the 
relevant vesting or exercise date. 
Participants holding Restricted Shares 
are entitled to any dividends paid on the 
shares prior to the vesting date. Dividend 
equivalents are paid to participants holding 
other forms of share award, unless the 
remuneration committee determines 
otherwise. Phantom awards will be 
entitled to dividend equivalents unless 
the remuneration committee determines 
otherwise.
Should shareholders not approve the 
proposed change to the Omnibus Scheme 
rules, international employees who are 
unable to receive shares as remuneration 
will receive awards of a similar value 
structured in a manner which complies 
with local securities regulations and Mark 
Coombs will receive an award of the same 
value as the proposed phantom award, on 
24 November 2010 subject to remaining in 
continued employment at this time. 
During the financial year share awards 
were granted to Graeme Dell from the 
Omnibus Plan on 15 October 2009 as set 
forth in the table below and as reported in 
the Remuneration Report for the year ended 
30 June 2009. No share awards were made 
to Mark Coombs in the financial year.
The Ashmore First Discretionary 
Share Option Scheme 
(“Option Scheme”)
This scheme was established on 
23 October 2000. Subsequent to the 
Company’s Admission in October 2006, 
it is not intended to issue any further 
options under this scheme.
The Company Approved Share 
Option Plan (“CSOP”) 
This plan was adopted on 11 October 
2006 and approved by HMRC on 1 June 
2007. The CSOP provides for the granting 
of options up to a market value limit of 
£30,000 to each individual on the date of 
grant. No awards have been made under 
this plan to date.
Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
performance measure
Relative TSR is used as the performance 
measure for long-term incentive awards at 
Ashmore.
The remuneration committee has 
established a comparator group against 
which to measure TSR performance in 
respect of share awards to executive 
Directors under CSOP and the Omnibus 
Plan (for awards of both restricted shares 
and matching shares). Share awards will 
not vest at below median performance. 
25% of share awards will vest for median 
performance rising to full vesting at upper 
quartile performance, with straight-line 
proportionate vesting between these two 
points. The performance period for awards 
under the Omnibus Plan is five years.
TSR is considered appropriate 
as a well established and recognised 
performance measure which aligns the 
interests of the executive Directors with 
that of the shareholders choosing to 
invest in other similar global investment 
management firms. In the absence of 
any other dedicated emerging markets 
investment management companies, a 
comparator group of 19 companies has 
been selected from global investment 
management companies of a similar size 
that are established and actively trading 
on stock markets.
The remuneration committee 
decided to increase the number of 
companies used for TSR comparison 
purposes on 10 September 2009 from 
the original 16 comparator companies. 
This was prompted by the suspension 
from trading or acquisition of three of the 
original comparator group companies. 
The remuneration committee felt that in 
order to ensure that a sustainable peer 
group was selected; the group should be 
increased for awards made in relation to 
the year ended 30 June 2009 forward.

In measuring the extent to which

the relevant targets, the remuneration 
committee instructs its independent 
remuneration consultants to prepare 
a report for it to use as the basis for 
approving vesting of performance related 
share awards.

1  Mark Coombs’ and Graeme Dell’s variable compensation is made up of 60% cash bonus and 40% deferred awards. They may commute up to 50% of their cash 
bonus in favour of an equivalent amount of bonus share or bonus phantom awards and an equivalent value in matching share or phantom awards. All share or 
phantom awards will be reported in the Directors share awards table in the year of grant.
2  The making of phantom awards is subject to the proposed changes to the Omnibus Plan noted above, for which shareholders approval will be sought at the AGM. 
Should shareholders not approve the proposed changes to the Omnibus Plan, an award of the same value as the proposed phantom award will be made.
3 During the year ending 30 June 2009 Graeme Dell chose to commute 50% of his cash bonus thus reducing his cash compensation from £420,000 to £210,000. 
4 Non-executive Directors do not receive any additional fees for committee memberships.
5 Michael Benson has waived his right to fees over £100,000 and has asked that any additional monies are paid to a charity or charities of his choice.

Company medical scheme.
7  Graeme Dell’s benefits include a pension contribution of 7% of basic salary in the “Benefits” column. His benefits also include membership of the Company medical 
scheme.

Independent auditors’ report to the 
members of Ashmore Group plc
We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements of Ashmore Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2010 
set out on pages 51 to 85. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 33, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/UKP .
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
>  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 June 2010 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
>  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
>  the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
>  the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
>  the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year (which includes that specific information presented in the 
Business review that is cross referred from the Principal activity and business review section of the Directors’ report) for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

1) Significant accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented in dealing with items which are 
considered material in relation to the Group and Company financial statements, with the exception of new standards and 
interpretations which have been adopted with effect from 1 July 2009 as disclosed in policy note (a) below.
(a) Basis of preparation – Group and Company
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Based on these adopted IFRS, the Directors have selected the accounting policies to be 
applied, which are set out below.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of 
derivative financial instruments and certain financial assets that are held as available-for-sale.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 which allows it not to present 
its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes.
With effect from 1 July 2009, the Group adopted the following new standards and interpretations:
IFRS 1 and IAS 27 Amended: Cost of an investment in Subsidiary, Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate
This standard has been amended to clarify the initial measurement of cost in the separate financial statements of a new parent 
formed as the result of a reorganisation. The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial 
performance or position of the Group.
IFRS 2 Amended: Share-based Payments
This standard has been amended to clarify the definition of vesting conditions. The amended standard also requires a 
cancellation of a share-based award, whether by the entity or other parties, to be accounted for as an acceleration or 
modification of the vesting period. The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial 
performance or position of the Group.
IFRS 3 Amended: Business Combinations
This amended standard changes the accounting applied to the acquisition of non-controlling interests and the loss of control 
of subsidiaries. Adoption of this amended standard has had no impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IFRS 7 Amended: Financial Instruments: Disclosures
The amended standard requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements and liquidity risk. Among other things, 
the new disclosures:
>  add disclosure of any change in the method for determining fair value and the reasons for the change 
>  establish a three-level hierarchy for making fair value measurements: 
 1.  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1); 
 2.  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices) (Level 2); and 
 3.  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3). 
>  add disclosure, for each fair value measurement in the statement of financial position, of which level in the hierarchy 
was used and any transfers between levels, with additional disclosures whenever Level 3 is used including a measure of 
sensitivity to a change in input data 
>  add disclosure of a maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities.
The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IFRS 8: Operating Segments
This standard requires disclosure of information about the Group’s operating segments and replaces the requirement to 
determine primary and secondary reporting segments of the Group. Additional disclosures are also required for single segment 
businesses, including information about major customers and the location of material non-current assets. Adoption of this 
standard had no material impact on the disclosure in the accounts since management continue to regard the Group’s services 
as comprising one business segment (being provision of investment management services) and that its operations are not run 
on a discrete geographic basis. Disclosure regarding significant revenue sources is given in note 2. No additional disclosure is 
required for non-current assets on the basis that all material non-current assets are held in the UK. Overview

Annual report and accounts 2010
IAS 1 Amended: Presentation of Financial Statements
This amended standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income, which presents all items of recognised income and 
expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements. The Group has elected to present a single statement in 
the form a consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
IAS 27 Amended: Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
Changes to IAS 27 and IFRS 3 work together such that a business combination leading to acquisition accounting applies only 
at the point where control is achieved. The amended standard also identifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in 
a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for within shareholders’ equity. Adoption of this amended 
standard has had no impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IAS 39 Amended: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
The amendments make clear that the intrinsic value, not the time value, of an option reflects a one-sided risk and therefore an 
option designated in its entirety cannot be perfectly effective. The time value of a purchased option is not a component of the 
forecast transaction that impacts profit or loss. Therefore, if an entity designates an option in its entirety as a hedge of a one-
sided risk arising from a forecast transaction, hedge ineffectiveness will arise. Adoption of this amended standard has had no 
impact on the financial performance or position of the Group as the Group excludes all time value from all hedges.
(b) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential 
voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from 
the effective date of acquisition.
(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
(iii) Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence exists when the Group has the 
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not control those policies.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method as described under IAS 28, whereby the investment is initially recognised 
at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Company’s share of net assets of the investee.
(iv) Employee Benefit Trust
An Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) acts as an agent for the purpose of the employee share-based compensation plans. 
Accordingly, the EBT is included within the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
(c) Foreign currency translation
The Group’s financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (“sterling”), which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency. Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. 60

Notes to the financial statements

(d) Financial instruments
(i) Derivatives
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage its foreign currency exposures.
Except when hedge accounting is applied, derivatives are initially recognised at cost on the date on which a contract is 
entered into unless fair value at acquisition is different to cost, in which case the fair value is recognised. Subsequently they 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Transaction costs are 
recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. The fair value of the derivatives is their quoted market 
price at the balance sheet date.
All derivatives are carried as current assets when the fair value is positive and as current liabilities when the fair value is 
negative.
(ii) Financial assets
The Group may, from time-to-time, invest in funds where an Ashmore Group subsidiary is the investment manager or an 
advisor (seeding). Where the holding in such investments is deemed to represent a controlling stake and is acquired exclusively 
with a view to subsequent disposal through sale or dilution, these seed investments are recognised as non-current assets 
held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5. Where control is not deemed to exist, and the assets are readily realisable, they are 
recognised as available-for-sale financial assets. Where the assets are not readily realisable, they are recognised as non-current 
asset investments. The recognition policy for the three categories is set out below:
• Non-current asset investments
Non-current asset investments, relating to closed-end funds, are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss. Fair value is assessed by taking account of the extent to which potential dilution of gains or losses may arise as a result of 
additional investors subscribing to the fund where the final close of a fund has not occurred.
• Financial assets held as non-current assets held-for-sale
Non-current assets held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except 
where measurement and re-measurement is outside the scope of IFRS 5. The relevant policy is set out in (d)(i). Where 
investments that have initially been recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale, because the Group has been deemed as 
holding a controlling stake, are subsequently disposed of or diluted such that the Group’s holding is now insufficient to be 
deemed a controlling stake, the investment will subsequently be reclassified as an available-for-sale financial asset. Any such 
reclassification will crystallise any gain or loss previously recognised through other comprehensive income within profit for the 
year as part of comprehensive income. Subsequent movements will be recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy for the newly adopted classification.
• Financial assets held as available-for-sale
For available-for-sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, until the asset is disposed of or is impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is included in profit for the year as part of comprehensive income.
(iii) Trade and other receivables and payables
Trade and other receivables and payables are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs. The fair value on acquisition 
is normally the cost. Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable amount are recognised through the 
statement of comprehensive income when there is appropriate evidence that trade and other receivables are impaired. 
However, if a longer-term loan or receivable carries no interest, the fair value is estimated as the present value of all future 
cash payments or receipts discounted using the prevailing market rates. The resulting adjustment is recognised as interest 
expense or interest income. Subsequent to initial recognition these assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost less 
any impairment.
(iv) Hedge accounting
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when the transactions meet the specified hedge accounting criteria. To qualify, 
the following conditions must be met:
> formal documentation of the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s) must exist at inception;
> the hedged cash flows must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could 
ultimately affect profit and loss;
> the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; and
> the hedge must be highly effective, with effectiveness assessed on an ongoing basis. Overview

For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the effective hedging instrument, is initially recognised in other 
comprehensive income and is released to profit for the year as part of comprehensive income in the same period during which 
the relevant financial asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Where highly effective, any ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognised in profit and loss. Where the instrument 
ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is discontinued.
(e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes leasehold improvements and office equipment, and are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The useful life of office equipment is estimated to be five years. In 
respect of leasehold improvements depreciation is charged over the remaining life of the lease or over the useful life of the 
improvements, whichever is shorter. The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually.
(f) Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
(g) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above.
(h) Deferred acquisition costs
Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management contract are deferred if they can be identified 
separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered. Deferred acquisition costs represent the 
contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are charged as the related revenue is 
recognised.
(i) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, the 
recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent 
that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(j) Dividends payable
Interim dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends when approved by shareholders.
(k) Employee benefits
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of 
comprehensive income when payable in accordance with the scheme particulars.
(l) Share-based payments
The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-based compensation plans. The awards have been classified as 
equity settled under IFRS 2: Share-Based Payments. 62
Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Notes to the financial statements
continued
The fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period. The fair value is measured using an appropriate 
valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
(m) Own shares
Own shares are held by the EBT. The holding of the EBT comprises own shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees 
of the Group. In both the Group and Company own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from retained earnings.
(n) Treasury shares
Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to retained 
earnings.
(o) Revenue
Revenue comprises management fees, performance fees and other revenue. Revenue is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income as and when the related services are provided. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Specific revenue recognition 
policies are:
(i) Management fees
Management fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided. Where management fees are received in 
advance these are recognised over the period of the provision of the asset management service, which is estimated based on 
experience of average holding periods for investments.
(ii) Performance fees
Performance fees relate to the performance of funds managed during the period and are recognised at the balance sheet date 
when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise. This is usually at the end 
of the performance period.
(iii) Other revenue
Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and administration fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs incurred by the 
Group. This revenue is recognised when the related services are provided.
(p) Distribution costs
Distribution costs are the cost-of-sales payable to third parties and are recognised over the period for which the service is 
provided.
(q) Operating leases
Payments payable under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are 
recorded as a reduction in premises costs.
(r) Finance income
Finance income includes interest receivable on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and gains on available-for-sale/held-for-
sale assets. Gains on available-for-sale/held-for-sale assets recognised in the year arose either as a result of crystallisation on 
disposal of an available-for-sale asset or upon reclassification of financial assets previously held as non-current assets held-for-
sale as described in policy note (d)(ii).
(s) Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. Overview

Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised.
(t) Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services (business 
segment), or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is 
subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Management regard the Group’s services as comprising one business segment (being provision of investment management 
services) and that its operations are not run on a discrete geographic basis.
(u) Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment are described in note 31.
(v) Adopted IFRS not yet applied
The Group has adopted all IFRSs endorsed by the EU. Newly adopted IFRSs in the year have had no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group.
Company
In addition to the above accounting policies, the following specifically relate to the Company:
(w) Investment in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential 
voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
(x) Financial guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the 
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will 
be required to make a payment under the guarantee or that guarantee expires for any reason.
2) Revenue
Management fees are accrued throughout the period in line with fluctuations in the levels of assets under management. 
Periodic performance fees are recognised only if performance hurdles have been achieved in a period. The Group is not 
considered to be reliant on any single source of revenue. During the year, four of the Group’s funds provided between 5.0% 
and 7.5% of total revenue through management fees. One of the Group’s funds provided 11.0% of total revenue in the year 
when considering management fees and performance fees on a combined basis. 64

Following the end of the financial year, it was announced that the rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 28% to 27% 
with effect from 1 April 2011. The reduction in the corporation tax rate was not substantively enacted by 30 June 2010. 
As a result, the Group’s deferred tax balances have been calculated using a rate of 28%. A change to 27% would not 
materially impact these financial statements.
8) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent of 
£160.0m (FY2008/09: £115.0m) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with an adjustment to the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There is no difference between the profit for the 
financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Overview

9) Share-based payments
Group and Company share-based compensation plans
The following share-based compensation plans were in operation during the reporting year.
The Ashmore First Discretionary Share Option Scheme (“Option Scheme”)
The Option Scheme was set up in October 2000. Options issued under the Option Scheme typically have a life of 10 years 
and vest after 5 years from date of grant. The fair value of options at each reporting year end has been accounted for on an 
equity-settled basis. No further options will be issued under the Option Scheme.
The Executive Omnibus Incentive Plan (“Omnibus Plan”)
The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, 
market value options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options and/or nil cost options to employees. The plan 
will also allow bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares. These elements can be 
used singly or in combination.
The Approved Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”)
The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant 
of market value options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding £30,000 per employee. 
The CSOP qualifies as a UK tax-approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC. 
To date, there have been no awards made under the CSOP .

The fair values of awards granted under the Omnibus Plan are determined by the average share price for the five business days 
prior to grant.
Where the grant of share awards is linked to the annual bonus process the fair value of the awards is spread over a 
period including the current financial year and the subsequent five years to their release date, when the grantee becomes 
unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares. Of the restricted share awards of 12,937,439 as at 30 June 2010 the amount 
of 10,857,224 were granted as part of the Group’s variable compensation process. The fair value of the remaining awards is 
spread over the period from date of grant to the release date.
10) Dividends
An analysis of dividends is as follows:
Group and Company 2010 2009
Dividends declared/proposed in respect of the year:
Interim dividend declared per share (p) 3.66 3.66
Final dividend proposed per share (p) 9.34 8.34
Dividends paid in the year:
Interim dividend paid (£m) 25.0 24.9
Interim dividend per share (p) 3.66 3.66
Final dividend paid (£m) 57.2 57.0
Final dividend per share (p) 8.34 8.34
In addition to the £82.2m (FY2008/09: £81.9m) dividends paid to equity holders of the parent, the Group also paid £0.4m 
(FY2008/09: nil) of dividends to non-controlling interests. 70

Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year in which they are paid, or in the case of a final dividend when approved 
by the shareholders.
On 13 September 2010 the Board proposed a final dividend of 9.34p per share for the year ended 30 June 2010. This has 
not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders. Based on the 
number of shares in issue at the year end which qualify to receive a dividend, the total amount payable would be £63.7m 
(FY2008/09: £57.0m).

The annual impairment review of goodwill was undertaken at 30 June 2010. No impairment was deemed necessary.
The recoverable amounts of the business are determined based upon future forecast profitability and cash flow projections. 
The key assumptions on which management has based its projections are the expected fund flows and growth of AuM, which 
determine management and performance fee income. Overview

The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with asset allocations, research and other such operational practices 
reflecting the commonality of approach across all fund themes. Therefore, no further split into smaller cash-generating units is 
possible, and the impairment review is conducted for the Group as a whole.
The goodwill balance within the Company at the beginning and end of the year is £4.1m and relates to the acquisition of the 
business from ANZ in 1999. Additional goodwill arising in the Group is in respect of the Dolomite acquisition in 2008.
There has been no gross impairment of goodwill to date.

17) Non-current assets and non-current liabilities held-for-sale
Where Group companies inject seed capital into funds operated and controlled by the Group, then the fund is classified as 
being held-for-sale. Typically, if the fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year from the original 
investment date it will cease to be classified as held-for-sale, and will be consolidated line by line. In determining whether 
to execute the reclassification, the Group will have regard to the proximity of loss of control, and the extent to which 
consolidation of the fund on a line-by-line basis would be material to the presentation of the Group’s financial statements.

19) Fair value of financial instruments
There is no material difference between the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and 
their fair values.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by reference to published price quotations (Level 2 inputs).
20) Financial instrument risk management
Group
The Group is subject to business and strategy, investment and operational risk throughout its business as discussed in the 
Business review. Specific areas of financial instrument risk include credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price 
risk. The effectiveness of the Group’s risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and 
considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Group’s senior management. The Ashmore Group risk management 
and control department and the Group’s risk & compliance committee (RCC) are responsible for monitoring the overall risk 
environment. The Group has established a control environment that ensures risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk 
controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements. In addition as a regulated business 
the Group is responsible for maintaining appropriate capital and performing regular calculations of capital requirements, 
including the development of an internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), based upon the Financial Services 
Authority’s methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive. An overview of the ICAAP can be found on our website 
at www.ashmoregroup.com.
• Credit risk
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full 
amounts when due. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
Financial assets subject to credit risk at 30 June 2010 are as follows:

Trade and other receivables 14 45.7 33.1
Total trade and other receivables 45.7 33.1
Total 465.9 361.9
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Trade and other receivables at amortised cost
Financial assets at amortised cost principally comprise fee debtors, which are all less than 90 days old.
Fee debtors arise principally within the Group’s investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly. 
Historically, default levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship 
between the Group and the client. There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients.
Financial assets – available-for-sale
Such assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, and debt and equity instruments in seeded funds.
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are liquid short-term deposits with banks which have credit ratings ranging from 
A to A+ as at 30 June 2010 (2009: A to A+).
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value
Such assets comprise derivative financial instruments with positive and negative fair values. Overview

• Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost. The liquidity 
policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 
12 months.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted 
cash flows and are all due within one year, except for commitments which are greater than one year.

• Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates.
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements 
in interest rates. This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2010, if interest rates had been 200 basis points higher or 45 basis points lower (2009: 200 basis points higher/
lower) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £6.6m higher/£1.5m lower (2009: 
£4.5m higher/£4.5m lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest on cash balances.
The assumption that the fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the 
model to calculate the effect on post-tax profits. 76

The Group’s revenue is almost entirely denominated in US dollars, while the Group’s cost base is largely sterling-based. 
Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the US$/£ exchange rate.
The Group’s policy is to hedge this net foreign exchange exposure by using a combination of forward foreign exchange 
contracts and/or options for up to two years forward. The Group also sells US dollars at spot rates when opportunities arise.
At 30 June 2010, if the US dollar had strengthened/weakened by 10 cents against sterling with all other 
variables held constant, profit before tax for the year would increased/decreased by £11.1m/£9.7m respectively 
(FY2008/09: £15.1m/£10.8m).
The Group also holds a number of seed capital investments, as shown on the balance sheet, which are denominated in 
Brazilian real or US dollars. Any such seed investments give rise to foreign exchange risk. At 30 June 2010, if the Brazilian real 
and US dollar had, in aggregate, strengthened/weakened by 1% against sterling with all other variables held constant, net 
assets and net revenue for the year would increased/decreased by £0.6m/£0.6m (FY2008/09: £0.3m/£0.3m).
• Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes.
The Group’s direct exposure to price risk is in respect of the seed capital investments it holds on its balance sheet. These can 
be either debt or equity instruments, where the Group’s exposure is restricted to the carrying value of the assets or liabilities. 
At 30 June 2010, a 5% movement in the fair value of these investments would have had a £3.3m (FY2008/09: £2.0m) impact 
on net assets.
There is also indirect price risk in connection with the Group’s AuM and its associated management and performance fees. 
These are diversified across a range of investment themes and not measurably correlated to any single market indices in 
emerging markets. Based on the year end assets under management of US$35.3bn, and a sensible medium-term average 
net management fee rate of 1%, a 5% movement in AuM would have a US$17.7m impact in management fee revenues. 
Performance fee revenues could be reduced in severe market conditions, however throughout Ashmore’s history the policy 
of having funds with year ends staged through the financial year has meant that in periods of steep market decline some 
performance fees have still been recorded. The profitability impact is likely to be less than this, as cost mitigation actions would 
apply, including reduction in the variable compensation paid to employees.
• Hedging activities
Included within the realised and unrealised hedging losses of £4.8m recognised at 30 June 2010 are:
– a £1.6m loss in respect of foreign exchange options covering net management fee income for the financial year ending 
30 June 2011; and
– a £3.1m loss in respect of crystallised forward foreign exchange contracts. 78

Financial year ending 30 June 2011: foreign exchange options
The options have been assessed as effective cash flow hedges at 30 June 2010. Time value in relation to the options 
is excluded from being part of the hedging item and, as a result, a net unrealised loss arising on the options of £1.6m 
(FY2008/09: £0.4m gain) has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 
30 June 2010, being the movement in the time value of the options in the financial year.
The £0.6m (FY2008/09: nil) intrinsic loss of the options has been recognised through other comprehensive income. Nil intrinsic 
value (FY2008/09: nil) was reclassified from equity to the statement of comprehensive income in the year. The cumulative fair 
value of the outstanding foreign exchange option collars liberty at 30 June 2010 was £1.8m (2009: nil).
This treatment will continue so long as the hedges are assessed as being highly effective. Intrinsic value gains and losses are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise.
All outstanding options mature in the year ending 30 June 2011 and hedge a proportion of the Group’s revenue cash flows 
which occur consistently throughout the year.

• Capital management
Equity as referred to in the Group’s balance sheet is the capital for the business. There are no other assets managed which are 
considered capital of the Group. As referred to above, the Group monitors its regulatory capital in order to meet the financial 
resources requirement of the Financial Services Authority.
Company
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole. The Company’s specific risk 
exposures are explained below.
• Credit risk
The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full 
amounts when due. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
Financial assets subject to credit risk at 30 June 2010 are as follows:

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are liquid short-term deposits with banks which have credit ratings ranging from 
A to A+ as at 30 June 2010 (2009: A to A+).
• Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost. The liquidity 
policy is to ensure that the Company has sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 
12 months. Overview

• Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates.
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Company will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse 
movements in interest rates. This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2010, if interest rates had been 200 basis points higher/60 basis points lower (2009: 200 basis points higher/lower) 
with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £3.4m higher/£1.0m lower (FY2008/09: 
£2.8m higher/£2.8m lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest on cash balances.
The assumption that the fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the 
model to calculate the effect on post-tax profits. 80

Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. Other than intercompany balances in relation to seed capital investments, the only foreign 
exchange risk to which the Company is exposed is in respect of US dollar cash balances.

The Group held 30.0% of the equity of an associate, Everbright Ashmore, as at 30 June 2010 (2009: nil).
The Group’s share of net assets of the associate is currently below the carrying value of the investment reflected on the 
consolidated balance sheet. This is considered to be a temporary position which has arisen as the associate progresses through 
an initial establishment phase. No permanent impairment is believed to exist and as such the carrying value of the investment 
in associate has not been adjusted.
The Group has an undrawn capital commitment of £15.1m to an investment fund managed by the associate. Further details

on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based upon value-in-use calculations 
prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
The Group assesses the recognition of performance fees to determine whether receipt of the fees is considered probable 
and the amount reliable. The assessment is made using management’s judgement of the circumstances relevant to each 
performance fee entitlement. Five-year summary

Notifying the Company of a 
change of address
You should notify Equiniti Registrars in 
writing. 
If you hold shares in joint names, the 
notification to change address must be 
signed by the first-named shareholder. 
You may choose to do this online, by 
logging on to www.shareview.co.uk 
You will need your shareholder reference 
number to access this service – this can 
be found on your share certificate or 
from a dividend counterfoil. 
You will be asked to select your own PIN 
and a user ID will be posted to you.
Notifying the Company of a 
change of name
You should notify Equiniti Registrars in 
writing of your new name and previous 
name. You should attach a copy of your 
marriage certificate or your change of 
name deed, together with your share 
certificates and any un-cashed dividend 
cheques in your old name, so that the 
Registrar can reissue them.
Dividend payments directly into 
bank or building society accounts
We recommend that all dividend 
payments are made directly into a 
bank or building society account. 
Dividends are paid via BACS, providing 
tighter security and access to funds 
more quickly. To apply for a dividend 
mandate form, contact the Registrar, 
or you can find one by logging on to 
www.shareview.co.uk (under Frequently 
Asked Questions) or by calling the 
helpline on 0870 600 3970.
Transferring Ashmore 
Group plc shares
Transferring some or all of your 
shares to someone else (for example 
your partner or a member of your 
family) requires completion of a share 
transfer form, which is available from 
Equiniti Registrars. The form should 
be fully completed and returned with 
your share certificate representing 
at least the number of shares being 
transferred. The Registrar will then 
process the transfer and issue a balance 
share certificate to you if applicable. 
The Registrar will be able to help you 
with any questions you may have. 
Lost share certificate(s)
Shareholders who lose their share 
certificate(s) or have their certificate(s) 
stolen should inform Equiniti Registrars 
immediately by calling the shareholder 
helpline on 0871 384 2030.

cost reduction actions taken in 2009 and 
continuing into 2010, margins improved

improvements in the second half and into 
2011. Utilisation remained high on most 
lines, with some weakness at the end of 
the year.

utilisation of l ine 2 began to rise with 
new products and new customers.

Chairman’s Statement
during 2010 Fiberweb saw a 
continuation of sustained 
performance improvement in many 
areas. Financially, steady progress 
was delivered in sales and 
profitability, with strong returns to 
shareholders during the year. major 
investments in infrastructure in the 
USa, in product development and in 
productive assets were successfully 
undertaken during the year in 
several sites in Europe and at our 
major industrial site at Old Hickory 
in the USa. 
Fiberweb’s portfolio was strengthened 
by the acquisition of Boddingtons 
announced in december, creating a 
stronger platform for the group in the 
geosynthetics market. From a 
management perspective, further 
streamlining and strengthening was 
accomplished, with costs further 
reduced and responsiveness improved, 
well-aligned with the evolving needs of 
our customers. additionally, important 
initiatives in the areas of management 
development, lean manufacturing and 
total quality management were 
developed and launched during the 
course of the year, demonstrating  
our ability to continue to invest in 
Fiberweb’s human and infrastructure 
resources.
Fiberweb continues to position its 
businesses for top-line and bottom-
line growth and to broaden its product 
range to address the needs of 
customers in its core business areas.
Financial Results
Overall, the financial results for 2010 
are very encouraging. against a 
background of increasing raw 
material costs, the continuing severe 
recessions in many of the group’s 
construction markets and the high 
degree of economic uncertainty 
prevailing for much of the year, 
continuing sales of £463.2 million 
(2009: £454.2 million) increased like-
for-like by £41.2 million (9.8%) at 
constant currency. This reflects 3.6% 
like-for-like volume growth, mix 
improvement aided by the launch of 
new products and the effect of higher 
raw material costs on sales prices. 
Continuing underlying operating profit 
of £29.0 million increased by 25.5% 
from £23.1 million, largely from the 
impact of higher sales, but also reduced 
overhead costs and the contribution 
from the strong performance of the 
first full-year of Fiberweb’s 50% stake 
in the FitesaFiberweb joint venture. 
Underlying operating margin 
increased by 117 basis points to 6.3%, 
with the 6.6% achieved in the second 
half, representing the seventh 
consecutive half-year of improving 
margins.
Net cash flow from operating activities 
before non-recurring items cash cost 
was again strong at £44.6 million 
(2009: £59.3 million) as a result of 
improved margins. in recent years, 
reductions in working capital have 
contributed significantly to operating 
cash flow. in 2010, due to increases in 
raw material costs and significant 
sales growth, working capital 
increased slightly by £4.3 million but 
at 14.6% achieved the group target of 
15% of sales. Capital investment of 
£33.2 million (2009: £27.0 million) 
increased significantly to secure 
competitive manufacturing and 
product development infrastructure 
for the future. The return on invested 
capital
(1)
 of 8.8% (2009: 7.5%), while 
substantially improved, remains below 
Fiberweb’s cost of capital, estimated 
at 9%, and further improvement 
remains a key objective. Net debt of 
d uring 2010 Fiberweb saw a continuation 
of sustained performance improvement in 
many areas. Financially, steady progress 
was delivered in sales and profitability, 
with strong returns to shareholders 
during the year.

£151.2 million (2009: £136.6 million) 
increased by £14.6 million due to 
higher capital investment, together 
with the £5.4 million cost of the 
termination of interest rate swaps 
relating to the old loan facility in 
July. On a constant currency basis, 
net debt increased by £12 million.
Key Events
important milestones during 2010 
included:
May –  
The successful 
upgrade of a large 
industrial spunbond 
line at Fiberweb’s 
industrial manufacturing site in 
Berlin. This upgraded line then ran 
at full utilisation for the remainder 
of the year.
August – 
Completion and 
commissioning of the 
major new utilities plant 
at Old Hickory, giving 
Fiberweb’s large industrial 
manufacturing operation on the site a 
secure and cost-effective source of 
steam and chilled water.
September – 
Completion of the 
building to house 
Fiberweb’s new 
industrial product 
development facility at Old Hickory.
September –  
l aunch of Fiberweb 
xl , the group’s first 
senior management 
development 
programme and of q5zero, the 
group’s operational excellence 
programme.
November – 
Completion of the 
construction phase of 
FitesaFiberweb’s 
spunbond facility at 
Simpsonville, USa and the beginning 
of commissioning.
December – 
announcement of the 
acquisition of the 
Boddingtons 
geosynthetics business, 
based at maldon in the UK. The 
acquisition was successfully 
completed on 6 January 2011.
The Hygiene business enjoyed a 
mixed year, with total volumes up 
only 2% like-for-like. Spunbond 
volumes were, in general, strong 
throughout the year, both at our 
wholly-owned facilities in Europe 
and at FitesaFiberweb’s plants in the 
USa, mexico and Brazil. volumes of 
speciality carded fabrics were more 
volatile during the year. Excellent 
progress was made with several 
important multinational customers 
in delivering innovation, securing 
additional volumes and longer-term 
supply relationships. Our production 
lines continued to be well-utilised 
overall, but margins were impacted, 
especially in the first-half, by steadily 
increasing raw material prices and 
the one-quarter lag in price recovery 
as a result of the pass-through 
contracts typically in place with 
major customers. airlaid volumes 
in asia were volatile and progress in 
filling l ine 2 continues to be slower 
than expected.
The industrial businesses saw the 
strongest trading performance, 
with volumes increasing by 6.3% 
despite tough market conditions.

businesses for top-line and bottom-line 
growth and to broaden its product range

Chairman’s Statement continued
growth, with a solid performance 
in filtration and initial success in 
new roofing products. Our first half 
growth in the US housing markets 
was not maintained in the second 
half, reflecting a material weakening 
in confidence. European volumes 
increased by 5%, with industrial 
Specialities and agriculture markets 
strong. d espite seeing a major 
reduction in European geotextile 
demand as a result of the decline in 
public sector construction, Terram 
volumes grew 4.5%, gaining UK 
market share and maintaining strong 
export volumes. 
Dividends
The Board is pleased to maintain the 
final dividend at 2.5 pence per share, 
continuing the stable payout record 
established since demerger. The total 
2010 dividend of 4.2 pence per share 
represents 39% of earnings, with 
comfortable dividend cover of 2.6. 
The final dividend, if approved by 
shareholders, will be paid on 27 may 
2011 to shareholders on the register 
on 26 april 2011 and the shares will 
go ex-dividend on 20 april 2011.
The Board and Management
The Board has remained unchanged 
during the year.
There have been three changes 
in senior executive management 
during the year. alice Heezen 
joined in January 2010 as Head of 
HR and Change, replacing Bridget 
Bradshaw who left after five years at 
the heart of Fiberweb’s turnaround 
programme. in July 2010 Carsten 
Heldmann was promoted to 
president of Consumer Fabrics, 
replacing ian Barnes who retired. 
Carsten had previously been 
Consumer Fabrics Head of R&d and 
marketing. derek Chan, president 
of Fiberweb asia, left in december 
2010 after four years, and his role 
has been incorporated into the 
responsibilities of other divisional 
presidents.
Prospects
Fiberweb is continuing to follow a 
consistent strategy of margin 
improvement through investment in 
competitive assets and 
manufacturing processes, 
investment in product development 
capabilities and through gaining a 
deeper understanding of key 
customers and markets. The like-
for-like sales growth and the 
continuing improvement in 
underlying operating margin seen 
throughout 2010, in difficult 
markets, is strong evidence that 
Fiberweb continues on the right 
track. Further acquisitions and 
innovations will be sought to 
accelerate Fiberweb’s development 
in targeted markets, offering the 
potential for sustainably attractive 
returns through product and service 
differentiation.
Malcolm Coster
Chairman
1 march 2011     Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REp ORT aNd FiNaNCial STa TEmENTS 2010    9
2010 marked the first year following 
the completion of the major 
restructuring programme we have 
been driving since 2006. The steady 
recovery in our financial 
performance demonstrates the 
success of our focus on building 
competitive assets, increasing 
efficiencies and identifying and 
targeting more attractive and higher 
margin markets and customers.
The most important objective for the 
year was to continue building on the 
growth in underlying operating 
margin seen during 2007-09. The 
5.9% achieved in the first half was 
followed by 6.6% in the strong 
second half reflecting our efforts to 
improve pricing, reduce costs and 
most importantly in the longer-
term, launch attractive and 
differentiated new products at 
improved margins.
Financial Performance 
Following the sales declines seen 
in recent years as a result of 
significant restructuring and 
economic recession in many 
markets, 2010 saw a return to like-
for-like growth. l ike-for-like 
volumes grew by 4% over the year, 
2% in hygiene and 6% in industrial. 
Benefiting from continuing 
improvement in mix as well as the 
increase in average raw material 
prices, which feeds through to 
sales with a lag of around 3 
months, reported like-for-like 
sales grew by 10% to £463.2 
million at constant currency. 2010 
full year underlying operating 
profits from continuing operations 
before restructuring costs and 
non-recurring items at £29.0 
million represent strong growth 
overall (25.5%) from £23.1 million 
in 2009.
profit before tax of £7.1 million 
(2009: loss of £6.1 million) reflects 
both the improved underlying 
performance as well as the much 
reduced restructuring charges and 
other non-recurring items of £6.5 
million (2009: £17.2 million) 
associated with ongoing efforts to 
improve productivity.
We saw further volatility in polymer 
prices during 2010, with steady 
increases during the first half in both 
North america and Europe, though 
prices reversed towards the end of 
the first half in North america and 
then remained fairly stable there to 
the year-end. in Europe by contrast, 
due to an apparent shortage of  
supply occasioned by an unreliable 
supply base, prices remained high 
throughout the year. We succeeded 
in designing a hedging programme 
that effectively mitigated a  
significant proportion of this volatility 
throughout the year, with hedges 
equivalent to the majority of the 
polypropylene demand of the 
European industrial division.  
We have significantly less hedging 
for polypropylene in place than at 
this stage in 2010, as attractive 
hedge pricing has not been  
available.
Chief Executive’s Review
The steady recovery in our financial 
performance demonstrates the success of 
our focus on building competitive assets, 
increasing efficiencies and identifying and 
targeting more attractive and higher margin 
markets and customers. 10   Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010 
Chief Executive’s Review continued
S4 line, Berlin
The upgrade of the spunbond line at 
Fiberweb’s industrial manufacturing site 
in Berlin was successfully completed in 
May 2010.
Boddingtons
In December 2010, Fiberweb agreed to acquire 
the Boddingtons group of companies, a leading 
UK based specialist geosynthetic and accessory 
manufacturer .
Operating cash flow of £44.6 million 
(2009: £59.3 million) before non-
recurring cash costs of £6.9 million 
(2009: £8.7 million) nearly funded 
capital investment of £33.2 million 
(2009: £27.0 million), net interest 
payments of £7.9 million (2009: £9.3 
million) and shareholder dividends 
of £5.2 million (2009: £5.1 million). 
The heavy investment programme 
plus substantial refinancing fees on 
the renewal of the group’s primary 
debt facility led to net debt 
increasing by £14.6 million to £151.2 
million. despite tight control of 
working capital as a percentage of 
sales, sales growth and the increase 
in raw material prices and hence 
sales prices conspired to produce a 
working capital outflow of £4.3 
million (2009: £15.3 million inflow). 
Working capital as a percentage of 
sales, a metric management 
believes is crucial to the business, 
improved to 14.6% (2009: 15.4%), 
reflecting tight controls and 
management focus.
Divisional Review
The divisional structure was  
further simplified at the end of the 
year with the asian business being 
integrated into other divisions. 
Notably, the airlaid business,  
which predominantly serves 
multinational hygiene customers, 
was integrated into the existing 
global Consumer Fabrics business 
and the small asian industrial 
business was integrated into the 
americas industrial business.  
This further reduced cost and is 
consistent with our philosophy of 
matching our organisation to the 
needs and structures of our 
customers. Following the  
year-end, the successful 
completion of the Boddingtons 
acquisition allowed the creation 
of a business unit within the 
industrial division focused 
exclusively on the particular needs 
of customers for geosynthetics  
and related ground engineering 
products.
Industrial
The industrial division has 
performed strongly in the year 
despite continued tough market 
conditions with good performance in 
a number of markets and volumes 
improved by 6.3% overall. We have 
been able to continue to improve 
margins and launch new products 
such as roofwrap in the US although 
some launches were slower than 
expected. 
Europe industrial sales increased 
4.5% to £83.2 million. The European 
business benefited from the 
successful upgrade of a large 
industrial spunbond line in Berlin 
at the half year which ran at full 
utilisation in the second half. The 
strong performance of the

2009 was not repeated as fears 
of a swine flu epidemic failed 
to materialise. Roofing markets

Our Terram geotextiles business      Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010    11
was impacted by the reduction in 
European demand as a result of 
the recession and decline in public 
sector construction spending. 
despite this, Terram performed well 
to gain market share in the UK with 
volumes improving 4.5%.
americas industrial sales grew 3.8% 
to £85.9 million. The main weaknesses 
were in construction due to the 
continuing weak market, and in 
graphic arts, driven by consolidation of 
printers in the USa and weak printing 
volumes. This was offset by improved 
margins as a result of sales of higher 
margin filtration and technical 
nonwoven products. 
The project to relocate an industrial  
spunbond line in China experienced 
delays and the site remains under 
review.
Hygiene
Hygiene volumes were up 1.9% on 
a like–for-like basis after adjusting 
for the mexico and Washougal 
businesses contributed to the 
FitesaFiberweb joint venture during 
2009. Spunbond volumes were 
strong throughout the year both at 
Fiberweb’s plants in Europe and at 
the FitesaFiberweb businesses in 
the USa, mexico and Brazil. There 
was more volatility in the speciality 
carded business. in the US, sales 
grew by 4.9% on a like-for-like 
basis despite a small reduction in 
volumes reflecting the impact of 
higher raw material prices.  
in Europe, volumes grew by 1%.
The focus in Hygiene is on 
optimising business performance 
and operational improvement.  
a number of pricing initiatives have 
taken place and the business has 
also secured a number of long  
term contracts with major 
customers.
margins were impacted by steadily 
increasing raw material prices 
in the first half and the delayed 
effect of the average three month 
lag in contractual pass through 
arrangements with our customers. 
airlaid volumes in asia, despite 
growth of 15.5%, were volatile and 
progress in filling line 2 is slower 
than expected. 
The new FitesaFiberweb spunbond 
line at Simpsonville has progressed 
well and is now operational.
Our People
i continue to be pleased by the 
loyalty and determination shown by 
Fiberweb people around the globe. 
We benefited again during 2010 
from targeted recruitment in  
several important areas, notably in 
technical and marketing functions in 
both our industrial and hygiene 
businesses. We have also launched 
a major management development 
programme – Fiberweb xl – to 
ensure that we both retain our  
most talented staff and prepare 
them for new and greater 
challenges within Fiberweb as their 
careers develop.
Airlaid
Fiberweb is the largest airlaid roll goods 
producer in Asia serving most of the feminine 
care producers in the region. 12   Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
I would like to thank all Fiberweb 
employees for their commitment 
and creativity as we begin to grow 
our businesses again and invest in 
challenging projects and initiatives.
Outlook
We expect Fiberweb’s performance 
to be resilient and in-line with 
market expectations, despite the 
continuing challenges of the 
economic environment and high 
levels of volatility in raw materials 
pricing. 
The Hygiene businesses are 
expected to see fairly stable end-
user demand and should benefit 
from new customer contracts. In 
particular, optimised loading and 
efficiencies on the Italian spunbond 
line commissioned in mid-2009 will 
benefit margins. Further overhead 
cost reductions in Europe are also 
underway and there is a renewed 
focus on operational excellence. 
FitesaFiberweb is expected to 
continue to profit from strong 
volumes in South America and from 
the first-time contribution from its 
new spunbond line in the USA.
The Industrial businesses will 
benefit from growth of sales of 
new products launched in 2010 
as well as from rationalisation in 
the UK following the acquisition 
of Boddingtons in January 2011. 
We will continue to examine our 
cost base and expect further 
improvements during the course of 
the year in manufacturing, as we 
continue to invest in product and 
market development.
Further debt reduction remains a 
priority, though capital expenditure 
is expected to remain at the 
elevated level of 2010. Fiberweb is 
in negotiations to conclude a sale 
and leaseback of the steam and 
chilled water plant commissioned 
in Old Hickory during 2010. It is 
anticipated that the sale price will 
be approximately £15 million. The 
medium-term target of net debt at 
2x EBITDA remains in place, and 
we will strive to make progress 
in this direction while continuing 
the necessary programme of 
investment to improve Fiberweb’s 
competitiveness further.

Fiberweb crop covers are used across the horticultural industry to 
improve yields and harvest earlier, reducing environmental drain 
on irrigation water and protecting early planting against frost and 
elemental impacts. New innovations in farming require support from 
expert suppliers. Wider fields improve efficiency but require new levels 
of protections. To help farmers maximize this potential Fiberweb 
has developed a unique process making rolls up to 28 metres wide 
to reduce coverage times for farmers adopting larger field sizes. 
By understanding new needs, the Fiberweb development process 
continues to support our customers to maximize their outputs and

Fiberweb’s vision is to evolve from 
being exclusively focused on 
nonwovens to become a leading 
global source of speciality technical 
fabric solutions, adding value to 
nonwoven fabrics and related 
products through a variety of 
processes which allow us, in 
partnership with customers, 
suppliers and other associates, to 
create products and solutions that 
offer outstanding value in selected 
market segments and applications.
Our strategy is to create and 
sustain value for shareholders 
through our strengths in developing, 
producing and applying technical 
fabrics and related products, 
building on our deep knowledge of 
selected markets, applications and 
customers.
We will continue the steady 
improvement in our financial 
performance by:
•  investing in strong businesses 
with the potential for sustainable 
differentiation and good growth 
prospects; and
•  Closing or divesting weak 
businesses and assets that 
cannot earn sustainable returns.
We seek to drive profitable growth 
and enhance our competitive 
position by:
•  identifying customer needs and 
defining novel, better solutions;
•  Enhancing our reputation for 
outstanding global service for 
customers;
•  improving cost competitiveness 
and operational efficiency on a 
global scale; and
•  Working with our suppliers to 
manage cost and risk in the 
supply base.
Our belief is that good prospects lie 
in exploiting Fiberweb’s strong 
technical, brand and market share 
positions in important segments of 
the large and growing market for 
technical fabrics and related 
products, particularly in filtration 
and speciality construction 
segments that reward technical 
differentiation, close customer 
contact, branding and innovation.
There are further industrial 
segments that offer good profit 
potential but enjoy lower growth or 
geographically-limited markets, 
such as fabric softener sheets in 
North america. These can also offer 
attractive returns and will be 
developed within the market 
constraints.
There are also attractive segments 
for Fiberweb within the hygiene 
market, where scale, manufacturing 
excellence and innovation can 
produce competitive advantage. in 
particular, Fiberweb has traditional 
strength in spunbond and speciality 
carded fabrics for baby diapers and 
in absorbent airlaid fabrics for 
feminine care applications. These 
are key market areas where 
reasonable returns are available to 
the best competitors.

Business Review continued
Our markets, Trends and External Environment
The technical fabrics market is 
diverse with an extremely wide 
range of end applications. Regional 
penetration, competition and 
potential growth can vary widely 
depending on the product areas and 
geography concerned.
Within technical fabrics, the 
nonwovens industry has grown 
steadily over the last three decades 
as these materials are increasingly 
used as a substitute for woven 
textiles and as products containing 
nonwovens, notably disposable 
hygiene products, have gained 
increasing penetration in emerging 
market areas. Technological 
advancements allow nonwovens to 
be used in new applications by 
improvements in properties such as 
comfort, strength, flexibility, 
durability and permeability.
Markets
Fiberweb operates in two main 
markets, namely hygiene and 
industrial. Hygiene markets 
continue to exhibit, in general, the 
overall stable medium-term growth 
that has been seen in the past.  
The long-standing trend to lower 
basis weights (i.e. lighter fabrics)  
in response to rising raw material 
costs is expected to continue.
The hygiene market, where steady 
3-5% medium term growth is 
anticipated, is characterised by a 
concentrated and sophisticated 
customer base. large multinational 
customers maintain very high 
standards of product quality and 
performance and expect nothing 
less from their suppliers. Fiberweb 
supports this philosophy and strives 
to innovate and manufacture world 
class nonwoven products and 
deliver world class levels of value 
and service.
Technological developments 
towards better value products have 
continued to progress during 2010 
and are expected to be maintained 
in the medium-term. The drive to 
improve fabric performance at lower 
weight (i.e. with the use of smaller 
quantities of polymer) continues to 
be the most significant trend. There 
are also moves amongst some 
hygiene product producers to 
examine the use of sustainable raw 
materials. These trends will impact 
Fiberweb’s hygiene business and 
choice of technology and R&d 
investment as lighter-weight fabrics 
demand more sophisticated 
equipment and control systems.
The industrial markets served by 
Fiberweb are varied and in most 
cases development has been as 
expected. The most difficult 
industrial market is undoubtedly the 
US residential construction market, 
with issues that have been well 
publicised. as a result of significant 
falls in new housing starts, market 
pressures have been considerable 
in housewrap and in construction-
related areas of landscape fabrics 
and pool filtration. While 
measurements of market share are 
difficult, it is notable that Fiberweb 
experienced much lower volume 
declines than the fall in overall 
market demand as represented by 
new housing starts. a similar 
demand trend was also observed in 
European housing markets.
The industrial market is not only 
fragmented but the level of 
technical expertise and competition 
varies depending on the application. 
Key to success in the industrial 
business is the ability to respond 
rapidly and effectively to customer 
needs for improving value and 
performance, often at short notice.     Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REp ORT aNd FiNaNCial STa TEmENTS 2010    17    Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010    17 17

External factors
Following the extreme economic 
conditions at the end of 2008 and 
the beginning of 2009, 2010 saw less 
volatility in the cost of Fiberweb’s 
most significant raw material, 
polypropylene. However, 
polypropylene prices did increase 
overall during the year, and a long 
term trend of increasing oil prices 
and the knock on effect on 
polypropylene is expected to 
continue in the medium and long-
term. We seek to manage this 
volatile situation through 
contractual pass-through 
arrangements as well as fixed price 
contracts and financial hedging 
arrangements where appropriate 
and reasonably priced. Hedging 
arrangements cannot always be put 
in place economically and, in these 
situations, Fiberweb needs to rely 
on pricing actions to maintain its 
margins where this is possible. in 
industrial markets, Fiberweb can in 
general move prices freely, subject 
to the competitive environment and 
agreements with customers, while 
in hygiene markets, long-term raw 
material pass-through contracts are 
typically in place with major 
customers accounting for around 
80% of Fiberweb’s business in this 
sector, which only allow quarterly 
adjustments to prices. Therefore, 
Fiberweb can be exposed  
financially to the impact of at least 
three months’ increase in raw 
material costs.
another key trend impacting 
Fiberweb’s hygiene business is the 
continued growth in emerging 
markets as the market penetration 
of disposable hygiene products 
continues to rise. This will impact 
Fiberweb’s geographic investment 
plans and potentially the choice of 
technology from lower-cost 
sources.
The long-term growth of technical 
fabrics in industrial applications 
continues to appear to be secure, 
despite current negative pressures 
on volumes from the economic 
cycle. demands for higher water 
and air quality continue to drive 
growth in filtration and demands for 
improved housing and infrastructure 
for much of the world’s population 
continue to drive the increased use 
of nonwovens in construction 
worldwide, both for housing and in 
the use of geotextiles in 
infrastructure for example.
Competitive environment
The competitive environment of the 
technical fabrics and nonwovens 
industry is constantly changing, with 
technological innovations and the 
development of new markets and 
applications. although Fiberweb has 
a strong position with its broad 
product portfolio and global 
presence, it faces competition at 
various levels depending on the 
application, emphasising the need 
for continuing investment in 
research and the development of 
new products.
There is a long-term trend  
towards consolidation in the 
nonwovens industry, as there can be 
advantages from scale, a broader 
geographic presence and a broader 
technology spread in meeting 
customer demands. Fiberweb has 
participated in this trend on 
occasion, but could also be 
negatively impacted if competitors 
consolidate to gain a scale 
advantage in areas such as polymer 
purchasing or relationships with 
global customers seeking global 
supplier partners.

The primary purpose of Fiberweb’s 
Research and development 
department is to provide innovation 
to Fiberweb’s customers by 
optimising the performance of 
existing products and processes and 
by developing new, more cost 
efficient solutions.
For our industrial businesses, 
Fiberweb’s R&d efforts continue to 
focus on spunbond and meltblown 
platform technologies, product 
innovations, portfolio depth and 
breadth, new markets and 
manufacturing processes. Recent 
developments include:
• Surround SR™, a new synthetic 
roof underlayment which has 
been successfully launched into 
the roofing product category 
following key US code 
certifications.
• Two new materials were 
developed for liquid filtration 
pleated cartridge applications 
which have been tested and 
certified by NSF, the US certifying 
body for this application.
• a new, cost effective synthetic 
belt technology which improves 
manufacturing yields and process 
uptime.
in Consumer Fabrics, focus has 
been given to developing innovative 
nonwovens with better softness and 
improved surface, extensibility, 
strength and absorbency properties, 
which, in addition to sustainability, 
are the key attributes that our 
hygiene customers are requesting. 
Recent developments include:
• Softness – new polypropylene 
based resin blends consisting of 
technically advanced composites 
of special copolymers and melt 
additives which provide enhanced 
drape and feel.
• Bico fibres – new bi-component 
products based on exclusive 
composites of resins and 
advanced modifiers which provide 
improved softness and 
permanent hydrophilic 
properties.
• d ryness – new durable 
hydrophilic spin finishes which 
resist multiple wetting and offer 
improved dryness in diaper top 
sheets and inner layers.
• Extensibility – significant 
progress has been made towards 
the qualification of proprietary, 
highly extensible spunbond 
fabrics with lubricating properties 
in the diaper manufacturing 
process.
• l ight weight and high strength – 
an improved spinning process 
which enables the spinning of 
finer fibres with improved 
strength in order to produce a 
lower weight fabric.
• airlaid products – several new 
airlaid products were launched in 
2010 including an ultra thin 
absorbent core, super absorbing 
fibres which provide higher 
acquisition speed, zero spillage 
and near 100% homogeneous 
distribution and a hybrid airlaid 
core comprising a synthetic 
acquisition layer.
• Reicofil process improvement – 
work conducted in conjunction 
with Cambridge University to 
improve nonwoven web 
uniformity.
Whereas R&d focuses on upstream 
product and process development 
and important new platform 
technologies, Technical Services 
(“TS”) provides local technical 
support to our customers. Being 
close to customers and their needs 
enables us to anticipate new market 
trends and is a key element of this 
function. The R&d and TS 
departments work closely together 
and responsibility for these aspects 
of product and process development 
is co-ordinated globally between the 
respective departments in Europe, 
the US and asia.
Overall, Fiberweb continues to 
invest significantly in R&d to 
maintain its leading market 
positions as is shown by our major 
investment in the design and 
construction of the new R&d Centre 
at our Old Hickory, Tennessee plant 
which has progressed with start-up 
of the semi-commercial pilot line

Review of Results
Revenue
Revenue – continuing operations increased by 2%
Revenue from continuing operations 
increased by 2% to £463.2 million 
(2009: £454.2 million). In the prior 
year, revenue included £27.9 
million from the Washougal and 
Mexico entities contributed to the 
FitesaFiberweb joint venture. At 
constant currency, and excluding the 
sales in 2009 of the Washougal and 
Mexico entities, sales were £41.2 
million (9.8%) above the prior year. 
Revenue – Industrial increased by 3.3%
The Industrial division experienced an 
overall volume increase of 6.3%, 
primarily in the US. Total American 
Industrial volumes increased by 9.5% 
year on year. European Industrial 
volumes increased by 4.7%. In 
revenue terms, total division sales 
increased by 5% overall to £188.7 
million on a constant currency basis. 
Revenue – Hygiene increased by 1.9%
The Hygiene division includes the 
Group’s global Consumer Fabrics 
businesses and Airlaid in China. 
Overall Hygiene volumes increased 
by 1.9% compared to 2009 after 
adjusting for the impact of the 
FitesaFiberweb JV, with sales up by 
11.8% reflecting the higher raw 
material prices. On a constant 
currency basis, sales of £274.5 
million were 12.3% higher than the 
like-for-like 2009 sales. Airlaid 
volumes were 15.5% higher than the 
prior year with sales 22.5% higher. 
Hygiene sales revenues are impacted 
by the volatility in raw material prices 
and the delayed impact of contractual 
pass through arrangements which 
distorts the relationship with 
underlying trading volumes.
Underlying Operating Profit
Underlying operating profit increased by 25.5%
Underlying operating profit 
increased by 25.5% from £23.1 
million to £29.0 million, while at 
constant currency, growth in 
underlying operating profit was 26%. 
Growth in underlying margins 
continues with a 6.3% operating 
margin compared to 5.1% for 2009.
Industrial margins increased to 10.5%
Industrial margins increased from 8.1% 
to 10.5%. European industrial margins 
reduced slightly to 9.7% from 10.6% 
reflecting increased raw material prices 
and mix. Americas Industrial margins 
increased from 5.7% to 12.2% resulting 
from significant volume growth of circa 
10% and improved mix. 
Hygiene margins increased to 6.3%
Hygiene margins strengthened to 
6.3%, with improvements in Europe 
offset with a decline in margin in the 
US reflecting higher raw material 
prices. Margins in China Airlaid 
increased from 4.3% to 4.8%.
Raw Materials
Raw material costs are a significant 
cost component representing 
approximately 50% of Group 
revenues. They are largely dictated  
by external factors including the oil 
price, from which propylene and 
polypropylene are derived, as well as 
demand and capacity issues at 
various points along the 
petrochemical supply chain. 
Prices increased about 28% versus 
the beginning of the year during the 
first half of 2010 and then declined 
and stabilised during the second 
half of 2010 resulting in a net 
annual increase of 22%. The Group 
actively manages the volatility 
caused by movement in raw 
material prices with hedging 
transactions. These arrangements 
reduced the impact of the 
increasing prices by some £10.4 
million during the year and included 
forward or fixed price contracts as 
well as financial derivatives. 
Approximately 50% of revenues are 
subject to contractual pass-through 
arrangements, comprising the 
majority of hygiene revenues and 
excluding industrial revenues which 
do not attract contractual pass- 
through arrangements.
Restructuring Costs and  
Non-Recurring Items
Restructuring costs and non-recurring items fell to 
£6.5 million
Restructuring costs and non-
recurring items fell to £6.5 million

severance costs across the Group  
from the completion of the 
restructuring programmes offset  
by a gain of £0.6m on the disposal of 
previously impaired assets from our 
Korma site in Italy following its 
closure. In addition, £3.7 million of 
transaction costs and related 
professional fees were incurred with 
the acquisition of Boddingtons,  
which completed in January 2011, 
and an aborted acquisition 
opportunity. Impairment charges of 
£1.3 million were recognised  
relating to the write down of a 
number of IT assets in our US 
business following the closure of a 
data centre. An impairment charge 
of £0.6 million was recorded on the 
transfer of Old Hickory Steamworks 
to assets held for sale reflecting fair 
value less costs to sell. In addition, 
the investment in our associate in 
India was impaired (£0.6 million).  
The Group’s share of non-recurring 
costs in the FitesaFiberweb joint 
venture was £0.1 million.
The Group recognised gains of  
£0.7 million on the ineffective portion 
of the mark-to-market valuation 
adjustment in respect of 
polypropylene hedges. 
Cash Flow
Net cash flow from operating activities
Net cash flow from operating 
activities was again strong at £37.7 
million (2009: £50.6 million) as a 
result of improved margins. In recent 
years, reductions in working capital 
have contributed significantly to 
operating cash flow, while in 2010, 
due to increases in raw material 
costs and sales growth, working 
capital increased by £4.3 million. 
Working capital management 
remains a key focus for the Group 
and working capital at 14.6% sales 
was slightly better than the Group’s 
target of 15%.
Working capital as a percentage of annualised sales
Investment
Capital investment of £33.2 million 
(2009: £27.0 million) increased 
significantly to secure competitive 
manufacturing and product 
development infrastructure for the 
future. During 2010, the Europe 
Industrial business benefited from the 
successful upgrade of a large industrial 
spunbond line in Berlin at the half year 
which ran at full utilization in the 
second half. In addition, £4.6m was 
invested in the construction of a new 
research and development facility in 
Old Hickory in the US. In August 2010, 
a new utilities plant at Old Hickory was 
completed and commissioned 
providing Fiberweb’s large 
manufacturing operation on the site 
with a secure and cost effective 
source of steam and chilled water. 
Fiberweb is in negotiations to 
conclude a sale and leaseback of  
that facility. It is anticipated that the 
sale price will be approximately  
£15 million.
Net Debt
Net debt increased 
Net debt at year-end was £151.2 
million (2009: £136.6 million). 
Restated in constant currency, net 
debt at 31 December 2009 was 
£139.1 million. 
During the year, the Group entered 
into a new Revolving Credit Facility. 
As part of this refinancing, the Group 
terminated the interest rate swaps on 
the old facility recognising an 
additional liability of £5.4 million.
Net debt of £151.2 million (2009: 
£136.6 million) increased by £14.6 
million as reported due to higher 
capital investment, together with the 
£5.4 million cost of the termination of 
interest rate swaps relating to the old 
loan facility in July as mentioned above.
The Group has set a target of reducing 
net debt to a maximum of two times 
EBITDA over the medium term. We 
intend to achieve this through 
improvements in operating cash flow as 
well as tight control of capital expenditure. 
During the year the Group drew down 
£10.7 million (2009: drew down £4.2 
million) of the debt advanced under 
the Group’s Revolving Credit Facility. 
The Group has drawn down against 
the facility to fund reinvestment in 
new assets and business ventures. 
We will seek to continue to reduce 
borrowings where possible and 
without damaging the long term 
growth plans for the business. 
Profit Before Tax 
Underlying profit before tax from continuing operations 
increased by 22.5% 
After net finance costs of £15.4 
million (2009: £12.0 million), 
Fiberweb generated underlying profit 
before tax from continuing 
operations of £13.6 million (2009: 
£11.1 million), an increase of 22.5%. 
The Group recorded a net tax charge 
for the year on underlying profits of 
£0.3 million (2009: £0.8 million credit). 
Excluding the credit of £4.7 million 
(2009: £4.0 million) in respect of the 
partial recognition of a deferred tax 
asset in respect of US tax losses and 
other timing differences, the underlying 
tax charge was £5.0 million (2009: £3.2 
million), representing an underlying 
effective tax rate of 36.8% (2009: 29%). 
The effective rate reflects the inclusion 
of the Group’s share of post-tax profits 
from the FitesaFiberweb joint venture, 
a benefit which is reflected in the 
Group’s reported earnings per share.

Review of Financial Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs)
We measure the achievement of our 
objectives through the use of 
qualitative assessments and through 
the monitoring of quantitative 
indicators, termed Key performance 
indicators (“Kpis”). The seven Kpis 
listed below represent factors by 
reference to which the development, 
performance or position of the 
business can be measured 
effectively.
We focus primarily on financial Kpis 
to measure progress in achieving 
the financial turnaround. 
Continuing underlying operating 
margins have increased by 120 
basis points to 6.3% from 5.1% last 
year reflecting a continued focus on 
cost savings and efficiencies and the 
impact of prior year restructuring 
action. 
Earnings growth was positive as a 
result of the margin improvement, 
with continuing adjusted EpS up at 
10.8 pence per share (2009: 9.7 pence 
per share), returning year on year 
growth of 11.3%. Excluding the 
deferred tax credit of £5.0 million 
(2009: £4.0 million) in respect of US 
temporary differences, adjusted 
earnings per share were 7.0 pence 
(2009: 6.5 pence). 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) 
increased from 7.5% to 8.8%. This is 
attributable to improving operating 
margins notwithstanding significant

capital investment in upgrading 
plant technology. ROCE, defined as 
underlying operating profit from 
continuing business in the last 12 
months against total equity and net 
debt, is considered an appropriate 
measure against which to monitor 
the group’s improving performance.
at constant currency, Industrial 
revenue increased by 5%. in addition, 
underlying operating profit margins 
improved significantly to 10.5% from 
8.1%, driven by a particularly strong 
performance in Europe, as well as an 
improvement in the US.
an important Kpi in managing the 
operating cash of the business is 
trading working capital expressed 
as a percentage of annualised 
sales, which, at the year end was 
14.6% (2009: 15.4%). The group 
continues to target reductions in 
working capital as a percentage of 
revenue, although future reductions 
are unlikely to be of the same 
magnitude given the notable 
reductions over 2008 and 2009.  
Operating cash flow, a critical 
measure, was £37.7 million (2009: 
£50.6 million). This strong cash 
performance is attributable both to 
improving operating margins and 
also to the continued focus on 
working capital management. 
Interest Charge and Borrowings 
Net finance costs were £15.4 million 
(2009: £12.0 million). in view of the 
low returns now available on cash 
deposits, the group’s focus is to 
minimise debt draw downs. 
a new loan facility was entered into 
in February 2010 (“the new RCF”) 
which has a term of 3½ years until 
July 2013, for an amount of circa £210 
million, comprising multi-currency 
facilities of €110 million and US$170 
million. interest rates are at prevailing 
market rates. The covenants under 
the new facility include an EBiTda/net 
debt gearing covenant of 3.0x and an 
interest cover covenant of 5.0x for the 
majority of the term of the new 
facility, with more relaxed covenants 
during the initial period. Covenant 
tests are required quarterly under the 
new facility compared to six-monthly 
under the original RCF. 
Taxation
a tax charge of £0.3 million (2009: 
£0.8 million credit) on underlying 
operations includes partial 
recognition of US deferred tax of £4.7 
million (2009: £4.0 million). Excluding 
the deferred tax credit, the tax charge 
is £5.0 million (2009: £3.2 million) 
which represents an underlying tax 
rate of 36.8% (2009: 29%). The partial 
recognition of the deferred tax assets 
in the US follows the third profitable 
year in the US since demerger, with 
forecast profitability now 
underpinning the group’s ability to 
benefit from brought forward tax 
losses as we continue to move ahead. 
Cash Flow, Net Debt and Liquidity 
Net cash from operating activities 
was £37.7 million (2009: £50.6 
million). The net cash inflow in the 
year was £2.6 million (2009: £3.7 
million), after £33.2 million of capital 
expenditure (2009: £27.0 million), 
£7.9 million of net interest payments 
(2009: £9.3 million) and shareholder 
dividends of £5.2 million (2009: £5.1 
million). 
The group received £1.3 million in 
respect of the disposal of production 
equipment at aqF and £0.6 million in 
proceeds from the sale of previously 
impaired production equipment at 
Korma (2009: £3.8 million for impaired 
assets at Simpsonville and Terram). 
Cash from operating activities was 
impacted by a £4.3 million working 
capital outflow from higher working 
capital reflecting high volumes and 
higher raw materials prices (2009: 
£15.3 million working capital inflow). 
Treasury 
The group’s policy is to hedge its 
interest exposure and it has entered 
into interest rate hedges for its 
exposure to both US dollar and 
Euro floating interest rates under 
the RCF. These interest hedges 
account for more than 66% of the 
debt under the RCF. as part of the 
refinancing, the group terminated 
interest rate swaps on the old 
facility recognising an additional 
liability of £5.4 million. These were 
replaced with new swaps reflecting 
the terms of the new RCF.
The group can consider hedging a 
proportion of the translation risk 
relating to earnings when this 
appears to be advantageous. There 
is limited transactional exposure as 
there is relatively little trading 
across currency borders. The bulk 
of raw material sourcing and other 
purchases are in the currency of 
operation, and the total volume of 
the group’s business which is 
affected by relative currency 
movements is less than 10% of its 
turnover. it is the group’s policy to 
hedge those exposures which are 
material for a period of up to 12 
months, using a specified range of 
financial instruments. Refer to note 
21 of the consolidated financial 
statements for more information on 
the group’s foreign currency risk. 
The group seeks to match the same 
proportional allocation between US 
dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona of 
debt drawn down under the RCF as 
applies between the net operating      Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010    29

Credit Risk
The group has a history of limited bad 
debts and it is believed its major 
customers are of good credit quality. 
Credit insurance is used in most 
markets. However, the inevitable 
consequence of the recent 
recessionary environment means  
that the group will increasingly 
assume balance sheet risk for some 
trading customers for whom credit 
insurance is either restricted or 
unavailable. The group adopts a 
prudent policy for reviewing and 
advancing credit and for ensuring 
adequate provision for bad debts. 
Refer to note 16 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for further 
information in respect of the group’s 
credit risk.
Shareholder Fund Movements
Shareholder funds were created 
upon demerger from BBa. The 
group has equity of £178.6 million 
(2009: £172.6 million). Of these 
reserves, £76.2 million (2009: £82.7 
million) are distributable reserves.
Retirement Benefits
The major retirement benefits or 
pension schemes are now defined 
contribution schemes, with the two 
most notable exceptions described 
more fully in note 23 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Simpsonville, North Carolina 
scheme is now closed to new 
entrants and benefits are frozen to 
current members; the Washougal, 
Washington scheme is a relatively 
small defined benefit scheme, and 
benefits were frozen to current 
members when the business and 
employees were transferred to 
FitesaFiberweb in July 2009. The 
group retains responsibility for the 
scheme deficit as at the point of 
transfer.
The net pension liability is calculated 
by the group’s actuaries, and is 
based on the fair value of the 
schemes’ assets and the present 
value of the schemes’ liabilities. 
This net liability increased by £0.6 
million during the year to £35.5 
million (2009: £34.9 million), with 
exchange losses of £1.2 million 
(2009: £4.2 million) offsetting 
actuarial losses of £1.2 million 
(2009: £4.9 million). Contributions 
paid totalled £4.3 million (2009: £3.7 
million). The group expects to make 
cash contributions of £3.7 million in 
2011. Non-cash net interest on 
pension liabilities was £1.7 million 
(2009: £2.3 million). 
Principal Accounting Policies
The accounting policies used to 
prepare the Consolidated Financial 
Statements are set out in detail in 
note 2 on pages 62 to 67.
Principal Risks & Uncertainties 
The following are the most 
significant risks identified by the 
Board and management:
1. Raw material costs
Raw materials represent the single 
most important input for the 
group’s production, representing 
approximately 50% of sales. 
although there are a variety of raw 
materials used by the group, the 
key raw materials are polypropylene 
and polyester. The prices of 
polypropylene and polyester are 
volatile and depend primarily on the 
price of crude oil and monomer and 
polymer manufacturing capacity  
and demand. 
Historically, increases in the price of 
polypropylene in particular have put 
pressure on the group’s margins. 
The group is subject to contractual 
pass-through arrangements on 
approximately 50% of revenues 
whereby polypropylene price 
increases or decreases are passed 
on to its customers. These pass-
through arrangements are generally 
subject to a time lag of up to three 
months. There is therefore a 
material exposure to movements in 
raw material prices. Significant 
increases in raw material prices 
that cannot be passed on to 
customers could have a material 
adverse effect on the group’s 
results and financial condition.
The group can mitigate some of this 
risk through pass-through 
arrangements with some customers 
for polypropylene cost changes, 
selective hedging of polypropylene 
purchases and strategic alliances 
with polypropylene producers.
2. Customer and supplier dependency
across certain markets in which the 
group operates there is a high degree 
of dependency on maintaining good 
relationships with a relatively small 
number of key customers. The failure 
of the group and its key customers to 
renew contracts could result in a 
significant reduction in the demand for 
its products. This is particularly the  
case for procter & gamble which, 
through a large number of different  30   Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010 
Business Review continued
Financial Review continued
contracts and purchasing 
arrangements of varying durations, 
accounted for approximately 24% of 
sales in 2010. in terms of overall 
concentration, the group’s top ten 
customers accounted for 46% of sales 
in 2010. The failure of one or more of 
these key customers could therefore 
have a material adverse effect on the 
group’s reputation, business, results 
of operations and overall financial 
condition. 
The group has procedures in place  
to monitor and mitigate this risk and, 
historically, has been generally 
successful in agreeing new contracts 
with key customers or extending 
existing contracts. The group 
continues to manage the procter & 
gamble relationship very closely.
Similar dependency arises in 
respect of maintaining regular 
supplies of polypropylene and other 
resins and fibres. The group is 
reliant on a small number of  
critical suppliers in the global 
market. given the limited  
alternative suppliers, a disruption in 
the supply chain could lead to the 
group being unable to satisfy the 
needs of its customers. The failure 
of one or more of the group’s key 
suppliers could therefore have a 
material adverse effect on the 
group’s reputation, business, 
results of operations and overall 
financial condition. The group  
seeks to mitigate this risk through 
diversity of supply and by 
negotiating group wide contracts. 
The group is also reliant on one 
specialist supplier, Reifenhäuser 
Reicofil gmbH & Co. Kg 
(“Reifenhäuser”), for their 
manufacturing lines. The 
manufacturing lines are typically 
made to order and components 
would not be easily replaced should 
the supplier fail to deliver the 
products. However, almost all of the 
important individual components of 
a line can be sourced from a variety 
of suppliers. Therefore, whilst the 
bankruptcy of, or a significant 
dispute with Reifenhäuser could 
lead to significant disruption to 
investment plans of the group,  
such events would not be likely to 
impact the ongoing operations of 
the business of the group.
3. Economics, market and trading 
conditions
group sales, expenses and 
operating results could vary 
significantly from period to period 
as a result of a variety of factors, 
some of which are outside the 
group’s control. These factors 
include general economic 
conditions, conditions specific to the 
market and conditions specific to 
the group. a negative change in 
economic conditions in the group’s 
customer markets, including, for 
example, a downturn in the 
Canadian housing market, 
deterioration in consumer 
confidence or new products and 
processes entering the group’s 
market place, could adversely 
impact the group’s business. 
in addition, significant increases in 
energy costs, the cost of transport 
and distribution and employment 
costs in the locations where the 
group’s manufacturing sites are 
based could adversely impact the 
profitability of the group. 
Significant fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates can have a 
material impact on the group’s 
business, results of operations and 
overall financial position. The group 
operates globally, with the majority of 
its revenues earned outside the UK 
and with significant investments 
around the world. as a result, the 
group is subject to currency 
translation risk due to movements 
between various currencies (mainly 
the US dollar and the Euro) and its 
reporting currency, Sterling. in 
addition, the majority of the revenues 
of one of the FitesaFiberweb joint 
venture companies, Fitesa Brazil, are 
in Brazilian Reals and a significant 
proportion of its debt is denominated 
in US dollars. The Real has over 
many years displayed significant 
volatility against both the US dollar 
and Sterling. in order to reduce the 
effect of foreign exchange movements 
on its reported earnings, the group 
borrows, where commercially 
appropriate, in the currencies of its 
operations, thus creating a natural 
hedge for a proportion of its balance 
sheet. The group also enters into 
derivative financial instruments in 
currencies that partially hedge its net 
investment values. The group does 
not undertake speculative treasury 
transactions.
4. Financial covenants
The group has financial covenants 
relating to its main source of long-
term funding as set out in note 20  
of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and as discussed in the 
directors’ Report on page 42. The 
group expects to comply with these 
covenants. in the event that forecast 
profitability is not achieved, the 
continued need to comply with these 
covenants could restrict the 
operational flexibility and 
management decisions of the group.      Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010    31
There is also a risk that the group’s 
long-term funding would need to be 
renegotiated with its debt-providers 
to ensure the continued operations of 
the group and there could be no 
guarantee that such a renegotiation 
would be possible on commercially 
acceptable terms or that the  
group would be able to successfully 
re-finance the relevant debt. 
The group manages compliance 
with these covenants through 
careful monitoring of operating 
performance and cash flows, 
regular forecasts of future 
performance and tight management 
of capital expenditure.
5. Competition
The group faces competition from 
global competitors that provide 
similar products to those offered by 
the group. Competition in the industry 
is based upon: range and quality of 
products offered; the ability to deliver 
new products; geographical reach; 
reputation; price; and customer 
relationships. The hygiene market is 
characterised by large customers and 
some production over-capacity with 
the result that there is strong 
competition to secure contracts with 
these large customers. While these 
risks have not changed in nature over 
recent periods, prices and demand in 
the group’s markets could be 
negatively affected if existing 
competitors increase their supply,  
or if new competitors enter the 
market with new products and/or 
favourable cost structures, or if 
important customers reduce demand 
or request significantly reduced 
prices. in response to a changing 
competitive environment, the group 
may need from time to time to make 
certain pricing, service or marketing 
decisions that could have an adverse 
effect on its sales, results of 
operations and overall financial 
condition.
This risk is mitigated by the actions 
described at 2 above. 32   Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010

Corporate Social Responsibility
Fiberweb endeavours to act in a 
socially responsible manner in 
all it does. Our businesses apply 
procedures appropriate to and 
compliant with local laws and 
operating conditions. in all our 
activities, we strive to ensure 
employee safety and we seek to 
protect the environment, public 
and occupational health and 
the communities within which 
we operate, while promoting 
profitability and business growth. 
Training and development 
opportunities and initiatives are 
provided to employees to develop 
and foster the skills, resources and 
knowledge they need to improve our 
business performance.
policies and procedures have been 
established at group level which 
provide a guiding framework for our 
businesses to apply in conjunction 
with local practices. These include 
policies on ethical business practices, 
compliance with anti-trust laws, equal 
opportunities and anti-harassment 
guidelines and disability, amongst 
others. Our market abuse and 
inside information policies govern 
behaviour in respect of share dealing, 
market abuse and dissemination of 
information to the market.
The manufacture of our products 
involves the use of large and 
complex manufacturing equipment 
and the Board attaches great 
importance to the safety and 
wellbeing of all our people. matters 
relating to health and safety 
performance are reviewed and 
discussed at each Board meeting 
and as discussed below, we 
measure and track our employee 
safety record continuously.
Our businesses support the local 
communities in which they operate. 
Examples of some of the initiatives 
our people have been involved in 
during the year are discussed in 
more detail below.
Employees
Fiberweb’s people are one of its 
most important resources. Their 
experience and expertise, their 
commitment to innovation and 
excellence and their drive to 
improve our performance is greatly 
valued.
Fiberweb’s policy is to provide  
equal opportunities for  
employment regardless of gender, 
race, colour, national origin, 
religion, age, marital status, sexual 
orientation or disability. Fiberweb 
takes compliance with anti-
discrimination requirements very 
seriously in all the territories in 
which it operates. all our 
employees, both current and 
prospective, are given full and fair 
consideration for employment, 
training, career development and 
promotion, based on their skills  
and abilities.
Fiberweb believes in open 
communication channels across 
its businesses and employees are 
regularly provided with information 
concerning the performance and 
prospects of their local business 
unit and the global business. 
internet based communications 
are used to provide information 
globally and employee councils 
and other local forums enable 
employees’ views to be heard and 
taken into account. as in previous 
years, in 2010, Fiberweb held a 
senior management conference 
to communicate and discuss the 
progress, challenges and future 
strategy and plans of the business. 
The content of the conference 
was disseminated to employees 
worldwide via a variety of media and 
events.
We have also launched a major 
management development 
programme – Fiberweb xl – to 
ensure that we both retain our most 
talented staff and prepare them for 
new and greater challenges within 
Fiberweb as their careers develop.
Health and Safety
providing a safe and healthy 
working environment for all those 
working at or visiting Fiberweb’s 
facilities remains a high priority and 
a core business value for Fiberweb. 
a focus on HS&E is integral to 
Fiberweb’s operations which aim to 
achieve the goal of zero injuries and 
zero adverse environmental impacts 
while at the same time promoting 
profitability and business growth.
Fiberweb continues to commit 
significant resources to ensure that 
all of its facilities provide a safe and 
healthy working environment for all 
employees and conform to HS&E 
regulations and good management 
practices (“gmp”). Fiberweb’s 
health and safety management 
system has been designed to 
identify workplace hazards and 
ensure proper safety precautions 
are implemented to minimise the 
risks associated with these hazards. 
We recognise that a successful 
health and safety programme is 
dependent on the commitment of all 
of our employees. in 2010, Fiberweb 
actively managed the significant 
physical expansion experienced 
across the group with no related 
injuries and continued compliance 
with strict HS&E regulations. We 
continue to evaluate our health 
and safety programmes and make 
careful and planned enhancements 
when required.
The following key elements provide 
an overview of our health and safety 
programmes and performance.      Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010    33
1. Safety performance metrics
Fiberweb uses several key metrics 
to evaluate the health and safety 
performance of its facilities globally. 
These metrics are analysed to 
identify strengths in health and 
safety programmes and areas that 
need improvement.
The first metric, the Recordable 
injury Rate (“RiR”), calculates the 
rate of recordable injuries per 100 
full-time employees. in 2010, 
Fiberweb maintained an RiR of 1.1 
which is substantially lower than the 
U.S. industry average of 3.0. 
Furthermore, nine facilities globally 
had zero recordable injuries in 2010.
The second metric, the l ost Workday 
Case Rate (“l WCR”), calculates the 
number of lost workday cases per 
100 full time employees. l ost workday 
cases include those cases that result 
in days away from work with or without 
job transfer or restriction. Fiberweb 
recently began using the lWCR 
metric to benchmark against its 
industry. in 2010, Fiberweb’s l WCR 
improved over the previous year to 
0.62, which is substantially lower 
than the US industry average of 1.2.
Fiberweb also tracks the injury 
Severity index, which reflects the 
number of lost workdays per 100 
full-time employees. in 2010 
Fiberweb’s injury Severity remained 
fairly consistent with previous 
reporting years at 26.4. Whilst this 
rate is relatively low, Fiberweb 
continues to focus efforts on 
identifying and mitigating all 
workplace hazards that have the 
potential to result in injury.
The following charts compare 
Fiberweb’s global RiR and lWCR to 
the US industry averages.
2. HS&E Management
as an international group, Fiberweb 
has adopted a consistent and 
systematic approach to managing 
HS&E globally. Fiberweb’s HS&E 
function is managed centrally to 
provide consistent HS&E direction 
and support globally. The global 
Head of HS&E and the HS&E 
Coordinators work to ensure 
consistency when responding 
to both local and global issues 
that arise and communication is 
streamlined to provide more timely 
and effective communication of 
HS&E issues across the group.
in 2010, Fiberweb began the  
process of transforming its  
existing HS&E management  
system into well recognised 
international Standards 
Organisation (iSO) 14001 and 
Occupational Health and Safety 
assessment Series (OHSaS) 18001 
formats. The new management 
system will be designed to 
communicate clear HS&E operating 
and performance expectations and 
share best practices across the

Note: Statistics referenced in this report include Fiberweb and the FitesaFiberweb 
joint venture. The industry average injury rates are obtained from the United States 
department of labor’s Bureau of labor Statistics. as the Bureau publishes injury 
rates at the end of each calendar year, the preceding year’s rates are used for the 
current year. Therefore, industry average injury rates reported for the current year 
will be updated the following year.

group, whilst maintaining alignment 
with business objectives.
Fiberweb has also incorporated a 
three year HS&E strategy plan into 
its HS&E management system  
that outlines the key goals and 
strategies that are needed to achieve 
and sustain Fiberweb’s HS&E 
mission. Through stakeholder 
review, this plan has been designed 
to work in concert with our 
operations’ strategic plan, allowing 
for improved visibility and integration 
of HS&E into the overall business.
3. Compliance Assurance
Fiberweb’s health, safety and 
environmental compliance auditing 
programme provides a 
comprehensive evaluation of 
conformance with internal HS&E 
requirements as well as applicable 
HS&E regulatory requirements. Our 
HS&E compliance audit schedule 
provides each facility with a detailed 
compliance audit once every three 
years and a follow-up audit during 
alternate years. in 2010, Fiberweb 
enhanced its HS&E audit protocol to 
include employee interviews, select 
HS&E management Systems 
elements as well as key US 
Occupational Safety and Health 
administration (“OSHa”) focus areas 
such as electrical safety, 
combustible dust and recordkeeping. 
in 2010, HS&E compliance audits 
were performed at all facilities in the 
americas and China, while follow-up 
audits were performed at all 
European facilities. Since the HS&E 
compliance audits began in 2007, a 
total of 1,926 action items have been 
identified. Fiberweb uses an on-line 
HS&E tracking programme to 
monitor progress on audit action 
items. By the end of 2010 the vast 
majority of the actions identified  
had been completed.
4. Global health and safety 
communications
Fiberweb believes that frequent 
communication is critical to the 
development and execution of its 
HS&E programme. Because of this, 
Fiberweb continues to conduct HS&E 
l ead Team and HS&E Coordinator 
meetings to increase the group-wide 
focus on integrating HS&E into the 
organisation, review performance 
metrics, share HS&E best practices 
and collaborate on HS&E 
improvement initiatives.
5. Process safety management
Whilst Fiberweb facilities are not 
currently required to comply with the 
OSHa process Safety management 
(“pSm”) Standard, our manufacturing 
facilities continue to apply OSHa’s 
pSm principles to facilitate 
recognition and control of process 
hazards. Fiberweb strongly believes 
that employee participation in the 
Hazard and Operability (“HaZOp”) 
studies allows for the production of 
comprehensive analyses of operations 
and builds participants’ abilities to 
identify process hazards and 
implement appropriate engineering 
and administrative controls. in 2010,  
eight initial HaZOp studies were 
conducted globally, bringing the  
total number of HaZOp’s completed 
to over thirty. in addition to these 
formal HaZOp studies, sites have 
conducted numerous process Safety 
assessments which utilise  
technology specific checklists to 
recognise and control risks 
associated with changing equipment 
or materials.
6. Near Miss Reporting
Fiberweb utilises several leading 
indicator safety metrics, one of 
which is near miss reporting. 
Fiberweb recognises that reporting 
near misses is a critical  
component of injury prevention 
and in 2010 the online reporting 
system was updated and awareness 
of the programme was reinforced 
across the group. These initiatives 
have resulted in a 60% increase 
in reporting within the first year. 
To ensure that these gains are 
sustained, additional programme 
enhancements followed by pilot 
studies are scheduled for  
selected facilities.
7. Resource exchange process
in 2009, Fiberweb developed the 
HS&E Resource Exchange 
programme (REx) for its facilities  
in the americas. The REx 
programme was designed to 
promote the professional 
development of site HS&E 
Coordinators, to exchange HS&E 
management information across the 
group and to assess HS&E 
compliance at Fiberweb’s facilities. 
Through structured meetings and 
assignments, the REx programme 
promotes interaction between HS&E 
Coordinators and site leadership 
and allows facilities to share best 
practice. in 2010 the REx 
programme was implemented 
across all sites in the americas  
and will be expanded in 2011 to all 
other Fiberweb facilities.
8. “Back to Basics III” (“B2B3”)  
safety initiative
developed in 2007, the “Back to 
Basics” safety initiative has provided 
a positive impact and focus on      Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010    35
health and safety by addressing the 
historical root causes of injuries and 
identifying hazards with potentially 
high severity. Over the years, this 
initiative has been enhanced to 
address the HS&E management 
needs of the organisation. in 2010, 
the third generation of the 
programme, “B2B3 Recognising 
Critical Behaviours” was deployed 
across the group. This third 
generation of the initiative utilises a 
“Critical activity Card” which 
provides users with a consistent 
approach to controlling our top five 
critical behaviours and activities at 
our facilities. it is also used to 
collect data for the purpose of 
trending safe and unsafe 
behaviours. The tools and processes 
within the Back to Basics initiative 
are being integrated into Fiberweb’s 
new HS&E management system.
9. Awards and recognition
The green Bay, Wisconsin facility 
has maintained its outstanding 
HS&E performance over the years 
and remains Fiberweb’s benchmark 
for HS&E. The facility has been 
recognised locally and nationally 
for its HS&E achievements. in 
addition to maintaining OSHa’s 
prestigious vpp STaR status, the 
facility has received the “Certificate 
of Safety Excellence” and the 
“Outstanding achievement award” 
by the Wisconsin Safety Council. 
additionally, the facility has now 
operated for more than eight years 
without a recordable injury and over 
13 years without a lost workday 
case. Several other Fiberweb 
facilities have made impressive 
HS&E achievements such as 
receiving iSO 14001 registration and 
OHSaS 18001 certification, being 
recognised by local governments  
for environmental improvements 
and energy conservation and 
operating for several years without 
recordable injuries.
The Environment
Fiberweb is committed to 
developing and promoting products 
and processes that reduce waste 
and adverse environmental  
impacts. This includes both the 
efficient use of materials and 
energy in product design and 
development and an awareness of 
the effect on the environment of our 
manufacturing processes.
Fiberweb encourages each of its 
facilities to develop its own 
environmental programmes and to 
work towards reducing its 
environmental impact. We continue 
to focus on identifying and improving 
performance in key areas of 
environmental impact, which include 
waste reduction, energy 
consumption, water consumption, the 
use of recycled and biodegradable 
materials and packaging.
Our businesses are encouraged  
to report all environmental  
impacts and key performance 
information is collected twice a  
year through the Environmental 
index, an electronic data collection 
system. The data is collated 
annually and provides a means by 
which our businesses can evaluate 
their environmental performance 
and set improvement targets. in 
2010, Fiberweb reviewed the  
current key environmental 
performance indicators (Kpis) in 
order to re-evaluate the type of 
information that is being collected. 
as a result, additional information 
related to energy consumption, 
environmental management 
and community/social programs 
were added to the Environmental 
index and the new system will be 
implemented during 2011.
data on the global business 
environmental impacts for 2010 will 
be available during the first half of 
2011.
at our facility in Old Hickory, USa 
an inefficient coal-fired steam plant 
has been replaced with a state-of-
the-art natural gas-fired central 
utilities plant which commenced 
operation in august 2010. The 
new plant will produce the steam 
and chilled water required by the 
facility in a more efficient and 
environmentally friendly manner 
which will significantly reduce 
emissions and energy consumption.
at FitesaFiberweb’s facility in mexico, 
polypropylene resin, the key raw 
material used in the manufacture of 
nonwovens at this facility, was 
previously delivered by truck with 
about 750 deliveries needed each 
year. The addition of a rail spur at 
this facility was completed in 2010 
which will allow for the more 
efficient delivery of polypropylene 
resin. d elivery by rail car will 
significantly reduce the emissions 
and resources associated with the 
large number of truck deliveries 
previously needed.
Sustainability and the  
Supply Chain
Fiberweb continues to work actively 
to design and develop products that 
promote sustainable development 
principles and do not adversely   36   Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010 
impact the environment or the 
health and safety of the 
communities it serves. This is 
pursued primarily through our R&d 
innovation strategy as well as 
centralised procurement or, where 
this is impractical, local sourcing. 
Sustainability plays an important 
role in our research and 
development activities where we 
seek to develop ways to reduce raw 
material usage and energy 
consumption and work with 
customers and suppliers to develop 
products with improved sustainability.
Fiberweb actively seeks to develop 
and market products which use 
renewable and recycled materials. 
in recent years Fiberweb has made 
considerable strides in the area of 
sustainable, renewable products 
involving polylactic acid and other 
biopolymers. Fiberweb’s product 
Ecofabrics
®
 is based on the world’s 
first greenhouse-gas neutral 
polymer and forms the basis for 
sustainable nonwoven products, 
replacing oil-based fibres. We have 
identified wood based lignin as a 
very interesting and potentially 
useful raw polymer source. We are 
investigating ways to reduce the 
consumption of oil-based polymers 
through the use of inorganic filler 
pigments. Recycling of in-house and 
external production waste is also an 
attractive, environmentally-friendly 
method of producing sustainable 
products and a new project to 
enable the consumption of 
bi-component and carded waste 
was launched in 2010.
Fiberweb also manufactures  
eco-friendly building products  
that support sustainable building 
practices and developments.  
For example, Fiberweb’s TYpaR
®
 
Weather protection System 
contributes to the US requirements 
for the Energy Star
®
 qualified New 
Home programme as an important 
component in the air sealing and 
insulating category. This 
programme can reduce heating and 
cooling costs by as much as 20%. 
These building products can also 
contribute to the US green Building 
Council’s leadership in Energy and 
Environmental design (lEEd) 
certification points in both lEEd – 
New Construction (commercial) and 
the pilot program lEEd for Homes 
(residential).
Fiberweb also participates in a 
number of sustainability-related 
initiatives of our stakeholders, 
including our suppliers and 
investor groups. in 2010, Fiberweb 
participated in the 2010 Carbon 
disclosure project (Cdp) for 
the first time. The data used to 
support Fiberweb’s responses to 
the Cdp and customer surveys 
is collected by the Environmental 
index. Fiberweb also participated 
in a life cycle assessment (lCa) to 
assess the environmental impact 
of its products and improve their 
environmental performance. 
Fiberweb’s participation in these 
activities will assist in evaluating our 
environmental performance, as well 
as engaging our stakeholders on 
sustainability issues.
Social and Community Matters
Fiberweb’s businesses are 
encouraged to become involved with 
their local communities through 
a range of organisations and 
initiatives. Examples of the support 
given in 2010 are:
• in our US operations our 
employees continue to support 
their local communities in a 
variety of ways including the 
donation of equipment and 
voluntary work for local schools 
and organisations. Fiberweb 
teamed up with Extreme 
makeover: Home Edition and 
local volunteers to rebuild the 
pre-school centre at the 
l ighthouse Christian School near 
Nashville, Tennessee. The pre-
school centre was completely 
destroyed in the Tennessee floods 
in may 2010 which took the lives 
of several residents and caused 
extensive property damage 
throughout the Nashville area. 
Fiberweb contributed its TYpaR
®
 
Weather protection System 
consisting of 36,000 square feet of 
TYpaR
®
 HouseWrap as well as 
TYpa R flashings and construction 
tape. The system will help provide 
the pre-school centre with a 
sustainable, high-performance 
building envelope. Fiberweb also 
made a $25,000 donation to the 
Nashville Red Cross to support 
local flood relief efforts. Fiberweb 
also encouraged its employees to 
donate paid work time to the  
relief effort.
• United Way is a nationally 
recognised, community-based 
organisation in the US that 
provides local funding to a large 
number of smaller charities and 
community services and is the 
officially designated charitable 
organisation that Fiberweb 
sponsors in the US for employee 
contributions. This support is 
provided through employee 
donations.

a final dividend for 2010 of 2.5 pence per share (2009: 2.5 pence

page 108.
Acquisitions and Disposals
On 16 December 2010 the Group agreed to acquire the entire 
issued share capital of Boddingtons International Limited, 
the parent company of the Boddingtons group of companies, 
a leading UK based specialist geosynthetic and accessory 
manufacturer, for a consideration comprising £8.2 million for 
the share capital and the assumption of debt of £0.9 million. 
The acquisition was completed on 6 January 2011 and the 
consideration of £8.2 million has been satisfied by a payment 
of £4.5 million in cash and the issue to existing Boddingtons 
shareholders of 4.5 million new ordinary Fiberweb plc shares, 
representing approximately 3.5% of Fiberweb’s enlarged issued 
share capital.
Capital Structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital of the 
Company, including movements during the year and the number 
of shares in issue at the end of the year, are shown in note 26 on

carries no right to fixed income and each share carries the right 
to one vote at general meetings of the Company. The rights 
attaching to the ordinary shares are defined in the Company’s 
Articles of Association. All issued shares are fully paid.
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares, the 
size of a holding or voting rights, which are all matters governed 
by the Articles of Association. The directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting 
rights. No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital, so far as the directors are aware.
Details of the significant holdings of ordinary shares are shown 
in the table of Substantial Shareholdings on page 42. No shares 
are held by the Fiberweb Employee Benefit Trust. Details of 
employee share schemes are set out in note 25 on page 93.

are contained in the Company’s Articles of Association, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related 
legislation. The Articles themselves may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders.
The powers of the Company’s directors, including any powers 
in relation to the issuing or buying back by the Company of its 
shares, are described in the Company’s Articles of Association, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and 
related legislation and the Schedule of Matters Reserved for 
the Board which can be found on the Company’s website.

circa £210 million multi-currency revolving credit facility 
agreement and the agreements relating to the FitesaFiberweb

Property Values
The directors are of the opinion that the market values of the 
Group’s properties are not substantially different from the 
values included in the Group’s financial statements.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Business Review on pages 13 to 37. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 24 to 31. In addition, notes 20 and 21 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements include the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities and its exposures to liquidity risk. Credit risk 
exposure is discussed in note 16.
In February 2010, the Group entered into a new loan facility 
(“RCF”) provided by a syndicate of several international banks, 
which replaced the original facility and has a term of 3½ years 
until July 2013 comprising a €50 million term loan facility, a 
$170 million revolving credit facility and a €65 million revolving 
credit facility. In April 2010 the facilities were adjusted to 
comprise revolving credit facilities of €110 million and $170 
million. The RCF is subject to the financial covenants set out on 
pages 81 to 84 in note 20. At 31 December 2010, £173.7 million 
(2009: £156.4 million) was drawn down under the RCF.
The Group prepares regular business forecasts and monitors 
its projected compliance with its banking covenants under 
the RCF, which is reviewed by the Board. Forecasts are then 
adjusted for sensitivities which address the principal risks 
to which the Group is exposed, such as fluctuations in raw 
material prices, exchange rates and best estimates of the 
possible impact of the macroeconomic environment on the 
Group’s underlying trading results. Consideration is then given 
to the potential actions available to management to mitigate the 
impact of one or more of the sensitivities. The Group’s central 
and sensitised forecasts, after applying reasonable possible 
adverse variations in trading performance, show that the 
Group is able to operate within the level of the RCF and remain 
covenant compliant. Covenant tests are required quarterly 
under the RCF.
After making enquires, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial 
statements.
Charitable and Political Donations
The Company made no political donations during the year.  
Group donations to charities worldwide were £48,640 (2009: 
£9,000), with UK charities receiving £10,600 (2009: NIL). Charitable 
donations comprise amounts paid in support of local community 
initiatives and charities. The two significant charitable donations 
were a donation of $25,000 to Extreme Makeover: Home Edition 
following severe flooding in the Nashville area and a donation 
of £10,000 to The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of 
Torture in lieu of issuing corporate Christmas cards. Further 
details are set out on pages 36 and 37. No other charitable 
donations were individually material.
Supplier Payment Policy
It is the Company’s and Group’s policy to negotiate terms 
of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each 
transaction, to ensure that the terms of payment are clearly 
understood and it is the Company’s policy to abide by terms of 
payment. Trade creditors of the Group at 31 December 2010 
were equivalent to 50 days’ purchases (2009: 46 days) based 
on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the 
year.
board of Directors
The names of the directors of the Company as at the date of 
this report, together with their dates of appointment, their 
biographical details and details of their skills and experience, 
are shown on pages 38 and 39.
Dan Abrams and Richard Stillwell will retire by rotation under 
the Articles of Association at the Annual General Meeting and 
offer themselves for re-election by shareholders. Mr Stillwell 
does not have a service contract with the Company. Profiles 
of each of Mr Abrams and Mr Stillwell are given on pages 
38 and 39 respectively. The Board considers that each of Mr 
Abrams and Mr Stillwell continues to make an effective and 
valuable contribution to the Board and has demonstrated clear 
commitment to their respective roles (including commitment of 
time for Board and Board Committee meetings).

Directors’ interests 
Details of the directors’ service contracts, remuneration and 
interests in the shares of the Company are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 49 to 54. Other than 
their service contracts, no director had any material interest in 
any contract of significance with any Group company at any time 
during the year.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company entered into a Deed of Indemnity with each 
director of the Company upon their appointment and each Deed 
of Indemnity remains in force at the date of this report. The terms 
of each of these deeds are identical and reflect the statutory 
provisions on indemnities introduced by the Companies (Audit, 
Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004. Under the 
terms of each deed, the Company undertakes to indemnify 
the relevant director, to the fullest extent permitted by law, 
against any and all liability, howsoever caused (including by 
that director’s own negligence), suffered or incurred by that 
director in the course of acting as a director or employee of the 
Company or any member of the Group.
Similarly, the Company entered into a Deed Poll of Indemnity 
in favour of the Company Secretary and persons discharging 
managerial responsibility on 30 October 2006. The terms of 
the Deed Poll are similar to the terms of the Deed of Indemnity 
entered into with the directors.
The Deeds of Indemnity, Deed Poll of Indemnity and the 
Company’s Articles of Association are available for inspection 
during normal business hours at the Company’s registered 
office and will also be available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.

The Company’s fifth Annual General Meeting will be held at

Corporate Governance
Fiberweb plc is committed to complying with the best practice 
principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
adopted by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 (the 
“Code”). The Company considers that it has, during the year ended  
31 December 2010, complied in full with the provisions set out 
in Section 1 of the Code, except in respect of Code provision 
A.4.1, as independent non-executive directors do not form a 
majority of the members of the Nomination Committee. Details 
and explanations of the application of the Code are given later 
in this report.
Incorporated in this report by reference are details of significant 
holdings of and special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital, voting rights, rules relating to the appointment 
and replacement and powers of directors and amendment of 
the Articles of Association of the Company which are set out 
on pages 41 and 42. A going concern statement can be found 
on page 42.
The role of the board
The Board as a whole has responsibility for the success of the 
Company. The Board meets regularly to determine the strategic 
direction of the Group and to review operating, financial and risk 
performance. Specific responsibilities are delegated to Board 
Committees as described later in this report.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board 
that includes approval of the following:
w the Group’s long term objectives and strategy;
w  acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure projects 
above certain thresholds;
w  all guarantees and treasury related transactions above 
certain thresholds;
w  the financial statements and assessment of financial 
performance;
w the Company’s dividend policy;
w  transactions involving the issue or purchase of Company 
shares;
w the Group’s risk management strategy;
w  legal actions brought by or against the Group above certain 
thresholds;
w  appointments to the Board and the appointment of the 
Company Secretary; and
w  Group policies and the scope of delegations to Board 
Committees and executive management of the Group.
The full schedule of matters reserved for the Board can 
be viewed on the Company’s website at www.fiberweb.com.  
The schedule of matters is reviewed on an annual basis. Matters 
outside the scope of the formal schedule of matters are decided 
by management in accordance with the delegated authority 
limits set out in the Group Authority Limits Policy.
In order to ensure that all matters are given due consideration, 
the Board has adopted a schedule of agenda items, which  
is reviewed and updated annually. These agenda items  
include:
w an annual strategy review;
w divisional updates and business plans;
w annual budget setting and approval;
w a review of Group policies; and
w succession planning.
At each meeting, the Board receives information from the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer on 
the performance and results of the Group and individual  
operating businesses, the Group’s current financial position 
and updates on any other significant matters. The Divisional 
Presidents and Heads of Functions present to the Board from 
time to time and other senior managers and the Company 
Secretary update the Board on developments in their area of 
responsibility.
The directors are generally provided with detailed and 
comprehensive papers in advance of each Board meeting. The 
agenda is set by the Chairman in conjunction with the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Company 
Secretary.
The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for the 
timeliness and quality of information and is responsible for 
advising the Board on corporate governance matters and Board 
procedures. All directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all Board 
Committees.
The directors may take independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense in relation to their responsibilities 
as directors. None of the directors obtained independent 
professional advice in this regard in the period under review.
The number of Board and Board Committee meetings held 
during the year and individual attendance by directors at those 
meetings are set out in the table below.
Note: Malcolm Coster, Daniel Dayan and Daniel Abrams all attended meetings of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee at the invitation 
of the Chairmen of those Committees.

 Richard Stillwell Non executive Director 12 4 5 1
 Brian Taylorson Non executive Director  11 4 5 0 The board, board balance and independence
The Board comprises two executive directors and four non 
executive directors (including the Chairman) who contribute a 
wide range of complementary skills and experience. Details of 
each director’s skills and experience are set out on pages 38 
and 39.
The Chairman of the Board is Malcolm Coster. The Chairman’s 
other significant commitments are set out on page 38.
The Chief Executive Officer is Daniel Dayan. Richard Stillwell  
is the Senior Independent Director. He is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that the normal channels 
of contact with the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer would 
not resolve.
The Board believes that there is an appropriate balance of 
executive and non executive directors on the Board, without one 
individual or group dominating the Board’s decision-making 
process.
The Board has determined all its non executive directors to be 
independent in character and judgement. The non executive 
Chairman, Malcolm Coster, was considered independent in 
character and judgement on appointment. The Board will 
assess the independence of its non executive directors on a 
continuous basis.
Following the introduction on 1 October 2008 of the statutory 
duty of directors to avoid situations which have or may have 
an interest which conflicts or possibly may conflict with the 
interests of the Company, the Nomination Committee has 
been given responsibility for considering and if appropriate 
authorising such conflict situations on such terms as are 
considered necessary or if material referring them to the Board, 
on an ongoing basis. Any director in a conflicting or potentially 
conflicting situation is excluded from any decision. During the 
year the Nomination Committee reviewed the conflict situations 
authorised and concluded that they remained appropriate and 
accordingly the Company has complied with the procedures in 
place to ensure the effective operation of the Board’s powers to 
authorise conflict situations.
role of the Chairman and Chief executive Officer
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate 
and there is a clear division of responsibilities between these 
roles. In accordance with the Code, the Board has adopted 
a formal written statement of the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Chairman leads the Board and ensures the effective 
engagement and contribution of all non executive and executive 
directors. In conjunction with the Company Secretary, he is 
responsible for ensuring that directors receive information in an 
accurate, clear and timely manner and for promoting effective 
decision making. He is also responsible for ensuring that 
directors continually update their skills and knowledge. The 
Chairman has active contact and involvement with the executive 
directors and the affairs of the Company. This serves to keep 
him abreast of current business issues but also provides the 
executive directors with access to an independent opinion on 
day to day business decisions.
The Chief Executive Officer has responsibility for the day to day 
management of the Group’s businesses and acts in accordance 
with the authority delegated by the Board. He is responsible 
for developing and proposing a strategy for consideration 
and adoption by the Board and for implementing the Board’s 
strategies, decisions and policies. He is also responsible for 
ensuring that the business strategy and activities are effectively 
communicated and promoted within and outside the business, for 
building positive relationships with the Company’s stakeholders 
and for creating and developing the Company’s culture.
board Appointments
Primary responsibility for planned and progressive refreshing 
of the Board lies with the Board. The Board, through the work 
of the Nomination Committee, ensures that there is a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of 
new directors. Further details of the work of the Nomination 
Committee are set out on page 48.
Appointments of non executive directors are made by the Board 
for an initial term of three years, subject to the usual regulatory 
provisions and continued satisfactory performance of their 
duties. Re-appointment for a further term is not automatic but 
may be made by mutual agreement.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, all 
directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at least 
every three years.
On appointment, all non executive directors are advised of the 
time commitment expected of them to fulfil their duties. Letters 
of appointment for the non executive directors are available for 
inspection on request.
board induction and Professional Development
The Board has adopted a formal written programme for the 
induction of new directors to familiarise themselves with 
the Group’s businesses, understand the goals, objectives 
and mission of the Company and develop an awareness 
and understanding of the views of the Company’s major 
shareholders. The programme is also structured to enable 
new directors to gain an understanding of their own specific 
duties and responsibilities. The programme, developed in 
accordance with the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and 
Administrators guidelines on Board induction, is made up 
of a combination of selected written corporate information, 
meetings with key senior management and site visits and is 
tailored to take account of each new director’s specific needs, 
skills and experience. Where a non executive director is also 
being appointed as a member of one of the Board Committees, 
his or her induction will cover matters such as the role of and 
terms of reference of the relevant Committee.
In order to maintain, develop and update each directors’ 
knowledge and capabilities, the Board and its Committees are 
briefed on corporate governance and regulatory developments 
as they arise. The Audit Committee is briefed on technical and 
accounting matters as a matter of routine at each meeting by 
senior management and the external auditors. The directors 
receive information and training in respect of their statutory 
duties and their disclosure obligations under the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules. A continuous 
programme of development will occur as required.
The Board regards performance evaluation as an important 
part of monitoring and improving its effectiveness and a 
formal internal appraisal of the Board, the Board Committees 
and the individual directors was undertaken during the year. 
This involved the Chairman, acting on behalf of the Board, 
obtaining views from and evaluating the performance of the 
other individual directors and the non executive directors, led 
by the Senior Independent Director, assessing the performance 
of the Chairman. An internal evaluation was considered by the 
Board to be adequate given the size and current position and 
circumstances of the Company and accordingly the evaluation 
was not externally facilitated.

board Committees
The terms of reference of the principal Committees of the 
Board, the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees 
are available on the Company’s website at www.fiberweb.com.
remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee are given in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 49 to 54.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of three independent, non 
executive directors and is chaired by Stephen Dryden. Its other 
members are Richard Stillwell and Brian Taylorson.
Both Stephen Dryden and Brian Taylorson are qualified 
Chartered Accountants and currently hold senior finance roles 
in major UK listed public companies.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee include all 
matters listed in Code provision C.3.2 although in practice risk 
management is reviewed by the Board as a whole. The terms of 
reference are reviewed annually and any proposed revisions are 
formally approved and adopted by the Board.
The Audit Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment of the external auditors 
and their remuneration. The Committee reviews the external 
auditors’ independence and considers the nature, scope and 
results of the auditors’ work and the provision of non-audit 
services by them. The Committee focuses particularly on 
compliance with legal and other regulatory requirements, 
accounting standards and ensuring that an effective system of 
internal controls is maintained. The Committee may consider 
any financial matter that may have an impact on the Company. 
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the 
annual and interim financial statements and bi-annual trading 
statements remains with the Board.
The Audit Committee normally meets not less than three times 
a year at dates to coincide with the financial reporting cycle. The 
Committee also meets privately with the external auditors and 
the internal auditors at least once a year. The Chairman may 
call a meeting at the request of the executive directors or the 
external auditors.
In addition to Committee members, the Chairman of the 
Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Group Financial Controller, the internal auditor and the 
external auditors normally attend meetings at the invitation of 
the Committee Chairman.
During the year and up to the date of this report, the Audit 
Committee considered the following matters and took the 
following actions in the discharge of its duties:
w	 	 reviewed and advised the Board on the financial statements 
in the 2010 report and accounts;
w	 	 reviewed and assessed the audit services provided and the 
effectiveness of the external auditors;
w	 	 discussed and agreed the nature and the scope of work to be 
performed by the external auditors;
w	 	 reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
systems established by management and reviewed the 
Board’s sign-off procedure on the system of internal controls, 
which are set out in more detail on page 47;
w	 	 reviewed the scope of the work and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and the manner in which internal 
audit services will be provided; 
w	 	 received and reviewed reports from the internal audit 
function on the work undertaken during the year;
w	 	 reviewed the policy on the provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditors and assessed the independence of the 
auditors; and
w	 	 reviewed the arrangements by which concerns can be 
raised by staff in respect of possible matters of financial 
impropriety or other matters.
Auditor independence and effectiveness
The external auditors were appointed in 2006 on the demerger 
of the Group from BBA Aviation plc.
One of the key responsibilities of the Committee is to ensure 
that the independence and objectivity of the external auditors 
is safeguarded. The Committee has adopted a policy on the 
provision of non-audit services that is in line with the Accounting 
Practice Board’s Ethical Standards. This policy is reviewed 
annually. It prohibits the external auditors from providing certain 
additional services to the Group such as bookkeeping, internal 
audit, valuations, actuarial services and financial systems 
design and implementation. The external auditors are, however, 
permitted to provide assurance services such as reporting 
accountant work, due diligence and certain tax services.
The Group’s general policy is not to use the external auditors for 
acquisition and due diligence work. However, where the Group 
considers it appropriate or conflicts arise, suppliers other than 
the preferred supplier may be asked to tender and this may 
include the external auditors.
In accordance with the policy, the Chairman of the Committee or, 
in his absence, another designated member of the Committee is 
required to pre-approve certain permitted services that exceed 
the financial limits set out in the policy. A summary of the 
overall level of non-audit fees paid to the external auditors is 
presented at each Audit Committee meeting.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditors, Deloitte 
LLP, for non-audit services provided during the year are given 
in note 4 on page 70.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the 
external auditors, the Audit Committee has during the year:
w	 	 reviewed the independence of the external auditors and the 
arrangements Deloitte LLP have in place to identify, report 
and manage conflicts of interest;
w	 	 considered the effectiveness of the external auditors through 
a review of their plan of work and the outputs arising from 
the audit; and
w	 	 considered the overall extent of non-audit services provided 
by the external auditors, in addition to case by case approval 
of the provision of non-audit services as appropriate as set 
out above. 
As a result of the above, and taking into account the tenure of the 
auditors, the Committee concluded the independence criteria 
under the relevant standards continued to be met and that it 
was not necessary to tender for the audit work. Accordingly, the 
Committee recommended to the Board the re-appointment of 
Deloitte LLP as external auditors.    Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    47 
internal Control and risk Management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management, and reviews its 
effectiveness on an annual basis.
The implementation and maintenance of risk management is 
the responsibility of the executive directors and other senior 
management and a system has been established to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant risks that the Group 
faces. The system is designed to mitigate rather than eliminate 
altogether the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The main elements of the Group’s internal control system are 
as follows:
1. The board
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control. As mentioned above in this report, the Board 
meets regularly and has a schedule of matters reserved for 
its approval and the Board Committees operate within their 
terms of reference. This structure includes the Audit Committee 
which, with the Chief Financial Officer, reviews the effectiveness 
of the internal financial and operating control environment 
of the Group. All acquisitions and disposals of companies or 
businesses are approved by the Board.
2. Strategic and business Planning
The Group and each business unit produce and agree a business 
plan each year against which the performance of the business 
is regularly monitored.
3. Monthly Management Accounts
Detailed monthly management accounts that measure actual 
performance against budget are submitted by management.  
A monthly report is provided to the Board, highlighting key issues 
and summarising the detailed financial information provided by 
the operating units. Forecasts of sales, profits and operating cash 
are reviewed at least quarterly and presented to the Board.
4. internal Audit
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the internal auditor undertake 
a programme of reviews aligned to the business risks. The Audit 
Committee receives a report from the internal auditor at each 
meeting that includes the findings of the reviews conducted 
and any actions agreed with management to be undertaken 
to improve the effectiveness of controls. The internal auditor 
has direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.  
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the internal 
audit activities, including the scope of work, authority and 
resources of the internal auditor and reviews the internal audit 
plan at least annually.
5. System of Control Procedures and Delegated Authorities
There are clearly defined guidelines and approval limits for 
capital and operating expenditure and other key business 
transactions and decisions that have been approved by the 
Board. A detailed matrix defines the levels of authority for the 
Group’s senior management and their direct reports including 
in relation to acquisitions, capital expenditure, commercial and 
employee contracts and treasury matters.
6. Treasury Policies and Procedures
Detailed procedures exist for investments, currency and 
commodity hedging, the granting of guarantees and the use of 
treasury products.
7. r isk identification, Monitoring and Management Procedures
A process is in place to collate schedules of risks for each key 
site, which are then reviewed by the Divisional Presidents and 
consolidated into a schedule of the significant divisional level 
risks. Risks identified cover business, financial, compliance, 
operational as well as environmental, social and governance 
risks. These risk schedules, which include an assessment 
of their likelihood and impact, are kept under review and  
are presented for review at least annually at a Fiberweb 
Executive Team meeting. The Fiberweb Executive Team is 
responsible for confirming that the plans to mitigate those 
risks are satisfactory and for improving internal controls 
and processes. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for 
reporting the work of the Fiberweb Executive Team on risk 
management to the Board.
8. Organisational Structure
Structures are in place at the Company’s Head Office and at 
divisional level that clearly define responsibilities for operational, 
accounting, taxation, treasury, legal, company secretarial and 
insurance functions.
9. Financial Control and reporting
The Group has adopted policies that are appropriate and as 
such, it has a full set of accounting policies and procedures 
in force. These are regularly reviewed for appropriateness 
and, when required, updated accordingly. Senior management 
of each business are asked to sign an annual confirmation 
that their business has complied with the Group Accounting 
Policies manual in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements.
The Fiberweb Group uses Hyperion Financial Management 
(“HFM”) for the consolidation of both monthly management 
accounts and annual and interim accounts. Results are  
prepared in accordance with IFRS. Businesses upload individual 
entity results into HFM via a secure internet link. Entity results 
are extracted from local ERP systems in trial balance format  
which are mapped to the common HFM Chart of Accounts. 
Entity results are reviewed by entity and divisional management 
prior to submission to HFM. The results are consolidated 
within HFM. HFM contains a number of validation checks and 
controls to ensure the accuracy of financial information. Results 
are reviewed by senior management including the Fiberweb 
Executive Team and the Board. 
10. Group Policies
A new Group Policy Manual was adopted in 2007 and 
communicated to all businesses. The policies are reviewed 
regularly and revised as necessary to take account of changing 
law and circumstances. New policies are added when 
appropriate. A review of compliance with a number of these 
policies by Group companies has been introduced and the 
results are communicated to the Fiberweb Executive Team and 
the Board as necessary.
11. Health, Safety and environmental Manual (HS&e)
A Group Health, Safety and Environmental Manual details 
policies, standards and procedures that are applicable 
throughout the Group. Further information is included in 
the Business Review on pages 32 to 35. A monthly report 
is prepared and circulated to the Fiberweb Executive Team 
on HS&E matters and the Board receives a report on HS&E 
matters at each Board meeting. 48     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
Corporate Governance continued
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Group and that it has been in place for the period under 
review up to the date of approval of the annual report and 
accounts. The Group’s system is reviewed by the Board and 
accords with the Turnbull guidance. Any significant failings 
or weaknesses that come to management’s and the Board’s 
attention are addressed and appropriate action taken.
The Company has board representation in the FitesaFiberweb 
joint venture and, whilst not applied in their entirety, a number of 
Group policies have been adopted by the joint venture. The joint 
venture is subject to the Company’s internal audit procedures 
and for management reporting purposes the joint venture is 
integrated with the Company. The financial results are separately 
audited but are reviewed by the Company’s external auditors.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Malcolm Coster and its 
other members are Daniel Dayan, Richard Stillwell and Stephen 
Dryden. Whilst the Committee leads the process for Board 
appointments, the Chairman will consult with all the directors on 
a regular basis throughout the process. While the composition of 
the Nomination Committee is not in compliance with A.4.1 of the 
Code, in the opinion of the Board it provides a suitable balance of 
knowledge and experience and the constitution of the Committee is 
appropriate given the size of the Board and the process undertaken 
for Board appointments. The Chairman will not participate in any 
discussion relating to the appointment of his successor.
The Committee has responsibility for identifying and nominating 
candidates for Board vacancies and making recommendations 
to the Board in relation to the appointment of the Company’s 
executive and non executive directors.
Before making an appointment, the Committee will evaluate the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and, 
in light of this evaluation, prepare a description of the role and 
capabilities required for a particular appointment. Use will be 
made of external recruitment consultants and the final decision 
regarding appointment rests with the Board.
The Committee also has responsibility for reviewing and if 
appropriate authorising conflicts of interest or potential conflicts 
of interest of directors.
One Nomination Committee meeting was held during the year 
at which the re-election of Malcolm Coster and Brian Taylorson 
as directors of the Company was considered and recommended 
to the Board for approval, and at which potential conflicts of 
interest were reviewed and considered.
Shareholder relations
The Board as a whole is kept up to date on the views of Fiberweb’s 
major shareholders. This is achieved through regular meetings 
during the year between the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer and major shareholders to discuss matters of 
mutual interest that are reported to the Board. Broker reports 
are routinely circulated to the Board.
The Chairman met with major shareholders during the year.   
The Board considers that its Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director have an understanding and awareness 
of the issues and concerns of major shareholders and the 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the other non 
executive directors were available to meet shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Both institutional and private shareholders are welcome at the 
Annual General Meeting. The meeting provides an opportunity 
for shareholders to discuss with executive and non executive 
directors any issues concerning the Company and its activities. 
The Chairman of the Board and the Chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees are available to 
answer questions at the meeting.
The Company counts all proxy votes cast in respect of the 
Annual General Meeting and makes available the proxy voting 
figures on each resolution. The voting results where resolutions 
are passed on a show of hands and details of all proxy votes cast 
prior to the meeting are available on the Company’s website. 
The results of the meeting are announced to the market via a 
Regulated Information Service.     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    49 
This Report to shareholders for the year ended 31 December 
2010 has been prepared in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the 
applicable Listing Rules. A resolution to approve the Report will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at 
which the financial statements will also be approved. The vote 
will have an advisory status in respect of the remuneration 
policy and overall remuneration packages and will not be 
specific to individual levels of remuneration.
Certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report are audited. 
Audited information is stated as such in the relevant section.
The remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee members are independent, 
non executive directors. The Committee Chairman is Richard 
Stillwell. Its other members are Stephen Dryden and Brian 
Taylorson.
The Committee normally meets no less than twice a year and 
has delegated responsibility for determining and agreeing with 
the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration 
of all executive directors and other senior executives and for 
determining, within the agreed terms of reference, specific 
remuneration packages for each of the executive directors 
(including pension rights), any compensation payments and 
the operation of executive incentive schemes. No director is 
involved in decisions relating to his own remuneration. During 
the period under review, the Remuneration Committee met on 
five occasions.
The Committee’s full terms of reference, which are available 
on the Company’s website at www.fiberweb.com, are reviewed 
annually and any proposed revisions referred to the Board for 
formal approval and adoption.
The Committee is responsible for:
w	 	 making recommendations to the Board on remuneration 
policy as applied to the Company’s executive directors and 
other senior management;
w	 	 determining the remuneration packages for the executive 
directors and the company secretary and the framework 
or broad policy for other designated members of executive 
management including base pay, performance-related bonus 
schemes, long-term incentives and other share awards;
w	 	 overseeing major changes in employee benefit structures 
throughout the Group;
w	 	 reviewing the design and operation of all share incentive 
plans for Board and shareholder approval, including 
approving grants of share awards to directors and senior 
managers; and
w	 	 reporting to the Board and external stakeholders on matters 
within its responsibilities.
The Committee has appointed Hewitt New Bridge Street (“HNBS”, 
a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited, whose ultimate parent 
company is Aon Corporation), a remuneration consultancy, 
as external advisers. HNBS has provided the Committee with 
advice in respect of certain aspects of main board and senior 
executive remuneration. HNBS provided no other services to 
the Company however the actuarial practice of Aon Hewitt 
Limited has provided actuarial and accounting assistance to the 
Company on pension schemes. No other services were supplied 
by any other part of Aon Corporation. The Committee has also 
appointed the remuneration practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
to provide advice in appropriate circumstances should the need 
arise. PricewaterhouseCoopers provided internal audit and 
tax advisory services to the Company during the year. The 
remuneration practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers operates 
separately from the rest of PricewaterhouseCoopers and there 
are provisions in place to ensure that there is no crossover of 
information between different practice areas. The Committee 
identified no conflict in the nature of services provided by its 
advisers.
The Committee also consults with the Chairman, who is not a 
member of the Remuneration Committee, the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Head of HR and Change, save in respect 
of matters directly relating to their own remuneration. The 
Committee receives an annual briefing on senior management 
remuneration and terms applicable within the Group and is 
otherwise appraised of pay and conditions in the Group as a 
whole by the Head of HR and Change as necessary to allow the 
Committee to take such matters into account when framing 
executive remuneration policy.
remuneration Policy
Fiberweb’s remuneration policy is that the remuneration of the 
Company’s executive directors and other senior management 
should be designed to attract and retain executives of high 
calibre so that the Company can be managed effectively to 
the benefit of its stakeholders. Remuneration levels are set 
taking into account the remuneration practices found in other 
UK listed companies of similar size, geographical spread 
and complexity. Consideration is also given to the economic 
realities of the Company’s own specific circumstances (in 
particular the current stage of the Company’s development 
and the international nature of its business operations) and 
remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Group. The Committee is conscious of the need to remain 
competitive in the different geographic areas in which the 
Company operates. In determining its remuneration policy, the 
Committee also takes account of UK corporate governance best 
practice and current market practice.
The policy is to pay base salaries and total remuneration around 
the median level for ‘on-plan’ performance and to provide the 
opportunity, via bonuses and long-term incentive plans, for 
executives to be rewarded at the upper quartile for the delivery 
of outstanding levels of performance.
The Committee has discretion to consider corporate performance 
on environmental, social and governance matters when setting 
the remuneration of executive directors but has chosen not to 
take these into specific account in setting performance targets 
for 2010 and 2011 in the belief that the structures in place 
neither encourage nor reward inappropriate behaviour in this 
regard and that relevant operational controls relating to such 
matters are in place.
Directors’ Remuneration Report 50     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
The Committee considers that the executive directors’ remuneration 
packages contain a suitable balance of fixed and variable 
performance-related pay and that the targets set for performance-
related pay are appropriate and demanding in the context of 
market practice, the Group’s trading environment and the current 
challenges that it faces.Performance-related remuneration forms 
a substantial element of the total remuneration package and is 
designed so as not to encourage excessive risk-taking but to be 
consistent with an approach which seeks to foster the generation 
of sustainable long-term returns for investors. Therefore, 
the Committee is satisfied that the Company’s remuneration 
policy and the executive directors’ remuneration packages do 
not encourage inappropriate operational risk taking and do not 
raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The main elements of the remuneration package for the 
executive directors and senior management are as follows:
w	 	 Base salary;
w	 	 Benefits in kind;
w	 	 Short-term cash based annual incentive plan;
w	 	 Long-term share based incentives; and
w	 	 Pension arrangements.
The various components of executive remuneration are 
discussed in further detail below.
base Salary
Base salaries are reviewed in relation to median market data 
for comparable companies in terms of size, market sector, 
complexity and geographic spread. Reviews occur generally on 
an annual basis and are based on performance, assessment 
of personal objectives where appropriate and any changes in 
responsibilities.
No changes in the base salaries of the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer have been made since December 
2008. Daniel Dayan’s base salary for the period under review 
was £370,000 per annum and Daniel Abrams’ base salary for the 
period under review was £215,000 per annum. The total salaries 
received by Daniel Dayan and Daniel Abrams for the year under 
review are shown in Table 1 on page 52. With effect from  
1 February 2011, Daniel Dayan’s base salary will be £382,000 
and Daniel Abram’s base salary will be £227,000. 
benefits in Kind
Benefits in kind for the executive directors include private 
medical insurance, personal accident insurance, permanent 
health insurance and life assurance. The executive directors 
are not provided with company cars and do not receive a car 
allowance.
Senior Management bonus Scheme
The executive directors are eligible to participate in the Senior 
Management Bonus Scheme under which payments may be 
made based on the achievement of challenging financial targets. 
Appropriate financial targets are set by the Remuneration 
Committee at the beginning of the financial year for which the 
bonus is payable. As described more fully below, 50% of the 
bonus opportunity is payable by reference to performance in 
the first six months of the year with the balance payable by 
reference to performance in the second six months of the year, 
although the bonus for the executive directors is only paid after 
the end of the financial year.
2010 bonuses
For 2010, the Bonus Scheme provided an incentive opportunity of 
up to 100% of base salary for executive directors. Primarily, 50% 
of the bonus opportunity was measured against the achievement 
of Group operating profit targets and 50% of the bonus opportunity 
was based on Group working capital as a percentage of sales, 
with the Committee then considering performance in the round 
to determine what level of bonus (if any) should be paid. For 
achievement of budgeted performance under both metrics, which 
constitute challenging targets, a bonus of 55% of maximum 
bonus earning potential was payable. In order not to reward 
underachievement, no payout occurs for achievement of below 
budget performance. In 2010, the Company achieved a Group 
operating profit of £29.0 million against a performance target 
of £24.5 million and a working capital of 14.6% against a 
performance target of 15%. Based on performance against these 
targets and taking account of overall performance in the year, 
Daniel Dayan’s bonus for the full year totalled £282,680 and 
Daniel Abrams’ bonus for the full year totalled £164,260.
2011 bonuses
For 2011, the Bonus Scheme for executive directors will 
broadly follow the structure in place for 2010 with a bonus of 
up to 100% of base salary being available. 70% of the bonus 
opportunity will be measured against profit after tax targets 
and 30% will be measured against return on capital targets.  
A bonus of up to 40% of salary will be payable for achievement of 95% 
of budgeted performance under both metrics (50% for achievement 
of budgeted performance in 2010). There will be no payout for 
achievement of less than 95% of budgeted performance.
Also consistent with the policy adopted in 2010, up to 50% of the 
bonus opportunity is based on performance in each half of the 
year (up to 50% in 2010). In the case of the executive directors, 
to the extent that the performance measures are met, payments 
will normally be made for both first half year and second half 
year performance only after the publication of the full year 
results. This approach gives the Committee the opportunity to 
ensure that the total bonus payable for the year reflects the full 
year Group performance before any actual payment is made.  
The Committee is satisfied that given the particular circumstances 
of the Company this approach to bonus payments is appropriate 
and that there is no likelihood of this approach resulting in the 
aggregate size of bonuses payable in any year not reflecting 
overall Group performance for that year.
executive Long-Term incentives
Deferred Share Matching Plan (“DSMP”)
Shareholders approved the DSMP in November 2006 at the time 
of the demerger of the Company from the BBA Group. Under 
the plan, a maximum of 50% of an executive’s net bonus may be 
voluntarily deferred into shares for three years. The deferred 
shares will then be matched at a rate of one to one (on a gross 
basis). The matching awards will vest three years after grant      Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    51 
if and to the extent that performance targets attached to the 
awards are satisfied. The detailed targets will be discussed 
and communicated to shareholders in advance of such awards 
being made. No matching awards have so far been made under 
the DSMP.
Long-Term incentive Plan (“LTiP”)
Shareholders also approved the LTIP in November 2006. In 
summary, under the LTIP, awards over shares with a face 
value of up to 100% of annual salary (200% in exceptional 
circumstances) can be made to executive directors in each 
financial year which (in normal circumstances) vest three 
years after grant, subject to the achievement of stretching 
performance conditions. The exercise period in respect of the 
award expires one year thereafter.
The majority of the awards made in 2006 to senior managers 
(including executive directors) lapsed (the portion of these 
awards that vested is explained below). In May 2008 and 
June 2009 awards were granted to a small number of senior 
managers, including the executive directors. No awards were 
made during 2007 and 2010.
Both the 2008 and 2009 awards are subject to Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) and earnings per share (“EPS”) targets. For 
the 2008 awards the TSR target is based on absolute total 
shareholder return (see table below) as the Committee 
considered at the relevant time that this was more appropriate 
in the circumstances and provided greater alignment with 
shareholder interests than a relative measure of performance. 
In the case of the 2009 awards the TSR target is based on 
Fiberweb’s performance relative to the constituents of the  
FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding investment trusts). The EPS 
target in respect of the 2008 awards measures EPS for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2007 against EPS for the  
year ending 31 December 2010, and for the 2009 awards 
measures EPS for the financial year ended 31 December 2008 
against EPS for the year ending 31 December 2011 (see table 
below). 
These performance conditions were chosen to provide a 
balanced long-term incentive for senior executives to generate 
both above market returns to shareholders and strong levels of 
EPS growth.
These awards vest as shown in the table below.
Sliding scale straight line vesting occurs for performance 
between the relevant threshold and maximum targets. LTIP 
awards (and DSMP awards if and when granted) do not have a 
‘re-testing’ facility. If the performance conditions are not met 
at the end of the relevant performance period, the awards will 
lapse.
The assessment of fulfilment of the TSR target and relevant TSR 
calculations will be undertaken by independent remuneration 
advisers. The Company’s external auditors will verify the 
Committee’s calculation of the extent to which the EPS targets 
have been met. These methods have been chosen to ensure that

After the publication of results for the year ending 31 December 
2009, it was confirmed that an award of 155,634 shares granted 
to Daniel Dayan on 27 November 2006 had vested in respect of 
77,817 shares due to part satisfaction of the EPS target to which 
50% of this award was made subject (the balance being subject 
to a relative TSR condition that was not met). The balance of 
the award in respect of 77,817 shares lapsed. The award was 
exercised in respect of 77,817 shares on 12 March 2010, on 
which date the mid-market price of a Fiberweb plc ordinary 
share was 51.75p. Accordingly, the gain made by Daniel Dayan 
on exercise of the award was approximately £40,271. Further 
details of this award are set out in Table 3 on page 53.
The performance targets applied to future awards will be set by 
the Committee taking into account the outlook for the Company 
at that time and will be fully disclosed in the relevant Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
In addition, the Committee will regularly review the operation 
of the Company’s share based incentive arrangements in light 
of the circumstances and prospects of the Company as they 
develop and emerging trends in the market and best practice. 
Details of awards made to executive directors under the LTIP 
are set out in Table 3 on page 53. 
Fiberweb executive Share Option Plan (“eSOP”)
The Company established the ESOP following shareholder 
approval in November 2006. Under the ESOP, the normal 
maximum grant limit will be 150% of salary per annum (200% in 
exceptional circumstances).
Options will vest after three years, subject to the achievement 
of performance conditions that are deemed appropriate at the 
time of grant and that will be communicated to shareholders 
before grants are made. No grants were made under the ESOP 
during the year.
Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company’s performance measured 
by Total Shareholder Return from the date of listing until  
31 December 2010, compared with the equivalent information for 
the FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding investment trusts).
This index has been selected because it is a broad-based equity 
market index of which the Company is a constituent.
Pensions
The Company made pension contributions at a rate of 25% of base 
salary to Mr Dayan which was invested in a defined contribution 
scheme nominated by him. Mr Abrams also received a pension 
contribution at the rate of 15% of base salary which was invested 
in a defined contribution scheme nominated by him. In addition, 
each director fulfilled a contractual obligation to contribute at  
least 7.5% of their salary to the Company defined contribution 
scheme. Details of Company pension contributions made in 
respect of the directors during the year under review are set 
out in Table 1.     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    53

Service Contracts
Both Daniel Dayan’s and Dan Abrams’ service contracts (dated 
27 October 2006 and 1 February 2008 respectively) will terminate 
automatically upon reaching age 65 and provide for 12 months’ 
notice by either party.
In the event of early termination by the Company other than 
for cause, the Company may elect either to make a single 
payment in lieu of notice (which will include base salary, an 
assessment of lost bonus opportunity and benefits and, to 
the extent prescribed by the relevant plan rules, share award 
entitlements) or to make that payment in three instalments. 
If the payment is made in instalments, the first instalment is 
payable on termination and will comprise six months’ payment in 
lieu of notice (calculated to include the remuneration elements 
described above). The second and third payments will comprise 
three months’ notice each. The second payment will be made 
six months after termination and the third payment will be made 
nine months after termination. To recognise the duty to mitigate 
loss the second and third instalments will be reduced to take 
into account the remuneration paid pursuant to any alternative 
employment obtained by the executive director prior to such 
payments becoming due.

No provision for any termination payment is made in the event 
of early termination for cause and the Committee is conscious 
of the need to protect the Company against the risk of making 
payments in the event of failure whilst having regard to the 
Company’s legal obligations.
Policy on external Directorships
The Board believes that the experience gained by executive 
directors through their involvement with other companies 
could be of benefit to the individual director and the Company. 
Executive directors are, with the Board’s permission, allowed to 
accept one such appointment, as long as there is no conflict of 
interest and the time commitment involved does not undermine 
the performance of their duties at the Company. The executive 
director may keep the fees from his external appointment. 
Daniel Dayan is a non executive director of Stobart Group 
Limited having been appointed in July 2009 for which he 
receives an annual fee of £40,000. Daniel Abrams has no such 
appointments at present.
Non executive Directors’ remuneration
The appointment of each of Richard Stillwell and Brian Taylorson 
as non executive directors was for an initial term of three years 
effective from the date of demerger in November 2006. The 
letters of appointment of Richard Stillwell and Brian Taylorson 
are dated 19 October 2006 and their appointments have been 
extended until the close of the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company in 2013 by letters each dated 29 April 2010. The letter 
of appointment of Steve Dryden as a non executive director is 
dated 27 May 2009 and his appointment is for a period of three 
years from 1 June 2009. The current letters of appointment 
for all the non executive directors are available for inspection 
on request. The non executive directors do not participate 
in any Company pension arrangements or incentive plans. 
Appointments can be terminated by either party on three 
months’ notice or compensation, and six months’ notice or 
compensation in the case of the Chairman.
The level of fees for the non executive directors is determined 
by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of the 
Chairman and the executive directors. The Chairman’s fees are 
determined by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of 
the Remuneration Committee after consulting with the Chief 
Executive Officer. Fees are in line with current market practice 
of comparable organisations and are set taking account of the 
time commitment and responsibility of each non executive 
director. The base annual fee is £32,000. The Chairmen of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees each receive an 
annual supplement of £6,000 in recognition of the increased 
commitment placed upon them in performing their roles. 
Richard Stillwell does not receive an additional supplement for 
his role as Senior Independent Director.
The original appointment of the Chairman was for a period 
expiring at the end of the annual general meeting in 2010.  
His letter of appointment dated 19 October 2006 and amended 
by a letter dated 29 October 2009 has been extended until the 
close of the Annual General Meeting of the Company in 2013 
by letter dated 29 April 2010. His appointment letters are 
available for inspection on request. The Chairman’s base cash 
fee is £120,000 per annum having been increased by £10,000 per 
annum on 1 November 2009. 
Non executive directors’ fees have been reviewed and have 
remained unchanged since appointment. Details of non executive 
directors’ fees for 2010 are set out in Table 1 on page 52.

Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law 
the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that 
period.  
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
w	 	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
w	 	 make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
w	 	 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
w	 	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
w	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
w	 present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
w	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
w	 	 make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
w	 	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
w	 	 the management report, which is incorporated into the 
directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and the related notes 1 to 
34. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and 
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
w	 	 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2010 and of its profit for the year then 
ended;
w	 	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
w	 	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to iFrSs as issued by the iASb
As explained in note 2 to the group financial statements, the 
group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
w	 	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
w	 	 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
w	 	 the directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ 
Report, in relation to going concern; 
w	 	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review; and
w	 	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Fiberweb plc for the year ended 31 December 
2010 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2010
1. General information
Fiberweb plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom 
on 22 January 2006 under the Companies Act 1985. The Fiberweb 
Group (“Fiberweb” or “the Group”) is an international Group of 
businesses dedicated to the development, manufacturing and 
supply of specialist nonwoven fabrics.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
because that is the currency of the ultimate parent company. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies 
set out in note 2.
2. Accounting policies
basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an 
historical cost basis, adjusted for certain derivative financial 
instruments which are stated at fair value. 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Policies (“UK GAAP”).
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
a going concern basis as explained in the Directors’ Report on 
pages 41 to 43.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”). The financial statements have also been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union (“EU”) 
and therefore the Group financial statements comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards 
and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the 
amounts reported in these financial statements.
The group has applied the revised version of IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separated Financial 
Statements with effect to business combinations from 1 January 
2010. The standard applies prospectively to all business 
combinations executed from that date. Business combinations 
executed prior to that date are dealt with under the previous 
version of the standards applied by the Group. The revised 
standards introduce changes in a number of areas, the most 
significant of which are as follows:
w	 	 Contingent consideration continues to be recognised at 
fair value at the date of the business combination. Post 
acquisition changes to contingent consideration classified 
as an asset or liability are required to be recognised in 
the income statement. Previously they were treated as an 
adjustment to goodwill.
w	 	 Contingent liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value 
at acquisition, where previously there was no requirement to 
record them on the balance sheet.
w	 	 Acquisition costs no longer comprise part of consideration, 
and must be expensed as incurred.
w	 	 Changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not 
result in a loss of control are accounted for within equity.
w	 	 Non-controlling interests may be measured either at fair 
value or at the proportionate share of the fair value of the net 
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, with the choice 
available individually for each business combination.
w	 	 For business combinations achieved in stages, the group 
is required at the acquisition date to re-measure to fair 
value any existing equity interest in the acquiree, with any 
resulting gain or loss taken to the income statement.
The revised standards apply prospectively to new business 
combinations and therefore their implementation does not result 
in any restatement of prior periods. The group did not complete 
any business combination in the period. Acquisition costs of £0.1 
million relating to the January 2011 acquisition of Boddingtons 
International Limited incurred during 2010 have been charged to 
the income statement as non-recurring items (see note 5).
In addition, the Group has adopted:
w	 Improvements to IFRSs 2009
w	 	 Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment – Group Cash-
settled Share-based payment transactions
w	 IAS 39 (amended 2008) Eligible Hedged Items
w	 IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the 
amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact 
the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been 
applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet 
effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
w	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
w	 IAS 24 (revised 2009) Related Party Disclosures
w	 Improvements to IFRSs 2010
w	 IAS 32 (amended 2009) Classification of Rights Issues
w	 	 IFRIC 14 (amended 2009) Prepayments of a Minimum Funding 
Requirement
w	 	 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity 
Instruments
The directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards 
and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group.
The principal accounting policies used in the preparation of 
these financial statements are detailed below. These accounting 
policies, presentation and methods of computation have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented.
basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Fiberweb. Control exists 
when Fiberweb has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain 
economic benefit from its activities. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the Group’s financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases in accordance with the acquisition method of 
accounting. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the      Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    63 
2.  Accounting Policies continued
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Associated undertakings are those investments other than 
subsidiary or joint venture undertakings where the Group is in 
a position to exercise a significant influence, typically through 
the participation in the financial and operating decisions of the 
investee. Investments in associated undertakings are stated at 
cost, plus the Group’s share of post- acquisition reserves, less 
dividends received and provision for impairment.
Joint ventures are those entities other than subsidiary or 
associated undertakings where the Group is deemed to have 
joint control over the financial and operating policies of the 
entity. This is usually contractual. Investments in joint ventures 
are accounted for using the equity method under IAS 31 and 
therefore are treated as investments in associated undertakings 
(above) upon consolidation.
business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquire. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at 
the acquisition date. Costs attributable to the business combination 
are expensed as incurred for acquisitions post 1 January 2010 
following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised).
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and 
initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, 
the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Any non-controlling interest in the acquiree is either initially 
measured at fair value at the acquisition date, or at its 
proportionate interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities of the acquiree. 
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions, being the excess of fair value of the 
consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired, 
is capitalised and tested for impairment on an annual basis, or 
more frequently when there is an indication that there may be an 
impairment. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
to the other assets of the unit. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled 
entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill 
written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has 
not been reinstated and is not included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Segmental reporting
The group’s primary reporting segments are defined according 
to markets served: Hygiene and Industrial. Fiberweb manages 
the trading results of individual reporting entities and operational 
sites analysed by the specific markets they serve. Segmentation 
of assets and liabilities is on a reporting entity basis, as reported 
to the Fiberweb Executive.
revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. Group revenue represents amounts 
receivable for goods supplied by the Group in the normal course 
of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related 
taxes and excluding intercompany transactions and sales by 
associated undertakings. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to 
the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
research and development expenditure 
Research expenditure is charged against income in the year in 
which it is incurred. An internally-generated intangible asset 
arising from the Group’s development expenditure is recognised 
only if the asset can be separately identified, it is probable 
that the asset will generate future economic benefits and the 
development costs of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Share-based payments 
Fiberweb operates four share-based compensation plans 
which are detailed in note 25. The equity-settled share-based 
payments under these schemes are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is 
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based 
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised (and any previously recognised 
expense is reversed) for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except where vesting is conditional upon a measure linked 
to Fiberweb plc’s share price (“a market condition”) or other 
market conditions. The likelihood of achieving the market 
condition is taken into account in the fair value and, therefore, 
the award is treated as vesting irrespective of whether or 
not the market condition is satisfied, provided that any other 
performance condition is met.
When an award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on 
the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for 
the award is recognised immediately in the income statement. 64     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2010
2.  Accounting Policies continued
The cost of share-based compensation schemes is recognised 
as an expense within staff costs in the income statement  
(see note 10). 
Leases 
Where assets are financed by lease agreements that give rights 
similar to ownership (finance leases), the assets are treated 
as if they had been purchased and the leasing commitments 
are shown as obligations to the lessors. The capitalisation 
values of the assets are written off on a straight line basis over 
the shorter of the periods of the leases or the useful lives of 
the assets concerned. The capital elements of future leases 
are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are 
charged to the income statement over the period of the leases 
to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital 
payments outstanding. 
For all other leases (operating leases), the rental payments are 
charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the lives of the leases.
Post-retirement benefits 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes 
are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost is determined 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations 
being carried out annually on 31 December. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. 
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that 
the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on 
a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits 
become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance 
sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, and 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting 
from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the 
present value of available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the plan. 
Retirement benefit scheme contribution levels are determined 
by valuations undertaken by independent qualified actuaries. In 
certain overseas subsidiaries, to comply with local legislation 
and to obtain taxation advantages, provision is made for the 
total actuarial liability less the current surrender value of the 
supporting investment. 
Treasury 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling  
at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
the balance sheet date are recorded at the rates of exchange  
prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising from a change 
in exchange rates subsequent to the date of transaction is  
recognised in the income statement. Where monetary assets 
and liabilities have been designated effective hedges against 
net investments in foreign operations, the exchange gains and 
losses arising on those assets and liabilities are taken directly  
to reserves.
The income statements of overseas operations are translated 
into Sterling at the average exchange rates for the year 
and their balance sheets are translated into Sterling at the 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange 
differences arising on consolidation are taken to reserves, 
subject to the requirements of IAS 21 “The Effect of Changes in 
Foreign Exchange Rates”. All other translation differences are 
taken to the income statement. 
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group comprise 
foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity 
derivatives. All such instruments are used for hedging purposes 
to manage the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the 
Group in line with the Group’s risk management policies.  
The Group designates these derivatives as either hedges of 
highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign 
currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges) or 
hedges of investments in foreign operations. 
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet 
at fair value. Recognition of gains or losses on derivative 
instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated 
as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred 
in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss 
in the same line of the income statement as the recognised 
hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is 
hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a 
non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred 
in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes 
the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity 
at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Gains or losses deferred in the foreign currency translation 
reserve are recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the 
foreign operation. 
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise.      Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    65 
2.  Accounting Policies continued
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs  
and after the share of results of associates and joint ventures, 
but before investment income and finance costs (see note 4).
Underlying earnings
The Company believes that underlying operating profit, underlying 
profit before tax and underlying earnings provide additional useful 
information for shareholders. The term underlying earnings is not 
a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable 
with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other 
companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, 
IFRS measures of profit. As the Company has chosen to present 
an alternative earnings per share measure, a reconciliation of this 
alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS 
is given in note 9. To meet the needs of shareholders and other 
external users of the financial statements the presentation of the 
income statement shows clearly, through the use of columns, our 
underlying business performance which provides more useful 
information on underlying trends.
The adjustments made to reported results comprise restructuring 
costs and non-recurring items as set in note 5 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Restructuring costs involve one-off 
incremental items of major expenditure and the Group views them 
as costs associated with investment in the future performance of 
the business and not part of the underlying performance trends of 
the business. Due to their significance and one-off nature certain 
other items are classified as non-recurring items. The gains and 
losses on these discrete items, such as profits or losses on the 
disposal or impairment of subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, 
investments and fixed assets, can have a material impact on the 
absolute amount of and trend in the Group’s operating profit 
and are therefore excluded in arriving at the underlying results.  
Non-recurring items also include the ineffective portion of changes 
in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as hedging 
instruments, and fair value gains and losses on derivatives where 
it is not possible to obtain hedge accounting under IAS 39, which 
could be highly volatile depending on movements in exchange 
rates, interest yields or commodity prices. This volatility will not be 
reflected in the cash flows of the group which will be determined 
by the fixed or hedged rate and accordingly is excluded from the 
underlying performance measures to reflect the cash flows that 
occur under the Group’s hedging arrangements.
Taxation 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year 
and takes into account taxation deferred due to temporary 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method. 
No provision is made for temporary differences on unremitted 
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates 
where the Group has control and the reversal of the temporary 
difference is not foreseeable. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow 
all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated in the balance 
sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for 
impairment. Depreciation is provided on the cost or valuation 
of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value 
and is calculated on a straight line basis over the following 
estimated useful lives of the assets:
Land  not depreciated
Building 40 years maximum
Plant and Machinery  
(including essential commissioning costs)   3–15 years
Tooling, vehicles, computer and office equipment are categorised 
within Plant and Machinery. 
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction 
of major items of property, plant and equipment are capitalised 
as part of those assets. The commencement of capitalisation 
begins when both finance costs and expenditures for the asset 
are being incurred and activities that are necessary to get the 
asset ready for use are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when 
substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the asset 
ready for use are complete. During the year ended 31 December 
2010, an average rate of 5.2% was used for the capitalisation of 
finance costs.
intangible assets excluding goodwill 
Licenses are shown at amortised cost. Amortisation provided on 
the cost of licenses is calculated on a straight line basis over the 
useful life of the licenses. 
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of 
computer hardware, the software is treated as an intangible asset. 
Computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred 
to acquire and bring to use the specific software. Amortisation is 
provided on the cost of software and is calculated on a straight line 
basis over the useful life of the software. 
The Group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible 
assets arising on acquisitions. An intangible asset will be 
recognised as long as the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be 
measured reliably. Amortisation is provided on the fair value of 
the asset, excluding goodwill, and is calculated on a straight line 
basis over its useful life.
impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding 
goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying value 
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment  66     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2010
2.  Accounting Policies continued
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows 
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates  
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite life 
is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to 
its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued 
amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation decrease. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that 
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as 
income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a 
revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment 
loss is treated as a revaluation increase. 
inventory 
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises the cost of raw materials and an appropriate 
proportion of labour and overheads in the case of work in 
progress and finished goods. Cost is calculated on a first in 
first out basis. Provision is made for slow moving or obsolete 
inventory as appropriate. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade 
date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under 
contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within 
the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except 
for those financial assets classified as at fair value through 
profit and loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: 
financial assets ‘at fair value through profit and loss’ (FVTPL), 
‘held to maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) 
financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is 
determined at the time of initial recognition. As at 31 December 
2010 and 2009, the Group did not have any ‘held-to-maturity’ 
investments or AFS financial assets. The Group does not enter 
into hedge transactions for speculative purposes.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL where the financial 
asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:
w	 	 it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in 
the near future; or 
w	 	 it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments 
that the Group manages together and has a recent actual 
pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
w	 	 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a 
hedging instrument.
A financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading 
may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
w	 	 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces 
a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 
otherwise arise; or
w	 	 the financial asset forms part of a Group of financial 
assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed 
and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance with the Group’s documented risk management 
or investment strategy, and information about the Group is 
provided internally on that basis; or
w	 	 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded 
derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement permits the entire combined contract 
(asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain 
or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or 
interest earned on the financial asset. 
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and 
receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is 
recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would 
be immaterial.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at 
their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand 
deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.      Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    67 
2.  Accounting Policies continued
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all 
of its liabilities. 
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at 
FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the 
financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as 
at FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
w	 	 it has been incurred principally for the purpose of disposal in 
the near future; or
w	 	 it is part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments 
that the Group manages together and has a recent actual 
pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
w	 	 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a 
hedging instrument.
A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading 
may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
w	 	 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces 
a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 
otherwise arise; or
w	 	 the financial liability forms part of a Group of financial 
assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed 
and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance with the Group’s documented risk management 
or investment strategy, and information about the Group is 
provided internally on that basis; or
w	 	 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded 
derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement permits the entire combined contract 
(asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain 
or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest 
paid on the financial liability. 
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are  
initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other 
financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest 
method is a method of calculating the amortised costs of a 
financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the 
profit and loss account using the effective interest method and 
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their 
nominal value. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below. 
The judgements used by management in the application of the 
Group’s accounting policies in respect of these key areas of 
estimation are considered to be the most significant. 
Impairment of goodwill and tangible fixed assets 
Determining whether goodwill or tangible fixed assets are 
impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated 
or the individual assets. The value in use calculation requires 
the entity to estimate future cash flows expected to arise from 
the cash-generating unit or asset and a suitable discount rate 
in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of 
goodwill and tangible fixed assets at the balance sheet date 
was £34.7 million (2009: £35.1 million) and £214.2 million  
(2009: £219.3 million) respectively. 
Details regarding the goodwill and tangible fixed asset carrying 
value and assumptions used in carrying out the impairment 
reviews are provided in notes 11 and 12. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
Determining the present value of future obligations of 
pension and other post-retirement benefit schemes requires 
an estimation of future mortality rates, future changes in 
employee benefits and length of service. These assumptions 
are determined in association with qualified actuaries. 
The net pension liability related to defined benefit type schemes 
at the balance sheet date was £35.5 million (2009: £34.9 million). 
Details regarding the carrying value and assumptions used in 
arriving at the carrying value are provided in note 23.  68     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010

Old Hickory of £0.7 million (2009: £nil).
In July 2010, the Group entered into US Dollar and Euro interest rate swaps for the term of the new RCF and for the majority of the new loan 
facility in each currency. As a consequence, the interest rate swap contracts under the old RCF have been terminated, crystallising break 
costs of £5.4 million which are being amortised through the Group’s finance charge over the original remaining term of the old RCF i.e. 
July 2010 to end of September 2011. These swap break costs are being repaid in quarterly instalments over the term of the new RCF.

to overseas operations. Domestic income tax is calculated at 28% (2009: 28%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation 
for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
In the light of post-demerger restructuring action and strategic focus in the Group’s US operations and taking into account the forecast 
future profitability of the US operations, including management’s view of possible sensitivities to those forecasts, the Group has recognised 
a further asset of £6.4 million (2009: £5.9 million) in respect of US deductible temporary differences, generating a credit of £4.7 million 
(2009: £4.0 million) to the underlying deferred tax expense for the year and a credit of £1.7 million (2009: £1.9 million) directly in equity 
in relation to temporary differences on retirement benefit obligations.

Tax credit for the year (0.1) (6.6)
Overall effective tax rate -1.4% 108.2%
Effective tax rate on underlying profits -2.2% -7.2%
The difference between the actual tax credit and that expected on the loss for the year has been based on the UK rate of Corporation tax 
of 28% (2009: 28%). The comparison of actual tax is made against the UK standard rate rather than the blended rate of taxation for the 
Group, in order to provide a more consistent approach across the two years. The use of a blended rate would lead to a distortion year on 
year as the mix of profits and losses has changed considerably as have the underlying tax rates in various jurisdictions. 
In addition to the income tax expense charged to profit or loss, a net £0.2 million (2009: £3.1 million credit) has been credited to equity 
in the period, comprising a debit of £1.5 million (2009: £0.5 million) in respect of fair value adjustments on financial instruments and a 
credit of £1.7 million in respect of retirement benefit obligations (2009: a credit of £3.6 million). 
The effective rate of tax on underlying continuing profits in the year ended 31 December 2010 of £13.6 million (2009: £11.1 million) is 
-2.2% (2009: -7.2%), due to the credit of £4.7 million (2009: £4.0 million) on partial recognition of the US deferred tax assets. Excluding 
this credit, the effective rate of tax on underlying continuing profits was 36.7% (2009: 28.8%). This includes the share of post-tax profits 
from the FitesaFiberweb joint venture of £4.0 million (2009: £2.7 million) included within underlying profit before tax of £13.6 million 
(2009: £11.1 million).

Licences are amortised over the period to which they relate, which is on average five years. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit 
from the business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 
    2010 2009    
    £’m £’m
Europe Industrial (Veratec and Coronor)   6.1 6.2
Europe Hygiene (Tenotex)   15.5 16.2
US Industrial (Reemay)   12.4 12.0
Other – several CGUs   0.7 0.7
 34.7 35.1
The business tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based on pre-tax cash flows discounted using a 
pre-tax discount rate. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and 
expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
The business prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management. Growth rates 
used for 2011 to 2013 are based on selling price and cost assumptions for each business individually, built from management’s current 
knowledge and specific expectations for future profit evolution in the short term. Forecasts specifically exclude any incremental profits 
that may be generated through targeted investments in new technologies or strategic markets. Cash flows are then extrapolated for the 
following 40 years; growth rates from 2012 are assumed to be nil.
Value in use calculations assume an annual level of maintenance capital expenditure throughout the forecast period, with periodic higher 
investments included based on previous experience of the useful lives of the equipment in use. Specific capital injections to fund projects 
and new technologies are excluded from value in use calculations.  76     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
11.  Intangible assets continued
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is estimated by reference to the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and the 
degree of risk that management feels attaches to a CGU. The discount rates applied in the review at December 2010 range from 9% to 
10% (2009: 10% to 12%). Headroom ranges between 15% and 93%.
Tenotex is a key part of the Group’s European Consumer Fabric business and, as such, operates in the more defensive Hygiene market, 
where demand for its products has remained broadly stable and has benefited from the upgraded resin-bond line that was successfully 
commissioned at the end of 2008. The discount rate applied to this CGU is 9%. 
The Reemay goodwill is comfortably supported by the US Industrial forecasts. A discount rate of 9% in line with the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital has been applied. 
Management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions which would result in the carrying amount 
of the CGUs exceeding the recoverable amounts.

At 31 December 2010, assets of £15.3m relating to the Old Hickory Steamworks and £0.3m relating to Peine land have been transferred 
to held for sale (see note 16). Non-recurring asset write downs comprise primarily of the write down of a number of IT assets in our US 
businesses following the closure of a data centre (see note 5).
In the year ended 31 December 2009, non-recurring asset write-downs of £13.4 million were expensed through non-recurring cost of 
sales in respect of plant and machinery at Peine, Germany as we completed our rationalisation of our European Hygiene production 
capacity. In addition, AQF assets with a net book value of £0.2 million were transferred to assets held for sale (see note 16), pending 
their sale to a third party in January 2010.
On 31 July 2009, assets with a net book value of £35.5 million were contributed into the FitesaFiberweb joint venture from the Group’s 
US Hygiene plant in Washougal and the Group’s Mexican operations (see note 30).

In the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group invested £0.8 million to acquire 26% of the shares in Terram Geosynthetics Private 
Limited. This initial cost of investment was reduced by £0.2 million in respect of the Group’s unrealised share of the post tax gain on 
Terram’s sale of its previously mothballed production line to the associate. This investment has subsequently been impaired as this is 
no longer considered to be recoverable.
On 31 July 2009, the Group entered into a joint venture, FitesaFiberweb, with partner Petropar S.A. The carrying value of the cost of 
investment in the joint venture at 31 December 2010 was £48.8 million (2009: £47.3 million).
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group disposed of its investment in associate, CoraTech.

fair value less costs to sell, in the Industrial segment and £0.3 million of land at Peine, in the Hygiene segment. Fiberweb is in negotiations 
to conclude a sale and leaseback of the Old Hickory Steamworks. It is anticipated that the sale price will be approximately £15 million.
In 2009, assets held for sale of £1.2 million comprise the production equipment at AQF held at its net realisable value and sold to a third 
party in January 2010 (see notes 12 and 5). 
Trade receivables
The average credit period granted on sales of goods is 50 days (2009: 47 days). No interest is charged on receivables paid within their due 
date. Thereafter, the seller reserves the right to charge interest on the overdue outstanding balance at rates ranging from 1.5% to 4% 
above the bank base interest rate of the relevant jurisdiction. An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from 
the sale of goods of £4.8 million (2009: £5.1 million). This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience and 
taking into account the Group’s credit insurance cover. Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring 
system, available for use via the provider of its credit insurance cover, to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and define credit 
limits by customer.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. 
Amounts owed by related parties includes amounts owed by the former parent company of £3.6 million (2009: £3.6 million) in respect of 
indemnities provided for corporation tax liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Demerger Agreement. This balance also includes 
£0.3 million (2009: £0.5 million) receivable from the FitesaFiberweb JV for transition services (see note 32).
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £3.4 million (2009: £3.1 million) which are past 
due at the reporting date and for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and 
the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances, as in the event of default,  
the Group would pursue reimbursement by claiming on its credit insurance cover.

Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments. The credit risk on 
liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances 
for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, 
is evidence of a reduction of the cash flows. The Group has global credit insurance cover to mitigate the risk of a material bad debt. 
The Group policy provides cover up to agreed limits, but which is subject to an aggregate deductible of €0.6 million. In the event that 
cover is either restricted or withdrawn, Group policy continues to require rigorous review of the customer’s current financial health and 
careful management of the maximum exposure to the Group at any one time. The amount of risk accepted by the Group is subject to 
defined approval limits up to the executive directors. Whilst every effort is made to limit the Group’s exposure to potential credit risk,  
the provision for such risk has been decreased from £5.1 million at December 2009 to £4.8 million at the end of the current year. 
The Group has some concentration of credit risk, especially within the Hygiene businesses, where a significant percentage of sales are 
to a small Group of key customers. However the Group’s major customers have high credit ratings, and therefore the directors do not 
believe that this creates a significant risk exposure. Refer also to the Business Review on page 29.

Finance lease obligations are denominated in the Swedish Krona 2010: £nil (2009: £1.4 million). 
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount. 
Obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets.

A new loan facility (“the new RCF”) was entered into in February 2010 for a term of 3½ years until July 2013 and for an amount of  
circa £210 million, comprising multi-currency facilities of €110 million and US$170 million. 
The majority of borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk, against which the Group seeks 
to protect itself through interest rate swaps (see note 21). The effective rates on borrowings are not materially different from their 
nominal interest rates. 
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. The business has secured loans of £1.2 million (2009: £1 million). The RCF is guaranteed 
by a number of the Group’s trading entities in respect of the parent’s liabilities. All other bank loans are unsecured, although there are 
some cases where parent guarantees have been issued in respect of bank loans to overseas subsidiaries.
At the year end, the Group had available $27.8 million (2009: $147.1 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Covenants include an EBITDA/net debt gearing covenant of 3.0x and an interest cover covenant of 5.0x for the majority of the term of the 
new RCF, with more relaxed covenants during the initial period. Under the new facility, covenant tests are required on a quarterly basis, 
compared to the six-monthly testing under the original RCF. 
Liquidity risk management
The Group is exposed to short term liquidity risks if outflows exceed the funds currently available at the time. Ultimate responsibility for 
liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors. The board in conjunction with the Group’s treasury function have built an 
appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves under the revolving credit facility and 
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring adequate funds are drawn down to cover any outflows required, 
subject to the restrictions imposed by the Group’s banking covenants. The additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal 
to further reduce liquidity risk are set out above.

Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt which 
includes borrowings disclosed in this note, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 26 to 28. The Group reviews its capital structure regularly and as 
part of such review, it considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. 84     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010

externally imposed capital requirement
Under the revolving credit facility described above, the Group is subject to the same capital requirements of a gearing ratio (net debt to 
EBITDA) and an interest cover ratio (EBITDA to interest) which will be measured every three months on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September 
and 31 December. EBITDA is defined as underlying operating profit adjusted to exclude interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation 
and certain other non-cash items. 
The net debt to EBITDA requirements are set out in the following table. 
relevant period ending:   Consolidated Net borrowings shall not exceed
30 June 2010, 30 September 2010 and 31 December 2010  3.20 times EBITDA
31 March 2011   3.125 times EBITDA
30 June 2011, 30 September 2011 and 31 December 2011  3.00 times EBITDA
31 March 2012 – 30 June 2013   2.75 times EBITDA
The EBITDA to interest ratio will also be measured every three months and is as follows:
relevant period ending:   ebiTDA shall exceed
30 June 2010 – 31 March 2011    4.50 times interest
30 June 2011 – 30 June 2013   5.00 times interest
The Group has remained within the limits of both its original and new facilities at all times over the life of the facilities. 
The immediate impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s net debt versus the slower impact on the Group’s trading results 
can adversely impact the calculation of the Group’s gearing covenant at the covenant test dates. This risk is mitigated by the existence 
of a clause in both the Group’s original and new RCF Agreements allowing net debt to be translated at the cumulative average exchange 
rates for the relevant period, if, and only if, the Group would be in breach of the covenant if spot rates are used to retranslate net debt.

at the balance sheet date and are held as assets and liabilities within other receivables and payables. Derivative instruments are fair 
valued based on the estimated market valuations provided by the respective bank with which the instrument is held. 
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The Group is required to analyse its financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, and to 
classify them into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
w  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
w  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
w  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All fair value measurements of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position are classified as Level 2 as 
defined above. Note that there were no transfers between the levels during the year.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s corporate treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial 
markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to operations. These risks include market risk (including currency 
risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. 
The Group seeks to manage the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures. The use 
of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which provide written principles on 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the 
investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer on a continuous 
basis and periodically by internal audit. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial 
instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  
The Group enters into a variety of financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:
w  forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising in trading subsidiaries, primarily through net sales 
to customers and purchases from suppliers in currencies other than their domestic local currency;
w interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates, and
w forward foreign exchange swaps to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on net balance sheet exposure around the Group.
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk. 
Foreign currency risk management
The overall policy of Fiberweb is to use borrowings in currency to manage the translational currency risk arising from assets and 
earnings in overseas subsidiaries. The currency profile of borrowings under the RCF broadly mirrors both the currency profile of 
the Group’s net assets and EBITDA. Foreign currency-denominated borrowings are largely designated as net investment hedges. 
Foreign exchange forwards are used to manage the net balance sheet exposure. It is the Group’s policy not to undertake speculative 
currency transactions. 
Fiberweb’s business is characterised by a relatively low level of cross border activity, and therefore the Group has little transactional 
currency exposure. Overall, the volume of transactions with a currency impact is below 10% of turnover. However, the Group’s policy 
is that, where significant transactional exposures exist, these exposures should be hedged with maturities not to exceed twelve 
months.
The Group monitors the translational foreign currency exposures of its financial assets and liabilities on a monthly basis, adapting 
its portfolio of loans and hedges as may be required. 
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge transactional risk are taken to the income statement.  
As at 31 December 2010, the Group had committed to a notional amount of £33.4 million (2009: £43.1 million) of forward contracts to 
buy or sell foreign currency. The fair value of such transactions was £nil (2009: an asset of £0.2 million).

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate applicable for the US Dollar and the Euro. Operating profit, EBITDA and 
net debt are the key inputs into the Group’s gearing covenant and the exchange impacts on these variables are monitored closely. 
The following table illustrates the impact on the Group’s continuing underlying operating profit, EBITDA, net debt and equity of a  
10% increase and decrease in Sterling against each of these currencies, assuming all other variables are unchanged. The use of a 10% 
variation has been chosen in light of the magnitude of recent fluctuations in both the US Dollar and Euro values against Sterling. These 
values have been computed using the currency profile of the Group’s operating profit, EBITDA and net debt. For the restatement of the 
Group’s operating profit and EBITDA, the Sterling equivalents have been retranslated by flexing the cumulative average exchange rates 
used by the Group for the relevant periods. For the restatement of the Group’s net debt and equity, the Sterling equivalents have been 
retranslated by flexing the actual closing exchange rates used by the Group at the period ends. The relevant cumulative average and 
closing exchange rates used by the Group for 2010 and 2009 are published in the Business Review on page 29.

21.  Derivative financial instruments continued
The impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s operating profit and EBITDA in 2010 has not been as notable as might be expected 
in the face of significant movements in both the Euro and USD cross rate with Sterling. This is attributable to the use of a 13 month 
cumulative average exchange rate to convert profits, which slows the impact of spot changes in the cross rate. 
Exchange rate movements have had a much greater impact on the Sterling equivalent of net debt and equity during 2010, since the 
translation is based on the exchange rates at a given point in time, rather than the cumulative average rate applied to the income 
statement and the absolute value being retranslated is in excess of approximately £120 million and £160 million respectively. 
interest rate risk
The Group is predominantly exposed to interest rate fluctuations on the portion of the revolving credit facility that is not covered 
by hedging arrangements. The total amount drawn down under the RCF at the year end was £173.7 million (2009: £156.4 million).  
The Group’s policy is to use a combination of debt and derivative instruments to hedge portions of its interest rate exposure for varying 
periods, up to the maturity of its underlying borrowing facilities. Interest rate swaps are entered into after due consideration by the 
Group’s treasury function of actual base interest rates and financial market projections for future changes to those rates based on 
economic conditions, and such swaps must be approved by the board of directors in line with Group policy. 
As a result of the new RCF, the Group entered into a series of interest rate swaps for totals of US$100 million and Euro 60 million (2009: 
US$100 million, Euro 60 million), spread over several banks, whereby it pays a blended average fixed rate of 1.79% for US Dollar and 
1.89% for Euros and receives floating rate. The swaps mature in 2013 and have been designated interest risk hedges. The interest rate 
swaps settle on a semi-annual basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 6-month US Dollar LIBOR and 6-month EURIBOR 
respectively. The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. The interest rate swaps 
settlements and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in the profit 
or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss. The fair market value of the swaps at  
31 December 2010 was a loss of £1.7 million (2009: a loss of £6.2 million) and the loss (2009: loss) has been debited (2009: debited) to 
the hedging reserve. 
The following table summarises the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of the interest rate swap contracts outstanding 
as at the reporting date:

    115.3  159.3  (1.7)  (6.2)
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
The interest sensitivity analysis below is based on the assumption that changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or 
expense of variable interest financial instruments and that a change in market interest rates only affects interest income or expense in 
relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at their fair value.
Under these assumptions, if market interest rates over the course of the year were on average 1% higher or lower for all currencies in 
which the Group had borrowings this would increase or decrease profit before tax and equity as follows:
         2010 2009  
         £’m £’m
Average amount drawn down under the revolving credit facility      172.3 150.8
Average amount covered by hedging arrangements        112.2 118.5
  
Average amount exposed to interest rate fluctuations       60.1 32.3
Effect on profit before tax and equity in the event of a 1% rise or fall in average interest rates over the period  0.6 0.3
During the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009, there has been no notable change in the Group’s sensitivity to interest rate 
fluctuations as a result of the high proportion of the Group’s borrowings that are hedged by interest rate swaps, effectively restricting 
exposure to changes in variable relevant base interest rates. 
Changes in interest rates in the market affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and 
all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective. 
Changes in fair values of interest rate hedging instruments are taken to the hedge reserve.  88     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
21.  Derivative financial instruments continued
Commodity risks 
The Group faces commodity raw material price exposure to a number of raw materials, mainly polypropylene and, to a lesser extent, 
polyester and polyethylene. The monthly management reporting process highlights the net impact, adverse or favourable, of fluctuations 
in raw material prices and this is considered by the board. The Group prefers to manage its exposure to polypropylene and others through 
business arrangements with its suppliers and customers, which neutralise part of the exposure. However, the market for appropriate 
hedging instruments is monitored continuously by management with a view to mitigate this risk. In July 2009, the Group took out a hedge 
contract for 12,000 tonnes of polypropylene purchases for the period 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2010; as at 31 December 2010, the Group 
is owed £0.3 million in respect of the final settlement of this contract. In December 2009, the Group entered into a contract to hedge the 
price of 14,400 tonnes of polypropylene purchases in the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010. As at 31 December 2010, the fair 
value of this hedge was a gain of £0.7 million, which has been recognised directly in the hedge reserve within Group equity. 
Further discussion of the key risks to which Fiberweb is exposed can be found on pages 29 to 31 of the Business Review.

23.  Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
The Group operates a number of pension plans worldwide. The majority of these are defined contribution in nature. The normal pension 
cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was £2.8 million (2009 £1.9 million) of which £2.7 million (2009: £1.8 million) was 
in respect of foreign schemes. This includes £1.8 million (2009: £1.1 million) relating to defined contribution schemes. The pension 
costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, where practicable, using a variety of methods 
and assumptions and otherwise, in respect of certain foreign schemes, in accordance with local regulations. 
The Group’s foreign pension schemes mainly relate to defined contribution plans 
The most significant defined benefit pension plans are in North America, where the Group operates two funded final salary pension 
arrangements. Pension costs for these plans have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method 
and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place. 
The Group also operates a number of post-retirement benefit plans in North America which principally cover healthcare and life 
assurance benefits for its current and future retirees. The costs of these benefits are also assessed by independent qualified actuaries 
using methods and assumptions appropriate under IAS 19. 
In accordance with IAS 19 the latest actuarial valuations of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plans have 
been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2010. The following weighted average financial assumptions have been adopted: 
 North America  Rest of World

  to 5% over   to 5% over
  the next  the next 
  5 years  3 years
Mortality assumptions
Mortality assumptions for the US plans are based on the US standard table RP2000 with allowance for future improvements in 
mortality allowed for in line with projections scale AA. Generational tables have been used so that the basis used to calculate liabilities 
in respect of future pensioners assumes lower mortality (i.e. a larger allowance for improvements) than for current pensioners.  
The expected future lifetimes calculated using these assumptions are summarised as follows:
Expected future lifetime of:  
 – a 65 year old current male pensioner      19.7 years 19.6 years
 – a 65 year old current female pensioner      21.6 years 21.6 years
 – a 65 year old future male pensioner (currently aged 45)      21.2 years 21.1 years
 – a 65 year old future female pensioner (currently aged 45)     22.5 years 22.5 years
The key sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities relate to the discount rate and the 
mortality rate and are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption   impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.5%  Decrease/increase by 5.6%/5.9%
Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year  Increase by 2.95%
Since the majority of the Group’s defined benefit liabilities relate to frozen US schemes, changes to inflation and salary assumptions 
do not have a material impact on the Group’s liabilities. 90     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010

The funding policy for the schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis and in consultation with an independent qualified actuary where 
appropriate in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the 
schemes over the long term. 
The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect the Group’s best estimate of the investment returns (net of tax and expenses)  
that will be earned on each asset class over the long term. The expected return on assets in the analysis of the income statement is 
based on weighted average returns using these rates, and taking into account the asset allocation of each plan.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses and other temporary differences of  
£13.3 million (2009: £15.3 million) available for offset against future profits. These assets have not been recognised as the precise 
incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be predicted accurately at this time. The Group’s tax losses 
may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for 
which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £0.1 million (2009: £0.1 million). No liability has been recognised in respect 
of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable 
that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

25.  Share-based payments
Up to the date of demerger, certain directors and employees of Fiberweb were entitled to participate in the share option schemes of the 
former parent company. 
Since demerger, Fiberweb has issued its own share-based payment compensation plans. In the year ended 31 December 2010,  
the Group recognised a total expense, within staff costs, in relation to share-based payments under equity-settled schemes of  
£0.4 million (2009: £0.9 million).
The schemes in operation during the year are as follows. 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) The LTIP provides for the grant of free shares in the form of contingent shares. 
The first award of shares under the LTIP was made 27 November 2006, when 1,143,938 shares were granted. Further awards of 1,333,333 
shares, 1,807,029 shares and 2,284,172 shares under the LTIP were made 12 and 29 May 2008 and 26 June 2009 respectively.
Shares in relation to all three of these awards will be released to participants at the end of an expected three year performance period, 
dependent on the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied. Subject to good leaver provisions, awards are forfeited 
if the employee leaves before the end of the vesting period. 
Fifty per cent of the shares awarded under the grants are governed by a TSR market based performance condition. The remaining fifty 
per cent is governed by an EPS performance condition.
The Group recognised a total expense in relation to LTIP awards of £0.4 million (2009: £0.9 million). Awards outstanding at the end of 
the year were 4,134,342 (2009: 5,506,631). The weighted average fair value of the LTIP awards during the period is 55.7 pence per share 
or £2.3 million in total (2009: 45.3 pence or £2.3 million).
The following table summarises the evolution of the Group’s LTIP awards during the period:

The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans was £0.4 million (2009: £0.9 million), all of which  
related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. After deferred tax, the total charge to the income statement was £0.4 million 
(2009: £0.9 million). The weighted average remaining contractual life of share-based payment schemes outstanding at 31 December 
2010 was 0.9 years (2009: 1.9 years).
Fair value assumptions
The fair value of shares awarded under the plans has been calculated using the market value of shares adjusted to take into account the 
TSR market based performance condition where applicable. The calculation has been performed using the stochastic pricing model. 
The assumptions made in performing the calculation for each award are listed below:
2010   2008 LTIP 2008 LTIP 2009 LTIP

25.  Share-based payments continued
Expected volatility for the grants is based on the historical volatility taking into account the expected vesting term for each grant. 
Awards of shares with no exercise price are not affected by the risk free rate of interest. In calculating the income statement charge in 
relation to the EPS element of the 2006 plans, an expected vesting percentage of 100% (2009: 100%) has been applied to the fair values. 
In relation to the EPS element of the 2008 and 2009 LTIP plans, expected vesting percentages of 100% applied to both. These vesting 
percentages have been calculated after taking into account expected staff retention rates and the probabilities attached to attainment 
of the performance condition.
The weighted average exercise price of all share-based payment schemes outstanding at December 2010 and 2009 was nil.

217,761 shares were issued on 8 March 2010 to satisfy the 2006 LTIP awards which vested in part due to the part satisfaction of the 
EPS target to which the awards were subject. There were no changes to the Group’s share capital during the year ended 31 December 
2009.
An additional 4,505,512 shares were issued on 6 January 2011 as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Boddingtons International 
Limited (see note 34).
27.  Movements on reserves
On demerger, former parent company, BBA Aviation plc (“BBA”) waived loans owed to it by Fiberweb entities totalling £90.0 million 
and creating distributable reserves in Fiberweb plc. BBA also converted £87.4 million of debt to equity in Fiberweb plc. 
The merger reserve comprises the excess between the nominal value of the shares issued in consideration of the transfer of 
subsidiaries and the book value of those subsidiary investments transferred. 
The other reserve comprises adjustments in respect of the Group reorganisation which took place as part of the demerger.  
This reserve primarily represents the difference between the capital structure of the Fiberweb entities that were owned directly by BBA 
prior to the demerger and the capital structure of Fiberweb plc and its subsidiaries after completion of the demerger restructuring. 
This reserve is not distributable. 
The capital reserve represents amounts accrued in respect of the cost of equity-settled share options in accordance with IFRS 2 
“Share-based Payments” (see note 25). 
The hedging reserve represents unrealised gains or losses on hedge instruments. 
The translation reserve represents the gains or losses on translation of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries.

i) On 31 July 2009, the Group entered into an agreement with Petropar S.A. (Petropar) to establish a 50/50 joint venture (JV), 
FitesaFiberweb, intended to create the second largest producer of spunbond nonwoven fabrics in the Americas.

30.  Acquisitions and disposals continued
The book value of the Fitesa assets is considered to approximate fair value, given that:
•  the Fitesa business primarily serves the industrial markets in the Mercosur region and there are no material contracts with 
customers to secure minimum volumes or prices;
• there are no material recognised brands within Fitesa’s product portfolio, and
•  the majority of the net book value of Fitesa’s plant and equipment comprises two new Reicofil 4 lines installed since 2006,  
such that the depreciated book value is considered a reasonable approximation of the current fair value of this equipment. 
The Fiberweb operations at Queretaro, Mexico and Washougal, US historically formed part of Fiberweb’s North American Hygiene 
business and, as such, were neither a separately reportable business nor geographic segment. Consequently, the disposal has not been 
accounted for as a discontinued operation for the purposes of IFRS 5 “Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”. 
Whilst, the disposal of these operations into the JV will impact the Group’s reported sales and gross margin, the Group’s share of the 
JV’s profits will be equity accounted and reported through underlying operating profits for the Hygiene and North American segments. 
The Group’s businesses in Washougal and Mexico contributed sales of £27.9 million (seven months to 31 July 2009) and £51.8 million to 
the Group’s Hygiene segment in the years ended 31 December 2009 and 2008 respectively. 
(ii) On 1 April 2009, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest of its joint venture partner Nordenia International 
AG in Coronor Composites GmbH (“Coronor”) for a cash consideration of €3.1 million (£2.8 million). The effective date of the acquisition 
for consolidation purposes was 1 January 2009. 
Coronor manufactures unique composite materials made of nonwoven fabrics and films primarily for use in the manufacture of medical 
drapes and its sole manufacturing line is located within Fiberweb’s site at Peine, Germany. The acquisition is consistent with Fiberweb’s 
strategy of simplifying the Group and investing in businesses with potential for sustainable differentiation and good growth prospects.
Coronor’s gross assets as at 31 December 2008 were €4.0 million (£3.7 million), including €2.0 million cash (£1.9 million) and pre-tax 
profit for the year ended 31 December 2008 was €0.6 million (£0.6 million). In the year ended 31 December 2009, Coronor generated 
sales of £10.4 million and underlying operating profit of £0.2 million, included within the Group’s Industrial market segment. 
The table below summarises the book and fair value to the Group of the assets and liabilities of this acquisition. The goodwill arising on 
the acquisition was £1.2 million.

Fiberweb (Tianjin) Speciality Nonwovens Company Limited it did not already own for a consideration of RMB 9,120,000 in cash. 
(iv) On 29 June 2009, the Group disposed of its 25.1% investment in CoraTech GmbH for a consideration of €750,000 in cash. The Group 
recognised a gain of £0.1 million on the transaction.
(v) Also in June 2009, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire a 26% interest in associate Terram Geosynthetics Private Limited 
for a consideration of £819,000 in cash (refer to note 13).
31.  Contingent liabilities
The Fiberweb business is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including specific product 
liability and environmental claims in Fiberweb North America. Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance, 
reserves and third party indemnities.
The Directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, 
will have a material adverse effect upon Fiberweb’s financial position. 98     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010

Transactions with associates and joint ventures
Terram Geosynthetics Private Limited
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group invested £0.8 million to acquire a 26% interest in associate Terram Geosynthetics 
Private Limited in India. In addition, Terram Limited sold previously impaired production equipment to the associate for proceeds of  
£1.75 million, recognising a gain on disposal, after elimination of the 26% unrealised portion of the gain, of £0.8 million within non-
recurring cost of sales (see note 5). This investment was impaired by £0.6 million during the year as it is no longer considered to be 
recoverable.
Fiberweb (Tianjin) Speciality Nonwovens Company Limited
In connection with the acquisition of the remaining 35% share in Fiberweb (Tianjin) Speciality Nonwovens Company Limited for RMB 
9,120,000, the Group paid RMB 5,472,000 during the year ended 31 December 2009. The balance of the purchase price of RMB 3,648,000 
was paid in the year ended 31 December 2010. RMB 250,000 is also included within Administrative expenses for the year ended  
31 December 2009 for rent of the plant from the ex-JV partner. 
FitesaFiberweb joint venture
FitesaFiberweb was formed on 31 July 2009 (see note 30). In accordance with a Transition Services Agreement signed on completion, the 
Group continues to provide certain administrative support services for FitesaFiberweb, primarily in connection with accounting, IT and 
human resource support. The Group also provides R&D services for the joint venture. Administrative support services are charged at 
cost plus an appropriate mark-up, based on either time spent or volume of transactions processed. R&D fees are charged at an agreed

34.  Subsequent events
On 6 January 2011, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Boddingtons International Limited, the parent 
company of the Boddingtons group of companies, for approximately £8.2 million total consideration consisting of £4.6 million in cash and 
4,505,512 Fiberweb plc shares for 100% of the issued share capital. At acquisition, the Boddingtons Group had net debt of £0.9 million. 
Boddingtons will be integrated into the Group’s Industrial segment. Goodwill and net assets at acquisition have not been presented as 
the acquisition accounting and purchase price allocation will be performed during 2011. The Terram business will be integrated into 
the Boddingtons business.
If the shares issued as part of the Boddington’s consideration had been in issue on 1 January 2010, adjusted basic earnings per share 
would have reduced to 10.4p. Unadjusted basic earnings per share would have reduced to 5.7p.
Fiberweb is in negotiations to conclude a sale and leaseback of the steam and chilled water plant commissioned in Old Hickory during 
2010. It is anticipated that the sale price will be approximately £15 million. 100     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010

The financial statements of Fiberweb plc, registered number 05683352, were approved by the board of directors and authorised for issue

Daniel Abrams
Director
As permitted by section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the 
year. Fiberweb plc reported a loss for the year ended 31 December 2010 of £1.9 million compared to a profit in 2009 of £0.9 million. 
The Company audit fee is included within the Group audit fee in the current year and cannot be separately identified.
The accompanying notes are an integral part of this balance sheet.
Company Balance Sheet
As at 31 December 2010 102     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
Notes to the Company Balance Sheet
For the year ended 31 December 2010
1.  Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared using the historical 
cost convention and in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and accounting standards. They have also been 
prepared on the going concern basis as described in the Going 
Concern Statement in the Directors’ Report on page 42 of the 
Group’s Annual Report. 
The principal accounting policies are set out below. They have all 
been applied consistently throughout the period.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in 
FRS1 “Cash Flow Statements” and has not produced a cash flow 
statement. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption 
contained in FRS8 “Related Party Transactions” and has not 
reported transactions with fellow Group undertakings. 
investments
Investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at 
cost less provision for impairment. Given that Group Reconstruction 
Relief is available under section 611 of the Companies Act 2006 
(“the Act”), the Company has taken advantage of the related option 
under section 611(1) of the Act to record the cost of the investments 
in Terram and the US subsidiaries at the nominal value of the 
shares issued in satisfaction of the acquisition. 
Treasury
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling 
at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
the balance sheet date are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising from a change 
in exchange rates subsequent to the date of transaction is 
recognised in the income statement. 
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for and 
presented under FRS26 (Revised) “Financial Instruments – 
Measurement” and FRS25 “Financial Instruments – Disclosure 
and Presentation”. Derivative financial instruments utilised by 
the Company comprise foreign exchange contracts, interest rate 
swaps and commodity derivatives. All such instruments are used 
for hedging purposes to manage the risk profile of an underlying 
exposure of the Group in line with the Group’s risk management 
policies. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance 
sheet at fair value. Recognition of gains or losses on derivative 
instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as 
a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge. 
The effective portion of gains or losses on hedges is deferred in 
reserves until the impact from the hedged item is recognised in 
the income statement. The ineffective portion of such gains and 
losses is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at 
their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all 
of its liabilities. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at  
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption  
and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to 
the profit and loss account using the effective interest method 
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to  
the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they 
arise. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their 
nominal value. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
Share-based payments 
Fiberweb plc operates four share-based compensation plans 
which are detailed in note 25 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Under FRS 20 the equity-settled share-based 
payments under these schemes are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is 
expensed within staff costs in the income statement on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate 
of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of 
non-market based vesting conditions.
The fair value of shares awarded under the plans has been 
calculated using the stochastic pricing model using the market 
value of shares adjusted to take into account market based 
performance conditions where applicable. The charge is adjusted 
each year to reflect the expected and actual level of vesting.
Tangible fixed assets
Property, plant and equipment is stated in the balance sheet 
at cost. Depreciation is provided on the cost or valuation of 
property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value and 
is calculated on a straight line basis over the following estimated 
useful lives of the assets:
Leasehold improvements  over the term of the lease
Office fixtures and equipment  3-5 years
Plant and equipment  10 years
Leases 
Where assets are financed by lease agreements that give rights 
similar to ownership (finance leases), the assets are treated  
as if they had been purchased and the leasing commitments  
are shown as obligations to the lessors. The capitalisation 
values of the assets are written off on a straight line basis over 
the shorter of the periods of the leases or the useful lives of the 
assets concerned. The capital elements of future leases are 
recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged 
to the income statement over the period of the leases to produce 
a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital payments 
outstanding.      Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    103 
1.  Basis of accounting continued
For all other leases (operating leases), the rental payments are 
charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the 
lives of the leases. 
Pension and post-retirement benefits 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are 
charged as an expense as they fall due. 
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and 
takes into account taxation deferred due to timing differences 
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes. Deferred tax is provided in full on all 
liabilities. In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent it is regarded that it is more likely 
than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities have not been discounted. 
2. Dividends
In respect of the current year, the directors propose that a final 
dividend of 2.5 pence per share (2009: 2.50 pence per share) 
will be paid to shareholders on 27 May 2011. This dividend is 
subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting and in accordance with FRS 21, “Events after the 
Balance Sheet Date”, has not been recorded as a liability in 
these financial statements. The proposed dividend is payable to 
all shareholders on the Register of Members on 26 April 2011. 
The total estimated dividend payable is £3.1 million (2009: £3.0 
million).

A new loan facility (“the new RCF”) was entered into in February 2010 for a term of 3½ years until July 2013 and for an amount of  
circa £210 million, comprising multi-currency facilities of €110 million and US$170 million. 
The majority of borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk, against which the Group seeks to 
protect itself through interest rate swaps. Details can be found in the notes to the Group statutory financial statements (see note 21).
At year end the Group had available $27.8 million (2009: $147.1 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    105

14.  Related party disclosures
For periods beginning before 6 April 2008, FRS 8.3(c) provided an exemption from disclosure in the financial statements of subsidiary 
undertakings, 90 per cent or more of whose voting rights are controlled within the group, of transactions with entities that are part 
of the group or investees of the group qualifying as related parties, provided that the consolidated financial statements in which that 
subsidiary is included are publicly available. 
This paragraph is amended in the revised Standard and in the Companies Act 2006, for periods beginning on or after 6 April 2008, 
so that the exemption includes the parent company as well as subsidiaries and so deals with intra-group transactions with 100% 
subsidiaries. However it does not provide exemption from disclosure of transactions with partly owned subsidiaries or with parties 
outside the group. The Company wishes to take advantage of this exemption therefore only these transactions are disclosed.  
These can be found in the notes to the Group statutory financial statements (Note 32).     Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010    107

Analysis of Shareholdings
Dividend re-investment plan
A scheme which allows you to use your dividend to buy further 
shares in Fiberweb plc.
Capita IRG Trustees Limited (“CIRGT”) is offering shareholders 
in Fiberweb plc the opportunity to participate in a Dividend 
Re-investment Plan.
What is a Dividend Re-investment Plan (DRIP)
This is a plan that allows private shareholders to reinvest cash 
dividends from their investments cheaply and easily back into 
Fiberweb plc shares and so obtain the benefits of compounding.
How is the plan managed?
The plan is managed by CIRGT which is authorised and regulated 
by the Financial Services Authority.
On the dividend date, shareholders who join the plan are still paid 
the cash dividend, but CIRGT then uses the cash to buy shares in 
Fiberweb on behalf of the shareholder. Please note that CIRGT 
may not offer a DRIP for every dividend paid. If a DRIP is not made 
available, the shareholder will receive the cash dividend.
What are the benefits to shareholders?
•  You can increase your shareholding over the long term at lower 
dealing commission rates than are generally available through 
retail brokers; 
•  Compounding effect of increasing shareholding and dividend 
payments;
• Offers the protection of a regulated service;
•  An alternative for overseas shareholders in qualifying countries 
who may have difficulty cashing sterling dividend cheques due 
to high bank charges.
What price will the shares be bought at?
CIRGT instructs its broker to buy shares on payment of the dividend at 
the current market price. Deals are aggregated for all shareholders. 
Shareholders will not be aware of the share price when they sign up 
for the DRIP.
What happens to any cash dividend left over?
Any cash dividend left over which is insufficient to purchase a whole 
share will be carried forward and held, without interest, in a Client 
Money bank account.
How much does the plan cost?
The DRIP commission charged to the shareholders is one per cent 
of the purchase price of the shares, with a minimum charge of £2.50 
plus SDRT, charged at the prevailing rate of the deal value (currently 
0.5%). Full details of all costs will be sent to you by CIRGT.

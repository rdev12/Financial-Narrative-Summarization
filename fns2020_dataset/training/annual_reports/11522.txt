Power sector recovery under way
Market overview
Whilst the demand-supply imbalance strongly underpins the fundamentals of  
the Indian power sector, it has faced challenges on many fronts in the recent past.  
The Government and regulators, pressed by industry players, are taking steps  
to refuel the growth of the sector. 
We have discussed some of the key challenges facing the sector and the recent  
changes below.
Coal availability 
Short supply of domestic coal due to delays in new 
coal blocks permitting
Recent changes and regulatory initiatives
 > Feb–Apr 2012: Coal ministry directs Coal India 
Limited (‘CIL ’) to sign Fuel Supply Agreements (‘FSA’) 
for 80% of assured coal quantity to producers with 
long-term power purchase agreements 
commissioned between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 
2015. 
 > Sep 2012: CIL Board agrees to supply 80% coal of 
which 65% is domestic coal and 15% is imported 
coal at cost-plus basis. CIL also agrees to pay 
penalties of 1.5-40% for shortage in supply.
 > Sep 2012: Coal India to import coal to supplement 
shortfall in domestic production on cost plus basis.
 > Jun 2013: Government allows pass through of 
increased cost to consumers on imported coal 
purchased to substitute domestic coal shortage.
 > Jul 2013: Coal Ministry directs Coal India to sign 
FSAs for capacity aggregating 78,000 MW instead 
of the previously decided 60,678 MW.
 > A fall in import coal prices due to increased global 
supply in the last year has helped, to some degree, 
balance costs against higher imports. 
Infrastructure Investment 
The sector has seen little investment by the public 
sector, in upgrading and expanding facilities 
Recent changes and regulatory initiatives
 > Following the ‘blackout’ in North India, which  
left half the country with no power for two days,  
the Government has stepped up and accelerated 
investment in electricity infrastructure through a 
public/private partnership model under Financial 
Restructuring Package (‘FRP’).

Tariffs and State Utility financial status 
In the last decade, tariffs have increased marginally 
across Indian States and stayed below purchase cost. 
As a result, utilities have built huge losses 
Recent changes and regulatory initiatives
 > Sep 2012: The Government approved the FRP of 
State Utilities, on the condition that the state utilities 
revise tariffs annually, reduce transmission losses 
and improve infrastructure. 
 > Thus far, State Governments in TN, UP, Haryana, 
AP, Rajasthan, Bihar, Kerala, HP and Jharkhand are 
at various stages of FRP implementation and tariff 
rises were implemented in 24 states in FY13.
Interest rates 
375 bps increase in interest rates from Mar 2010 to  
Oct 2011, leading to increased financial costs for  
power projects 
Recent changes and regulatory initiatives
 > Inflation rate fell to 7% in FY13, from a high of  
c. 11% in previous years, prompting rate cuts  
by the Reserve Bank of India.
 > Apr 2012 & Jan 2013 Interest rate cut: RBI cuts 
Repo rate (lending rate of RBI to banks) and SLR 
(Statutory Liquidity Ratio) by c. 100 bps. 
 > Jun 2012: Relaxation of External Commercial 
Borrowings for infrastructure and power sector 
under approval route for refinancing existing debt. 
 > Reduction in withholding tax on interest on foreign 
borrowing to 5%.
Exchange rates
The Indian Rupee has weakened c. 33% since 2010 
from Rs 45 to Rs 60 in June 2013 affecting all in the 
sector 
Recent changes and regulatory initiatives
 > Rupee impacted by: 
 –  increasing current account deficit due to high 
crude oil and gold imports 
 –  reduced foreign inward investment due to a 
slowdown in reforms/policy leading to an overall 
discouraging outlook and
 –  the Fed’s stance on tapering the financial stimulus. 
 > Sep 2012: The Government announces FDI in retail, 
power trading and aviation.
 > Jul 2013: RBI intervention on gold purchases and 
export earnings repatriation.

EBITDA margin
This is the average price realised per unit of power sold. 
Revenue for the Company is calculated by multiplying the 
number of units sold by the average price realised.  
The average tariff achieved for FY13 was Rs 5.58/kWh, 
amongst the highest in the sector.
The cost of fuel is the primary cost input in power plants. 
Cost of generation per kWh decreased marginally to  
Rs 3.19 (FY12: Rs 3.25) due to a decrease in imported 
coal prices offset by an increase in domestic coal costs.
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and 
Amortisation is a factor of volumes, prices and cost 
of production. This EBITDA measure is calculated 
by adjusting non-operational and exceptional items, 
depreciation and net finance cost. It is a measure of 
the Company’s operating profitability. EBITDA for 
FY13 was £17.7m. (FY12: £11.3m).

Gearing is a measure of net debt to shareholders’  
equity plus net debt. The Group has net debt of  
£52.98m (2012: £31.59m) and gearing of 37% (2012: 
gearing of 19%). As development of projects proceeds, 
the gearing increases.
This represents net profit after tax attributable to equity 
shareholders. EPS growth also demonstrates the 
management of our capital structure. In FY13, earnings  
per share was 2.48 pence. 
Plant load factor measures the output of a power plant 
compared to the maximum output it could produce. A 
higher load factor represents a more efficient plant and 
means fixed costs are spread over more kWh of output 
resulting in a lower price per unit of electricity.

The Group has grown substantially during the 
period in scale, performance and confidence. 
We have navigated the difficult trading 
conditions that the electricity sector in India,  
in general, has experienced courtesy of our 
flexible business model and through the 
delivery of our projects.
I am pleased to report that these annual results mark 
another year of all round progress in terms of both trading 
and new projects under development. Viewed in the 
context of the variable and mixed performance of the power 
sector in India in general, the consistent record of growth 
and profitability returned by your Company over the last five 
years underscores the soundness of our delivery 
capabilities and of our focus. 
Economic growth in India continues to be a healthy 5%, 
albeit lower than the 6–8 % of the previous years. This 
somewhat reduced growth rate needs to be seen in the 
context of both the current overall economic slowdown 
worldwide and the fact that this country, in the years since 
1980, has not missed a single year of economic growth. 
The power sector in India has achieved much in the last ten 
years in terms of capacity addition but still more remains to 
be achieved. A commendable increase in new capacity of 
115.47 GW (2003–2013) still results in power deficits of 
between 10 and 20% in different states across the country. 
The underlying, structural issue of low tariffs charged by the 
dominant, state owned producers is now being addressed 
in earnest with several state utilities having carried out two 
revisions of tariffs since April 2012. This process of making 
tariff regimes more realistic will ensure both better pricing 
for power suppliers and improved financial health for the 
utilities, factors that will contribute to further growth in 
the sector.
The power transmission system in the country will soon 
operate in a synchronous, seamless mode when the 
southern grid is fully integrated with the rest of the network 
in 2014. This will not only be among the largest in the world, 
supporting a total system throughput of more than 200 GW, 
but will result in a single, integral power market for the 
country as a whole.
In this overall context, the timely realisation of OPG’s 
new projects is of long term importance and I note 
with satisfaction that, in the nine months to June 2013, 
we brought two further plants at the Chennai site into 
generation. Given the progress achieved in the construction 
of both the 160 MW unit at Chennai and the 2 x 150 MW 
units at Kutch, these units should be in revenue within the 
indicated timelines if not somewhat earlier.
Whilst our present focus is on timely commissioning of the 
Chennai 160 MW and Kutch 2 x 150 MW units, further 
growth options, and the timing of these, are under 
continuous review. We believe that the critical mass and 
cash flows to be achieved with a capacity of 700 MW will 
sustain us on this growth path.
It being very much the case that every day is a new day  
in the power business, I must thank the employees  
and management at all levels for their dedication and 
performance which have contributed to the progress of  
the Company. I am equally thankful to my colleagues on  
the Board and to our shareholders who have supported  
us always.
I am pleased to be able to point, in conclusion, to two 
factors that characterise the Company’s performance and 
its trading environment. Firstly, the Group is on course to 
transform into an operator of significant capacity, with the 
two current projects well under way. Secondly, policy 
makers are giving increasing emphasis on addressing some 
of the constraints in the sector such as tariff levels, coal 
availability and transmission throughput. I look forward to 
another year of progress.

Our Company has transformed itself from a 
promising growth story into a strong cash 
generative business with a superior growth  
profile and further potential.
On completion of our fifth year as a listed company I am 
pleased to report that we now have 270 MW of power 
generation assets compared with just 20 MW at the  
time of listing on AIM in May 2008. Over that time our 
Company has transformed itself from a promising growth 
story into a strong cash generative business with a 
superior growth profile and further potential. Our 
earnings at 2.48 pence in 2013 were an all-time high.  
We have commissioned two assets in the last nine 
months thus completing the first major phase of our 
growth programme. Bringing this portfolio of three 
significant co-located assets to a steady state gives  
us the basis on which to deliver further value to our 
customers and shareholders. 
Robust operating and financial performance 
The commissioning of 77 MW Chennai II in September 
2012, load factors of over 90% on both assets and 13% 
higher average tariffs led to a strong performance for  
the year. Underlying revenues in Rupee terms were up 
63% whilst EBITDA margins were firm at 32% and  
we generated our highest earnings per share to date  
of 2.48 pence. 
Our plants performed ahead of expectations and I 
commend our operating team led by our COO, T 
Chandramoulee, for the quick stabilisation and ramp up 
of Chennai II. Further, the team has ensured Chennai I 
and II achieved excellent load factors in spite of an 
extended 25 day shutdown at Chennai I. 
A few days ago we announced the accelerated delivery 
and commencement of commercial operations at 80 MW 
Chennai III. This unit has been commissioned several 
months ahead of schedule by our own in-house team. 
Increased tariffs 
Burgeoning financial losses of the state electricity boards 
triggered a much needed rise in tariffs across India 
during the year. Financial restructuring packages and 
regulatory changes are expected to require regular 
review of tariffs going forward and we have already  
seen more than one round of tariff increases and  
the introduction of Fuel Price Adjustment charges in 
some states. 
Accordingly, as our flexible model allows, we continue  
to supply the bulk of our power to the Tamil Nadu state 
utility on short-term contracts as tariffs are attractive.  
We have recently agreed to supply c. 90% output from 
Chennai I and II until May 2014 and a further 90% output 
from Chennai III until September 2013 at Rs 5.50/kWh. 
Imported coal prices lower but expected to remain 
flat in short-term 
Whilst international coal prices have been lower than the 
prior year by 3%, domestic coal prices increased by 21% 
during the year. As we used a higher quantity of imported 
coal and Chennai II burnt exclusively imported coal our 
overall average unit cost remained flat. This once again 
demonstrated the advantages of our flexible boilers.

cONSTRUcTION
Both of our remaining 
principal projects at 
Chennai and Gujarat 
remain on schedule, to 
achieve commissioning  
in 2014, with civil works 
and foundations largely 
complete at both sites 
and other construction 
activities well progressed. 
Our strategy is to continue to procure imported coal 
through a mix of short and long-term contracts as 
efficiently as possible. 
Our projects
On 29 May 2013 we updated shareholders as to the 
degree of completeness of each of our projects under 
development. We did so in continuation of our strategy to 
adopt an open communication style and to promote an 
understanding of the value we believe to be built in to 
each project. 
Both of our remaining principal projects at Chennai and 
Gujarat remain on schedule, to achieve commissioning in 
2014, with civil works and foundations largely complete at 
both sites and other construction activities well progressed.
Building a strong team
The health and safety of our employees and contractors 
is of paramount importance to us. During the year we 
instituted a formal Health, Safety and Environment  
(‘HSE’) committee which has already led initiatives to 
improve standards and practices at our various sites.  
For instance, our flagship 77 MW Chennai I unit has  
recently been awarded ISO 14001 and OHSAS  
18001 certification.
Our team has gained in experience at all levels from 
development to management with all Engineering, 
Procurement and Construction (‘EPC’) and Operations 
and Maintenance (‘O&M’) principally performed in-house. 
The team has incorporated lessons from each of the 
projects to achieve continuous improvements and 
efficiencies across projects and operations. We are 
proud of our team’s achievements. 
Outlook
We believe the macro environment for electricity 
generation in India is recovering gradually. Forecasts for 
growth in India remain moderate at over 5% in this 
pre-election year. However, even at moderate growth 
levels, taken over a two to three year time horizon we see 
recent trends in the electricity generation sector as 
unstoppable – namely supply shortages in most parts of 
the country and the recognition amongst policymakers 
that power must continue to pave the way for both 
industrial growth and improvements in living standards. 
Accordingly over that same time period we do anticipate 
tariffs to rise gradually, more new capacity (thermal and 
renewable), and minor improvements in domestic fuel 
supplies accompanied by measures to moderately 
improve the investment climate for Indian infrastructure. 
As a result we believe the 460 MW second phase of our 
asset delivery programme to be well-timed as industry 
conditions should further stabilise and our priorities 
during the coming months are therefore to maximise our 
existing operations, de-risk the final elements of the 
project portfolio and evaluate our further growth strategy.

270 MW
With 270 MW in operation and generation on  
c. 1bn units, the operations team has been working 
continuously to improve operating effciencies and 
parameters. As with the EPC, the Operations and 
Management (‘O&M’) was managed by a third party 
initially for Chennai I and is now managed by our  
own team. 
We managed to ramp up Chennai II to c. 100%  
PLF within six months of commissioning and have 
consistently achieved an average PLF of over 90%.  
In addition, both Chennai I and II plants have achieved 
industry lows of auxiliary power consumptions  
since commissioning. 
The Chennai plants have been awarded the ISO 14001 
certifcate in May 2013. 
Capability – Operations 
The Company has transformed from a developer to an 
operator with three plants in generation. Our revenues 
have multiplied f ve times to £56m from £11.5m in FY10 
and EBITDA has grown 250% in the same period to 
£17.7m, outperforming our peers in the Indian power 
sector in diff cult trading times. We have built a strong 
f nancial base and delivered a growth of seven times  
in EPS of 2.48 pence in FY13. We remain focused in

Chennai I – 77 MW
During the year, the Chennai I plant achieved a PLF of 
92% ahead of our budgeted levels. Utilisation factor, 
which is the average PLF achieved based on available 
days, was 102.3% in FY13 as compared to 100.7% 
in FY12. Availability and, as a result, overall PLF was 
marginally lower compared to FY12 despite a 25 days 
shutdown in June for planned maintenance of Chennai I 
and connection of common facilities to Chennai II. 
Generation 
The team improved efficiencies across other operating 
parameters which is demonstrated by the reduction in the 
secondary fuel oil consumption in FY13 to 0.846 ml/kWh 
(FY12: 1.015 ml/kWh), which is below the Central Electricity 
Regulatory Commission, India operating norms of  
1 ml/kWh. Further, the plant heat rate reduced by c. 4% 
showing an improved thermal performance, resulting in 
lesser per unit consumption of coal for Chennai I.
Chennai II – 77 MW
The Company announced its successful commissioning 
of 77 MW Chennai II plant in September 2012. Chennai II 
was delivered on schedule and within budget, despite the 
increase in interest rates during the construction period. 
The new plant is a twin of the Chennai I 77 MW plant on 
the same site and shares some common infrastructure 
and operational personnel. 
The plant achieved stabilisation within 30 days, (120 days 
for Chennai I) and achieved a PLF of 99% in the year 
ended 31 March 2013. Chennai II has set benchmarks in 
certain operating parameters like auxiliary power 
consumption. 
Chennai III – 80 MW
The Company announced its successful commissioning 
of 80 MW Chennai III plant in June 2013. The plant 
achieved stabilisation within seven days, exceeding the 
industry benchmark. The Chennai III plant has been 
delivered ahead of schedule and within budget. Chennai III 
plant is a replica of the Company’s existing 77 MW 
Chennai I and II plants and OPG is expected to benefit 
from lower unit costs of production from the shared 
common infrastructure and operational personnel. 
The Company announced its successful commissioning  
of 77 MW Chennai II power project in September 2012. 
Chennai II was delivered on schedule and within budget,

Condenser (‘ACC’) were under way. Chimney construction 
was commenced. Equipment order was completed and 
delivery commenced in Q4 FY13. In June 2013 boiler 
erection was commenced. 
The project is fully financed and has all approvals in 
place. EPC for the Balance of Plant (‘BoP’) is being done 
by our in-house team. This plant will also benefit from 
shared facilities with Chennai II and III, such as power 
evacuation facility, coal handling and storage, water 
treatment plant, all of which have already been 
completed. The plant is expected to commission in FY15. 
Gujarat – 300 MW
Significant progress has been made on the Gujarat site 
during the year. Project civil works, including those for 
boiler, ESP , TG Hall, TG Deck, BoP are at an advanced 
stage. The project has achieved a number of major 
milestones including completion of the 220 metre chimney 
shell concreting, lifting of boiler steam drums for both the 
150 MW units and erection of the Unit I generator stator. 
By June 2013, approximately 75% of boiler, turbine, 
generator components were utilised in erection at site. 
Air-cooled condenser and coal handling plant erection 
works have also begun. 
The Gujarat site has developed and implemented a 
comprehensive construction safety system, as detailed

Continual assessment
Principal risks
The Group faces a number of risks to its business and strategy. Management
of these risks is an integral part of the management of the Group. The Group
has in place a process for identifying and managing risks.
The list of principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group’s business set out 
below cannot be exhaustive because of the very nature of risk. New risks emerge 
and the severity and probability associated with these will change over time.
Sector-related risks
Risk Potential impact Monitoring and mitigation
Power sale in
the Group
captive model
The Group’s power plants derive their revenue from the 
Group captive model selling power to captive consumers and 
partly from sale on short-term, medium-term, or long-term 
sale basis and would, for this purpose, enter into power 
purchase agreements with counterparties such as captive 
consumers, power trading companies and state utilities.
Contracts with customers may impose restrictions on the 
Company’s ability to, amongst other things, increase prices at 
short notice and undertake expansion initiatives with other 
customers. This could affect the revenue in the short to 
medium term.
 > Review contracts periodically to obtain best 
possible tariffs
 > Flexibility to sell to captive consumers or in the 
open market
 > Benchmarking captive consumer prices to state 
utility prices to benefit from any price increases
Availability of
fuel supply and
costs
The Group has coal linkages with domestic companies and 
agreements for imported coal. 
The dependence on third parties for coal exposes the 
Group’s power plants to vulnerabilities such as non-supply, 
price increases in the international market, foreign exchange 
fluctuations and increases in shipping costs. This could 
impact the operations and profitability of the Group. 
 > Seeking long-term supplies
 > Maintaining adequate storage facility to keep 
appropriate levels of surplus stocks
 > Maintaining relationship with suppliers and 
mitigating any potential disruption
 > Developing different sources for fuel supply 
especially in the imports market
Timely
execution of
projects
The length of the construction period and the cost to 
complete any given project is dependent on third party 
suppliers and EPC contractors. 
Factors such as disputes with contractors, price increases, 
shortages of construction materials, delays in supply from 
various contractors, accidents, unforeseen difficulties, 
changes in government policies and delays in receipt of 
necessary approvals can lead to cost overruns and delays 
impacting the timely completion and ultimately the profitability 
of projects. 
 > Close monitoring of projects by the project team 
and addressing issues causing delays
 > Ordering key equipment and long lead items 
ahead of schedule
 > Including liquidated damages clauses in its 
contracts in relation to such matters as delays 
and inferior Workmanship
 > Developed strong and well experienced 
in-house EPC team to deliver the projects  
on time
Project Finance The development of power plants is a capital intensive 
business and the Group’s projects require access to both 
equity and debt markets.
Terms of debt funding/Interest rates may change.
 > Assessing financial viability of projects
 > Financing projects with an optimum mix of debt 
and equity including internal accruals
 > Obtaining in-principle project finance from 
banks before commencement of projects
 > Monitoring cash flows to ensure repayment of 
debt and interest in line with schedule
 > Exploring new relationships in debt markets to 
ensure optimum debt funding terms 21

management
The Group’s plants are located in different states and in areas 
where there is adequate land to set up projects, water 
availability and connectivity to ports. Setting up power 
projects in such areas may affect the environment and health 
and safety. 
Changes in legislation and standards, the Group’s failure to 
control adequately environmental and health and safety risks 
or activism by local groups could have an adverse impact on 
the operations of the Company. 
 > The Group has management systems to 
monitor the health, safety and environmental 
aspects of business. These are communicated 
to the relevant businesses and employees with 
training provided on a regular basis
 > There is a formal committee responsible for 
health, safety and environmental issues at

India-specific risks
Risk Potential impact Monitoring and mitigation
Government
policy and
regulations
The power industry is heavily regulated with permits and 
licences issued by the Indian Government. Further, the 
regulatory environment is continuously changing. Obtaining 
these licences is critical to the Group’s development plans.
Failure or delays in receiving permits or approvals could have 
an adverse impact on projects and affect the profitability of 
the Group.
 > The Group monitors and reviews changes in the 
regulatory environment and its commitments 
under licences previously granted
 > It continually ensures compliance with the 
conditions contained within individual licences 
and is mindful of the importance of complying 
with national and local legislation and standards
 > The Group maintains an open and proactive 
relationship with the Indian Government and its 
various agencies
Ability to retain
fiscal and tax
incentives
The Group’s existing and planned power plants are based on 
the various fiscal and tax benefits that will be available to the 
Company by the federal and state government. 
A change in government policy to withdraw these incentives 
can have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Group. 
 > The Group continues to monitor changes and 
developments in respect of incentives provided 
by the Indian federal and state authorities
 > Project investment returns are evaluated based 
on the expected incentives available to the 
Company and are revised based on the most 
up-to-date guidance available
Exchange rate
fluctuations
As a consequence of the international nature of its business, 
the Company is exposed to risks associated with changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. The Group’s operations are 
based in India and its functional currency is the Indian Rupee 
although the presentational currency is Great Britain Pound 
Sterling. The raw material is purchased in US Dollar. 
The Group’s financial results may be affected by appreciation 
or depreciation of the value of the foreign exchange rates 
relative to the Indian Rupee. 
 > Putting in place, where appropriate, forward 
contracts or hedging mechanisms
 > Monitoring our risk on a regular basis where no 
hedging mechanism is in place and taking steps 
to minimise potential losses
Global financial
instability
The Indian market and Indian economy are influenced by 
global economic and market conditions, particularly emerging 
market countries in Asia. Financial instability in recent years 
has inevitably affected the Indian economy. 
Continuing uncertainty and concerns about contagion in the 
wake of the financial crises could have a negative impact on 
the availability of funding. 
 > The Group continues to monitor changes and 
developments in the global markets to assess 
the impact on its financing plans 22

Gross Profit
Gross profit (‘GP’), excluding depreciation in 2013 was £22.94m (£12.94m in 2012). GP is driven mainly on account of 
the 173 days operation of Chennai II (77 MW) plant and also due to a higher realisation of tariff and to an extent offset 
by the lower generation by Chennai I (77 MW) plant. 
Cost of revenue was 59% of revenue in FY13 lower from 66% in FY12. Over 90% of the costs of revenue are fuel 
costs i.e. coal. The average factory gate costs for Indian coal increased 21% while Indonesian coal costs decreased 
by 3%. The table below shows the price and blend of Indian and Indonesian coal consumed in FY13 and FY12 for 
Chennai I. Chennai II burnt imported coal during the year.

Taxation 
The Group consolidated PBT at £10.54m is after charging £1.11m towards adjustment in the carrying value of the 
legacy plants and £0.97m towards amortisation of Employee stock options (both being non-cash charges at the level 
of holding company). As such the effective PBT subject to tax is £12.62m.
Expenditure on projects
This relates to expenses incidental to projects under construction. These expenses in 2013 were £0.61m in (FY12 £0.63m).
Employee stock option charge 
This pertains to the amortisation of the value of stock options granted to certain Directors and is non-cash in nature.
Profits after tax
Profits after tax have increased by £8.55m from £0.28m in 2012 to £8.83m in 2013. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment has increased by £89.47m, 96.2% year-on-year growth, mainly reflecting the 
capitalisation of 77 MW Chennai II plant and the increase in capital work in progress on account of additional power 
plants in Chennai and Gujarat.

Current assets
Current assets have decreased by £3.04m to £114.38m year-on-year primarily as a result of the following: 
 > Reduction in the cash and cash equivalents by £14.97m due to the increase in investments made in the 
Gujarat and additional Chennai power plants; 
 > Increase in trade receivables by £17.40m; and
 > Decrease in other assets by £5.48m.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities have increased by £24.34m primarily on account of the increased bank borrowings and 
buyers credit.
Other non-current liabilities
Other non-current liabilities have increased by £50m primarily on account of increase in bank borrowing to meet  
the capital project expenses.
Gearing
Net borrowings (borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents) increased by £52.98m on account of capital 
expenditure on projects. Gearing ratio was 37%. The table below shows the investment in the projects under

Sustainable commitment
Investing in people
The Board established a Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee (‘HSE Committee’) during the year, to develop, 
implement and oversee a health and safety culture across 
the Group and to assist the Board and management in its 
drive towards achieving and maintaining industry-leading 
performance in these areas. 
Health and safety
The health and safety of our employees and contractors 
is of paramount important to us and the Board is 
committed to ensuring that the Group’s activities do not 
result in injury or illness to any employee, contractor or 
member of the public and strives hard to prevent 
work-related incidents, illnesses and injuries.
As a key step in this direction, the Board established a 
Health, Safety and Environment Committee (‘HSE 
Committee’) during the year, to develop, implement and 
oversee a health and safety culture across the Group 
and to assist the Board and management in its drive 
towards achieving and maintaining industry-leading 
performance in these areas. The HSE Committee will 
assist the management to identify all key issues and 
implement appropriate corrective action to achieve 
compliance and raise performance where required.
The HSE Committee comprises a Board member, Mike 
Grasby, as Chairman, together with Mr T Chandrmoulee, 
(COO) and senior executives and safety and environment 
officers from all units. The HSE Committee met twice 
during the year under review and undertook the  
following initiatives:
Safety 
 > Introduction of incident/accident reporting formats; 
 > Carried out a base line audit with the assistance of an 
independent consultant; 
 > Evaluated existing safety practices and recommended 
corrective action plans and procedures in accordance 
with international standards; 
 > Communicated to all contractors, especially the civil 
contractors working on the projects under 
development, the standards to be followed for worker 
safety; and
 > Standardised a contractor safety compliance 
checklist to be included as part of every subsequent 
work and supplier contract. 
Health 
 > Started an on-site dispensary with a general 
practitioner available for two to three hours daily and 
in emergencies as necessary; 
 > Ambulance made available in plant 24/7; and
 > Introduced mandatory periodic health checks for all 
employees in areas exposed to dust and coal.
We achieved a key milestone in this area by being 
awarded the OHSAS 18001 certificate in May 2013 for 
the OPG Chennai site having successfully completed the 
process initiated in the year under review. OHSAS 18001 
is a standard used for an occupational health and safety 
management system, which enables an organisation to 
control its risks and improve its performance in this area. 
The standard provides a systematic approach to 
identifying hazards and then either eliminates or reduces 
the risks of the hazards.
The Committee discussed and intends in the following 
year to adopt a global reporting format, to enable the 
Group to benchmark its safety standards, accidents and 
near misses. As part of this process, a comprehensive 
health and safety policy will be adopted and 
communicated to all employees, suppliers, contractors 
and visitors to OPG plants. 
Environment
The Group’s operations strive to achieve continuous 
improvements in environmental performance and seek 
to prevent, mitigate, reduce or offset the environmental 
impact of our activities. The Board continues to monitor 
the level of environmental performance to minimise 
any deviations. 
In May 2013, the OPG Chennai site successfully obtained 
the ISO 14001 certification, completing the process initiated 
in the previous year. ISO 14001 specifies requirements for 
an environmental management system to enable an 
organisation to develop and implement policies and 
objectives with respect to the environment. Post 
implementation of comprehensive environment 
management systems, the Company is continuing to 
develop further processes and systems to obtain the Indian 
Green Building Certification (‘IGBC’) for the Chennai site. 
Our plants are compliant with all applicable regulations and 
operate within the parameters specified under law.
Further, the Board understands that its approach to 
addressing the issue of global warming and reducing 
carbon emissions is important to the Group’s future  29

competitiveness. The Group has therefore registered 
under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and is awaiting the validation and 
verification of the Carbon Emissions Reduction 
registration for the Mayavaram gas plant and the 
Voluntary Emissions Reductions registration for the 
10 MW waste heat plant.
Green initiatives 
We have taken the lead by being the first power plant 
in Tamil Nadu to have a realtime display of all key 
environmental parameters at the plant boundary of the 
Chennai site and this will also be implemented at the 
Gujarat site when this plant commences operations. 
The Group has implemented a 100% ban of plastic and 
non-biodegradable substances in the power plant 
premises. At both premises, the Group has a fully 
covered coal shed to manage coal and dust dispersion 
in the surrounding areas. 
During the year, in keeping with the initiatives at the 
Chennai site, OPG planted 10,000 saplings within and 
outside the Gujarat site premises. Our dedicated staff 
continues to nurture and care for these trees on a 
continual basis. In keeping with our Green Belt 
Development Programme, further saplings will be 
planted within the premises in the coming year. 
Our people
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on keeping 
employees informed on matters affecting them and on 
the various factors affecting the performance of the 
Group. This is achieved through informal meetings 
and presentations on new developments both within 
the Company and the wider industry. The Group is 
committed to providing equal opportunities and opposes 
all forms of unfair or unlawful discrimination. Employees 
will not be discriminated against because of race, colour, 
nationality, ethnic origin, disability, sex or sexual 
orientation, marital status or age.
All employees are encouraged to raise genuine concerns 
about possible improprieties in the conduct of our 
business, whether in matters of financial reporting or 
other malpractices, at the earliest opportunity and in an 
appropriate way.
Disabled persons
Applications for employment by disabled persons are 
always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of 
the applicant concerned. In the event of members of 
staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure 
that their employment with the Group continues and that 
appropriate training is arranged. 30

Training and development
Employing the right people and encouraging the 
continuous development of the skills of our employees 
is critical to developing a successful business. During 
the last year, not only were our power generation plants 
managed by the Group, but day-to-day operational 
responsibility, which had in previous years been 
delegated to an external contractor, was taken over by 
an experienced in-house team assembled specifically 
for this purpose and trained in best practices. Thus, at 
the sites there has been a significant change from the 
practice adopted previously in that the full operation, 
maintenance and project execution is being undertaken 
by OPG employees, whereas earlier there were relatively 
few OPG employees on-site and the majority of staff 
were employed and supervised by an external 
contractor. This organisational shift is a key change in the 
development of the Group and is a strong indicator that 
the Group is maturing with regards to staff training and 
health and safety responsibility and implementation. 
Additionally the Group is recruiting graduate engineering 
trainees and providing them with a comprehensive six 
month on-site training programme. This will ensure that, 
as the Group grows, adequate well trained and 
competent personnel are available for in-house 
operations and project development. 
Supply chain
The Group works with a team of industry-leading 
suppliers and contractors in order to mitigate the risk in 
the event of there being a product delay or a supplier 
failing. The Board recognises the particular risks posed 
to its supply chain by the prevailing global economic 
conditions and the potential impact should key suppliers 
fail. To mitigate these impacts, the Group monitors 
suppliers’ business continuity issues.
The Company’s power generation plants are fuelled by 
coal sourced from India but also from imported coal from 
Indonesia. Availability of supplies is therefore less of an 
issue than prices, which can fluctuate in line with world 
market forces of supply and demand.
Community
The Group recognises the importance of engaging with 
the communities in which it operates. It encourages 
operating units to develop their own corporate social 
involvement plans in consultation with stakeholders in 
order to identify programmes with tangible and 
sustainable community benefits and to undertake 
programmes on a needs-based assessment.
OPG outreach
We are proud to report that OPG Outreach, launched in 
July 2011 near our Kutch site, has now completed two 
successful years and in the year under review has been 
expanded to the Chennai site as well. During this year, 
at the existing vocational training facilities in Kutch, 40 
women have completed the training programme and 
have started working and making products, which are 
being purchased by our collaborator, Welspun. The 
additional income from this has greatly augmented the 
monthly household income of these families. Going 
forward, we expect this programme to continue 
successfully for a number of years, empowering the local 
women and contribute greatly to the socioeconomic 
development of the surrounding community. 
During the last year, OPG Outreach in collaboration 
with Rotary Kilpauk, is participating in the ‘Happy Villages 
Initiative’, under which OPG has agreed to adopt and 
develop two to three villages in the immediate vicinity 
of the Chennai site, with the support and experience of 
Rotary Kilpauk. Rotary and OPG have jointly undertaken 
a total needs evaluation of the villages Peria Obulapuram, 
Chinna Obulapuram and SR Kandigai in Gummdipoondi 
Taluk. Under this collaboration OPG has, as a first 
step, agreed to sponsor, develop and maintain the 
following initiatives: 
(i) Free primary health care centres: 
In April 2013 the first centre was successfully opened 
at Sitha Raja Kandigai, and is currently staffed by a 
doctor and nurse for between five and six hours a day. 
The centre is serving the medical requirements of 
the residents of five nearby villages and provides 
consultation and treatment to approximately 50 people 
everyday. The entire centre, with all the requisite 
medical facilities and equipment, was built by the OPG 
Outreach team. 
A second healthcare centre is under construction at the 
Periya Obulapuram village and we fully expect it to be 
operational in the coming year. A free ambulance service 
catering to these two centres should also be operational 
in the coming year. OPG is confident that both these 
centres and their associated facilities will provide much 
needed basic care and medical aid to the communities 
around the OPG power plant. 
Other than the centres, regular specialised medical 
camps were also organised for diabetes, 
ophthalmological treatment etc.  31

(ii) Helping hands 
OPG Outreach identified the requirements of 25 
physically disabled residents in the vicinity and as part of 
Rotary’s Helping Hands Initiative provided hearing aids, 
wheelchairs and tricycles. 
(iii) Improving basic infrastructure
As the community does not have the benefit of 100% 
rural electrification, 260 families in SR Kandigai were 
provided with solar lanterns. 
To rehabilitate a drinking water source (village pond) OPG 
worked with the District Collector’s office and provided 
substantial sponsorship and co-operation. In addition, as 
an ongoing effort to provide clean and safe drinking 
water, OPG is in the process of installing Reverse 
Osmosis plants by connecting them to local water tanks 
and main drinking water sources. 
In continuation with this public infrastructure 
development, OPG plans in the following year to assist in 
construction of individual toilets to ensure adequate 
sanitation facilities are available for all members of the 
local community. 
The OPG Gujarat team with the local panychayat has 
constructed a short road connecting a nearby 
neighbourhood with a temple, which is a gathering point 
for this community. The road runs parallel to the OPG site 
and ensures that everyone has safe access at all times to 
the temple. 
(iv) Educational aid
OPG, following its belief that education is the way forward, 
has continued to provide educational assistance to 
children in our local communities. As a yearly concern, 
925 school children belonging to the villages Periya 
Obulapuram, Chinna Obulapuram, Kayalarmedu, SR 
Kandigai received full school supplies (uniforms, books, 
etc) for the entire year before the commencement of the 
school year. 35 children from families living below the 
poverty line are also granted annual school fees to ensure 
that lack of funds does not preclude their advancement. 
As part of OPG Outreach, a strong awareness 
programme has been developed to promote education 
for girls. To support this, from this year forward, the 
Group has started a sponsorship programme in higher 
secondary education at a reputed private school. Under 
this scheme, three girls will be selected every year based 
on academic background and economic needs.

Introduction
The Board is committed to good corporate 
governance practices. The Company was 
admitted to trading on AIM in May 2008. 
Accordingly, compliance with the governance 
framework contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published by the Financial 
Reporting Council (‘the Code’) is not 
mandatory. Nevertheless, the Company 
remains committed to high standards of 
corporate governance and endeavours to 
comply with the Code to the extent practicable 
for a public company of its size.
This report describes how the Company has 
applied, or how it intends to apply, the 
principles set out in the Code. 
Compliance with the Code
Since admission to AIM, the Group has grown substantially against 
a background of difficult trading conditions within the electricity 
generation sector. With its flexible business model, increased cash 
generation and pipeline of projects, the Board considers the Group 
to be well placed to deliver further growth for its shareholders. 
Against this background, the Board continues to evaluate the 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge to 
enable it to discharge its responsibilities effectively. The Board has 
taken a number of steps to comply with the Code with a view to 
achieving full compliance in all material respects. The Board notes 
the following areas of non-compliance with the Code with 
comments on each as appropriate:
1. Schedule of Matters Reserved (A.1.1)
The Board will in due course adopt a schedule of matters specifically 
reserved to it for decision. At present, the Board reviews and adopts 
the Group’s strategy, plan and key risks, policies and procedures. 
During the current year, an Executive Committee (‘ExCo’) of 
management was established to support the Board in implementing 
strategy and to report relevant matters to the Board for its 
consideration and approval. The ExCo met nine times during the last 
year and anticipates meeting monthly going forward.
2. Division of Responsibilities (A.2.1)
As explained in greater detail below, there is a clear separation 
between the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer. The Code further requires that this be set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board and this is to be done in due 
course. 
3. Non-executive Directors (A.4.2)
The Code requires the Non-executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, to meet without the Chairman to appraise 
the Chairman’s performance. The Board will consider the issue of 
evaluation, including evaluating the performance of the Chairman,  
in due course. 
4. Nominations Committee (B.2.1) 
The Board will at an appropriate time establish a Nominations 
Committee. It will meet as and when required, its primary function 
being to provide a formal and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board and to advise generally 
on issues relating to Board composition and balance. In 
appropriate cases, recruitment consultants may be used to assist 
in the process. As and when a Nominations Committee is 
appointed, compliance with those provisions of the Code relating 
to this committee will be considered further. 
5. Evaluation (B.6) 
As noted above, the Group continues to grow. The Board will, 
therefore, continue to evaluate the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge required to ensure that its 
composition is appropriate to the Group’s size and complexity. At 
the appropriate time, the Board will give further consideration to 
the issue of evaluating its performance and that of its principal 
committees and the individual Directors.

procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations 
are complied with. 
Directors have the right to request that any concerns they have are 
recorded in the appropriate committee or Board minutes. Informal 
procedures are in place for Directors to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense although these are 
not currently set down in writing.
The Company maintains Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
and indemnity cover, the level of which is reviewed annually.
Re-election of Directors

available to the other Non-executive Directors to discuss any 
issues of concern they may have relating to the Group or as 
regards their area of responsibility and to keep them fully briefed 
on ongoing matters relating to the Group’s operations.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that new Directors each 
receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board as 
required by provision B.4.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 36

Accountability and audit
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control which includes risk management. The Board has 
delegated the responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of 
its internal control systems to the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee will review these systems, policies and processes for 
tendering, authorisation of expenditure, fraud and the internal audit 
plan, on an annual basis.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The Board has instructed its newly-formed ExCo to be a leading 
part of its process to identify, evaluate and manage the significant 
risks the Group faces and which is in accordance with the current 
guidance on internal control. The Audit Committee will assist the 
Board in discharging its review responsibilities. A summary of the 
key risks facing the Group and mitigating actions is described on 
pages 20 to 21.
Assurance
Grant Thornton has been auditor for the Group for the last three 
years. The Audit Committee reviewed the auditor’s independence 
and effectiveness and concluded that Grant Thornton remained 
independent within the meaning of regulatory and professional 
requirements and that its independence had not been impaired. 
The Committee considers that, at this stage in the Group’s 
development, it is often efficient to use a single audit firm to provide 
certain non-audit services for transactions and tax matters. 
However, to regulate the position, the Committee will establish a 
policy on the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditor. That policy will set out the external auditor’s permitted and 
prohibited non-audit services.
Going concern 
A statement on the Directors’ position regarding the Company as 
going concern is contained on page 42.
Shareholder relations and the Annual General Meeting
The Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director and Finance 
Director met with a number of key investors during the year.
The Chairman is primarily responsible for ensuring the effective 
communication of shareholders’ views to the Board as a whole. 
Board members keep abreast of shareholder opinion and discuss 
strategy and governance issues with them as appropriate. 
The Annual General Meeting of the Company provides an 
opportunity to communicate with shareholders and the Board 
welcomes their participation. Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
meeting. The voting results will be made available on the

Directors’ remuneration report
Introduction
This report sets out information about the remuneration of the 
Directors of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2013. 
This report has been substantially prepared in accordance 
with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the 
‘Regulations’) in line with the relevant requirements of the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules. 
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are M C Gupta 
(Chairman), Martin Gatto, Ravi Gupta and Michael Grasby who, 
with the exception of Ravi Gupta, are all Independent Non-
executive Directors. 
Terms of reference have been approved for the Remuneration 
Committee and its primary duty is to determine and agree with the 
Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors, senior managers and such other members 
of the executive management team of the Group as is deemed 
appropriate. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is a 
matter for the Chairman and the executive members of the Board. 
The principal responsibilities of the Committee include:
 > Assessing and setting compensation levels for Directors and 
senior managers;
 > Reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the 
remuneration policy to ensure that members of the executive 
team are provided with incentives that encourage enhanced 
performance;
 > Reviewing the design of share incentive plans for the approval 
of the Board and shareholders;
 > Ensuring that contractual terms on termination are such that 
failure is not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate losses is 
fully recognised in the drafting of Directors’ service agreements 
and letters of appointment. 
In fulfilling these duties, the Committee shall be cognisant of 
remuneration trends across the Group and within the sector in 
which the Group operates.
The Chief Executive Officer and external advisers may be invited to 
attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee but do not take 
part in the decision making. 
Attendance at meetings of the Remuneration Committee by 
individual members is detailed in the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 36.
Advisors
During the year, the Remuneration Committee commissioned 
external advice in connection with the current incentive plans and 
the Group’s overall approach to rewards and incentives. The Board 
expects to receive this advice shortly.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee seeks to maintain remuneration 
policy to attract, retain and motivate its Executive Directors and 
management. 
The retention of key management and the alignment of 
management incentives with the creation of shareholder value are 
key objectives of this policy. 
The Group therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration 
to all its management and employees, appropriate to the business 
environment in the market in which it operates and in recognition 
of their contribution to Group performance. To achieve this, the 
remuneration package is based upon the following principles:
 > total rewards should be set to provide a fair and attractive 
remuneration package; 
 > appropriate elements of the remuneration package should be 
designed to reinforce the link between performance and 
contribution to the Group’s success and reward; and
 > Executive Directors’ incentives should be aligned with the 
interests of shareholders. 
The remuneration strategy is designed to be in line with the 
Group’s fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and 
equity and also to support the Group’s corporate strategy.
Long-term incentives
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is appropriate to 
operate share schemes to encourage Executive Directors and 
senior employees to meet the Group’s long-term objectives set 
by the Board. 
Stock option plan
Under the stock option plan approved by the Board on 16 July 
2009, options granted must be exercised within 10 years of the 
date of grant. Vesting conditions are:
1.  The power plant at Kutch in the state of Gujarat must have 
been in commercial operation for three months; and
2.  The closing share price must be at least £1 for three 
consecutive business days. 39

Service agreements, notice periods and termination payments
The Service Agreements for the Executive Directors are for no fixed term and may in normal circumstances be terminated on the notice 
periods set out in the table below. The Company reserves the right and discretion to pay the Executive Directors in lieu of notice. If the 
Company terminates the employment of an Executive Director by exercising its right to pay in lieu of notice, the Company is required to 
make a payment equal to the aggregate of basic salary and the cost to the Company of providing other contractual benefits for the 
unexpired portion of the duration of any entitlement to notice.
The key terms of the executive Directors’ service agreements are as follows:
Name Position Date of contract Notice period Current salary p.a. £

Chairman and Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. 
The Chairman does not currently participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor does any pension entitlement 
accrue. Neither the Chairman nor any Non-executive Director has a contract of employment with the Company. Each has instead entered 
into a contract for services with the Company.
Non-executive Directors’ contracts for services 
Non-executive Directors were appointed for an initial term of 12 months. M C Gupta, Martin Gatto, Michael Grasby and Ravi Gupta have 
each signed a contract for services with the Company. They were each appointed for an initial period of 12 months and, under the terms 
of their contracts for services, their appointments were renewable for a further period by mutual agreement, subject to re-election, when 
appropriate, by the Company in general meeting. A formal process for evaluating the performance of the Board, its committees and the 
individual Directors will be introduced in due course.
During the year, the Non-executive Directors’ fees were reviewed by the executive members of the Board and have been set at a level to 
reflect the time commitment and level of involvement that they are required to make in the activities of the Board and its committees. 
The key terms of the Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are as follows:

consent of the Board. Any such directorships must be formally notified to the Board.  40

into binding purchase contracts. The Group seeks to abide by the

but it does not have a Group-wide standard or code of practice

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group and the Parent 
Company financial statements. The Directors are required to 
prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted 
for use in the European Union and have also elected to prepare 
financial statements for the Company in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted for use in the European Union. Company law requires the 
Directors to prepare such financial statements in accordance with 
IFRS and the Companies Act 2006.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s 
and Company’s financial position, financial performance and 
cash flows. This requires the fair presentation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair 
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
International Financial Reporting Standards. Directors are also 
required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
 > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 > state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with specific 
requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and of the Company, for 
safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Group website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 45

Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the Members of OPG Power Ventures Plc
We have audited the accompanying group financial statements of 
OPG Power Ventures Plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which 
comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statements of 
Cash Flow and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (as 
adopted by the European Union).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Section 80C(2) of the Isle of Man Companies 
Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
non-financial information in the business review and corporate 
governance statements to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) (as adopted by the European Union) of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2013 and of their profit and loss for 
the year then ended.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies
3.1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss and available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Group will have sufficient funds to continue its 
operational existence for the foreseeable future covering at least 12 months. As the Group has forecast it will be able to meet its debt 
facility interest and repayment obligations, and that sufficient funds will be available to continue with the projects development, the 
assumption that these financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis is appropriate.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (Revised 2007) and 
have been presented in Great Britain Pound (£), which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company.
3.2. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial information of OPG Power Ventures Plc and its subsidiaries for the year 
ended 31 March 2013.
A subsidiary is defined as an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of 
acquisition, being the date on which control is acquired by the Group, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control 
ceases. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 March and use consistent accounting policies adopted by the Group.
All intra-Group balances, income and expenses and any resulting unrealised gains arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in 
full on consolidation. 
Non-controlling interest represents the portion of profit or loss and net assets that is not held by the Group and is presented separately in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately 
from parent shareholders’ equity. Acquisitions of additional stake or dilution of stake from/to minority interests/other venturer in the Group 
where there is no loss of control are accounted for as an equity transaction, whereby, the difference between the consideration paid or 
received and the book value of the share of the net assets is recognised in ‘other reserve’ within statement of changes in equity.

Details of the Group’s subsidiaries which are consolidated into the Group’s consolidated financial statement are as follows:

arrangement the assets and liabilities of GEPL and GHPL have been taken over by GPIPL and shares in GPIPL have been allotted to the shareholders of GEPL and GHPL on 
25 January 2013. The liquidation process of GEPL and GHPL is yet to commence as at 31 March 2013 (also refer note 23).

3.4. Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of the Company is the Great Britain Pound Sterling (£). The Cypriot entities are an extension of the parent and 
pass through investment entities. Accordingly the functional currency of the subsidiaries in Cyprus is the Great Britain Pound Sterling. The 
functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries operating in India, determined based on evaluation of the individual and collective 
economic factors is Indian Rupees (INR). The presentation currency of the Group is the Great Britain Pound (£) as submitted to the AIM 
counter of the London Stock Exchange where the shares of the Company are listed.
At the reporting date the assets and liabilities of the Group are translated into the presentation currency which is Great Britain Pound 
Sterling (£) at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date and the statement of comprehensive income is 
translated at the average exchange rate for the year. Exchange differences are charged/credited to other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date are translated into functional currency at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Aggregate gains and losses resulting from foreign currencies are included in finance income or costs 
within the profit or loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
stated at fair value are translated to functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The Great Britain Pound (£):Indian Rupee (INR) exchange rates used to translate the INR financial information into the presentation 
currency of Great Britain Pound (£) were as follows:

3.5. Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group, 
and revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in accordance 
with the relevant agreements, net of discounts, rebates and other applicable taxes and duties.
Sale of electricity
Revenue comprises revenue from sale of electricity. Revenue from the sale of electricity is recognised when earned on the basis of 
contractual arrangement with the customers and reflects the value of units supplied including an estimated value of units supplied to the 
customers between the date of their last meter reading and the reporting date.
Interest and dividend
Revenue from interest is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest rate method). Revenue from dividends is recognised 
when the right to receive the payment is established.
3.6. Taxes
Tax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity. 
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, taxation authorities relating to the current or 
prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is payable on taxable profit, which differs from profit or loss in 
the financial statements. 
Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the  
reporting period.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the 
Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.  54

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of 
realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are always 
provided for in full. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be utilised against future taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group has a right and the intention to set off current tax assets and liabilities 
from the same taxation authority. Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax income or expense in 
profit or loss, except where they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the 
related deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, respectively. 
3.7. Financial assets
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial 
instrument and are measured initially at fair value adjusted by transactions costs, except for those carried at fair value through profit or 
loss which are measured initially at fair value. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial 
asset and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, 
cancelled or expires.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories upon initial recognition: 
•	 loans and receivables; and
•	 available-for-sale financial assets. 
The category determines subsequent measurement and whether any resulting income and expense is recognised in profit or loss or in 
other comprehensive income. 
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. 
Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group’s cash and cash equivalents, trade and most other 
receivables fall into this category of financial instruments. 
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received 
that a specific counterparty will default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually impaired are reviewed for impairment in 
groups, which are determined by reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other shared credit risk characteristics. The 
impairment loss estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified group. 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for 
inclusion in any of the other categories of financial assets. The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets include mutual funds and equity 
instruments. Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and reported within the available-for-sale reserve within equity, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange differences on 
monetary assets, which are recognised in profit or loss. When the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired the cumulative 
gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from the equity reserve to profit or loss and presented as a 
reclassification adjustment within other comprehensive income. 
Reversals of impairment losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for financial assets that are debt securities which 
are recognised in profit or loss only if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
3.8. Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables. Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method and are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit  
or loss. 
All interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument’s fair value that are reported in profit or loss are included within 
‘finance costs’ or ‘finance income’.

3.9. Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted 
market bid prices at the close of business on the statement of financial position date. For financial instruments where there is no 
active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market 
transactions; reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis 
or other valuation models.
3.10. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or impairment losses, if any. The cost includes 
expenditures that are directly attributable to property, plant and equipment such as employee cost, borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects etc, if recognition criteria are met. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its costs are recognised in the 
carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repairs and maintenance 
costs are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is computed on straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset based on 
management’s estimate as follows:
Nature of asset
Useful life 
(years)
Buildings 40
Power stations 40
Other plant and equipment 3–10
Vehicles 5–11
Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost and not depreciated until commissioned.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use 
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively 
if appropriate.
3.11. Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date 
whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use  
the asset.
Group as a lessee
Contracts to lease assets are classified as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset 
to the Group. Leases where the Group does not acquire substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease of land is 
classified separately and is amortised over the period of the lease.
3.12. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets. Interest income earned on the temporary 
investment of specific borrowing pending its expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the costs of these assets. 
Gains and losses on extinguishment of liability, including those arising from substantial modification from terms of loans, are not treated 
as borrowing costs and are charged to profit or loss. 
All other borrowing costs, including transaction costs, are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred, the 
amount being determined using the effective interest rate method. 56

3.13. Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (‘CGU’) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In 
determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation 
multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or 
cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so 
that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the 
profit or loss.
3.14. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, net of 
restricted cash and outstanding bank overdrafts.
3.15. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition is accounted based on weighted average price.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling expenses.
3.16. Earnings per share
The earnings considered in ascertaining the Group’s earnings per share (‘EPS’) comprise the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
equity holders of the parent. The number of shares used for computing the basic EPS is the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year. 
3.17. Other provisions and contingent liabilities 
Provisions are recognised when present obligations as a result of a past event will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources 
from the Group and amounts can be estimated reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. A present obligation arises 
from the presence of a legal or constructive commitment that has resulted from past events. Restructuring provisions are recognised only 
if a detailed formal plan for the restructuring has been developed and implemented, or management has at least announced the plan’s 
main features to those affected by it. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence 
available at the reporting date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Where there are a number of 
similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a 
whole. Provisions are discounted to their present values, where the time value of money is material. 
Any reimbursement that the Group can be virtually certain to collect from a third party with respect to the obligation is recognised as a 
separate asset. However, this asset may not exceed the amount of the related provision. All provisions are reviewed at each reporting 
date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. 
In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, 
no liability is recognised, unless it was assumed in the course of a business combination. In a business combination, contingent liabilities 
are recognised on the acquisition date when there is a present obligation that arises from past events and the fair value can be measured 
reliably, even if the outflow of economic resources is not probable. They are subsequently measured at the higher amount of a 
comparable provision as described above and the amount recognised on the acquisition date, less any amortisation.

3.18. Share-based payments
The Group operates equity-settled share-based remuneration plans for its employees. None of the Group’s plans feature any options for 
a cash settlement. 
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where 
employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to 
the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market 
vesting conditions (for example profitability and sales growth targets and performance conditions). 
All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit or loss with a corresponding credit to ‘other reserves’.
If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate 
of the number of share options expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share 
options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Impact of market condition are included in the computation of the fair value at 
the grant date. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense 
recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting. 
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs up to the nominal value of the 
shares issued are allocated to share capital with any excess being recorded as share premium. 
3.19. Employee benefits 
Gratuity 
In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering 
eligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or 
termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment.
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each statement 
of financial position date using the projected unit credit method.
The Group recognises the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its statement of financial position as an asset or liability, respectively 
in accordance with IAS 19, Employee benefits. The discount rate is based on the Government securities yield. Actuarial gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to profit or loss in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 
Employees Benefit Trust
Effective during the year, the Group has established an Employees Benefit Trust (hereinafter ‘the EBT’) for investments in the Company’s 
shares for employee benefit schemes. IOMA Fiduciary in the Isle of Man have been appointed as Trustees of the EBT with full discretion 
invested in the Trustee, independent of the Company, in the matter of share purchases. As at present, no investments have been made 
by the Trustee nor any funds advanced by the Company to the EBT. The Company is yet to formulate any employee benefit schemes or 
to make awards thereunder.
3.20. Business combinations
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder that controls the Group 
are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or, if later, at the date 
that common control was established using pooling of interest method. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying 
amounts recognised previously in the Group controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components of equity of the 
acquired entities are added to the same components within Group equity. Any excess consideration paid is directly recognised in equity. 58

4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the consolidated financial statements are as set out above. The application of a 
number of these policies requires the Group to use a variety of estimation techniques and apply judgement to best reflect the substance 
of underlying transactions.
The Group has determined that a number of its accounting policies can be considered significant, in terms of the management 
judgement that has been required to determine the various assumptions underpinning their application in the consolidated financial 
statements presented which, under different conditions, could lead to material differences in these statements. The actual results may 
differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by the management and will seldom equal the estimated results.
The following are significant management judgements in applying the accounting policies of the Group that have the most significant 
effect on the financial statements. 
– Deferred tax assets: 
The assessment of the probability of future taxable income in which deferred tax assets can be utilised is based on the Group’s latest 
approved budget forecast, which is adjusted for significant non-taxable income and expenses and specific limits to the use of any unused 
tax loss or credit. The tax rules in India in which the Group operates are also carefully taken into consideration. If a positive forecast of 
taxable income indicates the probable use of a deferred tax asset, especially when it can be utilised without a time limit, that deferred tax 
asset is usually recognised in full. The recognition of deferred tax assets that are subject to certain legal or economic limits or 
uncertainties is assessed individually by management based on the specific facts and circumstances. 
– Recognition of interest income:
The Group has a contractual right to receive interest on overdue receivables from TANGEDCO. Notwithstanding this right, the Group has 
not recognised any interest, on a prudent basis, for the current year. Further, the management has also reversed past interest receivables 
amounting to during the year.
Estimates and uncertainties
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial position date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below:
•	 Recoverability of deferred tax assets: The recognition of deferred tax assets requires assessment of future taxable profit (see  
note 3.6).
•	 Estimation of fair value of acquired financial assets and financial liabilities: While preparing the financial statements the Group makes 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of financial assets and financial liabilities. 
 – Available-for-sale financial assets: Management apply valuation techniques to determine the fair value of available-for-sale financial 
assets where active market quotes are not available. This requires management to develop estimates and assumptions based on 
market inputs, using observable data that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Where such data is not observable, 
management uses its best estimate. Estimated fair values of the asset may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in an 
arm’s length transaction at the reporting date;
 – Other financial liabilities: Borrowings held by the Group are measured at amortised cost except where designated at fair value through 
profit or loss. Further, liabilities associated with financial guarantee contracts in the Company financial statements are initially measured 
at fair value and remeasured at each statement of financial position date (see note 3.9 and note 28); and
 – Impairment tests: In assessing impairment, management estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or cash-generating units 
based on expected future cash flows and use an interest rate to discount them. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about 
future operating results and the determination of a suitable discount rate;
•	 Useful life of depreciable assets: Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date, 
based on the expected utility of the assets.
5. Segment information
The Group has adopted the ‘management approach’ in identifying the operating segments as outlined in IFRS 8 – Operating segments. 
Segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief 
operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segment, has been 
identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions. Management has analysed the information that the chief operating 
decision maker reviews and concluded on the segment disclosure. In identifying its operating segments, management generally follows 
the Group’s service lines, which represent the generation of the power and other related services provided by the Group. The activities 
undertaken by the power generation segment includes sale of power and other related services. The accounting policies used by the 
Group for segment reporting are the same as those used for consolidated financial statements.

The Company is subject to Isle of Man corporate tax at the standard rate of zero percent. As such, the Company’s tax liability is zero. 
Additionally, Isle of Man does not levy tax on capital gains. However, considering that the Group’s operations are entirely based in India, 
the effective tax rate of the Group has been computed based on the current tax rates prevailing in India. Further, a substantial portion of 
the profits of the Group’s India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits attributable to generation of power in India. 
Under the tax holiday the taxpayer can utilise an exemption from income taxes for a period of any 10 consecutive years out of a total of 
15 consecutive years from the date of commencement of the operations.
The Group is subject to the provisions of Minimum Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) under the Indian income taxes for the year ended 31 March 2013 
and 2012. Accordingly, the Group calculated the tax liability for current taxes in India after considering MAT. 
The Group has carried forward credit in respect of MAT tax liability paid to the extent it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which such tax credit can be utilised.

In assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all 
of the deferred income tax assets will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the 
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The amount of the 
deferred income tax assets considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income 
during the carry forward period are reduced.
Shareholders resident outside the Isle of Man will not suffer any income tax in the Isle of Man on any income distributions to them. 
Further, dividends are not taxable in India in the hands of the recipient. However, the Group will be subject to a ‘dividend distribution tax’ 
currently at the rate of 15% (plus applicable surcharge and education cess) on the total amount distributed as dividend.
As at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012, there was no recognised deferred tax liability for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted 
earnings of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries, the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be 
distributed in the foreseeable future. 62

Available-for-sale investment – quoted short-term mutual fund units 
The Group has investments in mutual fund units. The fair value of the mutual fund instruments are determined by reference to published 
data. These mutual fund investments are redeemable on demand. 
The investments in OPGE and OPGRE have been fair valued and the share of the Group has been determined and disclosed as available-
for-sale classified as non-current. 
Effective 1 December 2011, the Group has given up control and significant influence over OPGE and OPGRE, pursuant to non-renewal of 
voting rights agreement entered by GEPL, GHPL and OPGPG (hereinafter referred as Shareholders) with Tamil Nadu Property Developers 
Limited (‘TNPDL ’). There was no consideration that was received and the Group’s interests in the said companies are being accounted 
as investments. 
Accordingly, the Group had derecognised the carrying value of assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest of the former subsidiaries 
and recognised the fair value of the retained investments at the date when control was lost. Further, the Group also reclassified to profit 
and loss, such amounts pertaining to these erstwhile subsidiaries that were earlier recognised through other comprehensive income and 
has accounted for the resulting difference as loss attributable to the Group.
As at the date of consolidation, the Company has fair valued the investments grouped under available-for-sale investments. There is no 
change in the valuation technique to those adopted in the previous year. The fair value of OPGE is performed using discounted cash flow 
approach. Significant inputs into the model are based on management’s assumption of the expected cash flows up to 31 March 2024 
and a discount rate of 17%.
The carrying amount of investments, its fair value and the resultant impact on the statement of comprehensive income is as follows: 
Particulars OPGE OPGRE Total
Investment value – Available-for-sale as on 31 March 2012 (fair value of retained  
non-controlling investments. Also refer note 24) 1,381,762 – 1,381,762

Advances to suppliers include the amounts paid as advance for supply of fuel. Other advance of the Group primarily includes additional 
import duty on imported coal paid under protest amounting to £Nil (2012: £754,442). Capital advances comprise of payment made to 
EPC contractors for construction of assets and advances paid for purchase of capital equipment. The management expects to realise 
these in the next one year. 64

Total 34,814,660 17,405,365
Since received from TANGEDCO is £25.79m for the sales made up to February 2013.
Trade receivables are generally due within 14 days terms and are therefore short-term and the carrying values are considered a 
reasonable approximation of fair value. The entire sum of £34,814,660 (2012: £17,405,365) has been pledged as security for borrowings 
(refer note 18). As at 31 March 2013, trade receivables of £978,893 (2012: £60,314) were collectively impaired and provided for. In 
determining the timing and amount of interest income receivable from TANGEDCO for past dues, the Group has considered its 
contractual rights and recent favourable regulatory commission orders passed for similar customers. Trade receivables that are neither 
past due nor impaired represents billings for the month of March.
The age analysis of the overdue trade receivables is as follows:

The creation of provision for impaired receivables has been included in ‘other expenses’ in the profit and loss. Amounts charged to the 
allowance account are generally written off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group does not hold any collateral 
as security.

The Company has issued share capital at par value of £51,671 (£0.000147 per share).
Reserves
Share premium represents the amount received by the Group over and above the par value of shares issued and the excess of the fair 
value of shares issued in business combination over the par value of such shares. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of 
shares are deducted from securities premium, net of any related income tax benefits. 
Translation reserve is used to record the exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries.
Other reserves represents the difference between the consideration paid and the adjustment to net assets on change of controlling 
interest, without change in control, Other reserves also includes any costs related with share options granted and gain/losses on 
remeasurement of available-for-sale financial assets.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income less dividend distribution. 
17. Share-based payments
The Board has granted share options to Directors and nominees of Directors which are limited to 10% of the Group’s share capital. Once 
granted, the share must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant otherwise the options would lapse.
The vesting conditions are as follows:
•	 The 300 MW power plant of Kutch in the state of Gujarat must have been in commercial operation for three months.
•	 The closing share price being at least £1.00 for three consecutive business days.
 
The related expense has been amortised over the estimated vesting period of 4.96 years (expected completion of the Kutch plant) and an 
expense amounting to £974,222 (2012: £1,454,247) was recognised in the profit or loss with a corresponding credit to other reserves.

Assumptions on valuation of options
The weighted average price fair value of options granted in 2010–11, determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, was £0.28 per 
option. The significant inputs into the model were weighted average share price of £0.66 (2011) at the grant date, exercise price of £0.60 
(2011: £0.60), volatility of 31.34% (2012: 31.34%), dividend yield of nil (2012: nil), an expected option life of 4.96 years (2012: 4.21 years) 
and annual risk free rate of 3%. The volatility measured at the standard deviation of continuously compounded share returns is based on 
daily share prices of the last three years. 66

receivables or payables. For the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group has not recorded any impairment of receivables relating to 
amounts owed by related parties (2012: £nil). This assessment is undertaken each financial year through examining the financial position 
of the related party and the market in which the related party operates.
21. Earnings per share  
Both the basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated using the profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company as 
the numerator (no adjustments to profit were necessary in 2012 or 2013).
The weighted average number of shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share can be reconciled to the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share (for the Group and the Company) as follows:
Particulars 2013 2012
Weighted average number of shares used in basic earnings per share 351,504,795 351,504,795

Weighted average number of shares used in diluted earnings per share 351,504,795 352,143,134
1 The potential equity shares are anti-dilutive in nature and hence have not been considered for diluted EPS computation.

23. Business combination within the Group without loss of control
Hitherto the structure of the Group was that two Cypriot subsidiaries of OPGPV, namely GEPL and GHPL, held the investments in the 
equity of the Group’s Special Purpose Vehicles (‘SPV’) in India. The management decided to interpose an Indian Holding Company, 
GPIPL, in the structure and warehouse the SPV investments in GPIPL. Accordingly, the shareholders of GEPL, GHPL and GPIPL had 
entered into a scheme of arrangement to effect the above restructuring of the Group. As part of the regulatory requirements in India, the 
Group had applied and obtained approval from the High court of Madras on 28 October 2011 subject to fulfilment of certain conditions 
including approval of relevant regulatory authorities, allotment of shares etc. The scheme had been consummated with effect from 25 
January 2013 upon issue of shares to the shareholders of GEPL and GHPL, namely CHL and the assets and liabilities of GEPL and GHPL 
have been taken over by GPIPL. Consequent to the scheme of arrangement, the Group has also gained 100% economic interest over 
GPIPL by virtue of an agreement entered into with the minority shareholders of GPIPL dated 1 April 2012. The liquidation process of 
GEPL and GHPL is yet to commence as at year end. Further, CHL has to update relevant secretarial records in their jurisdiction to reflect 
the above arrangement. The management has initiated the necessary process to achieve the above and expect the same to be complete 
by the end of 2013.
The above arrangement has been considered as a business combination involving companies under the Group and is accounted at the 
date that common control was established using pooling of interest method. The assets and liabilities transferred are recognised at the 
carrying amounts recognised previously in the Group controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components of 
equity of the acquired entities are added to the same components within Group equity. There was no excess consideration paid in 
this transaction.
24. Deconsolidation on loss of control of subsidiaries
In the previous year, pursuant to the voting rights agreement entered by GEPL with Tamil Nadu Property Developers Limited (‘TNPDL ’) 
and Salem Food Products Limited (‘SFPL ’) and OPGPG with Sonal Vyapar Limited (‘SVL ’) and TNPD (hereinafter TNPDL, SFPL and SVL 
are collectively referred as ‘Investors’) dated 12 May 2008 and 26 April 2008 respectively, the investors agreed that in consideration of 
GEPL agreeing to subscribe for shares in OPGRE and OPGPG agreeing to subscribe for shares in OPGE, the investors will exercise all 
voting rights in accordance with the directions of GEPL and OPGPG. The total voting rights held by the investors in OPGRE and OPGE 
amounted respectively to 45% and 21.59%. Further, the Investors had also appointed GEPL and OPGPG as the lawful attorneys to 
exercise their voting rights. Therefore the combination of the directly held interests together with the investors voting with the Group had 
the effect that the Group controlled a majority of voting rights in OPGRE and OPGE. Accordingly these companies were considered to be 
subsidiaries of the Group until the expiry of the agreement on 30 November 2011.
The management determined not to exercise control over the operations of OPGRE and OPGE beyond that date and has, pursuant to a 
voting rights agreement entered on 1 December 2011 by GEPL, GHPL and OPGPG (hereinafter referred as ‘Shareholders’) with TNPDL, 
the Shareholders have agreed to exercise their voting rights in accordance with the directions of TNPDL in the context of the expiry of the 
voting rights hitherto available from the investors. The Shareholders have thus extended voting support to TNPDL to provide for 
appropriate management of the Company. Also, the Group withdrew its nominees from the offices held in the respective companies 
effective 1 December 2011. There was no consideration that was received and these events resulted in loss of control and significant 
influence over OPGRE and OPGE and, effective 1 December 2011, the Group’s interests in the said companies are being accounted as 
investments classified as available-for-sale assets.  70

26. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, comprises of loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, and other current liabilities. The 
main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has loans and receivables, trade and 
other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operations. The Group also hold investments designated 
at available-for-sale categories. 
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Group’s senior management advises on financial risks 
and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below: 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair values of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. 
Market prices comprise three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity risk. Financial instruments 
affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, available-for-sale investments.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analyses:
(i) The sensitivity of the statement of comprehensive income is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest 
income for one year, based on the average rate of borrowings held during the year ended 31 March 2013, all other variables being held 
constant. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt 
obligations with average interest rates. 
At 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012, the Group had no interest rate derivatives.
The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each 
reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All other variables are held constant. If interest rates increase or decrease by 
100 basis points with all other variables being constant, the Group’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2013 would decrease or 
increase by £331,703 (2012: £243,249).
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rate. The Group’s presentation currency is the Great Britain Pound (£). A majority of our assets are located in India where the 
Indian Rupee is the functional currency for our subsidiaries. Currency exposures also exist in the nature of capital expenditure and 
services denominated in currencies other than the Indian Rupee.
Currency fluctuations may have a large impact on our Group financial results. We are subject to currency risks affecting the underlying 
cost base in the operating subsidiary companies and also the translation of unit cash costs, profit or loss and the statement of financial 
position (including non-Great Britain Pound denominated borrowings) in the consolidated financial statements, where the functional 
currency is not the Great Britain Pound. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency arises where a Group company holds monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a 
currency different to the functional currency of that entity:

Set out below is the impact of a 10% change in the US Dollar on profit arising as a result of the revaluation of the Group’s foreign currency

United States Dollar (USD) 54.36 (1,661,369) 50.88 (847,894)
The impact on total equity is the same as the impact on net earnings as disclosed above.
 
Credit risk analysis
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial 
loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade and other receivables) and from its financing 
activities, including short-term deposits with banks and financial institutions, and other financial assets.
The maximum exposure for credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets amounting to 
£105,751,939 (2012: £109,894,083). 
The Group has exposure to credit risk from accounts receivable balances on sale of electricity. The operating entities of the Group have 
entered into short-term agreements with transmission companies incorporated by the Indian state government (TANGEDCO) to sell the 
electricity generated. Therefore the Group is committed, in the short-term, to sell power to these customers and the potential risk of 
default is considered low. For other customers, the Group ensures concentration of credit does not significantly impair the financial assets 
since the customers to whom the exposure of credit is taken are well established and reputed industries engaged in their respective field 
of business. The creditworthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit in the normal course of the business is monitored 
regularly. The credit risk for liquid funds is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high-quality external 
credit ratings. 
The Group’s management believes that all the above financial assets, except as mentioned in notes 12 and 13, are not impaired for each 
of the reporting dates under review and are of good credit quality. 
Liquidity risk analysis
The Group’s main source of liquidity is its operating businesses. The treasury department uses regular forecasts of operational cash flow, 
investment and trading collateral requirements to ensure that sufficient liquid cash balances are available to service ongoing business 
requirements. The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial 
liabilities as well as cash outflows due in day-to-day business. Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and 
week-to-week basis, as well as on the basis of a rolling 90-day projection. Long-term liquidity needs for a 90-day and a 30-day lookout 
period are identified monthly. 
The Group maintains cash and marketable securities to meet its liquidity requirements for up to 60-day periods. Funding for long-term 
liquidity needs is additionally secured by an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to sell long-term financial assets. 
The following is an analysis of the Group contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities at 31 March 2013:
Current Non-current
Within 12 months 1–5 years Later than 5 years Total
Borrowings 17,849,474 128,713,272 14,630,134 161,192,880

Capital management
Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent and debt less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group’s capital management objectives include, among others:
•	 ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business; and maximise shareholder value;
•	 ensure Group’s ability to meet both its long-term and short-term capital needs as a going concern; and
•	 to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. 
The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. 
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ending 31 March 2013 and 2012.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, long-term debt and short-term committed facilities that are designed to 
ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for business requirements. There are no imposed capital requirements on Group or 
entities, whether statutory or otherwise.
The capital for the reporting periods under review is summarised as follows:
 2013 2012
Total equity 142,738,538 131,751,746
Less: cash and cash equivalents (22,906,776) (37,876,393)

Total equity 142,738,538 131,751,746
Add: borrowings (including buyer’s credit) 108,870,336 70,862,398
Overall financing 251,608,874 202,614,144 
Capital to overall financing ratio 0.48 0.46
The internal accruals by way of earnings during the year has resulted in an increase in capital to overall financing ratio.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values. 
1 Cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other borrowings like short-term loans, current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due 
to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
2 The fair value of loans from banks and other financial indebtedness, obligations under finance leases, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as well as other 
non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities.
3 Fair value of available-for-sale instruments held for trading purposes are derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Fair value of available-for-sale unquoted equity 
instruments are derived from valuation performed at the year end.

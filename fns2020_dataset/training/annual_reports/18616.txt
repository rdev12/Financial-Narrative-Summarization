With over 12,000 homes, Grainger is the largest quoted residential property owner 
in the UK. While acquiring, managing and selling these properties is the mainstay of
our business, we’re increasingly active in other areas such as equity release, residential
development, fund and asset management. We are also expanding into residential
development and investment in Continental Europe.

market tenancies
These assets are let at market rates on
standard assured shorthold tenancy
agreements. Not only do they produce 
a market rent but they also offer an
element of reversionary potential through
their discount to vacant possession
value. We now operate these assets
through our recently launched Fund,
G:res 1, and our objectives are to raise
further equity in this Fund and grow 
the assets under management. As well
as sharing in the performance of our 
co-investment stake, we receive fees,
enhancing our overall return. 
equity release
The assets in this business produce no
rental income year-on-year, but a high
margin on eventual sale. It therefore 
has similar return characteristics to the
regulated portfolio despite its relative
immaturity. We aim to build this activity
both in size and scope; achieving a
portfolio that will produce a large future
stream of cash ﬂow but also widening
the types of retirement solution product
that we can offer.
regulated tenancies
This mature business is low yielding 
but produces high reversionary returns.
A key aspect of this portfolio is that 
it is extremely cash generative. With
approximately 9% of the total properties
falling vacant every year, it produces in
excess of £100m cash per annum which
is available for recycling either into other
regulated assets or into other parts of
the Grainger business. Our objective for
this part of the business is to continue 
to invest as much as expected returns
and availability allow.
PAGE 6 PAGE 8 PAGE 4
our six areas of operation
Grainger’s strategy is to provide its shareholders 
with sustained superior returns through its long term
exposure to all aspects of the residential market. 
Our ambition is to use our residential skills to become 
one of Europe’s leading co-investing fund managers. 3
property and 
asset management
This represents the core skill of the
Grainger business. It includes the 
ability to manage large-scale residential
portfolios from the point of view of 
both an investor and a manager. Our
objectives are to continue to provide 
a cost effective high quality service to
our tenants and to generate additional
fee income for the group by selling 
that service to third party owners. This
ties very closely with our market-rented
properties which are largely held in a
fund in which we have secured third
party investors. 
development
This division gives us valuable exposure
to another side of the residential market,
building on our residential expertise,
funding capability and ability to work 
in partnership with a variety of other
organisations such as housing
associations, local councils, other
developers and occupiers. Our objective
is to produce a consistent stream of
good quality returns by focusing on
larger scale, mixed use developments.
europe
We aim to provide a similar mix of 
return proﬁles as our UK businesses. 
In Germany, our portfolio produces a net
rental return after ﬁnancing costs whilst
also providing an opportunity for capital
growth. Our objective is to successfully
acquire sufﬁcient assets to use as the
basis of a third party fund and to recycle
some of the capital released into new
opportunities. 
PAGE 10 PAGE 12 PAGE 14
Our strategy is currently applied through:
• direct ownership of a high quality, reversionary
portfolio of residential properties; 
• our property and asset management skills which
not only service our own portfolio but which
produce income from third parties; and
• our development division which delivers returns
from changes of use or density and from
development.
Within the business we use numerous benchmarks 
to measure operational performance and to assess
the success of our strategy in creating long term
shareholder value. Key amongst these are:
• Total shareholder return;
• Return on shareholder equity; and
• Return on capital employed. 4 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Regulated tenancies Grainger own over 7,700 regulated
residential properties, valued at over £1bn. Our tenants
have security of tenure and pay a ‘fair’ rent. This portfolio 
is core to our business and provides signiﬁcant, predictable
ongoing cash ﬂows from rents and sales proceeds. 
Grainger’s core business remains the ownership, management and trade 
of residential properties which are subject to regulated tenancies. Under
this arrangement, the tenant can stay in the property for the rest of their
life. The rent is set by an independent rent ofﬁcer and is usually less than
that which would be achieved if the property was let on the open market.
We buy these properties at a discount to vacant possession value (the 
price achievable without a tenant in place) to reﬂect the low rent we
receive and the fact that the tenant has lifetime rights of occupation.
When the tenant leaves we sell the property into the owner-occupier
market, realising the discount and any house price inﬂation from the 
date of purchase.
These properties give us two sources of income – rents and the proﬁts
made when they are sold. The size and geographic spread of the portfolio
(some 7,700 units across the UK), combined with the fact that we buy 
and sell properties over long periods of time, help to protect us against
some of the risks associated with residential investment – in particular 
a short term or localised fall in house prices.
Due to a change in the law, no new regulated tenancies have been 
created since January 1989 so the overall number in existence is falling
from year to year. We make every effort to replace the regulated properties
that fall vacant and are then sold but inevitably the portfolio will decline
over time. The management and trading skills that we have developed
over many years working with the regulated portfolio are now being
applied to our other areas of residential ownership such as equity release
and market let properties.

GLOUCESTER ROAD, South
Kensington, London was acquired
in June 2006. Three of the six
apartments are ‘regulateds’. Market tenancies are those properties let at market 
rates on assured shorthold tenancy agreements, 
typically six months or a year in length. The majority 
of these are now held in our recently launched 
co-investment Fund, G:res 1.
Although Grainger’s core tenanted residential business has been in
regulated tenancies, we also built up a large high quality market-rented
portfolio of properties, much of which came from our acquisition of 
City North Group plc in 2005.
During the course of the year, in common with many other property
companies, we transferred these assets (some 1,044 units worth
approximately £200m) to a Jersey Property Unit Trust with a view 
to attracting third party equity investment into the fund.
The successful ﬁrst close was announced on 22 November 2006 with
committed equity from a number of institutional investors. This, together
with currently available bank ﬁnance of up to £125m, should enable this
fund to grow to achieve signiﬁcant assets under management. Such
structures enable us to not only retain a geared exposure to the residential
investment market through our retained ownership but also to provide 
us with a valuable source of both property and asset management fees,
enhancing the overall return. There is also the potential to earn
performance fees.
In addition to providing management services to G:res 1, we also 
continue as property advisor and provide property management services 
to Schroder’s ResPUT, a market let fund. We also own a 22% stake in 
this fund, which at the year end was valued at some £19m.

INVESTMENT VALUE AND

Equity release offers home owners in or near retirement
the opportunity to access some of the value of their home
while continuing to live there for the rest of their lives.
Grainger specialises in home reversions, which can provide
customers with both certainty and access to more cash 
than a lifetime mortgage.
Grainger constantly seeks innovative ways to maintain long term
investment exposure to the housing market. One of our major initiatives
over the last few years has been in the area of ﬂexible retirement solutions
and in particular, the sale of home reversion plans. These plans are part 
of the wider equity release market and enable home owners to raise 
cash from what is usually their most signiﬁcant asset – their home.
Under a typical plan, we buy some or all of a home owner’s property 
for a lump sum or series of payments which depend on the value of the
property, the age of the owner(s) and the proportion they wish to sell. 
The owner can then stay in the property, rent free, for the rest of their 
life or until they decide to leave. At that point, Grainger is able to sell the
property and realise its proﬁt. The long term cash ﬂows from this business
provide a good strategic ﬁt with the cash ﬂows already being generated 
by the regulated tenancy business.
We acquire home reversion assets from three main sources – our own
Bridgewater brand, through our distribution agreement with Norwich
Union and through the direct acquisition of existing portfolios or home
reversion plans from third parties.
We expect the home reversions market to grow considerably in the next
few years as elderly people seek to release cash from their homes to
supplement their pensions or to fund improvements in their lifestyles. 
We are also seeking opportunities to broaden the types of retirement
products we can offer.

Bridgewater Equity Release offers home owners aged 65 and 
over all the advantages of home reversions, with added ﬂexibility.
They choose how much equity in their home they want to release
– from a minimum of 25% – and they can release further amounts
at any time.
A typical Grainger home reversion property is a 3 bedroom
bungalow with a vacant possession value of some £200,000.

PROPERTIES MANAGED
Property and asset management We are proud of our
skills as property and asset managers – producing the
required returns for our shareholders whilst ensuring that
the needs of our customers are met. We also apply this
added value ‘owner’s’ approach to the beneﬁt of our
increasing number of co-investment arrangements.
One of Grainger’s key strengths is our ability to manage property on 
a large-scale. Operating from seven UK ofﬁces and one in Germany, our
property management teams look after almost 18,000 homes and are
trained to understand all types of property and tenure.
Residential property management is a demanding role requiring complex
daily decisions. We fulﬁl our obligations as landlords and provide excellent
service to our customers whilst protecting the value of our assets and
enhancing the performance of our portfolio. Our property management
professionals are skilled at balancing these demands.
Further, our property management and sales and acquisitions teams work
together to ensure that the correct strategy and targets for the portfolio
are set at the outset and that the right blend of refurbishments, sales 
and acquisitions achieve the required performance. We believe that 
our combination of large-scale residential ownership and nationwide
management capabilities provides us with a unique offer to third 
party partners. 
We currently provide such services to the Schroders ResPUT residential
investment and to two partnerships set up between Grainger and the
Genesis Housing Group. We also service G:res 1, our own residential fund
which was launched in November 2006. This fund will act as a blueprint
for our ambitions to grow our business as a co-investing fund manager; 
a model which could be applied to all of our business sectors.

is increasingly focused on large and complex mixed use
projects. The recently strengthened management team is
based in London, Newcastle and Oxford, thus ensuring
good geographic coverage. Working as either principal or
with joint venture partners, Grainger has a diverse portfolio
of existing development opportunities.
Grainger is keen to maintain its exposure to all sectors of the residential
market. One way in which we do this is through our development division.
Our interests range from strategic land holdings to large-scale mixed use
developments, often in co-operation with a funding or development partner.
Our development division produces added value through gaining planning
permission with a change of use or density, or through physical development.
One example of this is the acquisition of green or brownﬁeld land sites
and, over time, obtaining planning permission for residential or mixed 
use developments.
We are increasingly involved in large mixed use developments where our
residential expertise can be used to good effect with the skills of other
development partners – for example, during the year we announced 
a collaborative agreement with Development Securities plc. Since the year
end we have entered into our ﬁrst transaction under this agreement for
the development of a 10 acre site in Birmingham.

GERMANY
Our investments in Germany are
in 3 main regions – Metro-Ruhr,
Baden-Wurttemberg/Bavaria
and Berlin
Europe represents an opportunity for Grainger to expand
and use our skills and experience in new and less developed
residential markets. As owner occupation increases,
Grainger is well positioned to take advantage of this 
trend and build a proﬁtable part of the business.
Grainger is seeking to replicate some of the main characteristics of our 
UK activities in mainland Europe – long term exposure to the tenanted
residential market and residential development opportunities.
Our main focus for residential investment is currently Germany where 
we have recently built up a portfolio of some 3,000 residential units. 
We see the German market as providing opportunities for an experienced
professional landlord such as Grainger. The low price per unit relative 
to other European markets and the low level of home ownership (42%
compared to an average of 59% in the rest of the European Union) augur
well for future capital growth. The attractive ﬁnancing environment also
means that net rents can exceed ﬁnancing costs, unlike the UK market
where low residential net yields require an element of house price inﬂation
to produce an acceptable total level of return. In the future our European
tenanted residential assets could form the basis for us to act as a 
co-investing fund manager on a much larger scale – the recent opening 
of our management ofﬁce in Mannheim is the ﬁrst step in this journey.
On the development side we have two relatively small but exciting
ventures with experienced local partners in Estonia (Tallinn) and the Czech
Republic (Prague). We continue to look for other markets where we can
utilise our skills to achieve appropriate returns.

chairman’ sstatement
Results This is the ﬁrst full year for which we present our results under
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and therefore the ﬁnancial
review contains a greater degree of explanation and interpretation than is usual.
Sufﬁce to say that the implementation of IFRS has no impact on the strategy and
cash ﬂows of our business and our key ﬁnancial indicators, based around net
asset values, show very healthy growth levels. Gross net asset value per share
(i.e. before any deductions for contingent tax or mark to market adjustments)
has risen by 20.2% to 677p from 563p. Base case Grainger Net Asset Value
(NAV) which brings in contingent tax and the reversionary surplus within our
long term portfolio now stands at 595p, up 19.8% from 496p. Statutory NAV
ﬁgures can be found in the ﬁnancial review. 
Proﬁt before tax has increased by 75% to £71.7m from £41.0m. Much of the
increase comes from revaluation or mark to market surpluses; on a like-for-like
basis, removing these items and the goodwill impairment loss, earnings before
interest and tax (‘EBIT’) fell by 4% to £81.5m from £85.3m, largely as a result
of the previously foreseen decrease in contribution from our development
division and from the increased cost of running a larger and more complex
enterprise. Increased borrowing costs from funding our investment programme
have reduced proﬁt before tax on the same basis to £27.4m from £35.6m. 
ROBERT DICKINSON
Chairman

We are again increasing our dividend by 10% per annum and consequently
the board are recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 3.75p per share. If approved,
this will be paid on 6 March 2007 to shareholders on the register on 16 February
2007. Together with the interim dividend of 1.87p per share paid in July this
will produce a total dividend for the year of 5.62p per share (2005: 5.11p).
Strategy and Outlook Grainger has been successful at delivering consistent
shareholder value over a sustained period of time. Over the last ten years our
average total shareholder return has been 28.4% per annum. By comparison,
over the same period, the FTSE 250 has delivered average annual returns of
13.6% and the UK Real Estate Sector 15.9%. Our performance has largely
been based on the trading proﬁts and revaluation surpluses generated by our
substantial residential portfolio. 
Whilst we believe that a major part of this will come from the core regulated
portfolio we also acknowledge that Grainger must evolve over time to replace
those returns as the overall stock of regulated assets declines. Grainger’s 
key strengths come from a combination of its asset base, sound ﬁnancial
platform, reputation with key stakeholders and experience and expertise in 
the residential market. We have ambitious plans to leverage these to expand
the range and depth of the Grainger business to ensure further growth in
shareholder value. These include introducing third party capital (both debt 
and equity) to improve the efﬁciency of our capital structure and to achieve
signiﬁcant scale more quickly but without taking on disproportionate risk. 
This will also be achieved by working with joint venture and collaborative
partners and using our management skills to produce fee income for the 
group at little or no incremental cost. 
We have already made signiﬁcant progress with these plans, including the
introduction of equity funding in our Jersey Property Unit Trust, G:res 1, by
bringing in non-recourse debt to our European business and some equity
release interests, by working with joint venture partners to acquire both
residential and development assets and by acting as property and asset
managers for a number of third parties.
This evolution will continue and as our various portfolios mature and reach
critical mass we can foresee a time when our returns will come from a more
balanced combination of direct property ownership, co-investment in residential
funds and fee income. In the long term, this will help us deliver sustainable

It is our aim to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders.  19
performance driven returns and thereby further enhance shareholder value. 
We see a real opportunity for Grainger ultimately to become the leading
European co-investing fund manager in residential property. 
As shareholders will be aware, a consortium comprising Regis, Merrill Lynch
and the William Pears Group announced in October that it was ‘assessing the
attractions of making a proposal regarding a possible cash offer’ for Grainger.
Later that month, the consortium announced that it had no present intention
of making an offer. I can conﬁrm that their activity did not deﬂect the Board 
of Grainger or its executive management from the strategy outlined above. 
Prospects We have great belief in Grainger’s ability to deliver attractive returns
to shareholders:
• we have a unique and irreplaceable portfolio, unrivalled expertise 
and a very strong reputation amongst our stakeholders; 
• the existing business model has substantial income and growth potential; 
• we can create additional income and shareholder value by moving 
towards a co-investing fund management model; and 
• our ability to work with co-investors and other partners has been
illustrated by our joint venture relationships, our launch of G:res 1 
and our agreement with Development Securities plc. 
The group has considerably changed the way in which it operates over the 
last few years and to reﬂect those changes we consider it appropriate to 
move forward with a clearer identity – one which is more in keeping with the
reputation and image we intend to present in the future. Consequently, we 
will propose to our shareholders at our Annual General Meeting a change 
of name to Grainger plc. 
I would like to take this ﬁnal opportunity to thank all of our staff for the
commitment and expertise they have demonstrated not only during the year
but also throughout my time as a director.

chiefexecutive’ sreview
The Market The UK residential market has shown strong levels of growth in the 
12-month period to the end of September – both the Nationwide and the Halifax House
Price Indices showed year-on-year growth of 8.2%. Healthy growth levels were recorded 
in most parts of the country with London and the South East showing particular increases
in the latter part of the year. Our own portfolio, which has some 59% by value in London
and the South East, showed an average increase of 9.1%. 
The increase in interest rates in August has done little to deter price growth and it is 
too early to say what impact the November movement will have, although it is likely that
lenders will pass on a higher proportion of the increase to their customers than seems 
to have been the case to date. Since September, we have seen the annualised October
Halifax Index rise to 8.7% and sales from our own portfolio have been achieving prices
3% above our September vacant possession values. This ﬁgure should, however, be
treated with some caution because of the relatively low number of transactions involved. 
Our major business areas share a common theme: an ability to 
generate superior returns through our expertise in owning, managing,
developing and trading residential property either directly or as 
co-investor. We are pleased with the progress made in these areas 
in the year and are excited by the opportunities we are creating. 
RUPERT DICKINSON Chief executive 21
The UK residential market has shown signiﬁcant growth levels over extended periods 
of time: the average UK house price in 1986 was £41,000; in 2006 that has risen to
£181,000, an annual compound growth rate of just under 8%. Much of this has come 
in the last ﬁve years where the equivalent rate has been 14%. Whilst the economic and
interest rate outlook are likely to dampen these rates, we still remain conﬁdent of the 
long term potential of the residential market. We believe that our core portfolio is
particularly well placed to withstand short term ﬂuctuations. It has a broad geographical
base but also a strong core in London and the South East where average annual values 
are expected to remain ﬁrm because of high demand. The average vacant possession 
value of the individual properties in our main reversionary portfolio, the regulated
tenancies, is £182,000 and some 31% of the portfolio is within 20% of that ﬁgure. 
We have relatively few properties at the more volatile top end of the market and as the
majority of our properties are unmodernised there is usually strong demand from ﬁrst 
or second time buyers and property developers who wish to improve the property.

Our Business Core Portfolio – Regulated Tenancies Our core portfolio consists
primarily of regulated tenancies which account for 54% by value of our total property 
and investment interests. At 30 September 2006, we owned 7,715 regulated units 
valued at £1,090m (2005: 8,161 units at £984m). At the same date, the vacant 
possession value (the value at which we hope to sell them when vacant at today’s prices)
of the regulated portfolio amounted to £1,403m (2005: £1,349m). Including our share 
of regulated tenancies held within joint ventures, the vacant possession value becomes
£1,474m (2005: £1,367m). 
The regulated portfolio is valued by deducting a discount from the vacant possession
value. This discount takes account of the fact that the rental yield is generally below
market rates and that it may be some years before we obtain vacant possession and 
can then sell the property. Over time, this discount has narrowed although for the last 
few years we have used a rate of 27.5%. Strong market and transaction activity has 
led us to believe that this discount is conservative and our valuers have now certiﬁed 
the valuation of these properties at 77.5% of vacant possession value – a discount of 
22.5%. This realignment has produced an increase in value at the year end of £67m.
In addition to regulated tenancies, our core portfolio includes a further 652 units
comprising vacants, assured tenancies short term lets, and other interests. These 
units have a value at 30 September 2006 of £141m (2005: £117m) and their vacant
possession value is £160m (2005: £124m).

Sales in this division have remained constant at £126m and margins on normal sales 
(i.e. when a property is sold on vacancy as opposed to with a tenant in situ) amounted 
to 48.6% (2005: 48.5%). Including net rental and other income of £24m, the regulated
chief executive’s review continued 23

For a portfolio of this type it is essential that we recycle capital – during the year, we
acquired 325 units for a consideration of £44m. The highlight of the year, however, 
was the acquisition of ﬁve London apartment blocks for £196m from the Church
Commissioners in the second 50:50 joint venture of this type with the Genesis Housing
Group. This portfolio included 429 regulated units.

Equity Release The equity release business is a strong ﬁt and a natural investment
channel for the surplus cash generated by our regulated business. We are building up a
highly reversionary portfolio which will provide us with the long term geared exposure 
to the residential market that we strategically seek. We have been building our portfolio
through three primary routes – our distribution agreement with Norwich Union, portfolio
acquisitions and our Bridgewater brand.

Industry ﬁgures from Safe Home Income Plans (‘SHIP’) indicate that we are now providing
44% of all new home reversions in the UK. 
The market value of our 3,003 unit equity release portfolio at 30 September 2006 stood 
at £241m, with a vacant possession value of £421m (2005: 2,663 units with a market
value of £196m, vacant possession value of £354m). During the year, we acquired 
432 units for £29m and sold 110 units for £13m. The division produced an operating
contribution of £3m (2005: £4m).

This is a market in which critical mass, service integrity and product innovation and
development are key. We were therefore delighted to receive the ‘Award for Innovation’ 
at the Investment, Life and Pension Awards 2006. 
Critical mass will enable us to put in place more efﬁcient forms of ﬁnancing, while 
product development will help us to provide a greater selection of retirement solutions 
to potential customers. 
Since the year end we have announced an offer to acquire a portfolio of over 900
retirement properties, which are subject to lifetime leases, or are currently vacant.
Market-Rented Properties Over the years, the group has acquired a number of market
rented properties usually as a result of purchases of mixed tenure portfolios. This was
bolstered by the acquisition of City North Group plc in 2005, and by the start of this
ﬁnancial year we owned 1,102 market rented properties with a value of £188m. We believe
that we can maximise returns from such a portfolio by introducing third party equity and
non-recourse debt, with Grainger retaining a substantial investment and obtaining the
beneﬁt of asset and property management fees. 
Consequently, during the year, we transferred the bulk of our market rented properties to
a JPUT and then marketed the holding as G:res 1, an independent Jersey exempt company,
to institutional investors. Although we still owned all of the units at 30 September 2006,
we announced ﬁrst closing on 22 November 2006 having raised third party equity
commitments of £56m. We are expecting to secure further equity commitments of £69m in
due course and see this as a model for other co-invested funds which we could establish. 
chief executive’s review continued 25
In G:res 1 at the year end, we had 1,178 market rented properties with a market value 
of £210m and a vacant possession value of £238m, producing operating proﬁt before
valuation gains of £4.6m. 
Property and Asset Management One of Grainger’s key strengths is its ability to provide
property and asset management services to third parties with the specialist expertise
derived from being a substantial owner in its own right. Almost uniquely we can provide
these services across the UK through our seven managing ofﬁces and network of managing
agents. We expanded this capability into mainland Europe in October when we opened 
an ofﬁce in Mannheim to manage our growing German residential portfolio.
In total we employ 103 staff in our property and asset management division. As well as
taking responsibility for our own UK portfolio of 12,420 residential units they also provide
services for a total of 2,801 units for third party owners or for joint venture vehicles in
which we are participants. This includes the Schroders ResPUT, in which we hold a 22.3%
stake and the joint ventures with the Genesis Housing Group. 
Our property managers also support our own market rented fund, G:res 1, which was
valued at 30 September 2006 at £210m; we anticipate that, before any performance
related elements, this will generate annualised fee income for the group of approximately
£2.2m. Our total recurring fee income will be approximately £4m per year. 
We see great potential for the fund management structure to be applied to other areas 
of our business, most obviously our European portfolio.

Development Grainger Development is an important proﬁt contributor to the group 
and provides us with entrepreneurial development skills which complement our other
spheres of residential expertise. We have reﬁned our focus in this division to concentrate
on larger scale residential or residential-led mixed use opportunities, particularly in those
areas where the longevity of the project, the need to work with partners or the nature of
the development itself makes it unsuitable for housebuilders. 
At the year end, the value of our UK development portfolio stood at £90m (2005: £124m)
and the division produced operating proﬁts and proﬁts on the sale of ﬁxed assets totalling
£7m (2005: £13m). Major gross contributions were £2.8m from The Glasshouse, Putney,
£2.5m from sales of three properties in Slough and £2.3m from the ongoing sales of
Grainger Homes sites. The decrease in returns compared to the prior year was foreseen
and reﬂects the predictable but volatile nature of the proﬁt stream in any development
business. It is our ambition to enable this division to produce a more steady ﬂow of returns
but given that many of our current projects are at an early stage of development, this may
be some time in the future. 
At 30 September, the completed development value of our sites is estimated at £675m, 
of which £178m has planning consent.

During the year, we outsourced project management and delivery responsibility for
Grainger Homes to its then management. Although we retain ownership of the existing
sites, representing a future bank of some 318 new houses and will receive proﬁts as they
are sold, it is not our intention to have future involvement in small-scale housebuilding
activities where we are competing directly against national and/or local housebuilders. 
There has been signiﬁcant progress in planning on our major sites in the year. At the
Barnsbury Complex in Islington we have achieved detailed planning consent on a scheme
comprising 140 private and affordable residential units. At Hornsey Road Baths, Islington,
we have commenced demolition at the start of the development of new council ofﬁces,
200 private and affordable units and community buildings. We were also pleased to obtain
planning consent for 94 residential units and a 26,000 sq. ft. ofﬁce building at Macaulay
Road, Clapham after many years of endeavour. We have also submitted an outline planning
application for 1,550 residential units, 12 hectares of employment use and 14 hectares 
of mixed use at our site at West Waterlooville. Other major sites in our current portfolio
include two large residential schemes in the North East of England which will deliver
approximately 300 housing units. Further details on when these projects are expected to
become income producing are shown in the Financial Review later in this report. 
The division’s future pipeline includes a scheme above Seven Sisters underground station
for 327 residential units and 53,000 sq. ft. of retail under a co-operation agreement 
with the London Borough of Haringey and appointment as preferred developer by
Newbury Council to develop 331 units and 47,000 sq. ft of retail at Market Street 
in the town centre. 
Since the year end, we have been delighted to announce the ﬁrst joint venture acquisition
with Development Securities plc under the co-operation agreement we revealed previously.
This is for the 10 acre Curzon Park site in Birmingham, with an end value in the region 
of £350m-£400m. It will provide a mixed use scheme of c. 1.4 million sq. ft. to include 
c. 800,000 sq. ft. of grade A ofﬁce space, c. 400,000 sq. ft. of residential accommodation,
a 180 bed hotel and c. 30,000 sq. ft. of retail space.
We see our ability and willingness to work with partners (other developers, land owners,
councils, housing associations) as being key to giving us access to the larger mixed use
residential-led schemes on which we aim to focus. This enables us to achieve scale without
taking on a disproportionate level of risk. 
We have invested heavily in the human capital of this division in the year and feel that 
we now have the team to deliver our vision.  28 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006

Europe At this stage last year we were looking forward to completing our ﬁrst 
acquisition of 1,406 German residential properties. At 30 September 2006, the 
portfolio stood at 2,739 units and, as announced in October, we have acquired 
a further 308 units in Munich with anticipated completion early in 2007.

Whilst we are constantly examining other areas for potential residential investment,
Germany still holds attraction for us. A combination of low levels of home ownership, 
an attractive ﬁnancing environment enabling us to achieve a positive yield spread, low
price levels relative to other European markets and potential for rental growth provides
good opportunities for experienced professional landlords. 
At 30 September, our portfolio comprised 186,844 sq. metres of residential space at 
a cost of £117m (generally below replacement cost) and providing an annualised gross 
rent of £7.5m. The operating contribution of the division in the year was £2.0m. 
There has been considerable comment on the opportunities for residential investment in
Germany and it is clear that competition for portfolios is ﬁerce. However, we are constantly
pursuing opportunities and our decision to open a small management ofﬁce in Mannheim
illustrates our commitment and enthusiasm for this sector. 
It is our ambition to grow the German portfolio to a size where it becomes an attractive
proposition for third party investment and where we can apply our strategic model for 
co-investing fund management.
In addition to our residential interests we also have an 81.6% stake in a company registered
in the Czech Republic. This company owns a well positioned development site of 21 acres in
Zizkov to the East of Prague City Centre. The site is designated as a mixed use development
site and we are hopeful of receiving a detailed planning consent in 2008.  29
Robert Dickinson We would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Robert
Dickinson who retires as Chairman at the conclusion of our next Annual General Meeting.
Robert was made a director of Grainger in 1961 and has been Chairman since 1992. 
Since 1961, Grainger has evolved from a small family company through initial listing on 
the then Unlisted Securities Market, full listing and is now the UK’s largest listed residential
property company. This tenure has seen a remarkable period of growth and return. 
A shareholder who had invested £10,000 in Grainger shares on ﬂotation in March 1983
would, at 30 September, have had shares worth £438,124 and would have beneﬁted from
£30,210 in dividends, including the proposed 2006 ﬁnal dividend. Further, if dividends had
been reinvested on receipt, the shareholder would, at 30 September, have had shares
worth £738,565*.
In a long term business like Grainger it has proved invaluable to have someone who has
been able to provide unrivalled experience and knowledge of the group and its market
over such a long continuous period. We have been fortunate to have been the recipients
of his wise and expert leadership.

As the Grainger business grows in size and complexity, 
it is essential that we have an appropriate management
structure in place to achieve our objectives.
graingerworks
During the year, the senior executive team (pictured) have made signiﬁcant
progress, working with the board to formulate future strategy for each
distinct operating division with the aim of delivering growth within 
the existing capital structure. Currently, Grainger is valued primarily on 
the basis of net assets. We believe that future outperformance will be
achievable if we are able to leverage our day-to-day operational expertise
in managing, trading and developing residential property, with strategic
corporate and ﬁnancial skills not widely used or accepted in the currently
fragmented residential investment sector. We are therefore continuing 
to invest in our management and staff as their proﬁciency and retention
are key to our ongoing success.

Measurements of net asset value are Key Performance Indicators for the group. We set out three measurements 
to better enable shareholders to compare our performance with our peers, while reﬂecting the somewhat unique 
nature of our business.  33
Gross Net Assets Per Share
Up 20.2% to 677p from 563p. This measure gives the
market value net assets per share before any deductions
for deferred tax on revaluation gains. 
The chart below shows the major movements in NAV 
in the year.
Triple Net Assets Per Share NNNAV
Up 25.0% to 487p from 389p. This is the gross net assets
per share ﬁgure adjusted for deferred tax on revaluation
gains and for mark to market adjustments such as those
arising from the restatement of ﬁnancial instruments. 
It should be noted that the deduction for deferred tax
assumes that all of the tax on the revaluation gains in our
portfolio is payable immediately. With our long term
reversionary portfolios (regulated and equity release) the
assets will only be sold when vacancy arises and this will
be some time in the future. As we know the average age

of our tenants we can estimate the timing of the vacancy and
therefore also the timing of the crystallisation of the tax liability.
If we were to discount this liability at our weighted average
cost of capital, the deferred tax deduction would reduce by
£112m and so our NNNAV would increase by 86p per share. 
Grainger NAV
Base case up 19.8% to 595p from 496p. Grainger’s NAV
brings in the reversionary value which resides in our long
term regulated and equity release portfolios. It adjusts
NNNAV for the taxed present value of the reversionary
surpluses in these portfolios which will revert over the
expected duration of our tenants occupation. The major
variables in calculating the Grainger NAV are:
• anticipated house price inﬂation over the 
reversionary period;
• the discount rate used to calculate the present value;
• whether deferred taxation on the revaluation surpluses
recognised in our market value balance sheet is 
discounted; and
• the average period it will take to obtain vacancy.
The base case Grainger NAV takes a very prudent approach 
to these key assumptions as follows:
• house price inﬂation is taken as zero over the entire
expected remaining period of occupation by the tenants;
• we have used a discount rate of 8.67% (our weighted
average cost of capital plus 3%); 
• deferred taxation on revaluation surpluses has not been
discounted; and
• we have taken the period of reversion as being 12 years
for our regulated tenants and 9.5 years for our equity
release tenants. We update these ﬁgures each year.
To illustrate the sensitivity of the Grainger NAV under
different assumptions, we have prepared a ﬁnancial model
on our website www.graingertrust.co.uk where these ﬁgures
can be ﬂexed. Some illustrative examples are:

Other Financial Performance Measures 
As well as NAV measures we use other key performance
indicators to evaluate our ﬁnancial performance:
Total shareholder return for the year was 39.1%, an
increase of 13.2 percentage points over 2005.
Return on shareholder equity (measured as the growth 
in NNNAV plus dividends per share as a percentage of
opening NNNAV) was 26.5%, compared to 6.0% in 2005.
Return on capital employed (measured as proﬁt before
costs of ﬁnancing together with all revaluation surpluses 
as a percentage of opening gross capital) was 15.3%, 
an increase of 9.1 percentage points over 2005.
Financial Performance in the Year
Operating proﬁt before fair value movements fell from
£85.3m to £81.5m in the year, the major changes as
shown below:
Operating contribution from our residential businesses 
(net rents together with trading proﬁts and proﬁts on sale
of ﬁxed assets) increased by 6.5% to £83m from £78m.
As predicted last year, operating contribution from our
development and trading division fell by £6m to £7m.
Our total administrative costs in the year of £32m have
risen from £22m in 2005. The major increases have come
from a series of one-off costs (City North and development
division re-organisations, various transaction costs) and
from the investments in high quality staff we are making 
in our emerging business lines (Europe, equity release 
and development). 
Many of our administrative overheads (property
management, sales and acquisitions, and our development
division’s costs) are directly attributable to operating divisions
and for statutory disclosure purposes are netted off those
income streams. Overall, £12m has been added to property
expenses, £6m has been added to sales costs and £4m 
has been added to the cost of development sales. 
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share has increased by 57% to 39.1p
from 24.9p as shown below:
The gain in valuation of investment properties of £39.9m
has arisen largely from the establishment of our Jersey
Property Unit Trust for market rented properties. On transfer,
these assets were classiﬁed as investment properties and the
uplift in value from cost is shown as a revaluation surplus.

Not all of our ﬁnancial instruments met the complex
hedging requirements of IAS 39 during the year and so
movements in their fair value have been taken to the
income statement. These amount to £10.4m. The vast
majority by value of these instruments are now compliant
and so value movements will be taken through reserves in
future and we should see less income statement volatility.
Our net interest bill has increased by £5.3m to £54.5m,
with interest payable increasing by £8.9m. This is primarily
as a result of higher average debt levels arising from our
signiﬁcant investment programme in Europe, equity release
and in joint venture acquisitions. The average of our
monthly debt levels has been some £188m higher in 
2006 than 2005. 
Our annual tax charge is at an effective rate of 29.59%,
the major items affecting it being:

Financial Resources 
The business continues to be highly cash generative. Cash
from operating activities and from sales of investment
property, amounted to £208m (2005: £174m).
Out of this cash ﬂow we paid interest of £55m, and tax 
of £15m and we reinvested a total of £301m in acquiring
properties, funding development and investing in joint
ventures. We borrowed an additional £165m, and the
headroom on our core facility at the year end stood at
£307m. This headroom affords us enviable strength in
bidding for signiﬁcant acquisitions.
Since the year end we have entered into a non-recourse
€150m facility which will be drawn down to fund our
German acquisitions. 
Also since the year end we have reached agreement 
with our major lenders to revise the terms of our core 
£1.3bn facility, which will spread the loan maturity dates
and extend the average maturity by two years and which
will reduce the overall borrowing margin by 13 basis
points. Together with a reduction in commitment fees on
any un-drawn facility this will produce an annualised
saving of some £1.7m. 
At the year end, our net borrowings were £1,051m (2005:
£861m) and our average cost of borrowings was 5.8%
(2005: 5.9%). To protect ourselves against interest rate risk
the group’s treasury policy is to maintain a ﬂoating rate
exposure of no greater than 35% of expected borrowings.
At the year end, we were 66% economically hedged 
(2005: 76%) and at current levels of borrowing we have
protection in place to meet our policy requirement for the
next 2.5 years and have at least £250m of hedging for the
next six years.
Our loan to value ratio at 30 September was 52% 
(2005: 53%).

22 December 2006 36 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
I am pleased to report that CSR is gathering momentum within
Grainger, and this year we have worked hard to achieve our
targets. Our corporate culture is very dynamic and go-getting
which has enabled us to embrace some of the challenges of CSR
with gusto and creativity. I believe this responsiveness to change
will increasingly be necessary in rapidly changing global markets,
and in the face of new business risks such as climate change. 
In 2006, Grainger developed a corporate environmental policy and we now
look forward to further formalising our environmental commitments across
areas of signiﬁcant impact. We have reviewed and extended our community
investment practices, both through active employment programmes run in
conjunction with BiTC, and through our charitable activities. During the year,
we also developed our new Employee Charter and launched an award-winning
Payroll Giving scheme that has already been a tremendous success. Following 
a comprehensive Health and Safety (H&S) review across all of our activities, we
now have robust procedures in place to manage, measure, monitor and reduce
H&S incidents across the entire business. We have also continued to improve
our customer service quality through extensive training of property managers,
and issued clear concise guidance to our tenants on a variety of issues,
including facilitating grant applications for them to improve heating and
insulation standards in their homes. These are just some of the areas that 
we have been working on in the past year.
This report summarises our achievements against our 2006 CSR targets,
structured under our seven longer-term CSR objectives (reviewed and updated
in 2005). It also includes a number of quantitative measures of our performance
against each objective, and thereby further improves our transparency on 
social and environmental issues. 
Of course, we recognise that we still have more to learn, and we continue 
to have ideas to further improve our business performance and align it with
the values underpinning CSR. We look forward to continuing our efforts over
the coming year.

In Autumn 2005, Grainger Trust participated in the Times 100 Best Companies to work 
for Survey. Although not making the top 100, Grainger scored well across a broad range
of areas, and the survey was helpful in conﬁrming areas Grainger has identiﬁed as in 
need of improvement. The most important of these was internal communication and staff
involvement, which we will be working on in the coming year. Grainger will participate in
the survey again in 2006, and will hope to demonstrate real improvement in performance.

Ensure that we treat our tenants and customers fairly, and that we are
responsive to their needs.
During the year, Grainger developed new Tenant Guide Packs for both our regulated and
market let tenants. These packs provide clear information relating to the terms of the rental
agreement, complaints procedures, and respective rights of both tenants and landlord. 
We have also published a Tenants Charter which clearly states our commitment to act 
in a professional and helpful manner to our tenants. Our website includes ‘graingerlets’,
which includes details of our properties available to let and a tenant guide to renting, for
prospective tenants. We began to centrally monitor all complaints received in March, and to
date we have received a total of 27, which represents only 0.2% of our tenants by number.
Throughout the year we also supported our tenants in accessing funding via Warm Front,
the government’s main grant-funded programme for tackling fuel poverty. 28% of the
properties we inspected had insulation work carried out and many of our tenants
successfully secured funding for central heating installation. 
Our property managers are the ‘face’ of Grainger to our tenants. It is essential, therefore,
that our property managers are equipped to manage the great range of demands made 
of them. With this in mind, Grainger launched ‘The Balancing Act’, an innovative and
interactive e-learning programme for property managers. Consisting of four modules, 
the programme challenges staff to ﬁnd ways to balance the often conﬂicting demands 
and expectations of property management. The programme has proved a great success, 
and all property managers have now completed modules one and two, with the 
remaining modules to be completed in early 2007. 
• 445 properties surveyed to date under the Warm Front initiative, of which 28% 
had insulation work done.
• 98.7% of rent due has been collected.
• Rent loss due to voids as a percentage of Open Market Rental Value was 5.5% 
for the year against a target of 7%. 
• 60% of exiting market rented tenants rated Grainger’s Management Service 
as very good or excellent.

“The Balancing Act has given us a new and innovative way of learning; many of our day-to-day issues 
do not have one speciﬁc solution – we must apply our experience and knowledge of operational
objectives to deal with a range of complex issues.” DAVID HANCOCK, PROPERTY MANAGER, ALTRINCHAM
Corporate Social Responsibility continued 39
targets 2006/07 • Become accredited under the local authority initiative ‘Landlords Accreditation Scheme’
where this is implemented in areas in which we manage housing.
• Develop and issue a Tenant Satisfaction Questionnaire for regulated tenants.
• Develop and launch a web area for tenants providing easy access to information
relevant to their tenancy, as well as guidance on other topical issues, such as 
the environment.
• Monitor our performance against the percentage of emergency repairs completed 
in 48 hours.
• Increase the proportion of our exiting market let tenants who rate our management
service as either Very Good or Excellent to 65% (from 60%).
Reduce our direct adverse environmental impacts, and help and
encourage our tenants and customers to do the same in respect 
of the properties they occupy.
In 2006, we have formalised our commitment to the environment in a policy statement,
with a particular focus on our development activities, where we feel we have the greatest
ability to mitigate our impacts. The policy can be viewed on our website . 
In May 2006, we conducted a preliminary review against EcoHomes for our Hornsey Road
development. This assessment included a cost beneﬁt analysis of a variety of heating
systems, and indicated that we are likely to achieve a Very Good EcoHomes rating. 
• Undertake a baseline review of Grainger’s environmental aspects and impacts 
with a view to formalising our management procedures around those that are 
most signiﬁcant.
• All new Grainger developments to achieve a minimum EcoHomes rating of Very Good.
• Monitor the performance of all our development projects in relation to both waste
management during construction and cost in use following completion.
• Carry out research to identify environmentally friendly materials/products with a view
to listing these on our refurbishment site ‘Property Design Solutions’ and actively
encourage our contractors to use them.

targets 2006/07 40 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Seek to understand the needs of the communities within which we
operate, and positively contribute to their well-being.
During 2006, Grainger strengthened its commitment to act as a responsible corporate
citizen, through the implementation of several initiatives and improved engagement 
with local communities.
• Community Consultation at Widdrington Station Grainger piloted a best practice
community consultation technique at our proposed regeneration development at
Widdrington Station. We commissioned local social regeneration consultants to carry
out the consultation, including proactive communication with residents, and design
workshops. The technique proved very successful and we have now committed to
apply minimum community consultation standards at all future development projects. 
• Business in the Community In 2006, Grainger became a member of Business in the
Community. This has helped us identify opportunities to make a real difference in the
communities in which we operate. As a result, we have committed to providing work
placements to disadvantaged groups by operating a ‘buddying’ scheme with our
existing staff to assist long term unemployed in getting back into the workplace.
• Workplace Giving In 2006, we launched our employee payroll giving scheme 
in partnership with Workplace Giving and Shelter, which has proved to be very
successful. Peter O’Hara, Managing Director of Workplace Giving UK said “It is great
to see that smaller employers who embrace Payroll Giving are successful and we
congratulate Grainger for their initial and ongoing commitment to the scheme 
which has already raised more than £13,000 for UK Charities.” 
Grainger has already won two awards for its payroll giving scheme and been awarded
the Gold Award under the new Payroll Giving Quality Mark.
• £24,112 raised for Shelter, our charity of the year again in 2006 
(Shelter in 2005 – £30,764).
• 220 staff involved in community activities (180 in 2005). 
• £58,747 raised in total for charities (£42,234 in 2005).

• Develop a community consultation procedure to include minimum standards to be
implemented on all development projects, and guidance on the use of best practice
techniques for appropriate projects.
Safeguard the health, safety and welfare of our employees, 
and where possible that of our tenants, contractors, visitors, 
clients and the general public.
During 2006, Grainger carried out an extensive and detailed Health and Safety (H&S)
review, which resulted in a detailed action plan being put in place. The majority of 
actions have now been completed, so we are developing a further plan for the coming
year to ensure continuous improvement. All property managers and development division
managers were required to attend a comprehensive H&S training course during 2006. 
The H&S manager also started a programme of e-learning display screen equipment
training, which 110 members of staff have now completed.
• No RIDDOR* reportable accidents and incidents.
• No pollution incidents.
• Gather and present H&S data for major development projects to track H&S
performance and identify any trends.
• Embed Grainger’s Construction, Design and Management policy into the organisation
and monitor KPIs.
• Undertake H&S audits of a sample of Managing Agents, in order that their H&S
performance can be assessed.
• All Property Maintenance Contractors to be issued, and conﬁrm compliance, 
with Grainger’s Health and Safety Handbook.

Engage proactively with prioritised suppliers to ensure that they meet
with our speciﬁed economic, social and environmental standards.
During the year, Grainger developed the ‘Black Book’, a new electronic supplier
management database. The system, which already includes H&S criteria, has been
designed to accommodate more CSR related questions, and will allow for contractors 
to be graded accordingly. 
Scorecards are being used to measure the community and environmental practice 
of suppliers, and environmentally preferable ofﬁce suppliers are being identiﬁed.
• Average payment term from invoice date remained at 30 days in 2006.
• Develop relevant guidance for contractors on tenant care, considerate construction,
and environmental good practice.
Maintain high standards of business conduct, and secure long term
sustainable returns for our investors.
• Investor Engagement We continue to keep our investors well informed of our
strategy and success through regular meetings and presentations. In particular, during
2006, the group’s chief executive and deputy chief executive/ﬁnance director have,
between them, conducted almost 100 meetings with shareholders, potential investors
and analysts (approximately  80 in 2005) in the UK, Europe and the US.
• Employee Charter During the year, we developed an Employee Charter setting
out all the guiding principles by which we expect our growing number of staff to
conduct business. In keeping with our ‘people ﬁrst’ culture, this Charter clariﬁes to
employees the nature of their own, and Grainger's responsibilities. It refers employees
to other more detailed policies including public interests disclosure (whistle blowing).
• Formally respond to requests for information sent by our major investors 
(owners of at least 3% shares) on CSR.
• Proactively undertake research into the public CSR commitments of our major
stakeholders (including investors, peers, partners, and contractors) to shape 
our future strategy.

Upstream has assessed Grainger’s achievement against these targets based on:
• Meetings and face-to-face interviews with the Grainger individuals responsible 
for speciﬁc CSR areas and for target delivery.
• Detailed review of documentation and information submitted as evidence against 
the targets.
On this basis we can provide assurance that Grainger has fully achieved 15 out of its 
21 targets (70%), with ﬁve substantially progressed, and only one target not met at all. 
This demonstrates a high level of achievement by a company that set CSR targets for 
the ﬁrst time, suggesting a commendable sense of ownership and commitment to CSR.
Grainger performed particularly well against its socio-economic targets, but has also
demonstrated signiﬁcant progress this year in developing its environmental policy
statement and further addressing the management of its environmental impacts.
The year’s highlights are well documented in these pages of the Annual Report, and more
detail is provided on the company website. The only target not to have been met was the
inclusion of a set of CSR standards in major construction contracts. Although a number of
environmental and H&S issues are covered as standard practice, the company is committed
to further strengthening its requirements of contractors on speciﬁc issues such as waste
management. 
Tighter management of environmental impacts also represents a considerable challenge 
to Grainger, given that it is not able to exert direct control over many of its properties due
to the management/leasehold arrangements. However, the company is committed to
identifying those areas where it does have inﬂuence, and to taking action in these areas 
as much as possible. 
At Upstream, we look forward to continuing to work with Grainger as it addresses current
and future challenges, and continues to embed CSR into the core of its business.

The board of Grainger continue to believe that it is
essential to maintain the highest standards of corporate
governance. In their view, good corporate governance is
achieved through the way that Grainger acts, and does 
not necessarily automatically follow from ‘ticking boxes’.
As in prior years, where the group departs from the
Combined Code 2003 (‘the Code’), this has been an 
active decision taken by the board that the provision 
is not in the best interests of the group.
As required by the Listing Rules, a statement of how the
principles of the Code are applied is given below, along
with our formal compliance statement and explanations
where the Code has not been applied. The main part 
of this report should be read in conjunction with the
additional statements made by the board committees
which follow.
Board Conduct
The board meets regularly, four times each year, for the
consideration of strategy and to monitor and evaluate the
group’s performance and prospects. This brings together 
a wealth and depth of experience ranging from the
cautious to the entrepreneurial, suitable to the effective
management of the group.
The table below shows the attendance by each director 
at the ‘ordinary’ board meetings held during the year.
Biographical details are given on page 45.

Further to the regular ‘ordinary’ meetings, the board 
also meets, by teleconference where necessary, in order to
consider major transactions as they arise. Full attendance
at such meetings is almost always achieved, although due
to the unpredictability of such transactions, cannot always
be guaranteed. In these circumstances, the chairman speaks
to the director who is unable to join the meeting in advance.
In June each year, the board meets for two days to receive
presentations from senior management and to discuss
strategy at length. This ensures that non-executives fully
understand and are able to impact the strategy of the
group in bringing their respective experiences to bear. 
It also gives opportunities for the non-executive directors
to meet with senior management to discuss their speciﬁc
business areas.
Further to the outcome of last year’s board evaluation, 
the board have held strategy meetings on the evening
prior to each of the four ordinary board meetings this year.
Each meeting has been some two hours in length and has
included presentations from the most senior management
where appropriate to the topic for debate. Dinner follows
each of the strategy meetings, allowing the directors more
informal time together.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the
board’s attention which includes:
• setting the overall strategy;
• approving major transactions;
• setting loan to value limits and associated 
hedging strategy; and
• accounting policies
The schedule is kept under review and updated as
appropriate to ensure that the most important matters
affecting the business are dealt with by the main board.
Other tasks which require main board director attention
are delegated to the board’s committees or to the
executives. Grainger therefore considers committee
membership and chairmanship to be of the utmost
importance to ensure each committee has the necessary
skills to properly discharge its duties.
Relevant ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information is supplied
to directors in a timely manner before each board/committee
meeting. Any ad hoc request for information from a
director is dealt with as a high priority, and every director 
Corporate governance report 47
is able to table agenda items at a board meeting. The
directors have direct access to the services of the company
secretary, who reports to the chairman regarding matters
of corporate governance. The appointment and removal of
the company secretary is a matter for the board as a whole.
Procedures also exist for directors to take independent
professional advice as required, at the group’s expense.
The chairman met during the year with the non-executives,
without the executive directors.
Investment Committee
During the year, Grainger has formed an investment
committee. Its terms of reference include the objectives of
approving strategic and/or material investments made by
the group, to monitor ‘routine’ investments to ensure they
are made in line with the group’s acquisition policies and
business plan, and ﬁnally, to recommend major investment
proposals to the main board. The committee comprises
Rupert Dickinson, Andrew Cunningham, Richard Exley 
and Cameron Spry (see page 30). 
The formation of this committee has added a new depth
and formality to the strategic decision-making of the group 
in line with its increasing size and complexity.
Roles
Grainger employs a relatively small board, which consisted
throughout the year of the chairman, deputy chairman,
two executive and four non-executive directors. Each 
non-executive is therefore required to participate in two
committees of the board and Robin Broadhurst fulﬁlled 
the senior independent director role.
The roles of chairman and chief executive are very distinct,
and a written division of their respective responsibilities has
been reviewed and approved by the board as a whole. In
brief, the principal differentiating factors are:
Chairman
Reports to the board
Only the CEO and company secretary report to him
Responsible for running the board
Guardian of the board’s decision-making
Chief executive
Reports to the chairman
All executive management report to him, 
directly or indirectly
Responsible for running the business
Responsible for implementing the board’s decisions
As announced at the interim on 13 June 2006, Robert
Dickinson will be retiring from the board at the Annual
General Meeting on 28 February 2007. He will be replaced
as chairman by Robin Broadhurst, currently senior
independent director. Bill Tudor John will replace Robin
Broadhurst as senior independent director. A search is
under way to ﬁnd a new independent non-executive
director. Following the appointment, committee
membership will be reviewed to ensure the most
appropriate composition for each committee depending
upon the skills and experience of the directors.
Independence
The independence of the non-executive directors remains
the principal potentially contentious corporate governance
issue. The board does not consider that the criteria set out
in section A.3.1 of the Combined Code should be taken 
as automatic failure of a director to be independent. It is
their fundamental belief that directors should be assessed
robustly as individuals, taking into account their own
unique experiences, reputations and competencies along
with their mindfulness and willingness to contribute to
decisions of the board on the basis of those. However, 
the board has carefully made progress with this issue over
the last few years, and after the retirement of the chairman
in February 2007, would expect that all non-executive
directors except for Stephen Dickinson and Robert Hiscox
will be independent on the strict A.3.1 criteria. The board therefore concluded that it included four
independent non-executive directors throughout the year
under review. The independent directors therefore
comprised one half of the board for the full year, and are
greater in number than any other ‘group’ of directors.
Following the AGM in February 2007, and the expected
appointment of a further independent non-executive, there
will be ﬁve independent directors including the chairman.
Retirement by Rotation and Re-election 
Although board members have been required to stand 
for re-election at intervals of no more than three years 
for several years now, the board believes it is important 
to maintain stability and continuity for longer periods.
Principally, this is due to the long term nature of the
group’s core businesses. The process of purchasing land,
negotiating planning and then subsequent development

48 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
The board itself is in the best position to assess independence, given their knowledge and experience of working with the
individuals themselves as professionals. The board has therefore, after due diligence and careful consideration, assessed
the independence of the non-executives as follows:
Director Board’s determination Explanatory notes
Robert Dickinson Not independent • close family ties
(Chairman) • more than nine years’ service
Stephen Dickinson Not independent • close family ties
(Deputy Chairman) • more than nine years’ service
• previously managing director
• part-time executive responsibilities
• participation in all-employee share scheme
Robin Broadhurst Independent • although previously European chairman at Jones Lang LaSalle, 
who have valued some of Grainger’s German properties, there is 
no material business relationship under A.3.1
• regarded as independent by search consultants used for 
his appointment
Robert R S Hiscox Independent • although a trustee for an Estate holding a material shareholding, 
the board is of the opinion that this position does not interfere with
or inﬂuence his character or judgement in any way. As chairman of
Hiscox plc, and past deputy chairman of Lloyds, Mr Hiscox brings
extensive skills and experience in his own right, which can only be
beneﬁcial to Grainger’s board
• the Estate has reduced its shareholding over the past two years, 
from 12.5m shares to 9.5m (10.1% to 7.3%)
John Barnsley Independent • John Barnsley was not connected with any service provided to
Grainger, whilst a partner at PwC, the group’s auditors. It is now
almost ﬁve years since Mr Barnsley left PwC

considers itself fortunate to have retained the services 
of several long-standing directors for extended periods.
Along with those directors retiring by rotation, the deputy
chairman will stand for re-election again this year, having
passed the age of 70. As described above, whilst he is
willing and able, the board considers itself fortunate to
beneﬁt from his continued services.
Induction, Evaluation and Training
During the year, there were no new appointments to 
the board, so no tailored induction has been undertaken.
Upon appointment to the board, a director would expect
to receive an introduction to the group via meetings with
all senior management and also a ‘bible’, divided into
digestible chapters, of policies and procedures of the
board, committees and the operating business.
The evaluation this year, built on the experience gained 
last year, was considered to have been very successful,
with a number of outcomes being acted upon.
Further to last year, the written questionnaire was
extended to be two dimensional, asking all board members
to rate how important they thought various characteristics
were, as well as how good they thought that the board/
committees are at those things. The result was a matrix
ensuring that the board acted upon any items considered
essential, but where performance could be improved. This
part of the process resulted in an effective self-assessment
of the board as a whole and the committees.
Given the upcoming handover of the chairmanship, 
the chairman and the chairman-elect together formally
interviewed each director, with an agenda of items
covering board, committee and individual director
evaluation. Results of the individual meetings are held only
by the chairman and company secretary so that directors
are encouraged to be open and free with their views.
Certain topics for discussion were particularly tabled 
due to their being of particular importance to Grainger
currently or imminently.
As the timing for the evaluation process is towards the end
of the ﬁnancial year, and the chairman’s retirement had
already been announced, it was felt that it was not necessary
or appropriate to evaluate the chairman this year.
Feedback from the process was discussed by the board 
as a whole at a meeting speciﬁcally held for the purpose.
There were no comments regarding individuals required 
to be made, which would have been made directly by 
the chairman to the individual concerned.
The board is provided with technical updates relating to
the property industry and the listed company regime, as
appropriate. In particular this year, the board has been
regularly updated on the upcoming REIT regime.
Should the need for any further training be identiﬁed, this
would be provided to directors on appointment or thereafter.
Relations with Shareholders and Potential Investors
The chief executive and deputy chief executive/ﬁnance
director meet regularly with institutional shareholders and
analysts. In addition to the usual meetings after results
announcements, ad hoc meetings are arranged to continue
dialogue throughout the year. In particular, during the year
under review, the group’s chief executive and deputy chief
executive/ﬁnance director have, between them, conducted
almost 100 meetings with shareholders, potential investors
and analysts. Further, the executives also presented at The
Credit Suisse Annual Real Estate Conference held in New
York, and gave one-to-one presentations at the Morgan
Stanley 9th Annual European Property Conference. They
also participated in roadshows in Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
Paris, Munich and Frankfurt, as well as in the UK. Feedback
gathered by the group’s broker and ﬁnancial PR agent
following such meetings and presentations is always
presented to the board as a whole and the board is briefed
on the views of major shareholders. Further, non-executive
directors are available for meetings with the same, although
there have been no requests for such meetings in the year
under review, or since the year end. 
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is the primary route
for communication with smaller/private shareholders,
although the group’s website also includes a speciﬁc
Investor Relations section. All directors attend the AGM,
and the chairmen of all committees are available to answer
questions. The notice of meeting and annual report and
accounts are sent out at least 20 working days before 
the meeting. Separate votes are held for each proposed
resolution, including the approval of the remuneration 50 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
committee report, and a proxy count is given in each case
after the voting on a show of hands. At the AGM in March
2006, Grainger included a ‘vote withheld’ category for the
second year, in line with best practice. Shareholders were
also able to lodge their votes through the CREST system.
Internal Control
The group has a cyclical process for identifying, assessing
and managing its signiﬁcant risks, which has been in place
for the full year under review. The process is designed 
to enable the board to be conﬁdent that such risks are
mitigated, or controlled as far as possible. It should be
noted, however, that no system can eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives entirely and can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss. The audit committee is
delegated the task of reviewing all identiﬁed risks, with the
absolute key risks retained for full board review. Risks and
controls are reviewed to ensure effective management of
appropriate strategic, ﬁnancial, operational and compliance
issues. The audit committee also reviews the half year and
full year ﬁnancial statements and holds discussions with
the group’s auditors. In addition, the group has an internal
audit function which performs relevant reviews as part of 
a programme approved by the audit committee. During
the year, Grainger also employed KPMG to perform
internal audit work on the German operations, ensuring
that the work was done by suitably qualiﬁed individuals.
The committee considers any issues or risks arising from
internal audit in order that appropriate actions can be
undertaken for their satisfactory resolution. The internal
audit manager has a direct reporting line to the chairman
of the audit committee.
An annual budget is produced, together with longer-term
projections, which are presented to the board for approval.
At each meeting the board discusses progress against the
budget and monitors any variances. Where applicable,
revisions are made to expected outturn against which
further progress can be monitored.
The board also discusses in detail the projected ﬁnancial
impact of major proposed acquisitions and disposals,
including their ﬁnancing. All such proposed substantial
investments are considered by all directors. Where
meetings are required between board meetings and a full
complement of directors cannot be achieved, an executive
committee of directors considers the necessary formalities.
The board is also responsible for the discussion and approval
of the group’s treasury strategy, including mitigation
against changes in interest rates. 
Going Concern
After making enquiries, including the review of future
anticipated cash ﬂows and banking covenants, the directors
have a reasonable expectation that the group and company
have adequate resources to continue in existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Compliance Statement
Independence of non-executive directors is explained in
detail above. In the board’s view it is their assessment 
of independence which determines compliance with the
Code and therefore no non-compliance on grounds of
independence has been recorded.
Except as noted below, the board considers that it 
has complied with the Code throughout the year ended
30 September 2006:
B.1.6 As explained in detail in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report, Rupert Dickinson and Andrew Cunningham
currently hold service contracts with notice periods
in excess of one year. The notice periods are being
reduced from two years to one year on a straight-
line basis over a period of ﬁve years from 1 October
2002. At the date of this report the notice period
outstanding stood at approximately 14 months.
Report of the Nomination Committee
The nomination committee consists of the chairman 
and two non-executive directors. It met once formally
during the year, and informally on other occasions. 
The attendance of individual directors, who all served
throughout the year under review, are shown overleaf:

The terms of reference of the nomination committee are
available on the group’s website and principally relate to
ﬁlling vacancies on the board, whether arising through
resignation, retirement or desired expansion and also
consideration of succession planning.
During the year, the committee started to consider the
appointment of an independent non-executive director, to
follow the resignation of the chairman. The nomination
committee ﬁrst discussed with the board the desirable
background and experience of a new non-executive, 
and then approached an agency with this information. 
The process is ongoing.
The nomination committee is also responsible for reviewing
the desirability of the continuation of service of directors
required to retire by rotation. In this regard, each of the
directors required to retire by rotation this year has
continued to demonstrate full, capable and committed
participation in setting and monitoring strategy for the
group. Details of those directors standing for re-election 
at the February 2007 Annual General Meeting are given 
in the Notice of Meeting which accompanies this report,
with biographies on page 45.
Report of the Audit Committee
The audit committee meets four times each year, ahead 
of each board meeting, reporting any relevant matters to
the board where ﬁt. Attendance of the individual directors,
who all served on the committee throughout the year, 
is shown below. In the opinion of the directors, the audit
committee comprised three independent non-executive
directors throughout the period, and Mr Barnsley has the
particular recent, relevant ﬁnancial experience required by
the Code.

The audit committee adheres to particularly strict and
detailed terms of reference, which are available for
inspection on the group’s website. In addition to the work
described within the ‘Internal Control’ section of the main
report above, the audit committee is also responsible for
reviewing the independence of the external auditor, which
includes the approval of any non-audit service fees above a
relatively nominal level. The audit committee is responsible
for the appointment of the external auditor and for
agreeing the audit fee.
The deputy chief executive/ﬁnance director and external
audit partner as well as other senior management are
invited to attend meetings of the committee. Once each
year the audit committee meet with management without
the auditors present and also with the auditors without
management present.

at the three remuneration committee meetings held during
the year were as follows:

In the opinion of the directors, the committee therefore
comprised three independent non-executives throughout
the year. Certain shareholder pressure groups raised
concerns that Mr Hiscox, as trustee of an estate containing
a material shareholding, should not be regarded as
independent. The board maintains their view that
Mr Hiscox is independent and a valued contributor 
to the remuneration committee. 
This year, the committee continued to receive advice from
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (‘NBSC’). As well as
providing information regarding the competitiveness of
overall packages for the executive directors, NBSC also
advised on the group’s incentive schemes. In particular,
speciﬁc guidance has been given on the changes to the
long term incentive plan for senior executives, which 
is further described later in the report. 
The committee has also had access to advice from the
group’s HR Manager, who is invited to attend
remuneration committee meetings when appropriate.
The committee’s terms of reference are available on the
group’s website.
Remuneration Policy
Grainger’s remuneration policy is designed to attract,
motivate and retain high calibre individuals to enable the
group to operate strategically for the continued beneﬁt of
shareholders, over the long term. In order to operate this
policy, the Remuneration Committee receives information
on remuneration packages awarded to directors in the
most comparable organisations and aims to ensure that
the rewards paid by Grainger are competitive.
The policy is also designed to align directors’ interests 
with those of shareholders. This is principally achieved
through the use of share-based incentives and by
encouraging executive directors to maintain a reasonable
shareholding in the group. As a guideline, executive directors
(and senior executives) are expected to hold the equivalent
value of at least one year’s salary in Grainger shares. Details
of executive directors’ shareholdings are shown on page 59.
Share awards are generally satisﬁed by the acquisition of
shares in the market, so are not dilutive to shareholders.
Share options are satisﬁed by the issue of new share capital.
Remuneration packages balance both short and long-
term rewards, as well as performance related pay and 
non-performance related. They include salary, bonus and
deﬁned contribution pension elements as well as long-
term share incentive and option schemes. Usual beneﬁts
are also afforded.
No executive director is involved in the determination of 
his own remuneration. Fees of the non-executive directors,
which include increments where a committee chairmanship
are held, are determined by the board as a whole.
The salaries and bonuses of senior management are
determined by the executive directors and reported to the
remuneration committee. Senior management also participate
in long term incentive scheme arrangements described
below. Usual beneﬁts are also afforded to these individuals.
In this context, senior management are those employees
who are members of the Leadership & Strategy Group,
which was formed in the year (see page 30). In addition to
this, speciﬁc bonus schemes were negotiated with certain
key senior management during the year, based on their
speciﬁc business areas, in order to drive performance.
Report of the Remuneration Committee and Directors’ Remuneration Report 53
Apart from salary and beneﬁts in relation to the notice
period described above, there are no other terms in any 
of the contracts which would give rise to compensation
payable for early termination, or any other liability of 
the company.
Each non-executive director has speciﬁc terms of reference.
Their letters of appointment state an initial one-year
period, with a continuation subject to review at that time.
The letters of appointment contain no entitlement to
compensation for early termination.
Other Directorships
On 2 August 2006, Rupert Dickinson joined Workspace
Group plc as a non-executive director. Grainger’s board
were satisﬁed that the appointment would be of mutual
beneﬁt, with Rupert gaining invaluable experience of
another plc. The associated non-executive fees are 
payable to Grainger.
Non-Performance Related Remuneration
Basic Salaries and Beneﬁts
Basic salaries are reviewed by the remuneration committee
annually. Uplifts are by reference to cost of living,
responsibilities and market rates, as for all employees and
are performed at the same time of year. Executive directors
and the deputy chairman, Stephen Dickinson, who has
part-time executive responsibilities, along with other senior
members of staff, receive a fully expensed company car, 
or a car allowance. All members of staff, including the
executive directors, beneﬁt from health and life insurances.
The chairman’s and non-executive directors’ fees are
reviewed on a biennial basis by the whole board. 
Pensions
The group contributes 15% of basic salary to the money
purchase pension schemes of Rupert Dickinson and
Andrew Cunningham. No other elements of remuneration
are pensionable.
The remuneration committee also reviews the total level of salaries and bonuses paid to the group as a whole. 
This includes reviewing the details of any employee earning over £50,000 or earning a bonus in excess of £5,000.
Service Contracts
As explained in prior years, Rupert Dickinson and Andrew Cunningham each hold service contracts with notice periods
decreasing on a straight-line basis from two years to one year, over a period of ﬁve years which began on 1 October 2002.
At the date of this report, therefore, the notice periods have been reduced to approximately 14 months. 
Contract dates and unexpired terms for the directors are as follows:
Contract date Unexpired term* Notice period
Rupert Dickinson 19 July 1996 No ﬁxed term 14 months
Andrew Cunningham 26 July 2000 No ﬁxed term 14 months
Robert Dickinson 17 July 1998 10 months** None
Stephen Dickinson 28 February 2000 5 months None
Robin Broadhurst 26 February 2004 5 months None
John Barnsley 27 February 2003 5 months None
Robert Hiscox 6 March 2002 5 months None
Bill Tudor John 24 February 2005 5 months None
*Calculated as at 30 September 2006 and rounded to the nearest whole month.
**Note that as Robert Dickinson is retiring at the forthcoming AGM he will only serve ﬁve months from 30 September 2006. Share Schemes open to all Employees
Executive directors, and Stephen Dickinson, deputy
chairman, are eligible to participate in two share schemes
which are open to all employees with relevant service,
subject to the rules of the schemes.
The ﬁrst is a Save as you Earn scheme (SAYE), and the
second a Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Both are Inland Revenue
approved and therefore subject to the limits prescribed.
Amounts relating to directors’ participation in the SIP 
and share options under the SAYE scheme are shown 
on pages 56 and 57. 
Performance Related Remuneration
As should be expected, a signiﬁcant element of executive
directors’ and senior management’s potential remuneration
is performance related. The combination of short and 
long term incentives attempt to align the interests of
executives and senior management with the interests 
of shareholders, and to reward signiﬁcant outperformance
of budgeted expectations.
Non-executive directors do not receive performance related
remuneration.
Annual Discretionary Bonus
Each year, the remuneration committee considers the
award of a bonus to the executive directors, which 
is at their ultimate discretion. The chief and deputy 
chief executive ofﬁcers, Rupert Dickinson and Andrew
Cunningham participate in an arrangement introduced 
in 2003 whereby the provisional bonus is calculated over 
a three-year period, by reference to the enhancement 
of the triple net asset value of Grainger, relative to a
theoretical market comparator. The comparator movement
is calculated with regard to the Nationwide and Halifax
house price indices and also interest rates, using ﬁve-
year swap rates. Bonuses remain capped at 150% of 
salary which would only be achieved under exceptional
performance conditions. Subject always to the committee’s
discretion, one-third of the calculated amount is approved
for payment and the provisional balance is taken into
account over the next two years. The award payable for
the year ended 30 September 2006 represents 90% of
salary for that year (2005: 63%). 
Long Term Incentives
Grainger’s policy in relation to long term incentive schemes
has evolved over time to more closely align the long term
interests of executives and senior management with those
of shareholders, to reward sustained performance over 
a number of ﬁnancial years and to encourage these
employees to grow their shareholdings.
In order to maintain best practice and more closely align
performance with reward, a proposal is being made to
shareholders, to adopt a new Long Term Incentive Scheme
(LTIS). A resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM
in February 2007.
Proposed Long Term Incentive Scheme
It has been recognised that the Grainger business is
somewhat unique and as such it has become increasingly
difﬁcult to ﬁnd a meaningful comparator group. For this
principal reason, a new LTIS has been proposed, and major
shareholders have been consulted on its proposed operation.
The main elements of the proposal are as follows:
• Two-thirds of the award will be based upon the increase
in NNNAV above WACC over a three-year period. The
remaining third will be based upon the absolute increase
in TSR, again over a three-year period. In each case,
minimum thresholds must be achieved and a prorate
award is made between that level and a preset top level,
above which the entire conditional award would vest.
• The maximum award will, in normal circumstances, be
made up to 150% of relevant salary, though may be
made up to 200% in exceptional circumstances.
• Participants may also purchase or pledge existing shares
worth up to 30% of their relevant salary and receive a
matching award of an equivalent size, depending on the
same performance criteria.
• The remuneration committee retain the ability to award
up to £30,000 of approved share options to
participants.
Full details of the proposed LTIS are included in the Notice
of Meeting which accompanies this report.

Report of the Remuneration Committee and Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 55
Existing Long Term Incentive Scheme
In the year under review, awards were made to executive
directors and senior management under the existing LTIS.
In those schemes, participants are eligible to receive annual
conditional awards of shares worth up to 50% of salary
under the Long Term Incentive Scheme and of share
options up to a maximum of 125% of salary under the
Executive Share Option Scheme. The awards under both
schemes become unconditional provided challenging
performance criteria are satisﬁed over a single three-year
performance period following grant. The criteria for all
awards granted since March 2002 have been based on
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) – dependent upon where
Grainger’s TSR lies with respect to a predetermined
comparator group as follows:
Performance Vesting 
condition of option
If Grainger’s TSR is equal to or 
greater than the upper quartile 
TSR of the comparator companies 100%
If Grainger’s TSR is equal 
to the median TSR of the 
comparator companies 40%
If Grainger’s TSR is above the 
median but below the upper 
quartile TSR of the comparator 
companies Pro-rata vesting
If Grainger’s TSR is below the 
median TSR of the comparator 
companies 0%
As shown in the table above, no award vests unless
Grainger’s TSR is at least equal to the median TSR of the
comparator group.
It should be noted that during its period of operation, 
it has been necessary to change the comparator group 
due to companies being taken over. The comparator group
for the awards made in January 2006 comprised A & J
Mucklow Group plc, Big Yellow Group plc, Brixton plc,
Capital and Regional plc, CLS Holdings plc, Daejan
Holdings plc, Derwent Valley Holdings plc, Freeport plc,
Great Portland Estates plc, Helical Bar plc, London
Merchant Securities plc, Mapeley Limited, Minerva plc,
Quintain Estates and Development plc, Shaftesbury plc, 
St Mowden Properties plc, The Unite Group plc, Warner
Estate Holdings plc and Workspace Group plc.

Directors’ Interests in Signiﬁcant Contracts
No directors were materially interested in any contract 
of signiﬁcance.
Insurance of Directors
The group maintains insurance for Grainger Trust plc’s
directors in respect of their duties as directors.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are required by UK Company law to prepare
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a
true and fair view of the affairs of the company and the
group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt
or loss for that period and comply with the Companies 
Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that applicable
accounting standards have been followed and that suitable
accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by
reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates, have
been used in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 30 September 2006. 
The directors must also prepare the ﬁnancial statements 
on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the company and the group will continue 
in business.
The directors conﬁrm that they have complied with the
above requirements in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the ﬁnancial position of the company and the
group. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the company and of the group, and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection
of fraud and other irregularities.
Creditor Payment Policy
It is the group’s policy to pay suppliers in accordance with
their normal terms and conditions of trading. Payment in
respect of the purchase of property is subject to and will
comply with contractual terms. Trade creditors existing at
30 September 2006 relating to purchases of property stock
generally complete 28 days after exchange of contracts.
Trade creditor days relating to other trade creditors of 
the company and group were calculated as 30 days 
(2005: 30 days).
Financial Risk Management
Details of this are included in note 21 to the ﬁnancial
statements.
Charitable Donations
During the year the group made charitable donations
amounting to £58,747 (2005: £42,234). Details are
provided on page 40.
Health and Safety
The company seeks to achieve the highest standards 
in respect of health and safety of employees, and the
safety of tenants. Consultants are employed to ensure 
that the company complies with health and safety
regulations and each year the gas supply and appliances
within all of the group’s relevant residential properties are
independently inspected under the Gas Safety (Installation
and Use) Amended Regulations 1996 and certiﬁcates of
compliance issued. The group employs a full-time health
and safety manager.
Directors’ report continued 61
Employment of Disabled Persons
The company gives full and fair consideration to
applications for employment made by disabled persons,
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. 
In the event of an employee becoming disabled every
effort is made to ensure that their employment within 
the company continues and that appropriate training is
arranged where necessary. It is the policy of the company
that the training, career development and promotion of
disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical 
to that of other employees.
Employee Involvement
The group places considerable value on the involvement 
of its employees and has continued its practice of keeping
them informed on matters affecting them as employees,
for example, eligibility to join company share schemes, 
and on the various factors affecting the performance of
the group. Communication is made using the intranet,
‘The Source’, and through regular meetings with, and
presentations by senior management.
Auditors
So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditors are unaware.
Each director has taken all steps that he ought to have
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the
company’s auditors are aware of that information.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have expressed their
willingness to continue in ofﬁce as auditors to the
company and group. A resolution to reappoint them 
as auditors to the company will be proposed at the 
next Annual General Meeting. 
Shares
As disclosed in Note 28 to the ﬁnancial statements, 
the company issued 551,088 5p Ordinary Shares for 
an aggregate consideration of £960,083 in the year under
various employee share schemes. As at 30 September
2006, the directors had unexpired power to repurchase 
up to 19,411,990 shares.
Post Balance Sheet Events 
Since the year end, Grainger has announced ﬁrst closing 
of G:res 1, its market let fund, made an offer for a
company containing some 900 retirement homes, signed 
a development agreement relating to a 10 acre site in
Birmingham and made a €32m portfolio acquisition in
Germany. We have also arranged a €150m facility with
EuroHypo AG and restructured the group’s core debt.
See note 36 to the ﬁnancial statements for further details.

Company Secretary
22 December 2006 62 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
We have audited the group ﬁnancial statements of
Grainger Trust plc for the year ended 30 September 2006
which comprise the consolidated income statement, 
the consolidated statement of recognised income and
expense, the consolidated balance sheet, the statement 
of consolidated cash ﬂows and the related notes. These
group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company
ﬁnancial statements of Grainger Trust plc for the year
ended 30 September 2006 and on the information in 
the Report of the Remuneration Committee and Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been
audited.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual
Report and the group ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are
set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
included within the Directors’ report.
Our responsibility is to audit the group ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has
been prepared for and only for the company’s members as
a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies
Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group
ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether
the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4
of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in
our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report 
is consistent with the group ﬁnancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have
not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law
regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions 
is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance report
reﬂects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions
of the Combined Code (2003) speciﬁed for our review by
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and 
we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness
of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk
and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual 
Report and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited group ﬁnancial statements. The other information
comprises only the chairman’s statement, the chief
executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the Corporate
governance report, the Directors’ report, the corporate
social responsibility report and the unaudited part of 
the Report of the Remuneration Committee and Directors’
Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the group ﬁnancial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
The maintenance and integrity of the Grainger Trust plc
website is the responsibility of the directors; the work
carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration
of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to
the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially presented
on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Grainger Trust plc 63
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the group ﬁnancial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the
group ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the group ﬁnancial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy 
of the presentation of information in the group 
ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union, of the state of the group’s affairs 
as at 30 September 2006 and of its proﬁt and 
cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
• the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is
consistent with the group ﬁnancial statements.

1 Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of preparation
Grainger Trust plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The group ﬁnancial statements consolidate those 
of the company and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the ‘group’, and equity account the group’s interests in joint
ventures and associates. The Parent Company ﬁnancial statements present information about the company and not about
its group.
The group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The company has elected to prepare its company ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with UK GAAP. These are presented on pages 127 to 132.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented 
in the group ﬁnancial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet as at 1 October 2004 for the purposes
of transition to IFRS. The principal exception is that, as more fully explained in note (m) below, ﬁnancial instruments are
accounted for on different bases in the current year and the comparative year owing to the transitional provisions of IAS
32 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets
and liabilities which are stated at their fair value; investment property, derivative ﬁnancial instruments and investments.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expenses. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the events and amounts involved,
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Transition to IFRS
The group is preparing its ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS for the ﬁrst time and, consequently, has applied
IFRS 1. An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported ﬁnancial position and the ﬁnancial
performance of the group is provided in note 38 to the ﬁnancial statements. IFRS 1 contains certain exemptions, both
mandatory and optional, to assist the transition to IFRS. The group has utilised these exemptions as follows:
i) Business combinations exemption – The group has applied the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 allowing 
it not to restate business combinations that took place prior to the 1 October 2004 transition date.
ii) Share-based payment transactions exemption – The group has applied this exemption and has therefore applied 
IFRS 2 to all grants of shares and share options made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
iii) Exemption from restatement of comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39 – The group has applied this exemption thereby
allowing it to present comparative information that does not comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39. Accordingly, the
adjustments required for differences between UK GAAP and IAS 32 and IAS 39 are recognised in the opening balance
sheet as at 1 October 2005.
iv) Employee beneﬁts – In accordance with IFRS 1 the group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses 
in full at the date of transition. Accordingly, the deﬁcit in the BPT Retirement Beneﬁts pension scheme as at 1 October
2004 has been taken through reserves. The group has applied the amendment to IAS 19 with effect from 1 October
2004 allowing it to report all actuarial gains or losses in full in the period in which they were incurred through the
statement of recognised income and expense.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 70 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
1 Accounting Policies continued
(b) Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purposes entities) over which the group has the power to govern the
ﬁnancial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. 
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when
assessing whether the group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control
is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from the date control ceases.
ii) Goodwill and impairment
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group. The cost 
of the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued plus the costs directly
attributable to the acquisition. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the
excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of net identiﬁable assets, including
intangible assets of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures 
and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for
impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For details of the impairment review performed 
in 2006, see note 22. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating 
to the entity sold.
iii) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Associates are all entities over which the group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but not control, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investment in joint ventures and associates are
accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The group’s investment in 
joint ventures and associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identiﬁed on acquisition.
The group’s share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ post-acquisition proﬁts or losses is recognised in the income
statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-
acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.

(c) Segmental reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable group of assets and operations, reﬂected in the way that the group manages 
its business, that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The group has identiﬁed six such segments as follows:
• UK Core portfolio – Regulated tenancies
• UK Market-Rented Properties 
• Equity Release
• UK Development
• European Tenanted Residential
• European Development.
More detail is given relating to each of the above segments in the chief executive’s review on pages 20 to 29 and in note 3. 
(d) Foreign currency translation
i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated ﬁnancial
statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the company’s functional and presentation currency.
ii) Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at
the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions are recognised in the income statement.
iii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation,
are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of foreign
operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the relevant period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the
translation reserve. 72 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
1 Accounting Policies continued
(e) Investment property
Property that is held for long term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the
companies in the consolidated group, is classiﬁed as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value. Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, 
if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the speciﬁed asset. If this information is not available,
the group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash ﬂow
projections. 
A structured sample of in-house valuations is reviewed annually by external valuers who have an appropriate recognised
professional qualiﬁcation and who have recent experience of the location and type of the property being valued.
Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of the property when it is probable that future economic
beneﬁt associated with the item will ﬂow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs
and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial period in which they are incurred. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the group’s investment properties are included in the income
statement of the period in which they arise.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when
it is probable that the future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the group and the cost of the item
can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the
ﬁnancial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method 
to allocate their cost less residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Land Nil
Fixtures, ﬁttings and equipment Five years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued 73
1 Accounting Policies continued
(g) Inventories – trading properties
Tenanted residential properties held for sale in the normal course of business are shown in the ﬁnancial statements at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes legal and surveying charges incurred during acquisition together
with improvement costs. Net realisable value is the net sale proceeds which the group expects on sale of a property with
vacant possession.
Land and property held within the development’s segment of the business, including house-building sites, are shown in 
the ﬁnancial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents the acquisition price including legal
and other professional costs associated with the acquisition together with subsequent development cost net of amounts
transferred to costs of sale. Net realisable value is the current market value which the group expects to receive on sale net
of associated selling costs.
(h) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
(i) Income tax
Income tax on the proﬁt for the periods presented comprises both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected
tax payable on the taxable income for the year using rates applicable at the balance sheet date. Tax payable upon the
realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the
associated deferred taxation.
Deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method. Provision is made for temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the values used for tax
purposes. Deferred income tax is calculated after taking account of any indexation allowances and capital losses. The
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities and is calculated using rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date in the tax
jurisdiction in which the temporary differences arise.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available
against which the assets can be used. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset if there is a legally
enforceable right of set off. 74 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
1 Accounting Policies continued
(j) Employee beneﬁts
i) Deﬁned contribution pension scheme
Obligations for contributions to deﬁned contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income
statement in the period to which they relate.
ii) Deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme
The group currently contributes to a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme that was closed to new members and employee
contributions in 2003. The full deﬁcit in the scheme was recognised in the balance sheet as at 1 October 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years. However, the valuation is updated annually
by a qualiﬁed actuary for the purpose of determining the amounts to be reﬂected in the group’s ﬁnancial
statements under IAS 19.
There are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and employee contributions.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities and the expected return on pension scheme assets will be reﬂected in the
income statement each year. Actuarial gains and losses will be reﬂected in the consolidated statement of
recognised income and expense each year.
iii) Share-based compensation 
The group operate an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a Long Term
Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and a Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’). The fair value of the employee services received
in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding
increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is spread over the vesting period during which the employees
become unconditionally entitled to the shares and options. This excludes the impact of any non-market vesting
conditions which are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become
exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to become exercisable. 
Awards under the LTIS are fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model and under SAYE using a Black 
Scholes model.
When options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited 
to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued 75
1 Accounting Policies continued
(k) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is stated net of sales taxes and value
added taxes. Revenue is recognised as follows:
i) Rental and similar income
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term on an accruals basis. 
ii) Service charge and similar income
Service charge and management charge income is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are
rendered. The group acts as principal in the operation of service charge accounts and therefore gross income received
is recorded as revenue.
Other income is accounted for as follows:
i) Proﬁt or loss on property sales
Proﬁts or losses arising from the sale of investment and trading properties (including development properties) are
included in the income statement of the group where contract completion has taken place. Proﬁts or losses arising
from the sale of trading and investment properties are calculated by reference to their carrying value and are included
in operating proﬁt.
ii) Income from investments
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have 
been established.
(l) Leases
i) Group as lessor
The net present value of ground rents receivable is, in the opinion of the directors, immaterial. Accordingly, 
ground rents receivable are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Properties leased out to tenants are included in the balance sheet as either investment property or as trading 
property under inventories. 
ii) Group as lessee
The group occupies a number of its ofﬁces as a lessee. After a review of all of its occupational leases, the directors
have concluded that all such leases are operating leases. Payments, including prepayments, made under operating
leases (net of any incentives received from lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the period of the lease.
The net present value of ground rents payable is, in the opinion of the directors, immaterial. Accordingly, ground rent
expenses are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  76 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
1 Accounting Policies continued
(m) Financial instruments 
(Under UK GAAP from 1 October 2004 until 30 September 2005)
i) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements. The group does 
not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or 
a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a ﬁxed rate to a variable 
rate or vice-versa. Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over 
the periods of the contracts.
If an investment ceases to be a hedge, for example, because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, 
the instrument is marked to market and any resulting proﬁt or loss recognised at that time.
ii) Loan issue costs
Costs incurred in raising loan ﬁnance are capitalised and set off against the outstanding debt in the balance sheet. 
The costs are charged to the proﬁt and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the facility.
iii) Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provisions for permanent diminution in value.
Financial instruments
(Under IFRS from1 October 2005)
Derivatives
The group uses derivative instruments to help manage its interest rate risk. In accordance with its treasury policy, 
the group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The derivatives are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is
recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for cash ﬂow hedge accounting in which
case any gain or loss is taken to equity in a cash ﬂow hedge reserve. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the 
item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The group is also required to document the relationship between the
hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction
is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the
cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. 77
1 Accounting Policies continued
Fair value estimation
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on a discounted cash ﬂow model using quoted market information. 
Derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
Derecognition is the point at which the group removes an asset or liability from its balance sheet. The group’s policy is to
derecognise ﬁnancial assets only when the contractual right to the cash ﬂows from the ﬁnancial asset expires. The group
also derecognises ﬁnancial assets that it transfers to another party, provided the transfer of the assets also transfers the
right to receive cash ﬂows from the ﬁnancial asset. When the transfer does not result in the group transferring the right 
to receive the cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset but it does result in the group assuming a corresponding obligation to 
pay the cash ﬂows to another recipient, the ﬁnancial asset is derecognised.
The group derecognises ﬁnancial liabilities only when its obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
At fair value through proﬁt or loss ﬁnancial assets
At fair value through proﬁt or loss ﬁnancial assets represents the group’s holding of units in the Schroder Residential
Property Unit Trust. They are included in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value taken through the
income statement. These units have been designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss as they are managed and their
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the group’s documented investment policy. The group
adopts the valuation provided by the fund manager as long as the valuation method adopted does not differ materially
from group valuation methods.
(n) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) 
and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings are classiﬁed as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability
for at least 12-months after the balance sheet date.
(o) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment in trade receivables is established when there is objective
evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due. The amount of the provision is the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the effective interest rate. 
The movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
(p) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a) the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and b) it is probable that
an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligation. 78 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
1 Accounting Policies continued
(q) Dividends
Dividend distributions to the company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the group ﬁnancial statements in the
period in which the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders.
(r) Assets held for sale
Where a group of assets are to be disposed of by sale together as a single group, they are classiﬁed as a disposal group.
The disposal group is classiﬁed as held for sale as deﬁned by IFRS 5 when they are available for sale in their present
condition and the sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classiﬁcation.
Non-current assets held for sale within a disposal group are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell.
(s) Investment in own shares
The group acquires its own shares through the Grainger Trust Employee Trustee Company Limited. The shares are held 
to enable the company to meet its obligations under the LTIS. The acquisition cost of shares is debited to an investment 
in own shares reserve within retained earnings. When shares are issued to employees under the LTIS, a transfer is made at
the average cost of the shares issued between the investment in own shares reserve and the share-based payments reserve
all within retained earnings (see note 29).
(t) Standards and Interpretations issued but not applied
At the date of approval of these ﬁnancial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been
applied in these ﬁnancial statements, were issued but the application was not yet mandatory for the period:
IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’
IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’
IFRIC 5 ‘Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds‘
IFRIC 7 ‘Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinﬂationary Economies‘
IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’
IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’
IFRIC 10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’
IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’
IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’
The directors anticipate that, with the exception of the additional ﬁnancial instrument disclosures required by IFRS 7 
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have 
no material impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the group.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued 79
2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
Those estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets
and liabilities are shown below:
Investment property valuations
The group uses the valuations performed by its own in-house surveying team to value the core regulated portfolio. 
A structured sample of these valuations is checked by external independent valuers. Investment property in the JPUT and
in Germany has been valued by external independent valuers. In the UK, the majority of the portfolio is invested in the
type of properties where demand is high. Accordingly, the valuers generally have good information on current market
prices for properties similar to our own. Valuers also make reference to discounted cash ﬂow projections based upon
estimates of future rental income, anticipated property expenses and an appropriate discount rate.
Trading property valuations
The group’s residential trading properties are carried in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
In assessing net realisable value, the group uses valuations performed by its own in-house surveying team. A structured
sample of these valuations is subjected to checks by an external independent valuer and where the valuations initially
differ, agreement is reached after further discussion. As with investment properties, the valuers generally have good
information on current market prices for properties similar to our own.
Development trading properties are carried in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. All properties
in the portfolio have been valued by an external independent valuer with the exception of short term housebuilding sites
and assets pre-sold prior to practical completion. Provision is made on a project-by-project basis to reduce cost to net
realisbale value to the extent that the total projected costs exceed total projected revenues.
Market valuation of regulated residential property assets
The group values its regulated residential property assets for market value purposes by deducting a discount from the
vacant possession value. This discount takes account of the fact that the rental yield is generally below market rates and
that it may be some years before we obtain vacant possession value and can then sell the property. Over time, this
discount has narrowed, although for the last few years we have used a rate of 27.5%. Strong market and transaction
activity has led us to believe that this discount is conservative and our valuers have now certiﬁed the valuation of these
properties at 77.5% of vacant possession value, a discount of 22.5%. This realignment has produced an increase in 
market value at the year end of £67m. 
Distinction between investment and trading properties
The group considers the intention at the outset for each property acquired in order to classify the property as either 
an investment property or a trading property. Where the intention is either to trade the property or to hold it during its
normal life cycle and to sell it upon receiving vacant possession, the property is classiﬁed as a trading property. Where 
the intention is to hold the asset for its long term rental yield and/or capital appreciation, the property is classiﬁed as 
an investment property. Where the intention for a property changes, the property is reclassiﬁed accordingly.
Income taxes
There are some transactions and calculations that involve a degree of estimation and judgement and whose tax treatment
can not be ﬁnally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities. In such cases,
the group’s policy is to be prudent and conservative in its assessment of the tax beneﬁt that may accrue in line with the
contingent asset rules set out in IAS 37. Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially
recorded, such differences will impact on the income and deferred tax amounts reﬂected in subsequent accounting periods. 80 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006

Included within total administrative expenses in 2006 are redundancy costs of £1.5m, abortive deal costs of £1.4m, an
accelerated write off of equity release transaction costs of £1.1m and £0.6m of overhead costs relating to a subsidiary
company SIP Home Limited which has ceased trading since the year end.
Resulting from a review of the allocation of overheads to the various business streams in 2005, the amount disclosed as
administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement shown previously as £9.8m has been reduced to £5.4m. 
The difference has been reallocated to increase property expenses by £2.0m and the carrying value of trading properties
sold by £2.4m. There is no impact on net proﬁt and management consider the revised ﬁgures to be better cost allocations
to the different business areas.

scheme and the fair value movement in cash ﬂow hedges.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The group has not taken all of the beneﬁt in respect of capital losses brought forward and available to offset against
subsequent capital gains arising as this has yet to be formally agreed with the relevant tax authorities. If it is found that 
all the capital losses are available for offset against capital gains, then provisions of up to £23m would be released over
the coming years. 92 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
12 Dividends
Under IAS 10, ﬁnal dividends are excluded from the balance sheet until they are approved by the company in general
meeting. Dividends paid in the year are shown below:
2006 2005
£m £m
Ordinary dividends on equity shares:
Interim paid of 1.87p per share (2005: 1.7p) 2.5 2.2

6.9 6.9
A ﬁnal dividend relating to 2006 of 3.75p per share has been proposed by the board. This will result in a further
distribution of £4.9m. If approved, it will be paid on 6 March 2007 to shareholders on the register on 16 February 2007.
The 2006 interim dividend of 1.87p per share was paid in July 2006. This gives a total dividend for 2006 of 5.62p per
share compared to £5.11p per share in 2005, an increase of 10%.
13 Earnings per share
Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Grainger Trust
Employee Trustee Company Limited to meet its obligations under the LTIS (see note 29).
Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding by the dilutive
effect of ordinary shares that the company may potentially issue relating to its share option schemes and contingent share
awards under its LTIS, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2006 was the end of the
contingency period.

Investment properties in the core-regulated portfolio, with a value of £93.7m, were valued as at 30 September 2006 at
their market value by our in-house chartered surveyors. These valuations were reviewed and approved by the directors. A
structured sample of the in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP, Chartered Surveyors, independently of the group.
Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP concluded that they have a high degree of conﬁdence in all of the valuations.
Investment properties in the JPUT with a value of £210.4m as at 30 September 2006, were valued at their market value by
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited. The JPUT is considered to be a disposal group as at 30 September 2006, and 80% of
the value of its investment properties have been transferred to current assets (£168.3m).
Investment properties in Germany were valued by CB Richard Ellis prior to their acquisition by the group. These valuations
took place between September 2005 and July 2006. The directors consider that these initial values have not changed
materially in the period to 30 September 2006. The value of investment properties in Germany as at 30 September 2006 
is £116.9m.
The historical cost of the group’s investment and development properties as at 30 September 2006, including those held 
as a disposal group under current assets was £370.4m (2005: £214.3m).
The revaluation gain in 2006 of £42.4m shown above has been included in the income statement. However, an accrual 
for fees of £2.5m relating to the cost of raising equity investment in the JPUT has been set against this revaluation gain 
to give a net amount of £39.9m.
The total value of investment property shown in the above table, includes £13.0m (2005: £10.8m) held under long leases. 94 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006

21 Financial risk management and derivative ﬁnancial instruments
(i) Financial risk management
The group is subject to a number of ﬁnancial risks, in particular, interest rate, liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks. 
Interest rate risk – The group does not take trading positions in ﬁnancial instruments but uses them to minimise the 
risk of exposure to ﬂuctuating interest rates. The majority of the group’s debt is subject to protective swaps, caps or collars
or is maintained at ﬁxed rates of interest (see note 23). To protect itself against interest rate risk the group’s treasury policy
is to maintain ﬂoating rate exposure of no greater than 35% of expected borrowings. At 30 September 2006, 66% of the
group’s debt was economically hedged.
Liquidity risk – The group maintains a combination of long term and short term committed facilities that are designed 
to ensure that it has sufﬁcient available funds for ongoing operations and to meet planned future investments. 
Foreign currency risk – The group invests in property acquired in currency other than pounds sterling. In such situations,
the group’s policy is to take out loans in the same currency to act as a natural hedge against currency ﬂuctuations.
Credit risk – The group’s principal ﬁnancial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables. The
group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are shown
net of provisions for impairment (see note 20). Such provisions are made where there is objective evidence that the group
will not be able to collect all amounts due. The group has no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk as its exposure is
spread over a large number of counterparties.
Until 1 July 2006, the group did not meet the strict criteria set out in IAS 39 to enable certain swaps to be treated as
being effective cash ﬂow hedges. Accordingly, all fair value movements on derivatives were taken to the income statement
until 30 June 2006. From 1 July, certain swaps did qualify to be treated as effective cash ﬂow hedges and the movement 
in their fair values to 30 September 2006 has been taken directly through equity.
The proﬁle of the group’s interest rate swaps in existence at 30 September 2006 which were classiﬁed as effective cash
ﬂow hedges at 30 September 2006 was as follows:

All of the ﬁnancial derivatives included in the above tables were valued by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, ﬁnancial risk
consultants, using a discounted cash ﬂow model using quoted market information and were checked internally using a
bespoke software package.
22 Assets held for sale
The sale of 38% of the units in the Jersey Property Unit Trust (JPUT) completed on 21 November 2006. Negotiations are
ongoing with investors and the current expectation is that 80%, in total, of the units will be sold within 12-months of the
balance sheet date. Accordingly, as at 30 September 2006, 80% of the net assets of the JPUT, less an accrual for sales
fees, have been reclassiﬁed as a disposal group under assets held for sale within current assets. The balance is comprised
as follows:
2006
£m
Investment property 168.3
Trade and other receivables 0.2
Cash and cash equivalents 4.5
Trade and other payables (4.7)
168.3
Included within the transfer of assets into the JPUT on 1 December 2005 was £67m of properties that had previously been
classiﬁed as trading stock. On transfer to the JPUT their intended use was changed to them being held for rental yield 
and long term capital appreciation. Accordingly, these properties were re-classiﬁed as investment properties. A one-off
revaluation gain of £23.5m was recognised within net valuation gains on investment properties in the income statement.
Goodwill amounting to £5.8m was written off following the transfer of the properties as they were transferred out of
their respective income generating units resulting in the goodwill being impaired.

implementation of IAS 39 on 1 October 2005 as part of the overall adjustment made to reﬂect the fair value of derivative
ﬁnancial instruments on implementation of IFRS.
25 Pension costs
Deﬁned contribution scheme
The group operates a deﬁned contribution scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from
those of the group in independently administered funds. Pension arrangements for directors are disclosed in the report 
of the remuneration committee and the directors’ remuneration report on page 56. The pension cost charge in these
ﬁnancial statements represents contributions payable by the group. This is shown in note 8.
Deﬁned beneﬁt scheme
In addition to the above, the group also operates a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, the BPT Retirement Beneﬁts Scheme. The
assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by trustees and are invested with an independent investment
manager. Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualiﬁed actuary using the attained age
method. Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 
1 July 2004. This scheme was operated by BPT Limited which became a subsidiary of Grainger Trust plc in 2003.
The actuarial valuation as at 1 July 2004 was based on the main actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 6.5%
per annum, salary increases of 5% per annum and inﬂation-linked increases to pensions in deferment of 2.5% per
annum, the scheme assets were valued at £10.5m and scheme liabilities at £13.3m, a funding level of 79%. The actuary
has recommended an employer contribution rate of 28.5% in order to eliminate the deﬁcit over the expected working
lifetimes of the members. The actuary also undertook a Minimum Funding Requirement valuation as at 1 July 2004 in
accordance with the Pensions Act 1995. The value of assets of the scheme was determined at 101% of the liabilities 
of the scheme.
The scheme was closed to new members and to employee contributions in 2003. Accordingly, there is no current service
cost for the scheme.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the 1 July 2004 actuarial valuation but have been
updated to 30 September 2006 by a qualiﬁed independent actuary. 108 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006

The assets are held with AXA Sun Life in a managed fund. As the above table shows, the assets of the scheme are
primarily held within equities and bonds. The equity return of 7% in 2006 is based on an equity risk premium of 2.6%
above the 15-year ﬁxed rate on gilts of 4.4%. The directors consider this to be at the mid-point of the acceptable range.
The directors have used the 15-year ﬁxed rate on gilts as the expected rate of return on bonds.

Merger reserve – the merger reserve arose when the company issued shares in partial consideration for the acquisition 
of City North Group plc. The issue satisﬁed the provisions of section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 and the premium
relating to the shares issued was credited to a merger reserve.
Cash ﬂow hedge reserve – the fair value movements on those derivative ﬁnancial instruments qualifying for hedge
accounting under IAS 39 are taken to this reserve.
Share-based payments reserve – this reserve comprises the credit entry relating to the share-based payments charge
made in the income statement less the average cost of own shares issued to employees as part of the LTIS.
Investment in own shares reserve – the Grainger Trust Employee Trustee Company Limited acquired 100,000 shares in
Grainger Trust plc in the year at a cost of £504,000. The shares are held to enable the company to meet its obligations
under the LTIS. A total of 679,707 shares were issued to employees during the year. At the year end 584,673 shares 
were held at an average total cost of £1,438,375. The shares had a market value at the year end of £3,671,746.

30 Share-based payments
The group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a Long term Incentive
Scheme (LTIS) and a Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme. Awards under the LTIS are fair valued using a Monte Carlo
simulation model and under the SAYE scheme using a Black Scholes model.
Awards under the LTIS are subject to market performance conditions under which the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
of the company is measured against a peer group. There is no vesting below median performance. If the company TSR
equals the median of the peer group, 40% will vest. If the group’s TSR is equal to or greater than the upper quartile TSR
of the peer group, 100% will vest. At points between the median and upper quartile of the peer group there is pro-rata
vesting between 40% and 100%. The Monte Carlo simulation model takes into account these market based performance
conditions which effectively estimate the number of shares expected to vest. No subsequent adjustment is made to the 
fair value charge for shares that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met. Adjustments are,
however, made for leavers and once adjusted for leavers the total expense for each equity-settled award is spread over 
the vesting period.
Options under the SAYE scheme are fair valued at the date of grant and are not adjusted thereafter. Adjustment is made,
however, for assumptions about leavers.
The tables below summarise the main assumptions used to fair value the awards made under the above schemes. 
For the LTIS, the number of shares or options is shown for both the maximum number at award and the latest number 
as at 30 September 2006 after adjustment for leavers. This same information is given for the SAYE scheme. 118 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006

SAYE options awarded in August 2006 under the 2006 scheme have not been fair valued in the accounts to 30 September
2006 as the cost to be charged to the income statement is very small in the context of materiality to the group results.
The cost of calculating the fair value exceeded the beneﬁt to be obtained. The 2006 SAYE awards will be valued early in
2007 along with the 2007 LTIS awards.

32 Related party transactions
During the year, the group held a 50% interest in Grainger Geninvest LLP and Grainger Geninvest No. 2 (2006) LLP . 
The group provides a number of services to both partnerships and receives an asset adviser fee of 0.25% p.a. of the 
latest property valuation, a sales fee of 0.5% of gross sales proceeds from the sale of properties, a commercial
management fee of 7% of gross commercial rents received and a treasury fee of £30,000 p.a. These fees are 
calculated on an arm’s length basis.
In addition to the above, the group has provided loans to both partnerships totalling £57.7m. These loans are shown
within investments in joint ventures in note 17 and were provided by way of ﬁxed interest 8.5% p.a. and 11% p.a. loan
notes and a mezzanine loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 4%. Interest receivable on the loan notes in the year amounted
to £2.7m and is included in interest receivable from associates and joint ventures shown in note 10.
The group also has a 33
1
⁄3% interest in Regen (NT) LLP and receives a management fee for the provision of accountancy
and other services. As above, the fees are calculated on an arm’s length basis.
On 1 September 2006, the group acquired a portfolio of properties at a cost of £13.1m from the Duke of
Northumberland. The Duke of Northumberland is a joint venture partner in Regen (NT) LLP with an interest of 33
1
⁄3%.
During the year, the group disposed of its 50% share in the Prescot Street Partnership to its joint venture partner for 
a consideration of £5.5m.
The group has a 43.2% interest in OÜ Robbins, a company incorporated in Estonia. The group has provided a loan to 
OÜ Robbins amounting to £2.1m by way of 9% p.a. ﬁxed rate unsecured loan notes. Interest receivable on the loan notes 
in the year to 30 September 2006 amounted to £0.1m and is included in interest receivable from associates and joint
ventures shown in note 10.
During the year, the group disposed of ﬁve properties in Crouch End, London to Clocktower Asset Management Limited, 
a company which is 50% owned by Clocktower Properties Limited which in turn is owned 100% by Mr Michael Sherley-
Dale. Mr Sherley-Dale although never a director of Grainger Trust plc, was a director of City North Group plc at the time 
of its acquisition by Grainger in April 2005. Following Grainger’s decision to sell the properties, an independent agent 
was appointed to market the properties. A signiﬁcant number of offers were received by the agent but Clocktower’s 
was the highest bid.
On 1 December 2005, the bulk of the group’s market-rented properties with a value of £197m were transferred to a
Jersey Property Unit Trust (JPUT). The group owned all of the units in the JPUT as at 30 September 2006.
Details of the key management compensation are provided in note 8.

35 Contingent liabilities
The properties in certain subsidiary companies forming a ‘guarantee group’ provide the security for the group’s MOF
facility (see note 23). The properties in certain of the group’s German subsidiaries provide security for the non-recourse
ﬁnance raised in those subsidiary undertakings.
In addition, the group has an obligation, under the sale and purchase agreement for the land at West Waterlooville, 
to pay further consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts. It is not possible to determine the
amount or timing of any such future payments due to the long term nature of the site’s development and the associated
uncertainties with respect to planning applications. However, any future payments will not fall due until at least 2015 and
will be spread over a number of years.
36 Post balance sheet events
The group acquired a 308-unit residential portfolio in Munich for €32m at the end of October 2006 with anticipated
completion in early 2007. In addition, in November, the group and an external third party company, Development
Securities, have jointly acquired a 10 acre site at Curzon Park in Birmingham for £33.5m. 
On 1 December 2006, the group made a conditional offer to the shareholders of The Capital Appreciation Trust (CAT)
which contains a portfolio of some 912 retirement properties. The offer price values CAT at £71.6m. 
On 21 November 2006, the group sold 38% of the shares in an independently managed private Jersey exempt company
which, through its subsidiaries, invested in the JPUT. This was after having raised third party equity commitments of £56m.
On 11 October, a €150m Euro credit facility was completed to fund further acquisitions in Germany and on 13 December
2006 the group reﬁnanced its main MOF lending agreement retaining a four tranche structure and £1.3bn of ﬁnancing
but with lower margins and an average extension of two years to debt maturity. 
37 Acquisition of subsidiaries
The group acquired three subsidiaries during the year for a total consideration of £3.4m. Just prior to the year end, 100%
of Suburban Homes Limited was acquired for £2.1m. The balance represents the acquisition of CCZ a.s., a company
registered in the Czech Republic, in which the group owns 81.6% of the voting rights and the acquisition of the
remaining shares in SIP Home Limited.

38 Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS
Explanation of transition to IFRS
As stated in Note 1, these are the group’s ﬁrst consolidated ﬁnancial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
The accounting policies set out in Note 1 have been applied in preparing the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 
30 September 2006, the comparative information presented in these ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 30 September
2005 and in the preparation of the opening balance sheet on 1 October 2004 (the group’s date of IFRS transition).
In preparing the opening IFRS balance sheet, the group adjusted amounts reported previously in its ﬁnancial statements
under UK GAAP. An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the group’s ﬁnancial position
and ﬁnancial performance is set out in the accompanying reconciliations and notes.

notes
a Under IFRS 2 the group operate an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a Long
Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) and a Save As You Earn Scheme (SAYE). The fair value of the employee services received
in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase
in equity. The total amount to be expensed is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become
unconditionally entitled to the shares and options. Awards under the LTIS are fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation
model and under SAYE using a Black Scholes model. The charge in the year ended 30 September 2005 was £0.5m.  124 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
38 Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS continued
As there is a corresponding credit to equity, there is no impact on group net assets in respect of the IFRS 2 adjustment.
The adjustment in the reconciliation of equity of £1.6m in both years relates to the reversal of provisions made under
UK GAAP , UITF 17.
b Negative goodwill of £85.0m arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004 has been credited to opening retained
earnings at that date. Subsequent releases of negative goodwill to the proﬁt and loss account under UK GAAP have
been reversed. The reversal amounted to £5.9m in the year ended 30 September 2005.
The acquisition of City North Group plc on 15 April 2005 has been re-stated to account for the deferred tax payable
on the difference between the fair value of the properties acquired and the tax base cost at entity level. This provision
is required under IFRS whereas no provision was allowed under FRS 19. In the balance sheet at 30 September 2005 it
results in the negative goodwill of £2.5m calculated under UK GAAP becoming positive goodwill of £5.8m under IFRS
with a corresponding increase of £8.3m in deferred tax liabilities.
c Proposed ﬁnal dividends at both 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005 respectively reﬂected in the UK GAAP
balance sheets at these dates have been excluded from current liabilities in the IFRS balance sheet reﬂecting the fact
that neither dividend was a liability of the group under IFRS at those dates. The proposed ﬁnal dividend for the years
ended on these dates is reﬂected in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which those dividends were
formally approved at an Annual General Meeting.
d A provision for deferred taxation of £102.6m has been made in the balance sheet at 1 October 2004 with a
corresponding charge made to opening retained earnings. This provision relates primarily to the tax that may be
payable on the difference ascribed to trading stock properties on acquisition compared to the tax base cost at entity
level. This tax, which relates mainly to the BPT plc acquisition, could not be provided under FRS 19. In addition, the
adjustment includes provision for tax that may be payable arising from the revaluation of the group’s investment
properties and based upon the expected manner of realisation either through continued use or sale. The future impact
of making these provisions in the balance sheet under IFRS is that the group’s effective tax rate, which has been
historically high at around 40%, will be much closer to the actual current rate of tax of 30%. This is because when
properties are sold, the majority of the tax payable as a result of the sale has already been provided for under IFRS
whereas under UK GAAP the full tax payable was charged to the proﬁt and loss account in the year of sale. This has
resulted in a reduction in the tax charge of £7.2m in the year ended 30 September 2005. After providing for the
deferred tax of £1.6m on the revaluation gain (see (f) below) the overall reduction in the tax charge in the year ended
30 September 2005 was £5.6m. 
e The deﬁcit of £4.6m and the related deferred tax asset of £1.4m on the BPT Limited deﬁned beneﬁt scheme has been
reﬂected in the opening balance sheet as at 1 October 2004 in full. When Grainger acquired BPT Limited it made
provision for the pension scheme deﬁcit. As at 1 October 2004 that provision was £4.7m with a related deferred tax
asset of £1.7m. Those entries have been reversed in the 1 October 2004 balance sheet. The net effect of the above
entries is a charge of £0.2m to retained earnings at 1 October 2004.The deﬁcit had increased to £5.3m at 30
September 2005 and, net of tax, there was a £0.8m charge to retained earnings at 30 September 2005. The group
has applied the amendment to IAS 19 with effect from 1 October 2004 allowing it to report all actuarial gains and
losses in full in the period in which they were incurred through the statement of recognised income and expense. 
f The revaluation reserve at 1 October 2004 of £13.9m has been transferred into retained earnings. In the year ended
30 September 2005, the revaluation gain on investment property of £5.4m has been included in proﬁt for the year 
in the income statement. The deferred tax thereon of £1.6m is part of the adjustment referred to in (d) above.

Remuneration Committee and Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal 
and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do
not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent
company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the Report of the Remuneration Committee and
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with
the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions 
is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual 
Report and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited parent company ﬁnancial statements. The other
information comprises only the chairman’s statement, the
chief executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the Corporate
governance report, the Directors’ report, the corporate
social responsibility report and the unaudited part of the
Report of the Remuneration Committee and Directors’
Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the parent company
ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend 
to any other information.
The maintenance and integrity of the Grainger Trust plc
website is the responsibility of the directors; the work
carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration
of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to
the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially presented
on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the parent company ﬁnancial statements 
and the part of the Report of the Remuneration
Committee and Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant
estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed. 126 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Grainger Trust plc continued
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the parent company
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report of the
Remuneration Committee and Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report of
the Remuneration Committee and Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and
fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the
company’s affairs as at 30 September 2006;
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the Report of the Remuneration Committee and
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is
consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.

The ﬁnancial statements on pages 127 to 132 were approved by the Board of Directors on 22 December 2006 and signed 
on their behalf by:
Rupert J. Dickinson Andrew R. Cunningham
Director Director 1 Accounting policies
(i) Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the historical cost convention, 
as modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain investments, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK
accounting standards.
The Company has taken the exemption allowed under Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 from the requirement
to present its own proﬁt and loss account. The loss for the year was £3.5m (2005: proﬁt of £1.5m). On an historic cost
basis, the loss for the year would have been £3.9m (2005: a proﬁt of £1.5m). These ﬁnancial statements present
information about the company as an individual undertaking and not about its group.
In accordance with the exemption in FRS 1, ‘Cash Flow Statements’, the company has not prepared a cash ﬂow statement
because one is included in its own consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8, ‘Related Party Transactions’, from the requirement to
disclose such transactions on the grounds that it has presented its own consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
(ii) Adoption of new standards
The company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under UK GAAP , rather than under IFRS which has been adopted
for group reporting. UK GAAP is converging towards IFRS and a number of new Financial Reporting Standards became
applicable for the ﬁrst time in the year.
In these ﬁnancial statements the following new standards have been adopted for the ﬁrst time:
– FRS 20 ‘Share-Based Payments’
– FRS 21 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’
– FRS 23 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’
– FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’
– FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’.
The corresponding amounts in these ﬁnancial statements are, other than those covered by the exemption permitted by 
FRS 25 and FRS 26, restated in accordance with the new Standards. FRS 25 and FRS 26 permit the corresponding amounts
not to be restated and the company has adopted this approach. The ﬁxed assets investment policy set out in note (iv)
below provides further details of the effect of adopting FRS 26 on 1 October 2005.
FRS 21 requires that ﬁnal dividends payable are recognised only in the period in which they are approved in the Annual
General Meeting and therefore become a liability. Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
This accounting treatment has superseded SSAP 17, ‘Accounting for Post Balance Sheet Events’ which required dividends
to be accrued for when proposed.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material 
in relation to the company’s ﬁnancial statements.

1 Accounting policies continued
(iii) Tangible ﬁxed assets
These assets comprise ofﬁce ﬁxtures, ﬁttings and equipment and are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
(iv) Investments
In 2005, investments are shown at cost less any provision for impairment. For 2006, investments in equity instruments that
have a quoted market price in an active market or whose fair value can be reliably measured are fair valued under FRS 26.
(v) Taxation
Corporation tax is provided on taxable proﬁts at the current rate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts
and their recognition in a tax computation.
In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’, deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated,
but not reversed, at the balance sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in future. Deferred
tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
(vi) Own shares
Transactions of The Grainger Trust Employee Trust Company Limited are included in the ﬁnancial statements. In particular,
the Trust’s purchases of shares in Grainger Trust plc are debited directly to equity.

The company has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements not to restate corresponding amounts in accordance
with FRS 25 and FRS 26. In the comparative period, all ﬁnancial assets and liabilities were carried at cost, amortised as
appropriate, less, in the case of ﬁnancial assets, provision for any permanent diminution in value. 
Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market or whose fair value cannot
be reliably measured cannot be fair valued under FRS 26. The investment in the Schroder Residential Property Unit Trust
can be reliably measured and, therefore, has been fair valued under FRS 26.

Chairman’s report 
Dear fellow shareholders 
I would like to thank you all for your 
support since the inception of 
GameAccount Network in 2002. 
During the intervening 11 years  
we have come a long way from  
our origins of four employees 
operating from serviced offices. 
We have evolved from a developer 
and provider of pure games of skill 
into a leading enterprise-level 
technology solution provider for 
land-based casino operators in 
regulated Internet gaming markets.
We believe our vibrant innovative 
business mix will generate 
substantial shareholder value over 
the next few years. 2013 has been 
a momentous year for our 
Company with admission to both 
the AIM and ESM markets, healthy 
profits and a strong balance sheet, 
which should expedite our 
expansion plans in the United 
States in particular.
We welcome regulatory changes 
in the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Spain and Italy where 
we believe we are well positioned 
to grow sustainable revenues.
GameAccount Network is 
committed to maintaining a Board 
composition that complies with 
the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and we have further 
strengthened our Board with the 
recent appointment of Seamus 
McGill as an independent non-
executive director.
Finally, the Board and I would like 
to thank all GameAccount 
Network employees for their work 
and commitment over the last 
year. Our people, culture and their 
commitment to excellence are 
among our greatest assets.
We look forward to the 
opportunities in 2014 and 2015 
during which we believe we can be 
a substantial player on the world 
stage as regulation of Internet 
gaming continues to unfold.

Core business offerings
GameAccount’s open platform 
means that operators can choose 
their own mix of content to appeal 
directly to their customer base. It 
allows operators to access content 
through a simple, efficient 
integration process across online 
and mobile.
For land-based casinos – it offers 
a complete range of games that 
reflect and complement the offline 
offering, without being biased to a 
single content provider.
For online operators – it fills 
gaps in the product portfolio 
by targeting the best performing 
offline content and bringing 
it online.
Technically, the platform is a 
single, proven, scalable solution 
that can easily integrate with 
internal operator or customer 
management systems. This is 
supported and serviced by 
world-class developers.
The platform is managed through 
a single back office which gives 
the operator not only a complete 
view of the players’ activity but 
also a toolkit to successfully run 
and manage every aspect of an 
online business.
The platform has been built 
around the requirements of newly 
regulated markets and existing 
responsible gaming and player 
protection frameworks.
Content development
As an agnostic content provider, 
GameAccount has invested heavily 
in a strategy which allows the very 
best of breed gaming products to 
be made available to its partners 
via either existing integrations or 
locally deployed content.
Since 2003, online gaming 
operators have been selecting 
GameAccount Network’s Gaming 
Content Platform in order to offer 
end-users proprietary, multi-player 
skill games and tournaments. This 
was supplemented in 2007 with 
the addition of casino table games 
and, significantly, with a large 
range of high performance third 
party slot content since 2011.
The GameAccount platform is a trusted, 
certified and open platform that provides a 
quick, cost-effective way for land-based 
casinos to move online.

Chief Executive’s review
to £29.6 million (2012: £17.7 million). 
Net revenues increased 123% to 
£12.3 million (2012: £5.5 million), 
driven by new business and 
organic growth. The business 
delivered strong organic growth in 
Europe, started receiving income 
derived from newly regulated 
Internet gaming in the United 
States and made significant 
progress positioning the Group 
for continued growth in the 
United States.
Strategy
Expansion in the United States 
remains a strategic priority for the 
Group following the establishment 
of a dedicated sales and 
infrastructure support office in Las 
Vegas, Nevada during the year. 
During the year the Group entered 
into landmark agreements with 
both Betfair for regulated real-
money Internet gaming in New 
Jersey and with Foxwoods® Casino 
Resort, America’s largest casino, 
for Simulated Gaming™, in 
advance of potential regulation, 
being a compelling converged 
Internet gaming enterprise 
solution designed for land-based 
casinos seeking to move online 
ahead of anticipated regulation of 
real-money Internet gaming. 
Regulated real-money Internet 
gaming and Simulated Gaming™ 
remain the primary growth 
opportunities in the United States. 
Extending the convergence 
capabilities of the Group’s 
GameSTACK™ Internet gaming 
system (IGS) remains a strategic 
priority, extending GameAccount 
Network’s substantial lead in 
offering land-based US casino 
operators the ability to converge 
their customers’ experience across 
land, online and mobile. Mobile 
casino gaming in particular 
represents a continued strong 
growth opportunity with gross 
income derived from mobile 
casino gaming growing 
substantially in 2013. In Europe, 
the Group continues to prepare for 
growth opportunities consequent 
to newly regulated casino slot 
gaming in Spain and is 
consolidating its position in Italy’s 
regulated casino slot Internet 
gaming market by delivering an 
expanding breadth of casino slots 
content to its major Italian 
operator partners.
Products
During the year the Group 
completed the development of 10 
online casino games for its casino 
equipment manufacturer clients 
including Aristocrat, Incredible 
Technologies and Ainsworth 
Game Technology, bringing the 
Group’s total games portfolio 
inherent within the GameSTACK™ 
Internet gaming system to 135. In 
2013 new casino equipment 
manufacturer clients of the 
Company’s game development 
services included Multi KONAMI 
Gaming in the United States, 
GamoMAT in Germany and Reel 
Time Gaming in Australia, with 
online facsimiles of their machine-
based casino slots scheduled for 
delivery in 2014.
By the year’s end the Company 
completed development of the 
unique Simulated Gaming™ 
product offering designed to 
enable land-based casino 
operators in the United States to 
move online in advance of 
regulation of real-money Internet 
gaming. Simulated Gaming™ 
combines the Company’s real-
money Internet gaming technology 
platform, recognisable Class III 
casino gaming content and the 
land-based casino operator’s 
brand. Augmented with a carefully 
constructed monetisation model, in 
2014 US land-based casinos have 
the opportunity to launch online 
casinos embedded within their 
existing news and information 
websites and offering a legal

Overview
GameAccount Network has made 
significant progress in delivering 
its enterprise software solution, 
gaming content and supporting 
services to major operators with a 
particular focus on the newly 
regulated intra-State markets 
emerging in the United States. 
During the year the Group signed 
a landmark agreement with Betfair 
and subsequently delivered its 
enterprise Internet gaming solution 
into New Jersey’s newly regulated 
Internet gaming market for Betfair, 
operating in partnership with New 
Jersey casino operator Trump 
Resorts International. Throughout 
the year GameAccount Network 
continued delivering a diverse 
range of machine-based casino 
slot games online for casino 
equipment manufacturers. The 
Group experienced strong organic 
growth in Italy’s newly regulated 
online casino slots market and 
continued to win new business in 
both Europe and the United States. 
During the year, the Group 
achieved double-digit financial 
growth, with gross income up 67%

experience online to residents 
anywhere within the United States.
GameAccount Network also 
continued to develop its industry-
leading casino product and 
service offering with a particular 
focus on the Group’s SENSE3™ 
mobile solution comprising 
multi-game native apps for iOS 
and Android, HTML5 casino 
games and responsive design 
websites. Major beneficiaries of 
this historic and continued 
investment in mobile capability 
include the Group’s client casino 
equipment manufacturers today 
relying upon GameAccount 
Network to develop online 
equivalents of their Class III 
machine-based slot games and 
distribute them online in Europe 
and the United States, enabled for 
real-money Internet gaming as 
well as Simulated Gaming™. 
Throughout 2013 the Group 
delivered substantially extended 
convergence capability within the 
GameSTACK™ Internet gaming 
system by completing two 
incremental integrations with 
major land-based casino 
management systems, being those 
employed by Foxwoods® Casino 
Resort in Connecticut and Trump 
Plaza in New Jersey. Convergence 
between a traditional land-based 
casino and a new online casino 
experience enables seamless 
customer journeys maximising the 
casino operator’s ability to 
monetise their customer database 
and extend online beyond the 
typical geographic radius in which 
their traditional customers reside. 
The continued investment in 
convergence supports the Group’s 
proven ability to enable traditional 
land-based casinos to move online 
and deliver an Internet gaming 
experience which supports and 
accelerates their existing gaming 
business through increased 
on-property visitation and 
increased local market share.
Marketing and support services
Throughout 2013 the Group 
significantly expanded its support 
services capability for operator 
customers using the 
GameSTACK™ as their primary 
platform for Internet gaming. 
Services are an increasingly 
important component in delivering 
an enterprise gaming solution to 
land-based casino operators and 
include the provision of managed 
payment processing, predictive 
analytics, CRM and online 
acquisition marketing services 
across all major online acquisition 
channels together with expertise 
in converting and reactivating 
land-based patron databases into 
online players. The marketing, 
CRM and analytics capabilities of 
the GameSTACK™ back office and 
associated integrated reporting 
systems enable the provision of a 
turn-key service to land-based 
casinos seeking to move online 
consequent to, or in advance of, 
real-money Internet gaming 
regulation. Income derived from 
services creates an incremental 
income opportunity for the Group 
and diversifies the business in a 
manner complementary to the 
core software licensing business.

Financial and operational review
Summary
GameAccount Network has 
delivered a record year in 2013 with 
net revenues increasing by 123% to 
£12.3 million resulting in EBITDA of 
£4.1 million compared to £0.3 
million in the comparative period. 
The strategy to diversify the 
Group’s revenue base has started 
to pay off and during the year the 
Group recorded its first significant 
Internet Gaming System sale and 
continued to increase B2B 
revenues from the development of 
online versions of machine-based 
slots game content. Operating 
profit for the year was £1.6 million 
compared to a loss in 2012 of £0.9 
million and profit after tax for the 
year was £1.1 million, an increase of 
£1.0 million from the £0.1 million 
recorded in 2012. 
In November 2013 the Group 
raised £15 million (before 
associated transaction expenses) 
in new capital as part of an initial 
public offering to place 11,111,111 
new ordinary shares and was 
admitted to both the AIM market 
in London and the ESM market in 
Dublin. As a consequence of this, 
the Group enters 2014 with a 
significantly strengthened balance 
sheet and together with an 
absence of debt financing is 
strongly positioned for future 
growth. The Group ended the 
period with a cash balance of 
£16.9 million compared to £1.7 
million for the year ended 31 
December 2012 and net assets at 
31 December 2013 of £17.7 million, 
an increase of £15.8 million during 
the period.
Revenue
Gross income increased by 67% 
from £17.7 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2012 to £29.6 
million in the current fiscal year. 
This increase has primarily been 
due to increased gross income 
from the distribution of slots 
content in the Italian market and 
increased gross income from the 
sale of an Internet Gaming System 
and game content development.
Net revenues for the year 
increased to £12.3 million 
representing an increase of £6.8 
million compared to net revenue 
generated in the previous year of 
£5.5 million. The increase has been 
primarily due to a major Internet 
Gaming System sale and increased 
game development and related 
revenues. Overall B2B revenues 
have increased from £3.9 million 
to £11.3 million offsetting a decline 
in the B2C business where 
revenues fell from £1.6 million to 
£1.0 million in the same period. 
Within the B2B revenue stream 
Game and Platform development 
revenues have increased from £1.3 
million to £8.7 million while 
revenues from the European 
distribution network are consistent 
with prior year at £2.6 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2013.
Expenses
Distribution costs include royalties 
payable to third parties, B2B and 
B2C direct marketing expenditure 
and the direct costs of operating 
the hardware platforms deployed 
across the business and have 
increased from £2.3 million to 
£3.0 million in the 12 months to 
31 December 2013. The increase is 
due primarily to increased 
royalties payable to providers of 
third party games content and the 
incremental cost of operating 
hardware platforms due to 
expansion into the US regulated 
market. 
Administration expenses include 
the costs of personnel and related 
expenditure for both the London 
and Nevada offices. Total 
administrative expenses have 
increased from £4.1 million in 2012 
to £7.7 million in the year ended 
31 December 2013 primarily due to 
expenses incurred in connection 
with the admission to AIM and 
ESM markets and increased 
headcount to support the Group’s 
continued investment in both the 
underlying Internet Gaming 
System and enhanced games 
team capability to develop online 
“ The strategy to diversify  
the Group’s revenue base 
has started to pay off and 
during the year the Group 
recorded its first significant 
Internet Gaming System 
sale and continued to 
increase B2B revenues from 
the development of online 
versions of machine-based 
slots game content.”

versions of existing offline slots 
game content. This investment has 
enabled expansion into the US 
market primarily to support the 
Group’s efforts to capitalise on the 
opportunity presented by real-
money gaming in regulated states 
and simulated gaming in states 
across the US market. 
 
EBITDA 
Clean earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation 
(clean EBITDA) of £4.1 million in 
2013 has increased materially from 
£0.3 million in the comparative 
period. 
Clean EBITDA is a non-GAAP 
Company-specific measure and 
excludes interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation, share-based payment 
expense and other items which 
the directors consider to be 
non-recurring and one time in 
nature. The directors regard clean 
EBITDA as a reliable measure of 
profits that is not unduly subjective. 
During the year the Group incurred 
£1.7 million of net costs included 
within administrative expenses that 
have not been included within the 
clean EBITDA measure, which 
include the costs of the Group’s 
initial public offering in November 
and are regarded as non-recurring 
and one time in nature.
Cash flow
The cash balance at 31 December 
2013 was £16.9 million (2012: £1.7 
million) representing an increase 
of £15.2 million. Cash balances 
have been significantly bolstered 
from the proceeds of issuing new 
shares of £14.7 million and cash 
flow generated from operations 
during the period of £1.9 million. 
During the year £0.8 million was 
spent related to the capitalisation 
of internal development time and 
£0.5 million was spent on fixed 
assets including the acquisition of 
new hardware to establish a 
platform in the United States 
market. 
Key Performance Indicators
The performance of the Group during the year demonstrates the Group’s 
strategy to both consolidate the core gaming content distribution 
business in Europe and to grow through higher margin revenue 
opportunities including IGS sales and game development in regulated 
markets. The directors regard earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (clean EBITDA) as a reliable measure of profits and the 
Group’s key performance indicators (KPIs) are set out below:
2013
£’000
2012

Gross income from gaming operations 
and services 29,657 17,690

Risk category Description Mitigation
Legal and regulatory risks
Loss of licences The Group holds a number of 
licences for its activities from 
regulators. The loss of all or any of 
these licences may adversely impact 
on the revenues and/or reputation of 
the Group.
The Group has established a 
compliance team, whose role is to 
develop relationships with regulators, 
monitor the regulatory environment 
closely, and ensure continuation of 
all necessary licences and permits 
to allow the Group to continue its 
business.
Changes in regulations Laws and regulations in the 
gambling sector are complex, 
inconsistent and evolving. The 
Group licenses its products to 
operators in the online gaming 
industry whose ability to operate in 
any jurisdiction may be impacted 
by changes in regulations, or failure 
to obtain any necessary licences. In 
addition there can be no guarantee 
that a jurisdiction will not change its 
licensing requirements. 
As an established regulated supplier 
to the online gambling sector, the 
Group is vigilant over legal and 
regulatory issues that may apply 
to its activities, not only in those 
jurisdictions where the Group is 
located but also where its licensees 
are operating using GameAccount 
Network software and services. 
In addition, the Group has diversified 
its risk by obtaining multiple  
licences in the UK, Alderney and  
New Jersey.
New licensing requirements In newly regulated markets, new 
licensing regimes may impose 
licensing conditions, such as the 
requirement to locate significant 
technical infrastructure within 
the relevant territory or establish 
real-time data interfaces with the 
regulator that present operational 
challenges, or may stop the licensee 
being able to offer the full range of 
the Group’s products.
The Group closely monitors 
developments in jurisdictions seeking 
to introduce or change regulations. 
The Group works to establish 
close relationships and actively 
participates in industry groups to 
help shape new licensing regulations. GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 15

Risk category Description Mitigation
The marketplace
Competition The online gambling market is highly 
competitive. Failure to compete 
effectively may result in loss of 
licensees and also the inability to 
attract new licensees.
The Group closely monitors 
competition and continues to invest 
significant resources to improve its 
technology, products and services. In 
addition the Group has a diversified 
geographical base which spreads the 
competitive risk.
Technology
Dependence on technology The Group’s operations are highly 
dependent on technology and 
advanced information systems and 
there is a risk that such technology 
or systems could fail. 
The Group may be adversely 
affected by activities such as system 
intrusions, denial of service attacks, 
virus spreading and phishing.
The Group has in place data recovery 
and systems recovery procedures, 
security measures and business 
continuity plans in the event of failure 
or disruption, or damage to, the 
Group’s technology or systems.
Customers
Fraud As an operator (www.moneygaming.
com), the Group experiences 
fraudulent activity on customer 
accounts in the form of deposits from 
stolen credit cards and debit cards. 
These amounts are written off as a 
loss to the business.
The Group has a compliance team 
whose role is to monitor transactions 
for signs of fraudulent activity and 
to carry out Know-Your-Customer 
procedures. Reports from the 
Management Information System 
(MIS) are used by the compliance 
team to monitor possible fraudulent 
activities. The Group sources multiple 
payment providers to mitigate for 
risk of losing any single funding 
channel. 
Risk of reliance on major licensees The Group operates a revenue share 
model with its licensees, meaning 
results can be impacted by poor 
performance of its licensees or by its 
licensees choosing to withdraw from 
a particular market.
The Group has continued to diversify 
its licensee base and develop its 
business in stable regulated markets.
Employees
Reliance on key personnel The Group’s future success depends 
on the continued service of senior 
management and key technical 
personnel, the retention of which 
cannot be guaranteed.
The Group has a performance 
evaluation system to identify 
key talent and to ensure that 
key personnel are appropriately 
rewarded and incentivised. This is 
through a mixture of annual bonuses 
and long-term incentives such as 
share options.

Corporate governance statement 
As an AIM listed group, GameAccount Network plc is 
not required to follow the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code). The Board 
however recognises the importance and value of 
good corporate governance procedures and 
accordingly have selected those elements of the 
Code that they consider relevant and appropriate to 
the Group, given its size and structure.
The Board
The Board comprises five directors including two 
executive directors, two non-executive directors and 
the Chairman. The Company appointed a further 
independent non-executive director on 9 April 2014. 
The Board meets regularly to consider strategy, 
performance and the framework of internal controls. 
The Board of directors comprises a mix of the 
necessary skills, knowledge and experience required 
to provide leadership, control and oversight of the 
management of GameAccount Network plc and to 
contribute to the development and implementation of 
strategy. In particular, the Board combines a group of 
directors with diverse backgrounds within the 
technology and related sectors, in both public and 
private companies, which combine to provide the 
Board with the resources and expertise to drive the 
continuing development of the Group and advance its 
commercial objectives.
The directors have established an audit committee, a 
remuneration committee and a nomination 
committee with formally delegated rules and 
responsibilities. Each of the committees currently 
comprises the non-executive directors and meets 
regularly, and at least twice each year.
Committees
The audit committee is responsible for ensuring that 
the financial performance of the Company is properly 
reported on and monitored and for meeting the 
auditors and reviewing the reports from the auditors 
relating to accounts and internal control systems. It 
meets at least once a year with the auditors without 
executive directors present. The audit committee is 
comprised of Roger Kendrick, David O’Reilly and 
Michael Smurfit Jr. and is chaired by Roger Kendrick. 
Roger Kendrick is deemed to have recent and 
relevant financial experience and is the audit 
committee financial expert.
The remuneration committee reviews the 
performance of the executive directors and sets and 
reviews the scale and structure of their remuneration 
and the basis of their remuneration and the terms of 
their service agreements with due regard to the 
interests of shareholders. In determining the 
remuneration of executive directors, the remuneration 
committee will seek to enable the Company to attract 
and retain staff of the highest calibre. The 
remuneration committee will also make 
recommendations to the Board concerning the 
allocation of share options to employees. No director 
is permitted to participate in discussions or decisions 
concerning his own remuneration. The remuneration 
committee is comprised of David O’Reilly, Roger 
Kendrick and Michael Smurfit Jr. and is chaired by 
David O’Reilly.
The nomination committee is responsible for 
reviewing the size, structure and composition of the 
Board, succession planning, the appointment of 
replacement and/or additional directors and for 
making the appropriate recommendations to the 
Board. It meets at least once a year with the auditors 
without executive directors present. The nomination 
committee is comprised of Michael Smurfit Jr., David 
O’Reilly and Roger Kendrick and is chaired by Michael 
Smurfit Jr.
Internal control
The Company has adopted a share dealing code in 
conformity with the requirements of Rule 21 of the 
AIM Rules and ESM Rules and will take steps to 
ensure compliance by the Board and the Group’s 
employees with the terms of the code.
The Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act) which came into 
force in the UK on 1 July 2011 prescribes criminal 
offences for individuals and businesses relating to the 
payment of bribes and, in certain cases, a failure to 
prevent the payment of bribes. The Company has 
therefore established procedures designed to ensure 
that no member of the Group engages in conduct for 
which a prosecution under the Bribery Act may result.

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors have elected to prepare the 
Group and parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. Under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
The directors are also required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the rules of the 
London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on the Alternative Investment Market. 
 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors 
are required to: 
 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether the Group financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Company will continue in business. 
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Website publication 
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual 
report and the financial statements are made 
available on a website. Financial statements are 
published on the Company’s website in accordance 
with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements, which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website is the responsibility of the 
directors. The directors’ responsibility also extends to 
the ongoing integrity of the financial statements 
contained therein. GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 24
We have audited the financial statements of 
GameAccount Network plc for the year ended 
31 December 2013 which comprise the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and company statements of financial 
position, the consolidated and company statements 
of changes in equity and the consolidated and 
company statements of cash flows and the related 
notes. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the parent Company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
(FRC’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the FRC’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of the Group’s and the parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union;
• the parent Company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the strategic 
report and directors’ report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept 
by the parent Company, or returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.

1. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, 
International Accounting Standards and interpretations (collectively, IFRS) issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union (adopted IFRSs). 
As this is the Group’s first year presenting its results and financial position under IFRS, the financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS’ and accordingly a third balance 
sheet showing the financial position as at 31 December 2011 has been disclosed. 
The Group’s significant accounting policies under IFRS are detailed below. As disclosed in note 23, there were 
no material differences on transition to IFRS and therefore no reconciliations are shown.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year the Group has adopted all of the new and revised standards and interpretations issued by 
the IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB, as they have 
been adopted by the European Union, that are relevant to its operations and effective for accounting years 
beginning on 1 January 2013.
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective (and in 
some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU) for the financial year beginning 1 January 2014. These have 
not been early adopted and the directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a 
material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future years.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
2.1 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December 2013. Control is achieved where the 
Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate.
Uniform accounting policies have been adopted across the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates (‘the functional currency’) which is UK Pound Sterling (£). The 
financial statements are presented in UK Pound Sterling (£), which is the Group’s presentational currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing  
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in net profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For more information, please visit: 
www.gameaccountnetwork.com/investors
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(c) Group companies
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at rates approximating to those ruling when 
the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences 
arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual 
rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve. 
 
Exchange differences recognised profit or loss in Group entities’ separate financial statements on the 
translation of long-term monetary items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation 
concerned are reclassified to other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve 
on consolidation. 
 
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange 
reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
2.2 Revenue recognition
Net revenues comprise amounts earned from B2C and B2B activities. B2B activities include revenues derived 
from the use of the Group’s intellectual property in online gaming activities and revenues derived from the 
game and platform development and related services.
(a) B2C
Net revenue from ‘business to consumer’ (B2C) activities represents the net house win, commission charged or 
tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his participation in a tournament. Net revenue is 
recognised in the accounting years in which the gaming transactions occur and is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable, net of certain promotion bonuses and customer incentives.
(b) B2B
Revenue share and other services
Net revenue receivable from ‘business to business’ (B2B) activities in respect of revenue share and other 
services comprises a percentage of the revenue generated by the contracting party from use of the Group’s 
intellectual property in online gaming activities and from fees charged for services rendered. Net revenue is 
recognised in the accounting years in which the gaming transactions occur or the services are rendered.
Game and platform development
Net revenue receivable from B2B activities in respect of game and platform development comprises fees 
earned from development of games for customers for use on GameAccount Network’s platforms and from the 
sale of platform software and related services.
Revenue in respect of game development and the sale of platform software is recognised when certification 
for the game has been obtained from the relevant regulatory authority, delivery has occurred and the fee is 
fixed, contractual or determinable and collectability is probable.
Services revenue principally relates to implementation services. Such services are generally separable from the 
other elements of arrangements. Revenue for such services is recognised over the period of the delivery of 
these services. Where an element of the fee is contingent on the successful delivery of the implementation 
project the revenue is not recognised until such time that it is probable that the requirements under that 
specific contract will be met.
2.3 Gross income from gaming operations and services
In order to provide further information to readers of the historical financial information and in particular to give 
an indication of the extent of transactions that have passed through the Group’s systems, the statement of 
comprehensive income discloses gross income from gaming operations and services arising through the use of 
the Group’s intellectual property in online gaming activities, which represents the total income of the Group, 
together with that derived by its contracting parties. This line item does not represent the Group’s revenue for 
the purposes of IFRS income recognition. GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 34
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.4 Distribution costs
Distribution costs represent the costs of delivering the service to the customer and primarily consist of 
technology infrastructure, promotional and advertising together with gaming and regulatory testing, all of 
which are recognised on an accruals basis, and depreciation and amortisation.
2.5 Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses consist primarily of staff costs, corporate and professional expenses, all of which are 
recognised on an accruals basis, and impairment charges.
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense 
that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.
2.6 Intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-
line basis over their useful economic lives.
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to 
determine the cost of intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Licences and trademarks Shorter of licence term or 10 years
Internally generated intangible assets (development costs)
Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Group’s software development, is capitalised 
only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products, the products are technically 
and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the years the Group expects to benefit from selling the 
products developed, which is typically three to five years. The amortisation expense is included within the 
distribution cost line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal 
projects are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the 
economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including that 
incurred in order to maintain an intangible asset’s current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
2.7 Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight-line basis over the expected useful 
lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 33% straight-line
Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are included 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.8 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and internally generated intangible assets
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and 
intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, 
the carrying amount of the asset (cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
2.9 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s statement of financial position when the 
Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are de-recognised when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or when the contractual rights to those 
assets are transferred. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged, cancelled or expired.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method less provision for impairment. Appropriate provisions for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when there is objective evidence that the 
assets are impaired. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term 
receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties 
on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to 
collect all of the amounts due under the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash 
flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions 
are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in 
the statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the 
gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that have maturities of three months or less from inception, are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Classification of shares as debt or equity instruments
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the 
definition of a financial liability. An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in assets or 
an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Accordingly, a financial instrument is treated as equity if:
• there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial asset or to exchange financial assets or 
liabilities on terms that may be unfavourable; and
• the instrument is a non-derivative that contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of 
shares or is a derivative that will be settled only by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other 
assets for a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments. GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 36
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
When shares are issued, any component that creates a financial liability of the Group is presented as such in the 
statement of financial position, measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, thereafter at amortised 
cost until derecognised. Any corresponding dividends relating to the liability component are charged as 
interest expenses in the income statement. The initial fair value of the liability component is determined using a 
market rate for an equivalent liability without a conversion feature, or where relevant, the redemption amount 
of the instrument.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are initially measured at their fair value and are subsequently measured at their amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method; this method allocates interest expense over the relevant period by 
applying the ‘effective interest rate’ to the carrying amount of the liability.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest method.
2.10 Current and deferred tax
Taxation represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit reported 
in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement 
of financial position date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or 
the liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it 
relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement  
of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset or liability is realised 
or settled.
2.11 Operating leases
All leases held by the Group are operating leases and, as such, are charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent-free periods or other incentives received for entering 
into a lease are accounted for over the lease term, so as to spread the benefit received.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.12 Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees (including directors).
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based upon the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will 
eventually vest, along with a corresponding increase in equity. At each statement of financial position date, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of 
non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised 
in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity reserves.
The fair value of share options is determined using a Black-Scholes model, taking into consideration 
management’s best estimate of the expected life of the option and the estimated number of shares that will 
eventually vest. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
2.13 Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. The amount charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the 
period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as 
either other liabilities or prepayments in the statement of financial position.
3. Financial risk management (see also note 15)
3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by management under policies approved by the Board of directors. 
Management identifies and evaluates financial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating segments. 
The Board provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as 
interest rate risk, non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
3.2 Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates.
3.3 Contractual risk
In the ordinary course of business the Group contracts with various parties. These contracts may include 
performance obligations, indemnities and contractual commitments. Management monitors the performance 
of the Group and any relevant counterparties against such contractual conditions to mitigate the risk of 
material, adverse non-compliance.
3.4 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to financial instruments  
fails to meet its contractual obligation. Credit risk arises from the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and  
receivables balances.
3.5 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  
This risk relates to the Group’s prudent liquidity risk management and implies maintaining sufficient cash. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity and cash and cash equivalents on the basis  
of expected cash flow. GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 38
3. Financial risk management (see also note 15) (continued)
3.6 Capital risk management
The Group’s capital structure is comprised entirely of the share capital and accumulated reserves.
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain adequate financial flexibility to preserve its ability 
to meet financial obligations, both current and long term. The capital structure of the Group is managed and 
adjusted to reflect changes in economic conditions.
The Group funds its expenditures on commitments from existing cash and cash equivalent balances. There are 
no externally imposed capital requirements.
Financing decisions are made by the Board of directors based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of 
capital and operating expenditure required to meet the Group’s commitments and development plans.
3.7 Fair value estimation
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their 
fair values because of the short-term nature of such assets and the effect of discounting liabilities is negligible.
3.8 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and 
judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are 
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates.
Reference is made in this note to accounting policies which cover areas that the directors consider require 
estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. These policies, together with references to the 
related notes to the financial statements, can be found below:

The Group recognised a charge in respect of doubtful receivables in each of the years ended 31 December 
2012 and 31 December 2013 of £9,845 and £106,880 respectively. The Group has not recognised any further 
allowances for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality on any 
receivable and the amounts are still considered fully recoverable.
Standard credit terms are 30 days. Debtor days at each year-end were:
At 
31 December 
2013
At 
31 December 
2012
Debtor days (Group and Company) 42 days 35 days
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables the Group considers any change in the credit quality of 
the receivable from the date credit was granted up to the reporting date. As set out in note 16, credit risk is 
mitigated by the fact that:
1. management monitors the debtor ledger closely on a frequent basis; and
2. a significant proportion of the Group’s customers are either large, publicly listed companies or owned by 
such entities.
Of the trade and other receivables financial instruments as at 31 December 2013, the Group has a concentration 
of credit risk exposure to one, single counterparty. The value of this receivable was £886,391. For the preceding 
years there was no such significant credit risk exposure. GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 48

The following trade and other receivable amounts were held in foreign currencies. The remaining balance was

The directors believe that the carrying value of trade and other receivables is considered to represent its fair 
value. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of 
receivable shown above. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

timeframe and no interest has been charged by any suppliers as a result of late payment of invoices. GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 50
15. Financial instruments
The Group is exposed to the risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the 
objectives, policies and processes of the Group for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. 
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout this financial information.
Capital risk management
The Group’s capital structure is comprised entirely of shareholders’ equity. The loan with the director  
Dermot S Smurfit was fully repaid during 2012.
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain adequate financial flexibility to preserve its ability 
to meet financial obligations, both current and long term. The capital structure of the Group is managed and 
adjusted to reflect changes in economic conditions.
The Group funds its expenditures on commitments from existing cash and cash equivalent balances. There are 
no externally imposed capital requirements.
Financing decisions are made by the Board of directors based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of 
capital and operating expenditure required to meet the Group’s commitments and development plans.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• Trade and other receivables
• Trade and other payables
• Cash and cash equivalents
• Borrowings
Financial assets

The Group’s directors monitor and manage the financial risks relating to the operation of the Group. These risks 
include market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
and interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk. Sales invoicing to customers is in UK Pound Sterling, United 
States Dollars and Euros and the majority of outgoing payments are in UK Pound Sterling with a small amount 
of United State Dollar payments.

15. Financial instruments (continued)
The Board carefully monitors exchange rate fluctuations and reviews their impact on the net asset and position 
of the Group. Exchange rates are negotiated with the Group’s main provider of banking services as and when 
needed. The Group does not enter into any derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign 
currency risk.
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at 
31 December are shown in notes 12, 13 and 14.
At each year-end, if the US Dollar, Euro and Australian Dollar had weakened by 10% against the UK Pound 
Sterling with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have increased/(decreased) by:
Impact of a movement  
in stated currencies of 10%  
on post-tax profit  
and impact on equity 
£’000
At 31 December 2012 (90)
At 31 December 2013 (205)
10% is the sensitivity rate that represents management’s assessment of the reasonable possible change in 
foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated 
monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year-end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. A 
positive version of the number above indicates an increase in profit or other equity where the UK Pound 
Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the UK Pound Sterling against 
the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity.
The differences are mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of US Dollar trade and 
other payables and Euro denominated trade and other receivables. 10% is deemed appropriate for the foreign 
exchange sensitivity analysis due to the current financial market.
Interest rate risk management
The Group has minimal exposure to interest rate risk. It is exposed to interest rate risk on some of its financial 
assets being its cash at bank balances. The interest rate receivable on these balances was at an average rate of 
1% during the year to 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: 1%). The directors currently believe that interest 
rate risk is at an acceptable level.
Due to its minimum exposure to interest rate risk, the Group has not prepared any sensitivity analysis.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial 
loss to the Group. Credit risk arises principally from the Group’s cash balances and trade and other receivables. 
The concentration of the Group’s credit risk is considered by counterparty, geography and currency.
The Group gives careful consideration to which organisations it uses for its banking services in order to 
minimise credit risk. The Group has a significant concentration of cash held on deposit with one large bank in 
the UK, an institution with an Aa3 credit rating (long term, as assessed by Moody’s). The amounts of cash held 
on deposit with that bank at each reporting date can be seen in the financial assets table.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows, although there have been no such 
impairments over the review year. Management considers the above measures to be sufficient to control the 
credit risk exposure. GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 52
15. Financial instruments (continued)
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall 
due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors. The Board manages 
liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the Group’s cash requirements by reference to short-term cash flow 
forecasts and medium-term working capital projections prepared by management.
At 31 December 2013 the Group had £16.9 million (31 December 2012: £1.67 million) of cash reserves.
Maturity of financial assets and liabilities
All of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and its financial assets in the years to 31 December 2013 and 
2012 are either payable or receivable within one year.

of preference shares into ordinary shares. Following this conversion, the entire ordinary shares of nominal value 
of 25p were subdivided into 43,413,425 shares by creation of 41,676,818 ordinary shares of 1p nominal value.  
On the same day shareholders approved a capital reduction whereupon the balance on share premium 
account was cancelled and the resulting reserve amounting to £10,696,000 credited to retained earnings.

18. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The number of shares in issue has 
been restated for the share split that occurred in 2013.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company has share options and 
a calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value 
(determined as the average market share price for the period) based on the monetary value of the subscription 
rights attached to the outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with 
the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

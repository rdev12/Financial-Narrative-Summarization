OVERVIEW
I am pleased to report that Capco had another successful year in 
2015, executing its strategy for its assets and generating strong 
returns for shareholders. Covent Garden and Earls Court have 
experienced a very active year and milestones have been reached  
at both of these unique London estates. 
PERFORMANCE
In 2015, Capco delivered positive performance with a total return  
of 17 per cent which represents the growth in net assets plus the 
dividends paid during the year. The valuation of the Group’s 
property assets increased by 14 per cent on a like-for-like basis  
and total shareholder return, which reﬂects the share price change 
and dividends paid, was 20 per cent. 
The strategy at Covent Garden to create an internationally 
renowned destination for retailers and visitors continues to drive 
performance. Following a positive year for leasing on the estate, new 
Zone A rental levels were achieved and we have continued to invest 
in the estate through strategic acquisitions and developments. 
Management remains conﬁdent that the ERV target of £100 million 
by December 2017 is on track. 
At Earls Court, our plans continue to advance. The team is 
demonstrating the capability to undertake complex and ambitious 
projects and to manage them successfully . The demolition of the 
former Earls Court Exhibition Centres is well-advanced and 
construction of Lillie Square is underway , with ﬁrst completions 
expected later this year.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 7 
The strategy to transfer the Venues business from Earls Court  
to Olympia London has been undertaken successfully and 
performance of the Venues business has exceeded expectations  
in this year of transition.
I would like to thank all of Capco’s employees for their hard work 
during the year. It is their commitment and expertise that allows 
Capco to continue to deliver our strategy and generate market-
leading returns for our shareholders.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND DIVIDENDS
Prudent ﬁnancing remains an important part of Capco’s strategy . 
The Board ensures that the Company maintains a strong balance 
sheet which will enable it to operate throughout the property cycle. 
The balance sheet is strong and ﬂexible with a conservative LTV of 
16 per cent. Following a Covent Garden reﬁnancing of £705 million, 
which has further strengthened the balance sheet, the Company is 
well-positioned to support its future activities with conﬁdence.
The Company continues to seek shareholder returns delivered 
through capital growth and a modest annual dividend. This is 
appropriate during a phase of capital investment and land value 
enhancement. Accordingly , the Directors are proposing a ﬁnal 
dividend of 1.0 pence per share, which brings the total dividend  
for 2015 to 1.5 pence per share.
THE BOARD AND ITS PRIORITIES
There were a number of changes to the Board during the year, with 
Gerry Murphy joining as an independent Non-executive Director 
and Andrew Huntley’s retirement.
Ian Henderson is to retire from the Capco Board and as Deputy 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM on 6 May 2016, and will step down as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 25 April 2016.  
The Board is pleased that Ian will remain available to the Company 
on a consultancy basis following his retirement from the Board, 
allowing the Company to continue to beneﬁt from his  
extensive experience.
Gerry Murphy will be appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee with effect from 25 April 2016, and Demetra Pinsent 
will join the Remuneration Committee on the same date. The role 
of Senior Independent Director will be taken up by Henry Staunton 
on Ian Henderson’s retirement. 
Anthony Steains has been appointed as a Non-executive Director  
of the Company with effect from 1 March 2016. On appointment, 
Anthony will become a member of the Nomination Committee.  
The Board is keen to ensure that a balance of skills and experience 
aligned to Capco’s strategic goals is maintained, and in 2016, will 
continue to consider whether any additional Non-executive 
Directors should be appointed. 
You can read more about Anthony Steains’ experience and our work on succession 
planning in the Nomination Committee report on page 65.  
Following the promotions of Gary Yardley and Soumen Das to the 
roles of Managing Director with responsibility for the oversight of 
and investment performance at Earls Court and Covent Garden 
respectively , the business has continued to evolve its operational 
structure. Operational functions have been further re-organised  
to embed and strengthen our focus on long-term returns from  
our assets. Both Managing Directors continue to report to  
Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive. The Board continues its 
commitment to encouraging diversity and the development  
of our people to ensure that Capco is resourced appropriately  
for the future. 
A RESPONSIBLE CULTURE
Capco seeks to generate market-leading returns with 
entrepreneurial ﬂair, whilst operating responsibly , professionally 
and with accountability . The Board encourages this culture 
throughout the business.
You can read more about Capco’s culture in our Corporate Responsibility report on page 49.  
Targeting ambitious returns requires us to ensure that risk is 
carefully managed. During the year, the Board undertook a 
comprehensive review of its principal risks and its risk 
management reporting across the business in order to ensure that 
the level of risk and return aspirations are appropriately balanced.
2015 saw our ﬁrst major demolition and construction projects begin 
at Earls Court and Lillie Square, and in preparation for this we 
reviewed our health and safety reporting across the Group and 
established a Group Safety Leadership Team.
Corporate Responsibility and how we conduct our business in  
the communities and environments in which we operate remains 
inherent in Capco’s strategy and culture. Our employees remain 
committed to our Corporate Responsibility programme and 
throughout the year we have supported a number of charitable 
fundraising initiatives including Maggie’s Culture Crawl, a quiz 
night in aid of the Sir Simon Milton Foundation and the Royal 
British Legion Poppy fundraising day for the fourth consecutive year. 
In addition, sustainability continues to play an important role in our 
business and activities on both of our estates are underpinned by an 
ambitious environmental and sustainability strategy .
LOOKING AHEAD
London’s economic prospects are positive and it is estimated that 
the population will grow signiﬁcantly over the next ten years. 
Capco’s two unique estates are well-placed to beneﬁt from this 
growth, providing vibrant and well-managed places for people  
to live, work and enjoy . Whilst we expect increasing market 
uncertainty due to global and political challenges, Capco’s strategy 
remains clear and focused. With a strong balance sheet we are 
well-positioned to continue to deliver long-term value creation  
for our shareholders.

Chief Executive’s review
OVERVIEW 
A year of performance and progress 
2015 was another year of performance and progress across Capco. 
Underpinned by a clear and focused strategy to drive value from 
our estates, the business has delivered a total return of 17 per cent.
With its focus on London, Capco’s two prime assets are well-placed 
for long-term success. London is a global and growing city with 
positive economic prospects and continues to attract businesses and 
people who wish to live, work and enjoy this great city . The 
population continues to increase and the Greater London Authority 
(“GLA”) estimates that the Capital’s population will grow by two 
million by 2031.
At Covent Garden, our distinct approach to placemaking and 
creative asset management will continue to ensure its success  
as a vibrant destination for retailers, visitors and residents. Our 
consented strategic land holding at Earls Court forms the only 
central London development opportunity of scale within existing 
strong transport infrastructure. As a designated GLA Opportunity 
Area, the Earls Court Masterplan is a strategic scheme for the 
Capital and a unique opportunity to create the next great estate  
of London, providing thousands of much-needed new homes  
and opportunities.
Capco continues to investigate new areas for investment 
opportunities where our core skills of placemaking and 
masterplanning can be utilised effectively . In 2015, we acquired  
a 50 per cent interest in the Solum Developments joint venture  
with Network Rail, which will allow us to explore potential 
opportunities for future redevelopments at signiﬁcant railway 
station sites across London.
The balance sheet is robust and disciplined with a conservative 
loan-to-value of 16 per cent and strong liquidity with £452 million 
of cash and available facilities, strengthened by the recent 
reﬁnancing at Covent Garden.
Valuations
The Group has beneﬁted from solid valuation performance 
following positive momentum across the business. The property 
portfolio is valued at £3.7 billion as at 31 December 2015, having 
grown by 14 per cent on a like-for-like basis over the year.
The Group has a 63 per cent controlling interest in Earls Court 
Partnership Limited (“ECPL”), the investment vehicle with 
Transport for London (“TfL”) which owns the land formerly 
occupied by the Earls Court Exhibition Centres. As a result, it is 
fully consolidated in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and 
TfL’s interest is represented as a non-controlling interest. See page 
41 of the Financial Review for further information.

Covent Garden – a leading global destination  
for brands and visitors 
Covent Garden is continuing its success as a leading global 
destination. Underpinned by our vision to position the estate at the 
forefront of global destinations for brands and visitors, 2015 was a 
strong year of performance and we are delighted to have signed our 
100
th
 brand to the estate.
Our asset management strategy , where every street has a plan, 
continues to attract global and premium brands while our creative 
approach to placemaking has continued to drive high quality footfall.
The estate is valued at £2.0 billion as at 31 December 2015,  
a like-for-like increase of 16 per cent. 2015 has been our most  
active year of leasing with 74 new lettings and renewals agreed  
at 11 per cent above December 2014 ERV . The ERV of the estate is 
£86 million, up 12 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Against this 
positive performance, we remain on course to deliver our ERV 
target of £100 million by December 2017 .
James Street established a new benchmark rental level reﬂecting the 
competition and the depth of demand for space on the street. A new 
Zone A rental level of £1,400 per square foot was achieved following 
lettings to Charlotte Tilbury and kikki.K who have both opened 
their ﬁrst London stores. Since the year-end, a new letting to 
cosmetics store, 3INA Cosmetics has set a new Zone A rental level of 
£1,475 per square foot.
The dining offer at Covent Garden has further strengthened and we 
are delighted to welcome SushiSamba, the iconic global restaurant, 
who will be moving into the Opera Terrace of the Market Building, 
one of the most prominent dining locations in London.
Covent Garden East Piazza Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 10 
The redevelopment of Kings Court is on track for completion in 
2017 and will transform pedestrian ﬂows on the north side of the 
estate. There has been positive interest from brands for this new 
development in line with the strategy to create an innovative retail 
and dining experience at Kings Court. 
We have continued to expand our presence on the estate through 
strategic acquisitions, investing £50 million on properties located 
at key access points to the estate. This takes the total invested in the 
estate since demerger in 2010 to over £500 million establishing one 
of the largest managed retail estates in London.
Earls Court – over 70 acres of consented strategic land in 
Chelsea and Fulham 
It has been a year of progress and momentum for our land interests 
at Earls Court. 
The valuation of Capco’s interests at Earls Court, represented by 
Earls Court Properties, has grown in the year to £1.4 billion. This 
represents an increase of 9 per cent over the year on a like-for-like 
basis beneﬁting from Capco’s strategy of driving value through 
planning, land assembly and land enablement as well as  
selective development. 
Our investment vehicle with TfL, ECPL, which is led by Capco, 
completed in April 2015 resulting in new 999 year leases over the 
former Exhibition Centres’ land. The signiﬁcant and complex 
demolition of the former Exhibition Centres, (“EC1 & EC2”), is 
successfully underway , as we continue to de-risk our land holdings 
in this part of the scheme. Demolition to ground level of the EC2 
building is now complete and demolition to ground level for the 
entire site is on track for completion this year. 
Artist’s impression of West Brompton Square
Detailed planning consent for West Brompton Village, a 1.2 acre site 
adjacent to the former Exhibition Centres, was granted by the Royal 
Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, bringing the total area for 
which detailed consent has been achieved to over 17 acres. 
Following the successful launch of Phase 1 of Lillie Square in 2014, 
construction is underway with ﬁrst completions on track for the 
second half of 2016. The ﬁrst phase is predominantly sold, 
crystallising over £250 million of sales and the average price per 
square foot for Phase 1 is approximately £1,500. 
The ﬁrst release of Phase 2 of Lillie Square which comprises  
70 units, was launched in September 2015; 40 per cent of this ﬁrst 
release has been reserved or exchanged. The residential sales 
market in London experienced challenging conditions towards the 
end of 2015 as a result of increasing supply , particularly in emerging 
locations, and regulatory intervention which has impacted 
demand. Whilst we remain conﬁdent in Lillie Square, the rate of 
sales has reduced compared to 2014, which reﬂects these challenges 
in the residential market. Nevertheless, sales prices achieved for 
Phase 2 are 5 per cent higher than comparable units in Phase 1, 
which reﬂects the strong location and transport connectivity  
of the scheme.

The Earls Court Masterplan is a unique opportunity to create the 
next great estate of London. The Masterplan is in one of the GLA’s 
designated Opportunity Areas, making it a strategic scheme for 
London. Against a backdrop of London’s rapidly growing 
population and its housing needs, options are being considered to 
intensify the Masterplan to optimise the development potential of 
this strategic project.
Venues – operational excellence
The Venues business performed very well in 2015 with EBITDA for 
the year of £15 million, up 33 per cent. Its valuation was up 25 per 
cent to £295 million on a like-for-like basis, reﬂecting its bright 
future prospects. 
Following the success of the transition of shows from the Earls 
Court Exhibition Centres, 2015 was Olympia London’s busiest year 
with over 200 events held and over 1.5 million visitors. It is now the 
venue of choice for premium shows in central London and 
continues to attract new events. 
As announced in November 2015, Capco is conducting a  
strategic review of its Venues business. A number of proposals  
are being explored as part of this review, including a sale or 
continued ownership.
OUTLOOK
Since our demerger in 2010, we have positioned Capco with two 
signiﬁcant prime estates in central London.
Covent Garden now comprises over one million square feet of 
retail-led space in the West End. In line with our ambitious vision 
to establish the estate as the leading world-class destination for 
retailers and visitors, we will continue to reposition the estate 
whilst maintaining our creative approach. We remain on track to 
achieve our ERV target of £100 million by December 2017 . We will 
invest selectively in acquisitions and developments which enhance 
the estate and meet our return expectations.
Earls Court comprises over 70 acres of consented strategic land in 
Chelsea and Fulham. As a GLA Opportunity Area, the Earls Court 
Masterplan is a key strategic site and the only consented scheme 
capable of scale in central London. Our focus will be on continued 
de-risking of our land holdings, through the complex demolition 
of the former Exhibition Centres, as well as exploring options to 
evolve and intensify the Masterplan in order to optimise the 
potential of this strategic scheme.
London’s status as a world class city continues. Its economic 
prospects are positive and the population is growing signiﬁcantly . 
With its focus on London, Capco’s two prime assets are well-placed 
for long-term success.
We expect increasing global and political uncertainty , while the 
challenging conditions seen in the residential market at the end  
of the year are expected to continue in 2016. Our strategy at Capco 
remains clear and focused and we are conﬁdent in the outlook for 
our prime estates which are backed by a robust capital structure. We 
enter a new year with conﬁdence to drive long-term value creation 
for our shareholders from our two exceptional London estates. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 12

selected to ensure clear alignment between  
its strategy , shareholder interests and 
remuneration of its employees
TOTAL PROPERTY RETURN
15.7%
TOTAL RETURN
16.6%
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
20.3%
1 Based on consensus estimates at 16 February 2016 for comparator group where results unavailable.
  The three-year total property return is calculated assuming annual reinvestment. Annualised three-year total return and total shareholder return are calculated on a basis 
consistent with the Group’s long-term incentive plans. A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level (including underlying 
earnings per share) or specifically relevant to each estate, for example ERV at Covent Garden and EBITDA at Venues. These are discussed further in the asset-specific operating 
reviews in the Strategic Report.
  All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors’ remuneration. These three indicators are carefully aligned with the Group’s strategy of creating and 
growing value and delivering market-leading total returns over the longer term. Total Property Return, underlying earnings per share and net asset value are linked to annual 
bonuses available to certain of the Group’s employees.

Total property return is calculated as capital 
growth including gains and losses on 
disposal plus rents received less associated 
costs, including ground rent
This metric allows comparability with the 
IPD Total Return All Property Index
Total return is the growth in EPRA 
adjusted, diluted NAV per share plus 
dividends per share during the year
Outperformance over a three-year period, 
versus the median of a comparator group  
of the nine largest constituents of the FTSE 
350 Real Estate Index, is identiﬁed as a key 
measure of the success of Capco’s strategy
Total shareholder return is the increase  
in the price of an ordinary share plus 
dividends during the year
The Group’s total shareholder return is 
benchmarked against the median total 
shareholder return of a comparator group 
of the nine largest constituents of the  
FTSE 350 Real Estate Index
As a key metric for the long-term equity-
based compensation for the Group’s 
employees, total shareholder return aligns 
incentives with shareholder interest

EFFECTIVE RISK 
MANAGEMENT
Through risk management and internal control 
systems the Group is able to identify , assess  
and prioritise risk within the business and  
seeks to minimise, control and monitor their 
impact on proﬁtability whilst maximising the 
opportunities they present
RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
Risk Management:
The Board has overall responsibility for 
Group risk management. It determines  
its risk appetite and reviews principal risks 
and uncertainties regularly , together with 
the actions taken to mitigate them. The 
Board has delegated responsibility for the 
review of the adequacy and effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control framework 
to the Audit Committee.
During 2015, a comprehensive review of 
risk management across the Group was 
undertaken. The purpose of the review  
was to set the right tone regarding risk  
at Board level and to develop a more risk 
aware culture and consistency in decision 
making across the organisation in line with 
the corporate strategy and risk appetite. 
Following the review, risk is now a standing 
agenda item at all management meetings. 
All corporate decision making takes risk 
into account while continuing to drive 
entrepreneurial culture.
The Executive Directors are responsible  
for the day to day operational and 
commercial activity across the Group  
and are therefore responsible for the 
management of business risk. The 
Executive Risk Committee, consisting  
of the Executive Directors, the General 
Counsel and the Financial Controller, is  
the executive level management forum for 
the review and discussion of risks, controls 
and mitigation measures. The corporate 
and business division risks are reviewed  
on a quarterly basis by the Executive Risk 
Committee so that trends and emerging 
risks can be identiﬁed and reported to  
the Board.  
Senior management from every division and 
corporate function of the business identify 
and manage the risks for their division or 
function and complete and maintain a risk 
register. The severity of each risk is assessed 
through a combination of each risk’s 
likelihood of an adverse outcome and its 
impact. In assessing impact, consideration  
is given to ﬁnancial, reputational and 
regulatory factors and risk mitigation plans

Risk Committee. The Directors conﬁrm that 
they have completed a robust assessment of 
the principal risks faced by the business, 
assisted by the work performed by the 
Executive Risk Committee. 
On the following pages are the principal 
risks and uncertainties from across the 
business and these are reﬂective of where 
the Board has invested time during  
the year. These principal risks are not 
exhaustive. The Group monitors a number 
of additional risks and adjusts those 
considered ‘principal’ as the risk proﬁle  
of the business changes. See also the risks 
inherent in the compilation of ﬁnancial 
information, as disclosed within note 1 
‘Principal Accounting Policies’ to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements,

VIABILITY STATEMENT 
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over the three-year period to December 2018, the period covered by the latest business 
plan, taking account of the Group’s current position and the potential impact of the principal risks disclosed on pages 15 - 17 . Based on this 
assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period to December 2018. In making this statement the Directors have considered the resilience of the 
Group, taking account of its current position, the risk appetite, the principal risks facing the business in severe but reasonable scenarios,  
and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. 
The business plan considers the Group’s cash ﬂows, capital commitments, ﬁnancial resources, debt covenants and other key ﬁnancial ratios. 
A sensitivity analysis was carried out which involved ﬂexing a number of these key assumptions underlying the three-year business plan 
both individually and together . This analysis was carried out to evaluate the potential impact of the Group’s principal risks actually 
occurring. The Directors believe that the Group is well-placed to manage its principal risks successfully . This assessment has considered  
the potential impacts of these risks on the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period. 
The Directors have determined that the three year period to December 2018 is an appropriate period over which to provide its viability 
statement. In making their assessment, the Directors have taken account of the Group’s robust and ﬂexible balance sheet position with a 
debt to asset ratio well below the 40 per cent limit set, substantial cash and available facilities, the Group’s ability to raise new ﬁnance and  
the ﬂexibility of future development expenditure.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A global destination in London’s West End
The Covent Garden estate continues to reinforce its 
position as a major global destination and address  
for retailers, visitors and residents, in the heart of 
London’s West End. Capco’s distinct approach to 
creating places attracts premium brands to Covent 
Garden and footfall remains consistently positive as 
visitors are drawn to the estate’s energy and unique 
retail, dining and cultural experience. 
Following another active year of leasing and investment 
activity , the Covent Garden estate remains on track to 
achieve its ERV target of £100 million by 2017 .
Overview
Providing over one million square feet of lettable 
space in London’s West End, the Covent Garden estate 
represents 55 per cent of Capco’s portfolio. At Covent 
Garden, Capco drives value creation through asset 
management, strategic investment and creativity , 
underpinned by a vision to consistently compete as 
one of the world’s best retail and dining destinations 
for brands and visitors. 
Covent Garden performed positively in 2015 with  
the value of the estate up 15.9 per cent on a like-for-
like basis to £2.0 billion. ERV was £86.2 million,  
a like-for-like increase of 12.1 per cent following an 
active year of leasing which reﬂects the success of  
the estate’s focused strategy to drive rental growth. 
Reﬂecting the depth of demand from retailers,  
74 new lettings and renewals were negotiated 
(including transactions under offer at year-end and 
signed in 2016) securing £11.9 million of passing rent, 
11 per cent above the 31 December 2014 ERV level. 
EPRA occupancy remains high at 98 per cent and 
footfall is consistently strong at over 42 million 
customer visits per year.
As the owner of the Covent Garden estate, Capco 
regularly hosts events on and around the Piazza which 
supports the estate’s cultural offering. In September, a 
major installation by French artist Charles Pétillon 
saw the South Hall of the Market Building ﬁlled with 
over 100,000 balloons. The installation “Heartbeat” 
featured a pulsing light display and symbolised the 
Market Building as the beating heart of central 
London. This innovative exhibit enjoyed positive 
reviews and received global media attention. 
Capco continues to work closely with community 
stakeholders including Westminster City Council 
(“WCC”) and the Covent Garden Area Trust (“CGAT”) 
to maintain and celebrate the attributes which make 
the area unique.

Retail
Retailer demand for space at Covent Garden continues 
to be positive. Continued curation of a contemporary 
luxury tenant mix where every street has a plan,  
fresh concepts and “global ﬁrst” stores has positioned  
Covent Garden at the forefront of demand for street 
retail in London. 
James Street is now an established destination for 
global retailers coming to London. The depth of 
demand for a presence on James Street has led to a 
strong progression of rental growth on the street. 
Cosmetics store, 3INA Cosmetics, is the latest tenant to 
choose James Street for their ﬁrst London store, setting 
a new Zone A high of £1,475 per square foot which 
compares to a Zone A rental level of £1,000 per square 
foot for the street as at 31 December 2014. This follows 
lettings during the year to premium cosmetics brand 
Charlotte Tilbury , which opened its ﬁrst stand-alone 
store and premium Australian stationery brand 
kikki.K, which also opened its ﬁrst London store, both 
at a Zone A rental level of £1,400 per square foot. 
The “Street to Suit” strategy to reposition Henrietta 
Street with a contemporary menswear focus and 
complementary dining offer has proven successful with 
nine retail and dining brands introduced to date. 
International retailer, Club Monaco, is the latest brand 
to take space and brings its classic yet modern clothing 
and accessories to Henrietta Street. The street now 
offers an array of premium menswear brands including 
Nigel Cabourn, The Real McCoy’s, Oliver Sweeney  
and Edwin. 
Following the trading success of its ﬁrst stand-alone 
cosmetics store, Chanel has signed a new lease to move 
to a larger unit in the north-east of the Market Building. 
The new unit will offer Chanel almost 50 per cent 
additional space to enhance its presence on the estate. 
King Street’s contemporary luxury offering has 
continued to expand with a new letting to French 
cosmetics brand NARS, which will open its ﬁrst London 
standalone store on the street. This follows the 
introduction of Parisian womenswear concept, Claudie 
Pierlot, and Italian knitwear brand, Stefanel, both of 
which opened earlier in the year.
Dining 
Covent Garden has experienced an active year for new 
restaurant lettings, further enhancing the estate’s 
reputation for destination dining. 
Renowned fusion dining restaurant, SushiSamba, has 
agreed terms to let the Opera Terrace, located above the 
Market Building with exceptional views across the 
Piazza. Plans for the unique dining space will see the 
existing glass structure replaced with a new Eric Parry 
design, creating an iconic structural addition to this 
historic London landmark. 
Adding to the depth of variety on the estate, Aubaine 
will open their latest delicatessen, bringing their 
successful French cuisine to the Market Building.
With brands 
including Charlotte 
Tilbury, kikki.K and 
3INA Cosmetics 
choosing James Street 
for their ﬁrst London 
stores, this prime street 
is now established  
as a destination  
for global retailers

HENRIETTA STREET TRANSFORMS
Covent Garden
Henrietta Street’s dining offer has been further 
strengthened with the introduction of two new 
restaurants. Gregory Marchand, through his 
successful Parisian restaurant Frenchie, has taken 
space for its ﬁrst London restaurant which has 
recently opened. Flat Iron steakhouse has opened its 
latest London restaurant occupying over 4,000 square 
feet, its largest space to date. 
On King Street, Mariage Frères, the iconic French tea 
house, will open its ﬁrst standalone store outside of 
Paris offering a tea emporium, café and store 
comprising over 8,000 square feet. Governance Financial statements Strategic report

Acquisitions
Capco has continued to expand its presence on the estate 
through strategic acquisitions. During the year, new 
properties were acquired for a total consideration of  
£50 million, representing £2.2 million of ERV . 
The acquisition of 30-33 Henrietta Street for £16 million 
has further consolidated Capco’s holdings on this 
strategic street. The building offers the opportunity of 
repositioning of the retail units and conversion of the 
upper ﬂoors. 
 31-33 Bedford Street was acquired for £32 million in the 
ﬁrst half of the year offering prime retail frontage. This 
follows the acquisition of 10-14 Bedford Street in 2014 and 
further enhances Capco’s presence on the street, a key 
access point to the estate. 
Residential and ofﬁces 
Demand for residential at Covent Garden continues.  
The letting market has been particularly strong with  
35 new lettings completed during the year. The 
Southampton, a premium residential development  
of seven apartments for rent, established a rental tone  
of £65-70 per square foot and have all been leased.  
Recent residential conversions of units on the upper 
ﬂoors of King Street and Henrietta Street have proved 
extremely successful with rents on certain units 
achieving over £80 per square foot. 
At The Beecham, a luxury development of nine 
apartments for sale or rental overlooking the Piazza,  
six apartments have now been sold or are under offer  
at an average price per square foot of £2,800. 
Establishing a new benchmark for prime office space,  
35 King Street, the ﬁrst new office development on the 
estate, has been leased to a digital agency for £77 per 
square foot.
Developments 
The Kings Court and Carriage Hall developments 
continue to progress positively . The schemes will 
transform pedestrian ﬂow in the area, creating a new 
connecting passage from Long Acre to King Street, 
unlocking the potential to extend Capco’s placemaking 
approach through to Floral Street. 
Kings Court will provide over 85,000 square feet (NIA)  
of space through eight retail and two restaurant units 
centred around a new public courtyard as well as 45 
premium apartments above the development. Carriage 
Hall includes the refurbishment of 15,000 square feet 
(NIA) and plans include the provision of a double height 
covered atrium. 
 The Kings Court and Carriage Hall schemes are on track 
to complete in 2017 . The total development cost is 
expected to be approximately £100 million, an increase  
of circa 8 per cent. Material changes are not expected to 
the total development cost going forward. 
Work progressed on Kings Court throughout 
2015. This new mixed use development will 
open up a pedestrian route between Floral 
Street and King Street, establishing new high 
quality residential, retail and restaurant space
ON SITE AT KINGS COURT
FUTURE PRIORITIES 
Through its creative vision at Covent Garden, Capco 
remains committed to enhancing the estate’s reputation 
as a leading global retail and dining destination for 
premium brands and visitors. 
The strategy at Covent Garden remains focused on 
driving value through creative asset management and 
strategic investment. The estate’s repositioning strategy , 
where every street has a plan is underway with initiatives 
across the estate. In particular, building on the success  
of Henrietta Street’s ‘Street to Suit’ strategy and 
repositioning the Royal Opera House Arcade with luxury 
gifting and accessories, following successful pop-up 
lettings in the year, will be key areas of activity . 
The Kings Court and Carriage Hall schemes are 
progressing well and are on track for completion in 2017 . 
The developments are a unique opportunity to transform 
pedestrian ﬂow in the area and extend Capco’s 
placemaking approach through Floral Street and King 
Street, unlocking further value potential in these key 
parts of the estate. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 28

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Over 70 acres of consented strategic land in 
central London
The Earls Court Masterplan covers over 70 acres of prime, 
consented, strategic land in central London. The scheme, 
which is located in Chelsea and Fulham is the largest 
regeneration opportunity in central London and is 
currently consented to provide over 7 ,500 new homes 
(including Lillie Square), creating 10,000 new jobs, and 
will deliver over £450 million of community beneﬁts. 
 The scheme is located in an established premium 
neighbourhood with history and heritage and is well 
connected, offering existing strong public transport 
connectivity . Underpinned by Capco’s distinct approach 
to creating places, the Earls Court Masterplan represents 
an opportunity to create the next great estate for London.
Earls Court is one of the Greater London Authority’s 
(“GLA”) 45 designated ‘opportunity areas’ making it a 
strategic scheme for the Capital. According to the London 
Plan, London’s population is expected to grow by

two million to 10 million by 2031 and the provision of 
housing is a key priority , with the Capital needing over 
40,000 new homes per annum. Against this backdrop 
of London’s housing need, the GLA increased the 
housing designation for Earls Court to at least 7 ,500 
new homes in its latest revision of the London Plan  
in January 2014.
Earls Court Properties represents Capco’s interests  
in Earls Court, which principally comprise: 
 ◦ 63 per cent interest in ECPL: the investment vehicle 
with TfL in respect of EC1 & EC2, and including 
certain other assets on and around Lillie Road
 ◦ 100 per cent of the Empress State Building 
 ◦ 50 per cent interest in the Lillie Square joint venture
In addition, in 2013 Capco exercised its option under 
the Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”), a 
binding agreement in relation to the West Kensington 
and Gibbs Green Estates. 
Plans at Earls Court are progressing well with 
demolition of the Exhibition Centres underway and 
construction of Phase 1 of Lillie Square on track with 
ﬁrst completions expected in the second half of this 
year. This positive momentum is reﬂected in the 
valuation which has increased to £1.4 billion (Group 
share), a like-for-like increase of 9.2 per cent. 
The Masterplan is located in two London Boroughs,  
the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the 
London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham. Capco 
continues to work positively and constructively with  
all its stakeholders. 
The Earls Court Masterplan saw continued progress 
and achieved a number of milestones throughout 2015.

Continued planning momentum
Capco continues to create value through the planning 
process at Earls Court. In March 2015, detailed 
planning consent was granted by the Royal Borough 
of Kensington and Chelsea for West Brompton 
Village. The consent will deliver a public square, a 
residential apartment building, townhouses, and 
three retail units across 1.2 acres. Following detailed 
planning achieved for Earls Court Village in 2014, this 
brings the total area for which detailed consent has 
been achieved to over 17 acres.
Signiﬁcant progress in land assembly and 
land enablement 
ECPL, the venture with TfL in respect of EC1 & EC2, 
completed in April 2015. ECPL is a UK limited company 
and owns 999 year leases over the EC1 & EC2 land 
together with certain other adjacent properties 
acquired from Capco on completion, primarily located 
on or around Lillie Road. Capco owns a 63 per cent share 
and is leading the venture following its appointment as 
exclusive business and development manager. 
Demolition of the former Exhibition Centres to 
ground level is progressing well and is on track for 
completion in the second half of 2016. As previously 
stated, the total cost of this phase of demolition is  
£50 – £60 million.
Capco continues to consolidate its ownership in the 
Masterplan area, acquiring a number of smaller assets 
which will enhance the implementation of the 
scheme. £30 million of acquisitions were made during 
the year, of which £17 million were acquired by ECPL. 
In November 2013, Capco exercised its option under 
the CLSA relating to West Kensington and Gibbs 
Green Estates. Capco to date has paid £45 million of 
the £105 million cash consideration including the ﬁrst 
of ﬁve annual instalments of £15 million which was 
paid in December 2015. Plans are progressing towards 
the construction of Block D of Lillie Square which will 
facilitate the ﬁrst phase of replacement homes for the 
residents of the estates.
The Earls Court Masterplan achieved outline planning 
consent for 10.1 million square feet in 2012. Due to its 
scale, there will remain a risk of protests or legal 
challenges (ranging from complaints about noise 
through to judicial reviews or applications for listing) 
against speciﬁc aspects of the scheme as it is progressed. 
It should be noted that all such challenges to date have 
been successfully defended however future challenges  
of this nature cannot be discounted.

LILLIE 
SQUARE
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The Lillie Square development is a one million square 
feet (Gross External Area (“GEA”)) residential scheme 
located adjacent to the Earls Court Masterplan. Providing 
608 private and 200 affordable homes, across three 
phases, Lillie Square delivers modern garden-square 
living in one of the most centrally-located and well-
connected schemes in London. 
The valuation of Capco’s 50 per cent interest in Lillie 
Square, which is held in a joint venture with the Kwok 
Family Interests (“KFI”), increased to £222 million,  
a like-for-like increase of 4.0 per cent over the year. 
Phase 1 launched successfully in 2014 and is 
predominantly sold, crystallising value through £250 
million of sales in this part of the scheme. The average 
price per square foot for Phase 1 is approximately £1,500 
with individual premium units achieving over £2,200  
per square foot. 
The ﬁrst release of Phase 2 of Lillie Square, which 
comprises 70 units, was launched in September 2015;  
40 per cent of this ﬁrst release has been reserved or 
exchanged. The rate of sales has reduced compared to 
2014, reﬂecting challenging conditions in the residential 
sales market. However, sales prices achieved for Phase 2 
are 5 per cent higher than comparable units in Phase 1, 
which reﬂects the strong location and transport 
connectivity of the scheme.
Construction of Phase 1 is underway and progressing 
positively with ﬁrst completions on track for delivery in 
2016. Construction of the private element of the scheme  
is expected to cost £400 million.

FUTURE PRIORITIES 
Capco remains committed to its strategy to create value 
through planning, land assembly , land enablement and 
selective development through its land holdings at  
Earls Court. 
At Earls Court, the focus of activities this year will be the 
completion of the complex and signiﬁcant demolition  
of the former Exhibition Centres to ground level. In 
addition, Capco will continue to selectively acquire small 
but important assets around the Masterplan area, which 
will enhance the overall implementation of the scheme.  
 At Lillie Square, the focus is on construction of Phase 1 
and delivery of the ﬁrst completions in 2016, together 
with sales of Phase 2. 
The Earls Court Masterplan is currently consented for 
10.1 million square feet of residential-led space and is a 
designated GLA opportunity area, making it a strategic 
scheme for the Capital. With a rising population and 
London’s forecast housing needs, maximising 
opportunity areas is vital in order to meet London’s 
housing demands and options are being considered 
which enhance and maximise the potential of this 
important London scheme.

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
The reinvigorated Venues business performed ahead of 
expectations in 2015 reﬂecting the positive transition of 
shows from the Earls Court Exhibition Centres. EBITDA 
for the year was £15 million, up 33 per cent. This is 
reﬂected in the positive valuation performance, which 
has increased 24.7 per cent to £295 million on a like-for-
like basis.
2015 was Olympia London’s busiest year with over 200 
events held and over 1.5 million visitors. Transitioned 
shows, including the Ideal Home Show and International 
Book Fair, have been successfully held at this reinvigorated 
venue. Olympia London is now the venue of choice for 
premium shows in central London and continues to attract 
new shows.
Following this successful transition, Capco announced in 
November 2015 that it is conducting a strategic review of 
its Venues business. A number of proposals are being 
explored as part of this review, including a sale or 
continued ownership.

Financial review
EPRA adjusted, diluted net assets per share rose 16.1 per cent during 
the year, increasing from 311 pence at 31 December 2014 to 361 pence. 
This 50 pence increase together with the 1.5 pence dividend paid 
during the year represents a total return of 16.6 per cent.
At Covent Garden continued growth in estimated rental values 
(“ERV”) was the main driver of the increase in the value of the estate 
by 15.3 per cent (15.9 per cent like-for-like). 
The market value of Earls Court Properties, which comprises  
the Group’s interests at Earls Court, has increased by 8.4 per cent  
(9.2 per cent like-for-like), primarily as a result of further de-risking 
of the development scheme through the completion of property 
transfers to ECPL (the investment vehicle with TfL) and progress 
with demolition of the Earls Court Exhibition Centres.

Basis of preparation
In line with the requirements of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ 
(“IFRS 11”) the Group is required to present its joint ventures  
under the equity method in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Under the equity method, the Group’s interest in joint ventures  
is disclosed as a single line item in both the consolidated balance 
sheet and consolidated income statement rather than 
proportionally consolidating the Group’s share of assets,  
liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis. 
Internally the Board focuses on and reviews information and 
reports prepared on a proportionate consolidation basis, which 
includes the Group’s share of joint ventures. Therefore, to align 
with the way the Group is managed, this ﬁnancial review presents 
the ﬁnancial position, performance and cash ﬂow analysis on a 
proportionate consolidation basis. Continuing and discontinuing 
operations have also been combined.

were transferred into ECPL which occurred simultaneously with  
a grant of 999 year headleases by the freeholder, TfL, to ECPL. 
Other adjacent property interests, primarily located on and  
around Lillie Road, were also transferred into ECPL. 
ECPL is held 63 per cent by the Group and 37 per cent by TfL. ECPL 
is fully consolidated within the Group’s ﬁnancial statements as the 
Group holds the controlling interest. At completion, the grant of 
999 year headleases over EC1 & EC2 was treated as an acquisition  
of property and fully consolidated. The transaction resulted in an 
increase in the carrying value of investment and development 
property (£419.1 million) which was offset by loan notes payable  
to TfL (£374.7 million) and TfL’s non-controlling interest share  
in capital (£44.4 million), both of which are recognised in equity . 
Due to the signiﬁcance of this transaction and to aid comparability 
to the previously reported position, a reconciliation to the Group’s 
share of property , net debt and other assets and liabilities is 
included in the summary adjusted balance sheet.
Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”)
In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA, 
which it entered into with the London Borough of Hammersmith  
& Fulham (“LBHF”), for the purchase of the West Kensington  
and Gibbs Green housing estates (the “Estates”). The overall 
consideration payable is expected to be £105 million cash plus the 
planning requirement to provide up to 760 replacement homes.
The CLSA remains unrecognised in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements of the Group as its main underlying asset (the land 
relating to the Estates) does not currently meet the recognition 
criteria under IFRS required for investment and development 
property . Annual payments of £15 million commenced in December 
2015. Where amounts are paid prior to the transfer of property , they 
will be carried on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet as 
prepayments against future land draw down. Of the £45 million 
paid to date, £15 million relates to the acquisition of two properties 
and £30 million is held as a prepayment. The remaining future 
payments totalling £60 million are disclosed as a capital 
commitment. A transfer from prepayment to investment and 
development property will occur once the risks and rewards of 
ownership have passed to the Group. Once this occurs, in line  
with the Group’s accounting policy , the land will become subject  
to bi-annual valuation with any uplift reﬂected in the Group’s 
reported net asset measure.  Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 42

Investment, development and trading property
The revaluation surplus on the Group’s property portfolio was £461.6 million during the year, a 13.9 per cent gain on a like-for-like basis 
compared with the IPD Capital Return for the equivalent period of 7 .8 per cent.
Total property return for the year was 15.7 per cent, outperforming the IPD Total Return index which recorded a 13.8 per cent return for 
the corresponding period.
Trading property is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value therefore valuation surpluses  
on trading property are not recorded. Any unrecognised surplus is however reﬂected within the EPRA adjusted net asset measure.  
At 31 December 2015, the unrecognised surplus on trading property was £99.9 million, up from £96.3 million at 31 December 2014.  
This primarily arises on trading property at Lillie Square. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 43 
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan-to-
value (“LTV”). LTV is calculated on the basis of net debt divided by 
the carrying value of the Group’s property portfolio. The Group 
focuses most on an LTV measure that includes the notional share  
of joint venture interests but excludes the share of the non-
controlling interest. The LTV of 16.4 per cent remains comfortably 
within the Group’s limit of no more than 40 per cent. In January 
2016 the £665 million Covent Garden facility was replaced by a new 
£705 million Covent Garden debt facility which has increased 
available facilities by £40 million. The table below includes the  
pro forma impact of the facility .
Pro forma 2015 2014
Loan to value 16.4% 12.1%
Interest cover 123% 188%
Weighted average debt maturity 5.3 years 4.1 years 5.1 years
Weighted average cost of debt 2.8% 3.3% 3.4%
Proportion of Group share gross 
debt with interest rate protection 91% 94%
The Group’s policy is to substantially eliminate the medium and 
long-term risk arising from interest rate volatility . The Group’s 
banking facilities are arranged on a ﬂoating rate basis but swapped 
to ﬁxed rate or capped using derivative contracts. At 31 December 
2015 the proportion of Group’s share of gross debt with interest  
rate protection was 91 per cent (2014: 94 per cent). In January 2016 
additional derivative contracts have been entered into taking 
advantage of the historically low market rates.
The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants.
At 31 December 2015 the Group had capital commitments of  
£211.1 million (£206.5 million Group share) compared to £171.4 
million at 31 December 2014. The increase is mainly attributable  
to the Kings Court construction contract.

The completion of ECPL on 2 April 2015 resulted in additions to 
property of £419.1 million which was offset by a non-controlling 
interest in equity . Excluding this, acquisitions during the year were 
£80.1 million, £50.0 million at Covent Garden and £30.1 million 
around the Earls Court Masterplan area.
Debt and gearing
The Group share of net debt increased by £227 .1 million to £578.9 
million, principally as a result of further investment in the business 
through property acquisitions and subsequent expenditure. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 44

CASH FLOW
A summary of the Group’s cash ﬂow for the year ended 31 December 
2015 is presented below:
2015 
£m
2014 
£m
Operating cash ﬂows after interest and tax 6.5 19.4
Purchase and development of property,  
plant and equipment (282.9) (259.8)
Investment in joint venture (12.5) –
Sales proceeds from property and investments 17.8 8.1
Deferred consideration on purchase  
of subsidiary (7.1) –
Pension funding – (0.8)
Net cash ﬂow before ﬁnancing (278.2) (233.1)
Issue of shares 0.1 252.1
Financing 275.2 58.9
Dividends paid (7.7) (11.0)
Net cash ﬂow (10.6) 66.9
Operating cash inﬂows were £6.5 million compared with cash 
inﬂows of £19.4 million for 2014, as a result of an increase in net 
working capital requirements. 
During the year £102.8 million was invested at Covent Garden for 
the purchase of three properties, completion of a property that had 
exchanged in the prior year and subsequent expenditure. At Earls 
Court £36.4 million was invested in land assembly and £132.4 
million was spent on subsequent expenditure for the construction 
of Lillie Square Phase 1, the demolition of the Earls Court 
Exhibition Centres and transaction costs associated with the 
completion of ECPL.
On 29 June 2015, the Group acquired a 50 per cent interest in Solum 
Developments, a joint venture arrangement with Network Rail 
Infrastructure Limited for £12.5 million. The joint venture will 
explore opportunities for future redevelopments on and around 
signiﬁcant railway stations in London.
Net borrowings drawn during the year were £210.9 million. 
Financing from TfL (i.e. the non-controlling interest) of  
£64.7 million was received to settle the non-controlling interest 
share of ECPL completion costs and subsequent expenditure on  
the demolition of Earls Court Exhibition Centres. 
Dividends paid of £7 .7 million reﬂect the ﬁnal dividend payment 
made in respect of the 2014 ﬁnancial year and the 2015 interim 
dividend paid in September. This was lower than the previous year 
due to a higher take up of the scrip dividend alternative, 51 per cent 
versus 11 per cent in 2014.
The Group’s cash and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 
2015 were £422.4 million (£412.1 million Group share). On a pro 
forma basis, adjusting for the increase in available facilities as a 
result of the new Covent Garden facility , the Group’s cash and 
undrawn committed facilities are £462.4 million (£452.1 million 
Group share).

Administration expenses
Administration expenses have increased by 22.1 per cent to £52.8 
million. Certain activities previously capitalised to the EC1 & EC2 
properties are now treated as overheads following the completion 
of ECPL and this will also increase reported administration 
expenses going forward. This change together with an increased 
headcount in line with expansion of the Group’s activities has 
resulted in the increase in administration expenses.
Net ﬁnance costs
Net ﬁnance costs have increased by 33.6 per cent to £20.1 million  
as a result of the increased net debt.
Taxation
The total tax charge for the year was £2.7 million which is made  
up of both underlying tax and non-underlying tax.
Tax on underlying proﬁts for 2015 reﬂects a rate of 20 per cent,  
in line with the current rate of UK corporation tax. This is offset  
by an adjustment in respect of previous years leading to an  
underlying tax credit of £3.0 million. Following the Chancellor’s 
announcement in the July 2015 Budget, the main rate of 
corporation tax will fall to 19 per cent from April 2017 and  
18 per cent from April 2020.
Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable on a 
theoretical disposal of all investment property held by the Group, 
was £17 .6 million. This relates to the properties held by ECPL which 
is a UK limited company . A disposal of the Group’s trading property 
at market value would result in a corporation tax charge to the 
Group of £20.2 million (20.25 per cent of £99.9 million).
The Group’s tax policy , which has been approved by the Board and 
has been disclosed to HM Revenue & Customs, is aligned with the 
business strategy . The Group seeks to protect shareholder value  
by structuring operations in a tax efficient manner, with external 
advice as appropriate, which complies with all relevant tax law  
and regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation as  
a responsible taxpayer. As a Group, we are committed to acting in  
an open and transparent manner.
Consistent with the Group’s policy of complying with relevant  
tax obligations and its goal in respect of its stakeholders, the  
Group maintains a constructive and open working relationship 
with HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining 
advance clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment  
may be uncertain.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be 
paid on 21 June 2016 to shareholders on the register at 27 May 2016. 
Subject to SARB approval a scrip dividend alternative will be offered.
Going concern
At 31 December 2015 the Group’s cash and undrawn committed 
facilities were £422.4 million and its capital commitments were 
£211.1 million. With weighted average debt maturity exceeding four 
years, LTV of 16.4 per cent and sufficient headroom against all 
ﬁnancial covenants, there continues to be a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and Group will have adequate resources to meet 
both on-going and future commitments for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly , the Directors have prepared the 2015 Annual Report  
& Accounts on a going concern basis.

Respecting the environment and communities in which we operate underpins our 
strong commitment to creating public value and delivering our strategy with integrity .
Our continued programme of CR activity reﬂects our desire to have a positive social and 
environmental impact in the Capital. Capco retains a reputation for sympathetic 
stewardship of Covent Garden and innovative urban creation at Earls Court. We have 
developed a robust internal management of community , environmental and people 
matters and hence the Board has decided that CR should now be reported directly  
to the Board instead of through the Corporate Responsibility Committee. The CR 
Executive Committee will continue to manage the Group’s day to day CR activities.
 We will continue to focus our charitable activity on social improvements in London, 
including youth employment, education and homelessness as we have identiﬁed these 
as important to the City’s future success.
Our CR strategy continues to develop as our business plan is delivered and we regularly 
review progress against our targets. This year we have taken the opportunity to refresh 
our CR reporting. We have included our performance against our key targets for 2015, 
and you can view performance against all our 2015 CR targets on our website.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
Company strategy and over-arching corporate objectives are 
communicated bi-annually by the Executive Directors, and Heads 
of Business Units ensure that their team objectives align with 
corporate strategy .
Annual performance objectives for individuals are agreed at 
performance review meetings which take place at the beginning  
of the calendar year. Performance is measured against objectives set 
for the previous year and individual performance ratings underpin 
bonus awards which are paid in April of each year.
We regard the giving of regular and direct feedback as a core 
competency of effective leadership and encourage line managers  
to appraise performance regularly during the year.
TALENT
Our aim is to manage talent effectively and ensure that we have 
sufficient capability to realise our ambitious strategy . We regularly 
undertake succession planning exercises to review the talent 
pipeline and progress individuals according to capability .
We recruit top graduates each year who pursue an internal 
programme of training and mentoring which will ensure they are 
well prepared for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
(“RICS”) Assessment of Professional Competence (“APC”). Each 
graduate is assigned an experienced Capco counsellor and 
supervisor who guides them through the APC process.
New opportunities that arise in the business are advertised 
internally and we prefer to promote internal candidates in order 
to enhance career development and encourage mobility across  
the Group.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Capco training and development programmes are designed  
to augment the bench strength of our teams and challenge  
aspiring leaders.
Individual training and development needs are identiﬁed and 
discussed at performance review meetings with line managers. 
During 2015, our employees spent 452 hours on training activity , 
against a target of 400 hours.
Through our sponsorship of individuals undertaking further 
professional qualiﬁcations, we encourage continuous learning 
reﬂecting our intention to create a learning environment. 
In order to promote knowledge transfer across the Group, we  
run a series of ‘lunch and learn’ sessions, where business leaders 
showcase their strategy to other employees, in order to enhance 
understanding of wider business objectives.
During 2015 we ran a bespoke training programme for  
Personal Assistants covering aspects of professionalism and 
organisational skills.
Our Essential Management Skills programme concluded in the  
ﬁrst quarter of 2015 and was supplemented by a 360 degree 
feedback exercise for rising stars within the business.
We recognise that coaching and mentoring can have signiﬁcant 
impact on behaviours and key staff continued to beneﬁt from 
bespoke coaching programmes.
Corporate responsibility continued
PEOPLE
People are the key to our success and we are proud 
of our team ethos and results oriented approach.

AT CAPCO WE ENCOURAGE COLLABORATIVE WORKING 
WITHIN AND ACROSS TEAMS
CULTURE
The high performance culture at Capco is reﬂective of the 
ambitious and innovative business strategy .
Typically , Capco people are results-driven and brave in their 
approach to new ideas. Many of our people are in new roles and 
have assumed increased levels of responsibility since joining Capco.
The three tenets of our corporate behaviour are: Collaboration, 
Creativity and Courage. These three aspects formed the basis of 
behavioural discussions across the business last year.
We believe that every person in the Company has a part to play in 
generating value and we understand fully the beneﬁts of a diverse 
workforce. We have a good track record of developing the careers  
of senior women and 50 per cent of the senior management team 
are female. 
We support parents returning after childbirth and encourage  
our people to adopt a healthy attitude to work-life balance.
BENEFITS
In addition to core elements, we reward people with an attractive 
package of additional beneﬁts. 
Our competitive package of beneﬁts includes private medical 
insurance and also covers dental treatment. The Company 
contributes up to 10 per cent of salary into the MyCapco  
pension scheme.
We have enhanced parental arrangements and encourage 
new parents to take their full entitlement to parental leave.
Our policy is to enable employees to take their full annual leave 
entitlement of 28 days per annum, rising to 30 days after four  
years’ service.
LIFESTYLE PROGRAMME
In September, we launched a new programme of lifestyle beneﬁts 
designed to assist Capco people with some of the issues that are 
important in their lives.
The programme included assistance with ﬁnancial planning, 
mortgage advice and the support of a specialist will writer.
We have partnered with a leading childcare adviser who will assist 
our working parents to ﬁnd a suitable childcare solution.
REWARD
The aim of our reward strategy is to compensate people for high 
performance and to incentivise them to strive to improve.
Core compensation packages at Capco comprise three elements 
of base salary , discretionary performance bonus and discretionary 
share awards.
We regularly benchmark our approach to reward to ensure that we 
remain competitive in the market and we aim to remain within the 
upper quartile range of our sector.
Awards are made in April of each year and take account of 
performance ratings discussed at performance review meetings  
in January .
All Capco employees are eligible to receive share awards so that 
everyone can participate in the success of the Company . These 
awards have a three-year performance period and are subject to 
corporate performance conditions.

SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES
Community initiatives
A programme of local community clubs and activities in the Earls 
Court area is now well established, delivering several community 
beneﬁts through Fulham Boys School (“FBS”). 
Children from the West Kensington & Gibbs Green estates were 
given the opportunity to take part in free educational and sporting 
activities using state of the art equipment, educational and sporting 
facilities funded by Capco at FBS. 
There has been a high level of take up of all clubs providing the 
potential to expand on the current programme, offering new clubs 
and additional opportunities to access activities. 
Covent Garden Management Plan
Capco has signed an agreement with Westminster City Council 
(“WCC”) which sets out the basis of collaboration for the 
management of the public realm of the Covent Garden area. The 
document is in keeping with Capco’s commitment to ensuring both 
the smooth running of servicing operations and enhancing public 
safety . Achievements include Capco lowering street access across the 
Covent Garden estate to enable access for vehicles. In addition, 
Capco and WCC have agreed to split responsibility for cleaning and 
gum removal in the district, with Capco focusing on King Street, 
Floral Street and Rose Street and litter picking on James Street.
Public realm enhancement
Capco has signed an agreement with WCC to fund the replacement 
of tarmac pavements with high quality York Stone paving on 
Henrietta Street, Southampton Street and sections of the Piazza 
including St. Paul’s Church portico. Work on the ﬁrst phase,  
which included the area under the portico, was completed before 
Christmas and the remainder of the streets will be ﬁnished by  
May 2016. As part of this, Capco has supported the contractor  
FM Conway in launching its apprenticeship scheme.
Corporate responsibility continued
COMMUNITY
During 2015, Capco continued to work to beneﬁt 
the communities in which we operate and to 
support our chosen charities. Capco staff 
committed a total of 607 hours to CR related 
activity (against a target of 400 hours) and 
volunteered to help with CR projects. 
Beneﬁting the communities in which our assets  
are located is the cornerstone of the stewardship  
of our estates.
Local initiatives
We have delivered a range of local community and education 
projects on our estates that have beneﬁted people of all ages.
Charitable donations
This year we have developed close ties with selected charities 
which align with our overarching CR strategy and have 
donated over £388,000 to charitable causes. A highlight was 
our sponsorship of the Maggie’s Culture Crawl.
Staff CR engagement
Capco staff remain committed to participating in CR related 
activities. 
Each employee was given a CR objective as part of their 
performance review and several teams undertook group 
volunteering activities.
2015 ACHIEVEMENTS
Recruit London
This is the second year that Capco has supported the Recruit 
London scheme. In 2015 40 people were recruited via the scheme 
into jobs with companies in Covent Garden. This year we 
contributed to the provision of a more dedicated Workplace 
Co-ordinator, focused solely on recruiting residents of Westminster 
into jobs in companies on the Covent Garden estate. This has given, 
and will continue to give us the opportunity to support our retailers 
in their recruitment. The Workplace Co-ordinator was involved in 
helping to ﬁll a number of temporary Christmas vacancies.
Staff cleaning the Covent Garden district 
All of the Covent Garden management team donned hi-vis clothing 
and completed a two hour shift cleaning streets in the district, as 
part of an initiative aimed at developing the team’s understanding 
of how such services can be improved.
Apprenticeships
We will continue to identify opportunities for apprenticeships 
for local young people across our assets and encourage our 
contractors to support this initiative.
Education Programme
We will extend the number of schools that participate in the 
Capco Education Programme, building further on our success 
with school children of all ages.
Charitable work
We will launch a volunteer programme with The Connection 
at St Martin-in-the-Fields, the charity for homeless people at 
St. Martin’s.
We will encourage employees to engage in CR initiatives  
and contribute 450 employee hours to supporting CR  
related projects.

CHARITABLE SUPPORT
In October 2015, we hosted a quiz night in aid of the Sir Simon 
Milton Foundation which raised £29,000 towards the 
establishment of a technical college in his name to beneﬁt  
young apprentices in London.
We began working with Spear, a charity concerned with youth 
employment, and sponsored students to participate in Spear’s 
programme which helps young people to enter work and progress 
in their career.  As part of the programme, participants visited our 
offices for a training session on CV writing with Capco employees 
and participated in a tour of the Covent Garden estate. We also 
participated in interview skills workshops at Spear which were 
beneﬁcial to the students.
The Covent Garden team has worked closely with Lifelites 
throughout the year and in the summer raised over £7 ,000 by 
organising a golf day for consultants and contractors. The 
equipment that Lifelites provides using these funds helps sick 
children to learn, play and interact with their families and other 
children when they would otherwise be isolated due to their illness.
Military personnel 
Covent Garden once again hosted the London Poppy Day Appeal 
across the Piazza, with performances from a variety of military 
bands, a replica life-size Spitﬁre and an RAF ﬂight simulator. A 
poppy shop sold merchandise from the Piazza, while a British 
Legion pop-up space allowed the public to learn about where the 
proceeds are spent both for veterans and those in active service.  
The event raised £42,502 towards the appeal.
Homelessness 
We supported The Connection at St Martin’s with donations on 
behalf of employees as part of our Christmas charitable activity .
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES
The Capco Education Programme, which runs in conjunction with 
the Urban Studies Centre, continued in 2015.
In the spring of 2015, we ran a project with Year Seven at FBS. The 
project included learning about the history of Earls Court and the 
local area, meeting experts from Capco to discuss the Earls Court 
development and visiting the Lillie Square construction site 
viewing platform and marketing suite. Throughout the duration  
of the project, the students studied a real life case study of changing 
urban landscapes, providing opportunities for discussion and 
critical thinking on development, housing and construction.
In the summer of 2015, we worked with Year Three at Fulham 
Primary School. The project centred on exploring North End Road 
Market, conducting environmental surveys and interviews to 
discover how the retail businesses of North End Road Market are 
performing. The children created North End Road t-shirts and 
exhibited project work on the Fulham Primary Market stall at 
North End Road summer market.
In the autumn of 2015, we joined Year Two at Servite Primary 
School. They explored the history of the Earls Court area as ‘Street 
Detectives’ , visiting Brompton Cemetery to hear stories of the 
locally famous and discussed the future of Earls Court. In one of 
their sessions, they also visited the Lillie Square marketing suite 
and the viewing platform overlooking the construction site.
Capco sponsored a highly innovative project called ‘Little 
Architect’ which introduced primary school children living 
near Earls Court and Covent Garden to the built environment. 
We partnered with The Architectural Association School of 
Architecture and ran highly interactive design sessions with 
the children mentored by volunteer Capco employees. The 
results were spectacular and were displayed at a showcase 
event hosted by New London Architecture.

Capco was a headline sponsor of the 2015 Maggie’s Culture 
Crawl, a 15 mile night-walk to raise money for Maggie’s Cancer 
Centres. The walk offered participants, including a Capco team 
of 10 walkers, access to landmark buildings in the Capital as 
well as performances from musicians, dancers and artists. 
Covent Garden hosted the ﬁnish line overnight, treating 
walkers to much needed refreshments, massages and an art 
installation by Rebecca Louise Law. The Capco team raised a 
total of £6,700 including matched funding and Maggie’s 
raised over £350,000 via the event.

ENVIRONMENT
Capco aims to minimise the impact of our 
operations on the environment. We apply a 
responsible and forward-looking approach to 
environmental issues and the principles of 
sustainability .
HEALTH & SAFETY
2015 saw considerably increased construction and demolition 
activities across the Group with work at Earls Court and Lillie 
Square both progressing well and development activities taking 
place at Covent Garden. During the year two Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (“RIDDOR”) 
incidents were recorded involving contractor employees; both were 
minor in nature and resulted from tripping incidents.
There were seven RIDDOR incidents at Covent Garden during 2015, 
all involving members of the public. At Olympia, there were three 
RIDDOR incidents involving members of the public and one 
RIDDOR incident involving an employee.
With the revised Construction (Design and Management) 
Regulations (“CDM”) 2015 that came into force in April 2015, CDM 
procedures and strategies have been reviewed and updated, taking 
into account the transitional and permanent changes to Client 
appointed Duty Holders.
Capco appointed a Head of Health and Safety in August 2015 with  
a remit to further develop and lead health and safety strategy across 
the Group, as well as monitoring compliance with relevant health 
and safety legislation. 
With the added support from the Head of Health and Safety , the 
Group’s Health & Safety Committee, chaired by the Managing 
Director and Chief Investment Officer, continued to meet on a 
monthly basis. The Health & Safety Committee reviewed health and 
safety performance, lessons learned and shared best practice across 
the Group. The outputs from the Health & Safety Committee, along 
with business-led health and safety reports, were discussed during 
Board meetings.
ENERGY AND CARBON
We continue to monitor and manage energy consumption and 
carbon emissions across the Group. In 2015 our absolute carbon 
emissions reduced by 38 per cent compared with 2014. This was 
principally due to the closure of the Earls Court Exhibition Centre. 
Across the Group we introduced a series of energy efficiency 
measures such as LED lighting, improved heating and cooling 
controls and energy management initiatives. We have continued 
our compliance activities in connection with the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (“CRC”) scheme, the Energy Savings Opportunity 
Scheme (“ESOS”) and continued our work to identify those of our 
properties with an Energy Performance Certiﬁcate rating of below 
E, which will be prioritised for improvements where appropriate. 
In 2015, we participated in World Green Building Week and 
promoted to our employees, opportunities to reduce energy use in 
our offices. In 2016 we plan to take further steps to raise awareness  
of energy efficiency and to extend this by engaging with our tenants. 
At Olympia we continued to promote the vehicle share and 
pre-event booking service, which has been successful in reducing 
traffic queues at peak times and provided useful data to assist 
organisers with carbon and sustainability reporting. 
Absolute carbon emissions reduced by 38 per cent compared 
with 2014.
Real time energy monitoring deployed on-site at Lillie Square 
to analyse carbon data and to implement measures to reduce 
energy consumption.
Purchased at least 80 per cent of electricity from low carbon  
or renewable energy tariff.
More than 85 per cent of non-hazardous waste diverted  
from landﬁll across Earls Court, Lillie Square and  
Kings Court projects. 
100 per cent of operational non-hazardous waste diverted  
from landﬁll at Olympia, Covent Garden and Head Office. 
Earls Court, Lillie Square and Kings Court projects 
participated in the Considerate Constructors Scheme and 
achieved scores higher than the industry average.
Improved Carbon Disclosure Project score for the fourth  
year running to 94B and continued as a participant in 
FTSE4Good index.
2015 ACHIEVEMENTS
Health & Safety
Continue to embed the updated governance and reporting 
framework at operational levels and promote the highest 
standards of Health & Safety management.
Energy & Carbon Management
Continue to measure, verify and report on the carbon footprint 
and achieve a reduction in energy consumption of three per 
cent in assets where Capco has operational control

. 
Waste & Water Management
Aim to minimise waste to landﬁll from properties where  
Capco has operational control and develop a waste 
consolidation strategy for the Covent Garden estate to  
improve recycling rates. 
Monitor water consumption across the portfolio and 
implement measures to improve water efficiency . 
Responsible Development
Continue to work towards achieving a minimum rating  
of BREEAM Very Good on major construction projects  
and, where existing planning conditions apply , Code for 
Sustainable Homes Level 4 certiﬁcation.  Target a minimum  
of 85 per cent of non-hazardous waste to be diverted from 
landﬁll and identify opportunities to reduce on-site energy 
use, carbon emissions and water consumption at major project 
sites including Earls Court, Lillie Square and Kings Court.
Further develop our approach to the responsible sourcing  
of construction materials, including the use of responsibly 
sourced timber, and determine opportunities to reduce 
embodied carbon impacts.

CORPORATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, Capco has collated data throughout 
the year to report on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations. Capco adopts the World Resources Institute Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, has applied the operational control approach, and adopted a materiality 
threshold of ﬁve per cent for greenhouse gas reporting purposes.
In 2015 new guidance was introduced to the GHG Protocol which requires Capco to report on emissions resulting from purchased electricity 
using two different methodologies. The two methodologies are the location-based approach and the market-based approach. For location-
based reporting, average national grid emission factors for the UK are used, and these have been sourced from the DEFRA 2015 Government 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. Market-based reporting uses an emission factor speciﬁc to the energy purchased, and here tariff 
or supplier-speciﬁc emission factors have been applied. Where a supplier-speciﬁc emissions factor was unavailable the residual mix emission 
factor was used. Reporting Capco’s emissions in this way demonstrates the positive impact of procuring electricity generated from renewable 
sources and from electricity suppliers with cleaner fuel mixes. Capco has engaged with Carbon Credentials Energy Services Ltd to provide 
veriﬁcation of the 2015 greenhouse gas emissions assertion in accordance with industry recognised standard ISO14064-3.

WASTE AND WATER MANAGEMENT
Across the Group, improving operational recycling rates and the 
diversion of waste from landﬁll has remained a priority and we 
achieved 100 per cent diversion of operational non-hazardous waste 
from landﬁll at Olympia, Covent Garden and Head Office in 2015. 
Throughout the year we monitored water consumption, 
establishing a water consumption baseline across the properties 
that we operate. We have identiﬁed opportunities to reduce usage 
by installing water efficient ﬁttings whilst undertaking 
refurbishment works. We will continue to identify water efficiency 
initiatives in 2016. 
RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT
Capco is committed to integrating responsible and sustainable 
practices into the delivery of our projects and development. At Lillie 
Square and Kings Court, we continue to work towards achieving a 
minimum of BREEAM Very Good and Code for Sustainable Homes 
Level 4 certiﬁcation. We have established monthly reporting 
procedures to actively monitor environmental aspects on-site and 
at Lillie Square real time energy monitoring has been deployed to 
analyse carbon data and identify measures to reduce consumption. 
Across our major projects we continue to procure responsibly 
sourced timber and have met our target of diverting 85 per cent  
of non-hazardous waste from landﬁll.
The Earls Court demolition site achieved a high score in the 
industry Considerate Constructors Scheme, demonstrating the 
high standard of environmental management. Managing 
demolition waste has been a major priority and in 2015 98 per cent 
of waste was diverted from landﬁll, 95 per cent was recycled off-site 
and three per cent was directly re-used. A carbon footprinting tool 
has been adopted and measures to reduce carbon impacts, such as 
innovative eco-fuel additives, are being trialled on-site. 
To further our commitment to sustainability in the built environment, 
we have produced a Sustainability Framework for Projects & 
Development. This will be adopted in 2016 and sets out sustainability 
performance measures for Capco’s projects. Capco is a member of  
the UK Green Building Council and we plan to become a more 
active member of the organisation by participating in key sustainability 
initiatives and collaborating with our peers in the sector .  Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 54

Corporate governance report
OUR GOVERNANCE 
FRAMEWORK
Ian Durant, Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2015 Corporate 
Governance Report. 
As reported in my Chairman’s statement, Capco had 
another successful year in 2015, executing its strategy 
for its assets and generating strong returns for 
shareholders.
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of 
Capco, and as Chairman I am responsible for ensuring 
that the Board operates effectively and efficiently in 
achieving its strategic objectives and managing the 
corporate risks while continuing to strive for 
outperformance for our shareholders. 
Capco’s strong performance since its establishment 
has been underpinned by a robust governance 
framework. In this report, and the Committee reports 
that follow, we explain how the Board and its 
Committees operated during the year. We also include 
information on some of the management committees 
that strengthen the controls and reporting framework 
across the Group. 
During the year, we undertook reviews of a number  
of our internal management systems, including risk 
management, business continuity and disaster 
recovery . 2015 saw our ﬁrst major demolition and 
construction projects begin at Earls Court and Lillie 
Square, alongside a heightened security environment 
following the terrorist incidents in Paris and 
elsewhere. We therefore reviewed our health and 
safety reporting across the Group and established a 
Security Risk Committee to provide Group-wide 
oversight of security risk.
Taking account of the robust internal management  
of Community , Environmental and People matters, 
the Board has decided that with immediate effect 
Corporate Responsibility matters will be reported 
directly to the Board. Accordingly , the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee of the Board will  
be dissolved. 
The Board is keen to ensure that a balance of skills  
and experience aligned to Capco’s strategic goals is 
maintained, and during the year, the Nomination 
Committee continued to review succession planning 
and progress recruitment of Non-executive Directors. 
In March 2015, Gerry Murphy was appointed as an 
additional Non-executive Director and I am pleased 
that we will welcome Anthony Steains to the Board  
in March 2016. The Nomination Committee Report  
on pages 65 to 66 provides more detail of our 
recruitment process and induction arrangements  
for Non-executive Directors. 
Ian Henderson will be retiring from the Board and as 
Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director at 
the Company’s forthcoming AGM, and will step down 
as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee with 
effect from 25 April 2016. The Board is pleased that  
Ian will remain available to the Company on a 
consultancy basis following his retirement from  
the Board, allowing the Company to continue to 
beneﬁt from his extensive experience. Gerry Murphy 
is to become Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, and Demetra Pinsent will join the 
Committee on 25 April 2016. I am pleased to conﬁrm 
that Henry Staunton will become Senior Independent 
Director on Ian Henderson’s retirement.  
“ A governance framework that 
supports the achievement of Capco’ s 
strategic objectives.”
Ian Durant
Chairman
24 February 2016
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Company has applied the principles and 
complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) during 2015. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 57 
THE BOARD 
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success  
of the Company , and for its leadership, strategy , values, standards, 
control and management. Day-to-day management of the Group  
is delegated to the Executive Directors, subject to formal delegated 
authority limits; however, certain matters have been reserved for 
Board approval. These matters are reviewed annually and include: 
Board and Committee composition, strategy , signiﬁcant funding 
decisions and corporate transactions, delegated authority limits 
and dividend policy . 
Board composition
As at 31 December 2015, the Board comprised the Chairman, three 
Executive Directors and six Non-executive Directors. The table on 
page 58 summarises the membership of the Board and Committees. 
Biographies of each of the Directors, which include information on 
their skills and experience, can be found on pages 54 and 55. 
Board independence
The Code requires that, excluding the Chairman, at least half of  
the Board should comprise Non-executive Directors determined  
to be independent. 
The Board has considered the independence of the Non-executive 
Directors, and the table on page 58 sets out those Directors 
considered to be independent in character and judgement. Each of 
these Directors has also conﬁrmed that there is no reason why they 
should not continue to be considered independent.
In considering Director independence, the Board concluded that 
Directors’ tenure should be counted from the date of their ﬁrst 
election by shareholders to the Capco Board.  
The key responsibilities of Board members are set out in the table on page 59.
THE BOARD IN 2015
The Board met formally throughout the year with main meetings 
timed around the ﬁnancial calendar, and additional meetings 
convened to consider speciﬁc matters as required. Attendance  
at Board and Committee meetings held during 2015 is shown  
on page 61.
The annual Board calendar includes a two-day strategy meeting 
which is held away from the Capco offices. At this meeting the 
Board receives detailed updates from external advisers and the 
business units, and is able to consider strategic issues in depth,  
and spend time with members of senior management in a less 
formal environment. 
Board papers are circulated a week in advance of meetings to ensure 
that Directors have sufficient time to consider their content prior to 
the meeting. If matters require approval at short notice, written 
approval is sought from the Directors. 
The Chairman meets regularly with the Non-executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors being present and maintains 
regular contact with both the Chief Executive and members of 
senior management.
As matters that require the Board’s decision are often large, 
complex and evolve over a period of time, informal update 
meetings are held between Board meetings to allow Board 
members adequate time to explore, understand and challenge 
matters under consideration. These are often combined with site 
visits and provide an opportunity for the Non-executive Directors 
to meet senior management. Four such updates were held during 
2015, including a presentation on EC planning matters and a visit  
to the Earls Court demolition and Lillie Square construction sites. 
During 2015, the Board received regular asset, ﬁnancial and 
performance updates from the Executive Directors and reports 
from the Company Secretary , General Counsel, Director of  
HR & CR and Committee Chairmen. The table below shows  
the key areas considered by the Board during the year.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration, Nomination  
and Corporate Responsibility Committees to enable the Board  
to operate effectively and ensure a strong governance framework 
for decision making.
Each Committee has written terms of reference which were 
reviewed during the year. The terms of reference can be viewed on 
the Company’s website www.capitalandcounties.com. Minutes of 
all Committee meetings are made available to all Directors. The 
Committee Chairmen attend the AGM to answer any questions  
on the Committees’ activities. 
The Board has decided that, taking account of the robust internal 
management of Community , Environmental and People 
matters, Corporate Responsibility will in future be reported on 
directly to the Board, instead of through a Corporate Responsibility 
Committee. Accordingly , this Committee will be dissolved.
A number of management committees support the business in 
delivering its strategy .
A summary of the role of each Committee is shown on page 58, and the activity of each 
Committee during 2015 is described on pages 62 to 87 .

During the engaging tour the Directors were shown the 
progress that had been made so far in the demolition of the 
Exhibition Centres and saw ﬁrst-hand some of the methods 
used and the logistical challenges of the site. 
In addition to visiting the Earls Court demolition site,  
the Directors also visited the Lillie Square construction  
site where they were able to see how the development was 
progressing from a purpose built observation platform,  
and viewed the new three-bedroom mock-up apartment.  Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 60 
ENSURING AN EFFECTIVE BOARD
Recognising that Capco’s Board must be effective, the Board 
conducts an annual evaluation of its own performance and that of 
its Committees and Directors. In 2015 the evaluation was managed 
by the Chairman and Company Secretary . Directors were asked to 
assess the effectiveness of the Board by providing a mixture of 
quantitative and narrative responses. The outcomes of the 
evaluation were considered by the Board and a Board action plan 
for 2016 was agreed. As the last external Board evaluation was 
undertaken in 2013, an externally-facilitated Board evaluation  
will be undertaken during 2016.
In addition, during the year the Senior Independent  
Director conducted an appraisal of the Chairman’s performance 
which identiﬁed a number of matters for focus during 2016,  
and the Chairman undertook appraisals of the other  
Directors’ performance.
COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Our policy
The Board is keen to ensure that our shareholders and potential 
investors have a good understanding of Capco’s business and 
performance, and that Directors are aware of any issues and 
concerns which shareholders may have. The Company 
communicates with stakeholders in a number of ways:
Corporate website
Our corporate website www.capitalandcounties.com allows  
visitors to access Company information, annual reports, results 
presentations and webcasts. The site also includes links to our 
business unit websites and contact details for shareholder queries. 
Annual General Meeting
Our AGM allows the Board to update our shareholders on Capco’s 
progress, and provides an opportunity for shareholders to pose 
questions to the Directors, and meet senior executives. 
Shareholders are encouraged to vote on the resolutions put to the 
meeting, either in person, online or by submitting a proxy card.  
We publish the results of the votes on all resolutions on our website 
following the meeting.
Our 2016 AGM will be held on Friday 6 May 2016. The notice of 
Annual General Meeting will be issued to shareholders at least  
20 working days before the meeting. Separate resolutions will  
be proposed on each issue, and in accordance with the Code, each 
Director, with the exception of Ian Henderson who is retiring  
from the Board at the AGM, will offer themselves for election  
or re-election. 
The Chairman, Chairmen of the Board Committees and other 
Directors will be available at the AGM to meet shareholders and 
answer any questions. 
Should shareholders have any concerns that they are unable to 
successfully resolve following communication with the Chairman, 
Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer, they may raise them 
through the Senior Independent Director.
ACTIONS FOR 2016

Communications with shareholders and other stakeholders 
Communication with the Company’s investors is a priority for the 
Board. The Company runs an extensive investor relations 
programme, and the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and 
Director of Investor Relations hold meetings with institutional 
investors throughout the year, including results presentations, 
webcasts, road shows, one-to-one meetings and investor tours. 
The Company’s major shareholders are encouraged to meet with 
the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director to discuss any 
matters they may wish to raise. During 2015, the Chairman and 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee held a number of 
meetings with shareholders, including discussion of remuneration 
and governance matters.
The Directors receive regular updates on the Company’s major 
shareholders, and receive reports on shareholder feedback at  
each Board meeting. The Non-executive Directors are invited  
to attend the Company’s results presentations. 
Private shareholders may raise questions through the  
Company Secretary’s office either by telephone or by email 
(feedback@capitalandcounties.com). 
The Company maintains active relations with community 
stakeholders.
Please see page 50 and 51 in the CR Report for more details of Capco’s  
stakeholder engagement.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Chairman’s other business commitments are set out in his 
biography on page 55. The Board is satisﬁed that the Chairman’s 
additional commitments allow him to devote sufficient time to 
perform his duties as Chairman of Capco. 
The Deputy Chairman, who is retiring from the Board at the 2016 
AGM, is a Director of the Board of Capco’s joint venture in respect 
of the Lillie Square development. He receives no remuneration for 
this appointment. The Board considered this appointment carefully 
before conﬁrming its approval and remains satisﬁed that there is no 
conﬂict of interest and that the appointment does not compromise 
his independence. 
On appointment, and each subsequent year, Non-executive Directors 
are required to conﬁrm in writing that they have sufficient time to 
devote to the Company’s affairs. In addition, they are required to 
seek prior approval from the Chairman before taking on any 
additional external commitments which may affect their time 
available to devote to the Company , and the Board is advised of  
any changes. 
The interests of new Directors are reviewed during the recruitment 
process and, if appropriate, authorised by the Board on appointment. 
The Board is satisﬁed that all Non-executive Directors are 
contributing effectively to the operation of the Board. 
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
authorise potential conﬂicts of interest that may arise. The Board 
has adopted a procedure under which Directors must notify the 
Chairman of any potential conﬂicts. The Chairman then decides 
whether a conﬂict exists and recommends its authorisation by the 
Board where appropriate. A Director who had a conﬂict of interest 
would not be counted in the quorum or entitled to vote when the 
Board considered the matter in which the Director had an interest. 
DTR DISCLOSURE
The disclosures required under DTR 7 .2 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules are contained in this report, and the Audit 
Committee and Nomination Committee Reports, except for 
information required under DTR 7 .2.6 which is contained in  
the Directors’ Report on pages 88 and 89. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 62 
Audit Committee report
Henry Staunton, Chairman of the  
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, reporting to the Board, oversees the ﬁnancial 
reporting process, monitors the effectiveness of internal control, 
internal audit, risk management, and the statutory audit and 
monitors the independence of the statutory auditors and the 
provision of non-audit services. As at 31 December 2015 and the  
date of this report, the Committee comprises four independent 
Non-executive Directors, and is chaired by Henry Staunton  
who is considered to have signiﬁcant, recent and relevant  
ﬁnancial experience.
The Committee’s meetings were also attended by the Company’s 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, General 
Counsel, Company Secretary and Financial Controller together 
with senior representatives of the external and internal auditors.
The valuers and members of senior management, including the 
Director of Tax & Treasury , attended by invitation to present 
reports required for the Committee to discharge its responsibilities. 
The Audit Committee met three times during 2015. Attendance  
at these meetings is shown in the table on page 61. The Committee 
also met privately during the year with both the external and 
internal auditors. 
The Committee follows an annual programme, which is agreed 
with the Committee Chair, management and external auditors 
prior to each ﬁnancial year, and ensures it gives thorough 
consideration to matters of particular importance to the Company , 
and additional matters are considered when appropriate. The 
Committee’s 2015 agenda is shown in the table below, and the 
signiﬁcant matters considered by the Committee during the year

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Henry Staunton
Chairman of the Audit Committee, 24 February 2016
Members:
Henry Staunton (Chairman) 
Ian Henderson
Gerry Murphy  
Andrew Strang
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2015 Audit Committee Report. The 
Committee plays a key oversight role for the Board, and this year its principal 
activities have focused on monitoring and reviewing all aspects of the Group’s 
ﬁnancial reporting, internal controls and risk management procedures. 
This report provides an overview of the work undertaken by the Committee 
in the past year. During 2015, the most signiﬁcant topics considered by the 
Committee included the Group’s property valuations, taxation and the 
accounting treatment of various signiﬁcant corporate transactions. 
The Committee reviewed the updated risk disclosures resulting from  
the change in approach to risk management described on page 14, and also 
reviewed the viability statement disclosure before it was recommended  
to the Board.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 63 
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
Committee Responsibilities
The Committee oversees the relationship with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), the external auditors, and  
is responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring  
the Company’s policy on external audit, and for monitoring the 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical, 
professional and regulatory requirements. The external auditors 
are not permitted to perform any work that they may subsequently 
need to audit or which might either create a conﬂict of interest or 
affect the auditors’ objectivity and independence. 
Access to Committee
The external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee 
Chairman should they wish to raise any concerns outside formal 
Committee meetings.
Effectiveness of Auditors
The Committee monitored PwC’s effectiveness and performance 
during 2015, and considered a paper prepared by the Financial 
Controller which conﬁrmed that in management’s view PwC  
were providing a good quality audit service and continued to 
deliver against all facilities considered at their appointment.  
The Committee is satisﬁed that the external auditors remain 
independent and objective and that the Group is receiving a robust 
and challenging objective audit and has therefore recommended  
to the Board that PwC be reappointed in 2016. 
Tendering of External Audit Contract
Capco tendered its external audit contract in 2010, and PwC were 
appointed as Group auditors on an annual rolling contract. The 
Directors plan to complete an audit tender in 2020, the date by 
which the external audit contract must be tendered to comply with 
regulatory requirements, unless issues are identiﬁed which require 
a tender to be undertaken earlier. This is in the best interest of the 
Company’s members because it will ensure continuity of service 
from the external auditors.
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 – statement 
of compliance 
The Company conﬁrms that it complied with the provisions of the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the ﬁnancial year 
under review.
Non-Audit Services
Non-audit services are normally limited to assignments that are 
closely related to the annual audit or where the work is of such a 
nature that a detailed understanding of the Group is necessary .
The Company has adopted a policy to ensure that the provision  
of non-audit services by the external auditor does not compromise 
its independence or objectivity . The policy requires the Audit 
Committee Chairman to pre-approve any non-audit work with a 
cost exceeding the lower of £50,000 or 15 per cent of the estimated 
annual level of the auditor’s fees at that time. Approval is only given 
following a full and thorough assessment of the value case for using 
the auditor and the skills and experience the auditor would bring. 
Additionally , consideration must be given to the preservation of 
auditor independence; and the external auditors are required to 
conﬁrm that they are acting independently and are not:
 ◦ auditing their own work;
 ◦ making management decisions for the Company; 
 ◦ creating a mutuality of interest; 
 ◦ developing close personal relationships with the Company’s 
personnel; or 
 ◦ acting in the role of advocate for the Company . 
The Committee is satisﬁed that the policy remains effective. 
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE IN 2015
Matter considered What the Committee did
Valuations As in previous years, the independent external valuers presented the year-end and half-year valuations to the 
Committee at the February and July meetings respectively . The Committee reviewed the valuation process and 
component parts of the valuations, discussed the valuations with the external auditors and challenged the valuers 
on the assumptions used. The Committee also advised the Board on the independence of the valuers and obtained 
conﬁrmation that management had provided all requested information. The Committee was satisﬁed that the 
approach taken by the valuers was appropriate. Please refer to note 16 on pages 114 to 117 in the notes to the accounts.
Tax The Director of Tax and Treasury presented a report to the Committee at the February and July meetings, explained 
the basis of the Group’s tax position, identiﬁed key taxation risks to the Group and updated the Committee on the 
ongoing relationship with HMRC. The Committee challenged the assumptions made in arriving at the tax position 
and discussed with the external auditors the assumptions and judgements made in arriving at the deferred tax 
position. The Committee was satisﬁed that the policy was appropriate for the Group. Please refer to note 29 on  
page 129 in the notes to the accounts.
Signiﬁcant  
and complex 
transactions
As in previous years, the Committee received updates from the Financial Controller on signiﬁcant and complex 
transactions at each meeting. With regards to each transaction, such as the CLSA, the Solum joint venture and  
the Olympia strategic review, the Committee discussed the accounting treatments with management and the 
external auditors and is satisﬁed that the appropriate approach has been taken. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 64 
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2015 were £454,000,  
of which £14,000 related to non-audit work. These fees primarily 
relate to corporate transactions and veriﬁcation of performance 
against share scheme performance conditions. The total fees paid 
and payable to PwC in 2015 are set out in the table below.
2015 2014
Total fees paid to PwC £454,000 £442,000
Non-audit fees £14,000 £55,000
Ratio of non-audit fees 3.1% 12.4%
INTERNAL AUDITOR
Internal Audit Plan
BDO LLP (“BDO”) has been appointed to act as Capco’s internal 
auditor. During 2015, BDO’s audit plan included reviews of:
 ◦ contract management
 ◦ treasury , cash management & bank covenants
 ◦ disaster recovery & business continuity
 ◦ Bribery Act policies and procedures 
 ◦ payroll procedures
During 2016, it is expected that the audit plan will include reviews  
of health & safety , joint ventures, IT security and training, expenses, 
insurance, accounts payable,talent management, VAT compliance  
and Bribery Act policies and procedures. 
Committee Responsibilities
The Committee reviews the work of the Internal Auditor, the  
audit plan, any matters identiﬁed as a result of internal audits  
and whether recommendations are addressed by management  
in a timely and appropriate way . The Committee is satisﬁed that  
the internal auditor was independent and its services effective.
Access to the Committee
The internal audit partner has direct access to the Audit Committee 
Chairman should they wish to raise any concerns outside formal 
Committee meetings. The Committee meets with the internal 
auditors at least once per year without management being present.
INTERNAL CONTROL & RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework and system of internal control and the 
ongoing review of their effectiveness; it also determines the risk 
appetite of the Group and regularly reviews principal risks and 
uncertainties. The framework is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has 
delegated responsibility for the review of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls relating to risk  
to the Committee.
During 2015, a review of risk management across the Group was 
undertaken. The Committee reviewed the controls relating to risks 
and the updated principal risk disclosures.  
A description of the Group risk management framework and the review undertaken 
during the year is set out on page 14.
Viability Statement
As part of its work in reviewing the Group’s ﬁnancial statements, 
the Committee reviewed the methodology for the preparation of 
the viability statement including the principal risks, supporting 
analysis, qualiﬁcations and assumptions to be disclosed. 
The viability statement can be found on page 17 
Internal Controls
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of  
the Group’s internal controls and reports regularly to the Board  
on its work and conclusions. In reviewing the effectiveness of  
the Group’s internal controls, the Committee considers reports 
provided by the Financial Controller, external auditor and internal 
auditor. No signiﬁcant failings or weaknesses were identiﬁed in  
the review process.
Details of the Group’s internal controls are set out below:
Day-to-day procedures and internal control framework
 ◦ Schedule of matters reserved for the Board
 ◦ Remit and terms of reference of Board Committees 
 ◦ Delegated authority limits
 ◦ Documentation of signiﬁcant transactions
 ◦ The Executive Directors are closely involved in the day-to-day 
operations of the business and hold regular meetings with senior 
management to review aspects of the business, including risks 
and controls 
 ◦ Regular Board updates on strategy and project developments
 ◦ A whistleblowing procedure under which staff may raise matters 
of concern conﬁdentially . No calls were received during the year.
Speciﬁc controls relating to ﬁnancial reporting and 
consolidation process
 ◦ Appropriately staffed management structure, with clear lines  
of responsibility and accountability
 ◦ A comprehensive budgeting and review system. Board and  
Audit Committee updates from the Chief Financial Officer  
which include forecasts, performance against budget and 
ﬁnancial covenants
 ◦ Led by the Chief Executive, the Group Finance team participates 
in the control self-assessment and policy compliance elements of 
the risk management framework and sets formal requirements 
with business unit ﬁnance functions which specify the reports 
and approvals required
 ◦ BDO conduct regular audits of the Group’s ﬁnancial control 
procedures and reports its ﬁndings to the Audit Committee
The Committee is satisﬁed that the Group’s internal controls are 
operating effectively .

NOMINATION 
COMMITTEE REPORT
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations on Board appointments and succession to  
the Board. 
The members of the Committee as at 31 December 2015 and the  
date of this report are listed in the box above. The Nomination 
Committee met twice during the year, and attendance at these 
meetings is shown in the table on page 61.
Non-executive Director recruitment
Capco operates a rigorous and transparent recruitment process  
for new Directors. During 2014, following a full review of the skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of Board members, it was 
agreed that two new Non-executive Directors should be recruited, 
of whom at least one should have speciﬁc property expertise. 
The Zygos Partnership, which provides no other services to the 
Group, was engaged by Capco in 2014 and 2015 to assist with the 
recruitment of Non-executive Directors. To ensure that the 
long-list of candidates reﬂected diversity of both gender and skills, 
a broad brief was provided to the Zygos Partnership. A description 
of the Non-executive Director recruitment process is set out on 
page 66. In January 2015 the Committee made a formal 
recommendation to the Board that Gerry Murphy be appointed  
as a Non-executive Director of the Company and as a member of  
the Nomination Committee, Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee, and in February 2016 the Committee made a formal 
recommendation to the Board that Anthony Steains be appointed 
as a Non-executive Director of the Company and as a member of the 
Nomination Committee. Work to recruit a further Non-executive 
Director, with speciﬁc property experience, will continue in 2016. 
Non-executive Director induction 
An induction programme is provided for each new Non-executive 
Director, which is tailored depending on the Director’s experience 
and expected role on the Board. A typical induction programme for 
a Capco Non-executive Director will include individual meetings

composition to ensure that the Board continues to have the right mix of 
skills and experience to deliver Capco’s strategy , and I am pleased that 
Anthony Steains will be joining the Board on 1 March 2016. Anthony will 
bring extensive corporate ﬁnance experience and a diverse and international 
perspective to the Board. The report below provides more information on 
our Non-executive Director recruitment process and the induction that we 
provide to our new Directors.
As I explained in my letter on page 7 , Ian Henderson will be retiring from 
the Board at the Company’s forthcoming AGM. The Board is pleased that 
Ian will remain available to the Company on a consultancy basis following 
his retirement from the Board, allowing the Company to continue to beneﬁt 
from his extensive experience.
As previously reported, the Committee recognises the need to maintain the 
depth of property experience on the Board. Accordingly the Committee will 
continue to focus on this area during 2016.
Matters considered by the Committee during  
the year include: 
 ◦ Board and Committee composition, including diversity
 ◦ Non-executive Director recruitment 
 ◦ Succession planning
 ◦ Board evaluation 
 ◦ Directors’ skills and experience 
 ◦ Directors’ time commitments
 ◦ Committee terms of reference Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 66 
Nomination Committee report continued
At present, Capco has one female Director. 
The Board does not feel that it is appropriate 
to set targets on gender diversity as all 
appointments must be made on merit; 
however, gender and wider diversity will 
continue to be taken into consideration 
when evaluating the skills, knowledge  
and experience desirable to ﬁll each  
Board vacancy .
Board composition and succession
The Committee regularly considers  
Board composition and succession planning  
for both Executive and Non-executive 
Directors. In considering Executive Director 
succession, the Board’s strategy is to 
consider both internal and external 
candidates, whilst aiming to develop a 
choice of internal potential successors. The 
focus of Non-executive Director succession 
planning is to ensure that the Board and its 
Committees continue to have the right mix 
of skills and experience to deliver Capco’s 
strategy . A summary of Directors’ core areas 
of experience as at the date of this report is 
shown in the ﬁgure to the right.
Board succession and composition will 
continue to be considered at Committee 
meetings during 2016, and the Committee 
will make recommendations to the Board 
where appropriate.
with the Chairman, Executive Directors, 
General Counsel, Company Secretary and 
members of senior management, site visits 
to Capco’s estates, and an introduction by 
the Chairman to the Company’s brokers, 
advisers and lawyers. The Director is also 
provided with copies of past Board and 
Committee papers and minutes, and 
individual brieﬁngs are arranged on  
topics such as Directors’ duties and 
responsibilities and the property market.
Non-Executive Director development
The Chairman and the Committee together 
ensure that Directors keep their skills and 
knowledge up to date to allow them to  
fulﬁl their roles on the Board and Board 
Committees. The General Counsel and 
Company Secretary regularly update the 
Board on legal and corporate governance 
matters, and information on training 
opportunities and seminars is circulated  
to Directors. The Company also arranges 
periodic brieﬁngs from external advisers, 
and Directors receive regular business 
updates from the Executive Directors. 
Directors may also take independent  
advice at the Company’s expense where 
they feel this is appropriate. 
Diversity
Diversity is important to Capco across the 
Group and we recognise the business 
beneﬁts of employing people with varied 
outlooks. We are keen to develop female 
talent and the ratio of men to women within 
Capco’s senior management team is 1:1.

REMUNERATION REPORT

ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
The Committee’s key objectives, as in previous years, are to  
ensure that Capco’s executive team is appropriately incentivised 
by remuneration arrangements that are fully aligned with the 
Company’s strategy of providing long-term market-leading 
returns to shareholders. Management incentives are linked to  
the KPIs which the Company uses to measure the creation and 
growth of value for shareholders. These KPIs are described in  
full on page 13. 
Since its establishment in 2010, Capco has delivered TSR 
performance which ranks ﬁrst when compared to its listed  
peers, and strong performance has continued in 2015. This  
year the ﬁnancial elements of the bonus paid out at 90 per cent  
of maximum, reﬂecting the year-on-year increase in NAV of  
16.1 per cent and TPR performance which exceeded the 
benchmark by 1.9 per cent. However, despite the very strong 
performance delivered since 2010, the long-term incentive awards 
which will vest in 2016 based on TSR and TR performance up to 
the end of 2015 are only expected to vest in part. 60 per cent of the 
PSP awards and, depending on the award, 40 or 80 per cent of the 
MSP awards granted in 2013 are expected to vest. This relatively 
low vesting outcome is due to the stretching nature of our 
long-term targets for TSR and TR.
During 2015 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the 
remuneration arrangements in place at Capco in order to simplify 
the arrangements, take account of shareholder views, and to 
ensure that the arrangements continue to be aligned with our 
strategy . During the review process the Committee considered a 
number of factors, including the best way in which to reward and 
incentivise performance, market practice at other listed property 
companies and developers, and how to simplify the remuneration 
arrangements which are currently too complex. As a result of the 
review the Remuneration Committee is developing an alternative 
remuneration structure which will signiﬁcantly simplify the 
existing structure by removing the facility to grant exceptional 
awards, removing the matching and co-investment arrangements, 
whilst continuing to incentivise and reward signiﬁcant 
outperformance. As part of this review, the Committee also 
intends to address the salary positioning of the Chief Executive, 
which remains below the level that the Committee believes to be 
appropriate for the contribution and experience of the individual 
concerned, and is also below market levels when compared to 
property and development companies of similar size. The 
Committee now intends to consult with shareholders on the  
new structure during 2016, and then to implement any new 
arrangement from the expiry of the existing policy at the  
2017 AGM at the latest.
In 2016 the operation of the current remuneration policy is 
expected to be broadly in line with its operation in 2015. In 
summary , all elements of the remuneration policy will continue  
to be operated and the Committee has decided not to make any 
exceptional awards under the long-term incentive schemes.
In more detail, the policy comprises a number of elements, 
namely , base salary , beneﬁts and pension, annual bonus, PSP 
awards, MSP awards and the co-investment opportunity . The 
Remuneration Committee has taken the following decisions  
with regard to the implementation of these elements in 2016:
 ◦ With the exception of the Managing Director & Chief Financial 
Officer, base salary or fee increases for Executive and Non-
executive Directors will be in line with the increase for the 
general workforce.
 ◦ Following an assessment of the performance of the Managing 
Director & Chief Financial Officer in his new role, the 
Committee approved an increase in his base salary from 
£410,000 to £450,000. This increase had been agreed and 
presented to shareholders upon the promotion of the 
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, but was subject to 
his performance in role in 2015. The Committee is satisﬁed that 
his performance merits the agreed increase.
 ◦ No change to beneﬁts or pension provision.
 ◦ The annual bonus will continue to be based 75 per cent on 
ﬁnancial measures and 25 per cent on personal performance.

our strategy to deliver market-leading returns to  
our shareholders.” Governance Financial statements Strategic report

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee on behalf of the Board and complies with the 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority , Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. In accordance with Section 439 of the 
Companies Act 2006, an advisory resolution to approve  
the above Annual Statement and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for 2015 will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company to be held on  
6 May 2016. The information in this report subject to audit 
comprises the single ﬁgure of remuneration and associated 
detail, conﬁrmation that there were no payments for loss of 
office or to former Directors, the incentive achievement for 
2015, the incentives to be awarded in 2016 and the details of 
Directors’ shareholdings and share interests.
1. POLICY REPORT
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out Capco’s 
current remuneration policy . Details of actual remuneration paid, 
share awards made, and the approach to remuneration for 2016 are 
set out within the Annual Report on Remuneration which starts  
on page 76.
1.1 Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the Company’s remuneration policy are to:
 ◦ strongly align executive and shareholder interests
 ◦ underpin an effective pay-for-performance culture
 ◦ support the retention, motivation and recruitment of talented 
people who are commercially astute
 ◦ encourage executives to acquire and retain signiﬁcant holdings 
of Capco shares
The Committee aims to achieve an appropriate balance between 
ﬁxed and variable remuneration, and between variable 
remuneration based on short-term and longer-term performance. 
Fixed remuneration includes base salary , beneﬁts and pension. 
Variable remuneration includes an annual bonus, half of which is 
deferred in shares and may be matched via the Matching Share Plan 
(“MSP”), co-investment under the MSP and awards under the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”).
The remuneration policy is aligned to the strategy and nature of  
the Company , and reﬂects the importance of total return and the 
long-term nature of Capco’s business, rewarding the Executive 
Directors for delivering strong performance against the Company’s 
Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).
The Remuneration Committee is not proposing any amendments 
to the Company’s existing remuneration policy .
Details of each element of remuneration, their operation, purpose, 
link to strategy and performance metrics are set out in this section.
 ◦ Reﬂecting the greater relative importance of absolute net 
asset value per share and relative total property return to 
Capco’s strategy , in 2016 the weighting of underlying earnings 
per share as a performance measure will be reduced to 5 per 
cent of the ﬁnancial performance measures.
 ◦ PSP and MSP awards will be made on a normal basis, with no 
exceptional awards. 
 ◦ The previous co-investment opportunity was due to expire in 
December 2015. However, as the Company was in a prohibited 
dealing period before the year-end, participants will be 
permitted to participate for a short window as soon as the 
Company is no longer in a prohibited period, to allow 
participants to utilise the previous opportunity , before the 
next cycle of co-investment opportunity commences.
Finally , I will be stepping down from the Committee in advance 
of my retirement from the Board at Capco’s Annual General 
Meeting on 6 May 2016, and Gerry Murphy will become 
Chairman of the Committee at this time.
Capco’s remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM held on 2 May 2014. This year, consistent with 
market practice, we are not submitting the remuneration policy 
for another vote at the 2016 AGM, and we will only ask 
shareholders to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration 
and this Annual Statement. However, we have included the 
remuneration policy in the Annual Report in order to provide 
clarity for our shareholders. The Committee looks forward to 
receiving your support for this advisory vote at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.

1.2 Executive Director Policy Table
The table below summarises each of the components of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors:
To provide an appropriately 
competitive base salary , whilst placing 
emphasis on the performance related 
elements of remuneration.
The Committee believes base salary  
for high-performing experienced 
Executive Directors should be at  
least median.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation
To be appropriately competitive with 
those offered at comparator companies.
To be appropriately competitive with 
that offered by comparator companies.
To incentivise and reward performance.
The Committee selects performance 
measures and targets each year to 
reinforce the strategic business 
priorities for the year.
The deferral of half of the bonus into 
shares is designed to further align 
executives with shareholders’ interests.
To incentivise and reward long-term 
outperformance, and help retain 
Executive Directors over the  
longer term.
To further align the interests of 
Executive Directors with those  
of shareholders.
To enable participants to enhance their 
long-term incentive opportunity by 
committing to signiﬁcant long-term 
investment in the Company .
To provide a link between short-term 
and long-term remuneration.
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase taking effect from 1 April.
The Committee reviews base salaries with reference to:
• other property companies (including the constituents of the long-term incentive plans’ comparator group)
• UK companies of a similar size
• each Executive Director’s performance and contribution during the year
• scope of each Executive Director’s responsibilities
• changes to the remuneration and overall conditions of other employees
When reviewing base salaries, the Committee is mindful of the gearing effect that increases in base salary will 
have on the potential total remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Beneﬁts will be in line with those offered to some or all employees and may include private dental and 
healthcare, life insurance, personal accident cover, travel insurance, income protection and a car allowance, 
currently paid in cash.
Other beneﬁts may be introduced from time to time to ensure the beneﬁts package is appropriately competitive 
and reﬂects individual circumstances. For example, Directors may be offered relocation and/or expatriate 
beneﬁts should a Director be required to relocate as a result of emerging business requirements.
Capco offers a deﬁned contribution pension scheme.
Executive Directors may elect to be paid some or all of their entitlement in cash.
The Company does not currently operate any All Employee Share Schemes, however if such a scheme were 
introduced the Executive Directors would be able to participate on the same terms as other employees.
The annual bonus arrangements are reviewed prior to the start of each ﬁnancial year to ensure performance 
measures and weightings are appropriate and support the business strategy .
The Committee reviews performance against the annual bonus targets but has the ability to take into account 
broader factors and may exercise two-way discretion to ensure that the annual bonus awarded properly reﬂects 
the performance of the Company and each Director.
Adjudication of bonuses will be explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil-cost options for three years (under the MSP) 
subject to risk of forfeiture should an Executive Director leave the Company . Alternatively the Committee may 
invite Executive Directors to use 50 per cent of their net bonus to purchase shares in the Company which will be 
matched under the MSP and held for three years subject to equivalent restrictions.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive awards under the PSP , which may be made as market value share 
options, shares, or nil-cost options, at the discretion of the Committee.
In assessing the outcome of the performance conditions, the Committee must satisfy itself that the ﬁgures are  
a genuine reﬂection of underlying ﬁnancial performance, and may exercise discretion when determining the 
proportion of an award that will vest.
A matching award may be made in respect of deferred bonus described above.
Executive Directors may also be offered the opportunity to co-invest up to 150 per cent of salary in aggregate 
(across outstanding award cycles) under the MSP .
In assessing the outcome of the performance conditions, the Committee must satisfy itself that the ﬁgures are  
a genuine reﬂection of underlying ﬁnancial performance, and may exercise discretion when determining the 
proportion of an award that will vest.

Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome of the 
annual review and will normally be in line with increases awarded 
to other employees. However, the Committee may make additional 
adjustments in certain circumstances to reﬂect, for example, an 
increase in scope or responsibility , to address a gap in market 
positioning and/or to reward the long-term performance of an 
individual. The Chief Executive will have the highest base salary of 
all Executive Directors, and the maximum base salary for the Chief 
Executive will be within the top quartile of the Chief Executive 
salaries for the constituents of the long-term incentive schemes’ 
comparator group (current constituents listed on page 81).
Set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate in light of 
relevant market practice for the role and individual circumstances. 
The cost of all beneﬁts will not exceed 10 per cent of base salary , with 
the exception of any future expatriate and/or relocation beneﬁts, 
which would be disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
The maximum and current contribution rate for Executive 
Directors is 24 per cent of base salary .
In line with HMRC approved limits.
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is  
150 per cent of annual salary with a bonus of 75 per cent of salary 
payable for achieving target levels of performance. No bonus is 
payable for below threshold performance. The payment for 
threshold performance will not exceed 10 per cent of maximum. 
Awards are made on a straight-line basis for performance between 
threshold and target, and on a separate straight-line basis for 
performance between target and maximum.
Each year participants may be granted up to 150 per cent of salary  
in shares or nil-cost options or up to 300 per cent of salary in 
market value share options.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee can make awards  
of up to 200 per cent of salary in shares or nil-cost options or up  
to 400 per cent of salary in market value share options.
The Committee’s policy is to consider exceptional executive 
performance (in the year prior to grant) as a circumstance that 
could warrant the granting of exceptional awards under  
incentive plans.
For awards made under the usual scheme limit, 33 per cent vests  
for median performance. Where an exceptional award is made,  
25 per cent vests for median performance.
Participants may earn up to one matching share for each invested 
share, in normal circumstances.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee can award two 
matching shares for each invested share.
The Committee’s policy is to consider exceptional executive 
performance (in the year prior to grant) as a circumstance that could 
warrant the granting of exceptional awards under incentive plans.
For awards made under the usual scheme limit, 33 per cent vests  
for median performance. Where an exceptional award is made,  
16.5 per cent vests for median performance.
The Committee considers individual and Company performance when setting  
base salary .

Executives’ performance is measured relative to challenging targets in key 
ﬁnancial, operational and strategic measures. The measures selected and their 
weightings vary each year according to the strategic priorities.
At least 75 per cent of the bonus will be measured against ﬁnancial performance.
Measures and respective weightings used for the current annual bonus and 
proposed for next year’s annual bonus are set out in the annual report on 
remuneration on pages 78 and 79.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 72.
PSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, however the additional 
element of an exceptional award is subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to continued employment and the Company’s 
performance over a three-year performance period based:
• 50 per cent on relative Total Return (Net Asset Value growth plus dividends)
• 50 per cent on relative TSR
For both measures, performance is measured relative to a comparator group 
comprising the largest FTSE350 property companies.
The performance measures and weightings which apply to the PSP are reviewed by 
the Committee annually , and the Committee may make non-signiﬁcant changes to 
the weightings and/or comparator group to ensure that they remain relevant to the 
Company strategy and suitably stretching.
Details of the performance conditions for previous years’ awards, and those proposed 
for 2015 awards, are set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 80 and 81.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 72.
MSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, however the 
additional element of an exceptional award made in respect of deferred bonus  
is subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to the same conditions as the PSP .

1.3 Notes to the Policy Table
Performance measurement selection
Annual Bonus Scheme
Executive Directors may earn bonuses 
depending on the Company’s ﬁnancial 
performance and their own individual 
performance. The current structure of the 
annual bonus performance conditions is 
illustrated within the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 79. The ﬁnancial 
performance measures and the importance 
of each are set out in the table below.
The annual ﬁnancial performance targets 
are set by the Committee in the ﬁrst quarter 
of each year following an analysis of 
external and internal expectations 
compiled by the Committee’s independent 
adviser. The Committee sets targets it 
believes to be appropriately stretching,  
but achievable.
Long-term incentives
As mentioned above, the performance 
conditions are consistent for the MSP and 
PSP , which ensures that the interests of 
participants in different plans are aligned, 
and comprise two measures:
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends)
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
The Committee believes that these two 
measures are the most appropriate 
measures of long-term success for Capco  
as long-term relative performance provides 
an appropriately objective and relevant 
measure of Capco’s success which is strongly 
aligned with shareholders’ interests.
The Committee believes that NAV growth  
is the most important internal measure of 
success for Capco at this time. Accordingly , 
the Committee considered it appropriate  
to reward NAV performance in both the 
short and long-term incentive 
arrangements, with one-year absolute  
NAV growth being used in respect of the 
annual bonus arrangements and three-year 
relative NAV (as the main component  
of three-year Total Return) being used in 
respect of the long-term incentives. NAV  
is used as a performance measure by over 
half of FTSE350 property companies in 
their long-term incentive arrangements.
Relative TSR helps align the interests of 
Executive Directors with shareholders by 
incentivising share price growth and, in the 
Committee’s view , provides an objective 
measure of the Company’s long-term success.
Performance is measured relative to a 
comparator group comprising the largest 
FTSE350 property companies and Capco. 
The members of the comparator group are 
shown in Figure 4 on page 81.
In order for any awards to vest, the 
Committee must also satisfy itself that  
the TR and TSR ﬁgures are a genuine 
reﬂection of underlying ﬁnancial 
performance. In assessing the extent to 
which the performance conditions have 
been met, the Committee consults with its 
independent remuneration adviser. The 
calculation of the returns is also reviewed 
by the Company’s auditors as appropriate.
The performance targets are set by the 
Committee following an analysis of internal 
and external expectations, and are believed 
to be appropriately stretching.
The current structure of the long-term 
incentive performance conditions is 
illustrated within the Annual Report  
on Remuneration on page 81.
Payments resulting from existing 
arrangements
Executive Directors are eligible to receive 
payment resulting from contractual 
arrangements entered into or the vesting  
of any award made prior to the approval 
and implementation of the remuneration 
policy detailed in this report.
Bonus malus
Awards granted from 2013 (other than 
awards made in respect of the 2012 ﬁnancial 
year) are subject to bonus malus in the event 
of gross misconduct of a Director which  
is considered to have had a material 
detrimental impact on the business of any 
Group company or to have brought the 
business of such company into signiﬁcant 
disrepute, or in the event that the prior 
ﬁnancial statements of any Group company 
or any business unit or division of any 
Group company are materially restated, 
corrected or amended. The application  
of any malus is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Why is each performance measure appropriate for Capco?
Measure Reason
Growth in Net Asset Value  
per share
Considered by the Committee to be the most important driver of value creation for Capco at the present time.
Relative Total Property Return Rewards the additional portfolio value created by management over and above any changes in value from tracking the 
property market as a whole, as measured by IPD.
Underlying Earnings Per Share Rewards value growth in net rental income as well as the management of ﬁnancing and other costs. However, given 
the current stage of the Company’s development, the Committee considers EPS to be less relevant as an indicator of 
value creation than growth in Net Asset Value per share. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 73 
Remuneration of employees below  
the Board
The policy and practice with regard to the 
remuneration of head office and Covent 
Garden employees below the Board is 
consistent with that for the Executive 
Directors, except as set out below. 
Employees below Board level have not,  
to date, participated in the MSP but do 
participate in the PSP with awards being 
subject to the same performance conditions 
as apply to awards made to Executive 
Directors (with the exception of the 
conditions that apply to any exceptional 
portion of an award made to an Executive 
Director). The 2016 awards for employees 
below the Board will be subject to the same 
performance conditions as previous years’ 
awards. In exceptional circumstances, such 
as recruitment, long-term incentive awards 
may be granted without performance 
conditions to participants below the Board. 
The pension contribution rate for 
employees below the Board is lower  
than that for Executive Directors. 
Employees below the Board are not  
subject to any minimum shareholding 
requirement. 
The Venues business has separate 
remuneration arrangements appropriate 
for that business. These comprise salary , 
separate pension arrangements and 
discretionary bonuses. 
Shareholding guidelines
The Chief Executive is required to achieve  
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 300 per cent of salary and the other 
Executive Directors are required to achieve 
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 200 per cent of base salary , to be achieved 
by retaining at least 50 per cent of any 
vested share awards (net of tax) and/or 
within three years. The Committee believes 
that these shareholding requirements are 
the most stringent in the listed property 
sector in the UK. The current shareholdings 
of the Executive Directors are set out on 
page 85. The Chairman is required to 
maintain a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent to 100 per cent of his base fee.

The potential reward opportunities 
illustrated in Figure 1 are based on the 
policy which will apply in 2016, applied  
to the base salary at the salary review date,  
1 April 2016, and provide estimates of  
the potential future reward opportunity  
for each Executive Director, and the 
potential split between the different 
elements of remuneration under three 
different performance scenarios: ‘Below 
Threshold’ , ‘Target’ and ‘Maximum’ . 
The Below Threshold scenario includes base 
salary , pension and beneﬁts (ﬁxed pay). No 
annual bonus or PSP and MSP elements are 
included (variable pay). The Target scenario 
includes ﬁxed pay , on target bonus and 
threshold vesting of PSP and MSP awards. 
The Maximum scenario includes ﬁxed pay , 
maximum bonus and full vesting of PSP 
and MSP awards. For variable pay , the 
amounts illustrated are the normal 
maximum opportunities, except for  
the 2013 MSP co-investment matching 
opportunity which is based on an 
exceptional match on an annualised 
co-investment of 50 per cent of salary .
It should be noted that the PSP and MSP 
awards granted in a year do not normally 
vest until the third anniversary of the date 
of grant. The projected values of long-term 
incentives shown here exclude the impact 
of share price movement and dividends.

1.5 Approach to recruitment remuneration
When hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration,  
as follows:
Element of remuneration Policy on recruitment Maximum opportunity
Salary Based on scope and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the 
candidate’s experience; implications for total remuneration positioning vs.
market pay levels for comparable roles; internal relativities; and the candidate’s 
current salary .
N/A
Pension On a similar basis to other Executive Directors.
Beneﬁts Appropriate beneﬁts will be provided, which may include the continuation  
of beneﬁts received in a previous role. 
Annual Bonus Executive Directors will participate in the annual bonus scheme on the same 
basis as existing Executive Directors, pro-rated for proportion of year served.
Normal policy table limits may 
be exceeded on recruitment in 
exceptional circumstances. The 
maximum additional bonus 
opportunity will be limited to  
50 per cent of salary
Matching Share Plan* New Executive Directors may participate in the MSP on similar terms to other 
executives.
As per the normal policy table.
Performance Share Plan* New Executive Directors may be granted awards under the PSP on similar terms 
to other executives.
As per the normal policy table.
Other In determining appropriate remuneration for new Executive Directors, the 
Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors (including quantum, 
the nature of remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from) to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Capco and its shareholders.
Remuneration may include:
• An award made in respect of a new appointment to “buy out” existing incentive 
awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In such cases the compensatory 
award would typically be a like-for-like award with similar time-to-vesting, 
performance conditions and likelihood of those conditions being met. The fair 
value of the compensatory award would not be greater than the awards being 
replaced. To facilitate such a buyout, the Committee may use an award under a 
different structure or an additional award under the PSP or MSP .
• A relocation package, should this be required. 
• In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board, the Company would 
honour any existing contractual arrangements.
 
* Awards are subject to performance conditions.
1.6 Service contracts and exit payment policy
The service contracts of Executive Directors are approved by the Remuneration Committee and are one-year rolling contracts. The current 
contracts commenced on 17 May 2010. The service contracts may be terminated by either party giving one year’s notice to the other. It is the 
Company’s policy that termination payments should not exceed the Director’s current salary and beneﬁts for the notice period.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of his/her statutory employment rights or any other 
claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Committee will be entitled to enter into a settlement agreement with the 
Director. The Company may pay a Director’s legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement. 
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and 
participants. Any annual bonus payment in respect of the year of termination is subject to the discretion of the Committee.

Soumen Das 17 May 2010 12 months
Gary Yardley 17 May 2010 12 months Governance Financial statements Strategic report

The table below summarises how MSP and PSP awards are typically treated in speciﬁc leaver circumstances, with the ﬁnal treatment 
remaining subject to the Committee’s discretion:
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Treatment of awards
Good leaver Normal vesting date, although 
the Committee has discretion to 
accelerate
Payments are pro-rated for time and remain subject to outstanding performance 
conditions. Where vesting is accelerated, payments are further pro-rated to reﬂect the 
extent to which the performance conditions had been satisﬁed at the date of leaving.
Change of control Immediately Except in certain cases which were set out in full in the Company’s prospectus dated 12 
March 2010, vesting will be pro-rated for time and remain subject to performance 
conditions. However, the Committee has discretion to allow awards to vest in full in such 
circumstances if it deems this to be fair and reasonable.
Any other reason Awards lapse
An individual would generally be considered a ‘good leaver’ if they left the Group’s employment by reason of injury , ill-health, disability 
approved by the Committee, redundancy or retirement with the agreement of the employing company . The table above summarises how 
MSP and PSP awards are typically treated in speciﬁc leaver circumstances, with the ﬁnal treatment remaining subject to the Committee’s 
discretion, for example an individual may be considered a ‘good leaver’ for any other reason at the absolute discretion of the Committee, 
and the vesting of awards may be reduced for ‘good leavers’. 
There are no obligations on the Company contained within the existing Directors’ service contracts which would give rise to payments not 
disclosed in this report.
The service contracts of any future-appointed Directors will provide for mitigation in the event of termination.
1.7 Non-executive Director Policy Table
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment. The letters of appointment of the 
Non-executive Directors are reviewed by the Board annually and contain a one month notice period. The Chairman’s letter of appointment 
contains a 12 month notice period.

Non-executive Directors.
The Chairman and Non-executive Director fees  
are reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase 
taking effect from 1 May .
The Board and Committee review fees with 
reference to: 
• other property companies
• UK companies of a similar size
• the time that Non-executive Directors are required 
to devote to the role
Non-executive Director fees may include a 
basic fee and Committee/SID fees as 
disclosed in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. These are set at a level that 
is considered appropriately competitive in 
light of market practice, and will not exceed 
the aggregate fees permitted by the 
Company’s Articles of Association.
N/A
Beneﬁts
To be appropriately competitive 
with those offered at  
comparator companies.
The Chairman’s beneﬁts include private healthcare 
and personal accident and travel insurance. 
Other Non-executive Directors will be covered by 
the Company’s travel insurance policy should they 
be required to travel on Company business.
The maximum value of the beneﬁts 
provided to Non-executive Directors will be 
the cost of purchasing them in the market.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
1.8 External Directorships
The Company’s policy is to encourage each 
Executive Director to take up one or more 
Non-executive Directorships, subject to 
Board approval. Fees received for serving  
as a Non-executive Director of a company 
outside the Capco Group are retained by  
the Executive Director. 
1.9 Consideration of conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
When setting Executive Director pay the 
Committee considers the remuneration and 
overall conditions of all employees. The 
Committee does not consult with 
employees when deciding remuneration 
policy , but it receives regular updates from 
the HR Director on salary increases, bonus 
and share awards made to Group employees 
and is aware of how the remuneration of 
Directors compares to that of other 
employees, for example, salary increases are 
generally in line with increases awarded to 
other employees, which are set with 
reference to market data. 
1.10 Consideration of shareholder views
It is the Committee’s policy to consult with 
major shareholders as appropriate, for 
example, prior to ﬁnalising any major 
changes to its executive remuneration policy .
2. ANNUAL REPORT ON 
REMUNERATION
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report explains how Capco’s remuneration 
policy has been implemented during  
the year.
2.1 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining and 
recommending to the Board the policy  
for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, setting targets for the Company’s 
incentive schemes and determining the 
total individual remuneration package for 
each Executive Director. Membership of the 
Committee as at 31 December 2015 and the 
date of this report is set out on page 69. In 
addition, the Company Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Company Secretary and the 
Director of HR & CR are invited to attend 
Committee meetings and contribute,  
except on matters relating to their own 
remuneration. Attendance at the 
seven meetings held during the year is 
shown in the table on page 61 and a 
summary of the matters considered by  
the Committee during the year is set out  
in the adjacent shaded box in column 3.
2.2 Remuneration Committee and  
its advisers
The Committee appointed New Bridge 
Street as its independent remuneration 
adviser in 2014 following a competitive 
process. During the year, the Committee 
received advice on matters including 
remuneration structure, incentive design 
and target setting from New Bridge Street. 
New Bridge Street is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and 
adheres to its code of conduct. The 
Committee has received conﬁrmation of 
independence from New Bridge Street, and 
is satisﬁed that the advice received was 
objective and independent. In addition to 
advice provided to the Committee, New 
Bridge Street also provided share award 
valuation services to the Company . During 
2015, the Company was charged a total of 
£143,727 by New Bridge Street in respect of 
advice to the Committee. Fees were charged 
on a time basis.
2.3 Statement of shareholder voting
The table below shows the results of the 
advisory vote on the 2014 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report at the 2015 AGM and 
the binding vote on remuneration policy at 
the 2014 AGM.
2.4 Single ﬁgure of remuneration
The tables on page 77 show the single 
ﬁgures of total remuneration paid to each 
Director in 2015 and 2014. The charts in 
Figure 2 on page 78 illustrate the 
contribution that each element of 
remuneration made to the total 
remuneration of the Executive Directors, 
including the substantial proportion of 
remuneration that has resulted from the 
share price growth from which all 
shareholders have beneﬁted.
Matters considered by the 
Committee over the past  
year include:
 ◦ Executive Director remuneration
 ◦ Shareholder discussion meetings
 ◦ Directors’ Remuneration Report
 ◦ Committee terms of reference
 ◦ Institutional investor voting 
reports and voting at 2015 AGM
 ◦ Setting of and evaluation of 
performance against Executive 
Directors’ performance targets

2   In the 2015 table, this comprises the expected value on vesting of the 2013 PSP and MSP awards which have a performance period that ran from 2013 to 2015, and are expected to vest 
in early 2016. The value on vesting of these awards has been included in the 2015 single figure as the performance conditions relating to these awards had been substantially (but 
not fully) completed during 2015, and has been calculated assuming that 60 per cent of the PSP awards and, depending on the award, 40 or 80 per cent of the MSP awards will vest 
and using the average share price for the last three months of 2015, being £4.333. As required under the remuneration regulations, the 2014 multi-year variable comparators (which 
were previously disclosed on the basis described above assuming 93.1 per cent vesting and using a price of £3.464) have been restated with values calculated using the actual share

Directors’ remuneration report continued
The Committee has previously committed 
to publish the ﬁnancial performance  
targets once they cease to be commercially 
sensitive. The ﬁnancial performance  
targets that applied in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2013 are no longer 
commercially sensitive; accordingly , the 
targets and the Company’s performance 
against these targets are set out on the 
following page. The 2013 annual bonus 
awards were based 75 per cent on  
ﬁnancial performance and 25 per cent  
on individual performance.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 
2015, the Company performed strongly 
against its ﬁnancial targets, for example 
NAV per share was over 5.5 per cent higher 
than the top end of the target range set by 
the Committee and TPR at 15.7 per cent 
compares to 13.8 per cent for the IPD index. 
However, underlying EPS of 0.9p was  
below the threshold performance target. 
Accordingly awards of 101.25 per cent of 
salary were made to each Executive Director 
in respect of the ﬁnancial performance 
measures. The Committee assessed 
individual performance against a set of 
KPIs which align with the Company’s 
objectives outlined on page 12 of the  
Annual Report.
These KPIs include:
 ◦ Corporate objectives: enhancing Capco’s 
position and reputation in the market; 
identifying, monitoring and controlling 
risk, progress towards meeting medium-
term corporate objectives;
 ◦ Financial objectives: optimising liquidity 
and ﬁnancing; effective cost and capital 
expenditure management; other 
budgeted KPIs;
 ◦ Investment objectives: strategic 
investment initiatives; establishment  
and operation of JVs; implementation of 
business plans; achievement of planning 
targets; and
 ◦ CR/HR objectives: optimisation of 
organisational structure; nurturing of 
future leaders; promotion and support  
of CR initiatives. 
The performance of the Executive Directors 
in 2015 was considered to have been 
excellent, including the achievement of  
new record rental levels at Covent Garden, 
completion of Earls Court Partnership 
Limited, the Covent Garden reﬁnancing, the 
commencement of Earls Court demolition 
and Lillie Square Phase 1 construction. 
Accordingly , awards of between 30.75 and 
35.63 per cent of salary were made to each 
Executive Director in respect of the 
individual performance measures.

2.5 Incentive outcomes in respect of the 
year ended 31 December 2015
Annual Bonus Scheme
Executive Directors may earn bonuses  
of up to 150 per cent of salary depending  
on the Company’s ﬁnancial performance  
and their own individual performance. 
Awards made in respect of the year ended  
31 December 2015 were based 75 per cent  
on ﬁnancial performance, and 25 per cent 
on individual performance. 
The ﬁnancial performance element for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 was based on 
growth in absolute NAV per share (“NAV”), 
Total Property Return relative to the IPD 
Total Return All Property Index (“TPR”), 
and underlying EPS (“EPS”). In 
determining the annual targets for these 
measures in 2015, the Committee 
recognised the long-term nature of some 
aspects of the Company’s strategy , and the 
extent to which this would be reﬂected in 
these measures on a 12-month horizon. The 
performance measures, weightings and 
targets that applied in respect of the 2015 
annual bonus are summarised in the table 
on page 79. 
The Committee has decided that, reﬂecting 
the greater relative importance of NAV and 
TPR to Capco’s strategy , in 2016 the 
weighting of EPS as a performance measure 
will be reduced to 5 per cent of the ﬁnancial 
performance measures. The rebalancing of 
weightings of the ﬁnancial performance 
measures for 2016 is shown in the table on 
page 79. The relative weighting of ﬁnancial 
and individual performance measures will 
remain unchanged. The Committee will 
consider the appropriate weighting of the 
EPS measure on an annual basis.
The TPR target is included in the 
Company’s KPIs on page 13. The KPIs are  
in part dependent upon the occurrence of 
certain discrete events. Therefore, whilst 
the outperformance targets that apply  
to the long-term incentives are disclosed, 
the Board has decided that as the Group 
operates in three speciﬁc locations within 
the competitive central London property 
market, prospective disclosure of speciﬁc 
short-term NAV and EPS targets would 
provide a level of information to 
counterparties that could prejudice the 
Company’s commercial interests.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The operation of, and the maximum 
opportunities under, the PSP are explained 
in the remuneration policy on pages 70 and 
71. Details of the awards made to Executive 
Directors under the PSP in 2015 and in past 
years are set out in the tables on pages 86 
and 87 . Since 2011, in line with common 
market practice, with the exception of 
awards made under the HMRC approved 
schedule to the PSP , the Committee has 
made awards to Executive Directors in  
nil cost options which utilise a lower 
proportion of the Company’s share capital 
than market value share options.
In 2015, an award of 150 per cent of salary 
was made to Executive Directors in nil-cost 
options and the Committee has decided 
that the same level of award will be made  
in 2016. In 2015, the Committee determined 
that the performance conditions relating  
to the market value options awarded under 
the PSP in 2012 had been partially satisﬁed 
and accordingly 93.1 per cent of the awards 
vested. Details of the performance 
conditions that apply to awards made under 
the PSP are set out in Figure 4 on page 81. 
The Committee continues to explore ways 
of structuring future awards under the 
long-term incentive arrangements in a 
potentially more tax efficient manner for 
participants. The Committee will ensure 
that any changes are cost neutral to Capco. 
No changes are proposed at this time.
2.6 Long-term incentive performance 
conditions
As explained in the policy report, the 
current performance conditions are the 
same for both the MSP and PSP and 
comprise two equally weighted measures:
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends)
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
The Committee has reviewed the 
performance conditions for the PSP and MSP 
and concluded that the existing performance 
measures are believed to be appropriately 
stretching and remain appropriate. 
The performance conditions for the MSP 
and PSP awards are illustrated in Figure 4 
on page 81.
2.7 Vesting of 2012 and 2013 MSP and 
PSP awards (Audited)
In 2015, having considered a report 
prepared by the Company’s auditors, the 
Committee determined that Capco’s 
TSR had outperformed the median of the 
comparator group by 3.2 per cent p.a. (vs. an 
outperformance target of 4 per cent), and 
that Capco’s TR had outperformed the 
median of the comparator group by more 
than 9 per cent p.a. (vs. an outperformance 
target of 2.5 per cent p.a.) and as such  
93.1 per cent of the 2012 PSP and MSP 
awards vested or, where holding periods 
continued to apply , would vest subject  
to continued employment on the third 
anniversary of grant.
In 2016, the Committee determined that 
Capco’s TR was expected to outperform the 
median of the comparator group by 2.2 per 
cent p.a. (vs. an outperformance target of  
2.5 per cent or 3 per cent for exceptional 
awards), and that Capco’s TSR was expected 
to outperform the median of the 
comparator group by 2.1 per cent p.a. (vs. an 
outperformance target of 4 per cent or 5 per 
cent for exceptional awards), and as such 
the performance conditions relating to the 
2013 PSP and MSP awards had been met in 
part. Accordingly 60 per cent of the 2013 
PSP awards, 40 per cent of the MSP awards 
made in respect of co-investment and 80 per 
cent of the MSP awards made in respect of 
deferred bonus are expected to vest, subject 
to continued employment on the third 
anniversary of grant.
Long-term Incentive Arrangements
Matching Share Plan (MSP)
The operation of, and the maximum 
opportunities under, the MSP are  
explained in the remuneration policy on 
pages 70 and 71. Details of the awards made 
to Executive Directors under the MSP in 
2015 and in past years are set out in tables 
on pages 86 and 87 . These awards include 
deferred bonus shares, and matching 
awards made in respect of deferred bonus 
and co-investment, in accordance with the 
remuneration policy .
Annual bonus: 
The Committee has awarded a normal  
1:1 matching opportunity in respect of 
Directors’ deferred bonus shares for 2015.
Co-investment opportunity: 
In 2010 (the inception year of Capco), 
Executive Directors were invited to 
co-invest up to 150 per cent of salary in  
the Company’s shares during the ﬁrst  
12 months of inception (subsequently 
extended to 24 months as the Company  
was subject to extended restricted periods 
during which Directors were unable to 
purchase Capco shares) in return for the 
opportunity to receive up to two shares for 
each share purchased, subject to three-year 
performance. The Committee considered 
that the MSP had been highly successful 
and had played a crucial role in motivating 
and retaining management. Accordingly , 
and in light of the Company’s strong 
performance since 2010, which signiﬁcantly 
exceeded the maximum level of 
performance rewarded under the original 
performance conditions, in 2013 the 
Committee offered the Executive Directors 
an opportunity to invest up to 150 per cent 
of 2013 salary between 2013 and 2015 when 
permitted by scheme headroom with an 
exceptional matching opportunity of 2:1. 
The additional matching opportunity can 
only be earned for performance above the 
normal stretch targets, as illustrated in 
Figure 4 on page 81. As the Company was  
in a prohibited dealing period before the 
year-end, the Committee has permitted 
participants to co-invest under the 2013 
invitation for a short window as soon as  
the Company is no longer in a prohibited 
period, to allow participants to utilise this 
opportunity . The MSP awards made in 
respect of co-investment under this 
invitation to date are set out on page 87 .
In light of the crucial role the Committee 
considers the MSP to have in motivating 
and retaining management, the Committee 
has offered the Executive Directors in 2016 
an opportunity to invest up to 150 per cent 
of 2016 salary between 2016 and 31 December 
2018 when permitted by scheme headroom 
with a normal matching opportunity of 1:1. Governance Financial statements Strategic report

Non-executive Directorship of AIM-listed

Limited from which he stepped down on  
30 December 2015. No other Executive 
Director currently serves as a Non-executive 
Director elsewhere.
2.11 Statement of implementation  
of policy for 2016
Salary
The Executive Directors’ salaries are 
reviewed annually . The current salary 
positioning of the Chief Executive remains 
below the level that the Committee believes 
to be appropriate for the contribution and 
experience of the individual concerned and 
is also below market levels when compared 
to property and development companies of 
similar size. However, the Committee has 
decided to address this issue as part of the 
ongoing review of remuneration, and for 
2016 will increase the salary of the Chief 
Executive by 3.6 per cent to £578,000 which 
is in line with the increase expected to be 
applied to Group employees. In setting the 
2016 salaries of the Managing Directors,  
the Committee took advice from its 
remuneration adviser, and considered  
each Director’s performance, experience, 
and market data. Following an assessment 
of the performance of the Managing 
Director & Chief Financial Officer in his 
new role, the Committee has approved an 
increase in his base salary from £410,000  
to £450,000. The salary of the Managing 
Director & Chief Investment Officer will  
be increased by approximately 3.6 per cent 
to £518,000. 
The proposed revised salaries for the 
Executive Directors are set out in the  
table below:
Executive Director Salaries – 2015 and 2016
2016 2015 % Increase
Ian Hawksworth £578,000 £558,000 3.6

Pension and beneﬁts
As described in the policy table on pages  
70 and 71.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity will  
remain unchanged for 2016. The ﬁnancial 
performance targets for the year ended  
31 December 2015 were based on growth  
in absolute NAV per share, Total Property 
Return relative to the IPD Total Return All 
Property Index, and underlying EPS. 
Further information on the Company’s 
KPIs can be found on page 13. 
The Committee has decided that growth in 
absolute NAV per share and Total Property 
Return relative to the IPD Total Return All 
Property Index are the most important 
ﬁnancial performance measures for 2016  
as they best reﬂect the KPIs by which the 
Company measures its success, and that the 
relative weighting of underlying earnings 
per share will be reduced to 5 per cent of the 
ﬁnancial performance measures for 2016. 
The rebalancing of weightings of the 
ﬁnancial performance measures, which 
reﬂects the Committee’s view of their 
relative importance for 2016 given the 
current stage in the execution of Capco’s 
strategy , is shown in the table on page 79. 
The relative weighting of ﬁnancial and 
individual performance measures will 
remain unchanged. The Committee will 
consider the appropriate weighting of 
underlying earnings per share as a 
performance measure on an annual basis. 
The key area of focus for 2016 continues to 
be capital growth. The Board has decided 
that the 2016 annual bonus targets should 
not be disclosed prospectively due to 
commercial sensitivity . The Group operates 
in three speciﬁc locations within the 
competitive central London property 
market. As a result the Board feels that any 
disclosure on its targets would provide a 
level of information to the market around 
its current return targets which would be 
commercially sensitive. The Committee 
expects to publish the performance targets 
retrospectively once they have ceased to be 
commercially sensitive.
Matching Share Plan
The MSP awards to be made in 2016  
are described on page 80. The applicable 
performance conditions are set out  
on page 81.
Performance Share Plan 
PSP awards of 150 per cent of salary will be 
made in 2016 (2015: 150 per cent) as nil cost 
options. The applicable performance 
conditions are set out on page 81.
Chairman and Non-executive  
Director remuneration
The Chairman has been appointed for  
a three-year term, subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders, which will 
expire at the 2016 AGM at which he will 
seek re-election. The Chairman’s annual 
base fee for 2015 was £248,000.
The remuneration of the Chairman is 
reviewed annually . Following the 2015 
review it was agreed that the Chairman’s 
annual base fee would be increased to 
£257 ,000 with effect from 1 May 2016.
The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors is considered by the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive, with regard to 
market comparatives, and recommended  
to the Board as a whole. The Non-executive 
Director fees are reviewed annually . 
Following the 2015 review it was agreed that 
the Non-executive Director fees would be 
increased as set out in the table above with 
effect from 1 May 2016.

2.15 Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (Audited)
(a) Directors’ shareholdings
The beneﬁcial interests in the shares of the Company for each Director who served during the year are set out in the table below. The  
Chief Executive is required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 300 per cent of salary and the other Executive Directors 
are required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary , to be achieved by retaining at least 50 per 
cent of any vested share awards (net of tax) and/or within three years. The Chairman is required to maintain a shareholding equivalent to 
100 per cent of his base fee. The Committee believes that these shareholding requirements, which have been met, are the most stringent  
in the UK property sector. The current shareholdings of the Chairman and Executive Directors are illustrated in Figure 7 .

Directors’ responsibilities 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
& Accounts, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
(a)  select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
(b)  make judgements and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent; 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union (EU) have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial  
statements; and  
(d)  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time,  
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
– the Group financial statements, which have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true  
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position  
and profit of the Group; 
– the Directors’ report contained includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces; and 
– having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought  
to the attention of the Board during the year into account, the 
Directors consider that the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as 
a whole are fair, balanced and understandable. The Directors 
believe that the disclosures set out in the Annual Report & 
Accounts provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position, performance, business model 
and strategy. 
The financial statements on pages 96 to 142 were approved by the 
Board of Directors on 24 February 2016 and signed on its behalf by

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. 
Our audit approach 
Context 
Our 2015 audit was planned and executed having regard to the fact that Capital & Counties Properties PLC’s operations were largely 
unchanged in nature from the previous year, additionally, there have been no significant changes to the valuation methodology and 
accounting standards relevant to the Group. In light of this, our approach to the audit in terms of scoping and areas of focus was largely 
unchanged. 
Overview 
Materiality Overall Group materiality: £42 million (2014: £31 million) which represents 1% of total assets. 
Audit scope We audited the complete financial information of each of the Group’s four business lines of which Covent Garden, Earls 
Court and Venues are financially significant. 
Areas of focus Valuation of central London investment and development properties. 
 Taxation. 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to 
provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in 
this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.    Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 92

Area of focus   How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Valuation of investment and development properties 
Refer to pages 62 to 64 (Audit Committee Report), pages102 to 106 
(Principal Accounting Policies) and pages 102 to 142 (Notes to  
the accounts) 
The valuation of the Group’s investment and development properties is 
the key component of the net asset value and underpins the Group’s 
result for the year. The result of the revaluation this year was a gain  
of £454m (2014: £454m), which is accounted for within ‘Gain on 
revaluation and sale of investment and development property’ and  
is a significant component of total consolidated income. The Group’s 
property portfolios, which comprise investment property (including, 
retail, restaurants, offices, exhibition and residential) and development 
property located in central London are not uniform in nature, and 
therefore a number of different assumptions are made by the Group’s 
external valuers in determining fair value: 
 Investment properties − The valuation of investment properties 
(principally Covent Garden) is inherently subjective, due principally 
to the individual nature of each property (including its location) which 
heavily influences the future rental it is expected to generate. The 
assumptions on which the property values are based are influenced 
by tenure and tenancy details for each property, prevailing market 
yields and comparable market transactions. 
 Development properties − The valuation of development property  
is also inherently subjective. Development properties (principally  
Earls Court), are valued using the residual appraisal method (i.e. by 
estimating the fair value of the completed project using either a sales 
comparison or income capitalisation method less estimated costs to 
completion and market based profit margin providing a return on 
development risk). 
The valuations were carried out by third party valuers, Jones Lang 
LaSalle and CB Richard Ellis (the “Valuers”). They were engaged by  
the Directors, in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional 
Standards (“RICS”). The Valuers used by the Group are well-known 
firms, with considerable experience of the Group’s market.  
The fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property 
valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material misstatement, 
warrants specific audit focus on this area.  
Experience of Valuers and relevance of their work 
We read the Valuers’ reports from CB Richard Ellis and Jones Lang 
LaSalle, who between them, value the entire property portfolio. We 
confirmed that the approaches used were consistent with RICS and the 
requirements of IFRS. We assessed the Valuers’ competence and 
capabilities and read their terms of engagement with the Group, 
determining that there were no matters that affected their independence 
and objectivity or imposed scope limitations upon them. 
Data provided to the Valuers 
For investment and development properties we sample tested data 
provided to the Valuers by management and found that it was accurate 
and reliable. This data included tenancy schedules, capital expenditure 
details, cost schedules and square footage details which we agreed 
back to appropriate supporting documentation. For development 
properties we agreed that the planned schemes being valued were 
consistent with the actual planned developments and, where 
appropriate, had achieved planning consents. 
Assumptions and estimates used by the Valuers 
We met with the Valuers independently of management and 
challenged the valuation methods and assumptions used. The nature  
of assumptions used varied across the portfolio depending on the nature 
of each property but they included estimated capital values, investment 
yields, construction costs and developers’ margins. In each of these 
areas, and on a sample basis, we compared the estimates and 
assumptions used by the Valuers against our own expectations, using 
evidence of comparable market transactions. Where we identified 
estimates and assumptions that were outside the typical ranges used, 
we discussed these with the Valuers to understand the rationale  
and then assessed, based on all the available evidence and our 
experience in this sector, whether the use of the estimate or assumption 
was justified. 
Our testing which involved the use of our internal real estate valuation 
specialists, qualified chartered surveyors with deep market knowledge, 
indicated that the estimates and assumptions used were appropriate in 
the context of the Group’s property portfolios. 
Taxation 
Refer to pages 62 to 64 (Audit Committee Report), pages 102 to 106 
(Principal Accounting Policies) and pages 102 to 142 (Notes to  
the accounts) 
Tax is a specific risk for the Group due to the degree of judgement 
involved in some of the ongoing activities of the Group and the wider 
Group restructuring. This gives rise to material tax considerations on the 
calculation, recognition, and classification of current and deferred tax 
balances from both a tax compliance and accounting perspective. 
Judgements are made by management to arrive at the current and 
deferred tax position. These judgements include the impact of the 
transfer of investment properties and the Group holding structure. 
 
We assessed the principal assumptions and judgements made in 
arriving at the current and deferred tax position by using our experience 
of similar matters in the industry. 
We used our tax specialists to evaluate tax provisions and potential 
exposures as at 31 December 2015, challenging the Group’s 
assumptions and judgements through our knowledge of the tax 
circumstances and by reading relevant correspondence between the 
Group and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs and the Group’s external 
tax advisors. 
Our testing did not identify any matters that the Directors had not 
adequately reflected in their calculation of the necessary current and 
deferred tax provisions.

How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as  
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates.  
The Group is structured along four business lines, Covent Garden, Earls Court Properties (including the Lillie Square development joint 
venture), Venues and Other. 
The Group engagement team audited all business lines except Venues (a significant component), where the detailed audit procedures were 
performed by a separate PwC engagement team. The Group team issued the Venues audit team with detailed instructions that explained 
the work that the Venues audit team needed to do and highlighted, in particular, the areas of focus insofar as they were relevant to the 
Venues business line. Throughout the audit, the Group team communicated with the Venues team to make sure that we obtained 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality  £42 million (2014: £31 million). 
How we determined it  1% of total assets. 
Rationale for benchmark 
applied  
The key area of focus in the audit is the valuation of investment and development properties and the balance 
sheet as a whole. Given this, consistent with the prior year, we set an overall Group materiality level based 
on total assets. 
In addition, a number of key performance indicators of the Group are driven by income statement items and we, therefore, applied a lower 
specific materiality of £16 million (2014: £13 million) based on a three year average profit before tax for testing net rental income, finance 
costs and administrative expenses. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during 
our audit above £2 million (2014: £1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ Statement, set out on page 89, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.  
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and 
that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we 
have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
– the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 56 to 61 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements. 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 information in the Annual Report is: 
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group and Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
 otherwise misleading. 
 
We have no exceptions to report. 
 the statement given by the Directors on page 90 , in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole 
to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to 
assess the Group’s and Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company acquired in the 
course of performing our audit. 
 
We have no exceptions to report. 
 the section of the Annual Report on page 63, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee. 
 
We have no exceptions to report. 
 
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity  
of the Group 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to: 
 the Directors’ confirmation on page 14 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 
of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
 
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to.

whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
 
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit 
and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in 
alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.

Corporate governance statement 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, a corporate governance statement has not been prepared 
by the Parent Company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions of the 
Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review.  
 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT 
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 90, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
– whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
– the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
– the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures 
or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the accounts 
 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
General information 
Capital & Counties Properties PLC (the “Company”) was 
incorporated and registered in England and Wales on  
3 February 2010 under the Companies Act as a public company 
limited by shares, registration number 7145051. The registered 
office of the Company is 15 Grosvenor Street, London, W1K 4QZ, 
United Kingdom. The principal activity of the Company is to act  
as the ultimate parent company of Capital & Counties Properties 
PLC Group (the “Group”), whose principal activity is the 
development and management of property.  
The Group’s assets principally comprise investment and 
development property at Covent Garden, Earls Court and  
the exhibition halls at Olympia. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union, International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) 
interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
under the historical cost convention as modified for the  
revaluation of property, available-for-sale investments and 
derivative financial instruments.  
During 2015, the following accounting standards were adopted  
by the Group: 
IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payment’ (amendment) 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (amendment) 
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ (amendment) 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ (amendment)  
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (amendment) 
IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (amendment) 
IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ (amendment) 
These pronouncements had no significant impact on the 
consolidated financial statements and resulted in no changes to 
presentation and disclosure.  
Standards and guidelines relevant to the Group that were in issue 
and endorsed at the date of approval of the consolidated financial 
statements but not effective at the balance sheet date and have not 
been adopted early are: 
IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations’ (amendment) 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ (amendment) 
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ (amendment) 
IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ (amendment) 
IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ (amendment) 
IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (amendment) 
IAS 34 ‘Interim financial reporting’ (amendment) 
The assessments of these amendments issued but not effective are not 
anticipated to have a material impact on the financial statements. 
A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, which 
have been applied consistently across the Group is set out below. 
Going Concern 
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future  
and for this reason the consolidated financial statements have  
been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation  
These consolidated financial statements include the consolidation 
of the following limited partnerships: Capital & Counties CGP, 
Capital & Counties CGP 9, Capco CGP 2012 LP, EC Properties LP, 
Solum Group Holdings LP and The Empress State Limited 
Partnership. The members of these qualifying partnerships have 
taken advantage of exemptions available in Statutory Instrument 
2008/569 and therefore will not produce consolidated accounts  
at the partnership level. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in British 
pounds sterling, which is also determined to be the functional 
currency of the Parent. 
Subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which  
the Group has control; it is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over an entity. Subsidiaries 
cease to be consolidated from the date this control is lost. 
Non-controlling interests are recognised on the basis of their 
proportionate share in the recognised amounts of a subsidiary’s 
identifiable net assets. On the balance sheet non-controlling 
interests are presented separately from the equity of the owners  
of the Parent. Profit or loss and total comprehensive income for  
the period attributable to non-controlling interests are presented 
separately in the income statement and the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Estimation and uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, income and 
expenses. Although these estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those estimates.  
The most significant area of estimation and uncertainty in the 
consolidated financial statements is in respect of the valuation  
of the property portfolio and investments, where external 
valuations are obtained. The valuation of the Group’s property 
portfolio is inherently subjective due to the assumptions as 
outlined within the property portfolio note. As a result, the 
valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject  
to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions 
which may not prove to be accurate and could therefore have a 
material effect on the Group’s financial performance and position. 
Other areas of estimation and uncertainty are included within  
the accounting policies below, the more significant being: 
Revenue recognition 
Share-based payment 
Provisions 
Pensions 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Income taxes 
Trade and other receivables 
Operating segments 
Management has determined the operating segments with 
reference to reports on divisional financial performance and 
position that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive,  
who is deemed to be the chief operating decision maker. 
Revenue recognition 
Property rental income and exhibition income consist of gross 
income calculated on an accruals basis, together with services  
where the Group acts as principal in the ordinary course of 
business, excluding sales of property. Rental income is spread 
evenly over the period from lease commencement to lease expiry.  
   Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 103 
 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Revenue recognition continued 
Tenant lease incentive payments, including surrender premiums 
paid which can be directly linked to enhanced rental income,  
are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Upon receipt of a surrender premium for the early termination  
of a lease, the profit and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the 
lease concerned are immediately reflected in net rental income. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed  
at the inception of a lease, for example increases arising on  
rent reviews, are recorded as income in the periods in which  
they are earned.  
Rent reviews are recognised as income, based on management 
estimates, when it is reasonable to assume they will be received. 
Estimates are derived from knowledge of market rents for 
comparable properties determined on an individual property  
basis and updated for progress of negotiations. 
Where revenue is obtained by the sale of property, it is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to  
the buyer. This will normally take place on exchange of contracts 
unless there are conditions that suggest insufficient probability  
of future economic benefits flowing to the Group. For conditional 
exchanges, sales are recognised when these conditions are satisfied. 
Revenue arising from the sale of property under construction is 
recognised when both contracts have been exchanged and the 
building work is physically complete.  
Other income includes management fees charged to joint ventures 
for services associated with the management of properties and 
other general expenses as defined by management agreements. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate. 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right  
to receive payment has been established. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view  
are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size  
or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s  
financial performance.  
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting  
from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the income statement except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of available-for-sale investments  
which are recognised in other comprehensive income.  
Income taxes 
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the 
year and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by  
the balance sheet date.  
In accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, deferred tax is provided 
for using the balance sheet liability method on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of those assets 
and liabilities. However, temporary differences are not recognised 
to the extent that they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; or are associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where  
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be 
controlled by the parent, venture or investor, respectively,  
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believes it is probable that future taxable profit  
will be available against which the deferred tax assets can be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate  
to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the  
same taxable group or different taxable entities where there is an 
intention to settle balances on a net basis.  
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates  
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.  
For tax purposes, an investment property accounted for at fair 
value will normally be recovered through sale rather than use.  
Discontinued operation 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s  
business that represents a separate major line of the business  
that has been disposed of or meets the criteria for classification  
as held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented separately 
from continuing operations in both the income statement and 
statement of cash flows.  
Share-based payment 
The cost of granting share options and other share-based 
remuneration to employees and Directors is recognised  
through the income statement with reference to the fair value  
of the instrument at the date of grant.  
The income statement is charged over the vesting period of  
the options with a corresponding increase in equity. An option 
pricing model is used applying assumptions around expected 
yields, forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility.  
Upon eventual exercise, a reserves transfer occurs with no  
further charge reflected in the income statement. 
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans and 
other share-based payment arrangements are treated as treasury 
shares and deducted from equity.  
Investment and development property 
Investment and development property are owned or leased  
by the Group and held for long-term rental income and  
capital appreciation. 
The Group has chosen to use the fair value model. Property and  
any related obligations are initially recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards attached to the property have transferred to the 
Group. Payments made in respect of the future acquisition of 
investment and development property, as is the case for the CLSA, 
are initially recognised as prepayments until the recognition 
criteria outlined above have been met. Investment and 
development property are recorded at cost and subsequently 
revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined  
by professionally qualified external valuers on the basis of market 
value after allowing for future transaction costs.  
The fair value of property is arrived at by adjusting the market 
value as above for directly attributable tenant lease incentives  
and fixed head leases. 
Property held under leases is stated gross of the recognised finance 
lease liability.

Notes to the accounts continued 
 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Investment and development property continued 
The valuation is based upon assumptions as outlined within the 
property portfolio note. These assumptions conform with the  
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation 
Professional Standards. The cost of development properties 
includes capitalised interest and other directly attributable 
outgoings, with the exception of properties and land where no 
development is imminent in which case no interest is included. 
Interest is capitalised (before tax relief) on the basis of the  
weighted average cost of debt outstanding until the date of 
practical completion. 
When the Group redevelops a property for continued future use, 
that property is classified as investment and development property 
during the redevelopment period and continues to be measured  
at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
and development property are recognised in the income statement 
in the period in which they arise. Depreciation is not provided in 
respect of investment property including plant and equipment 
integral to such investment property. Investment and development 
properties cease to be recognised as investment and development 
property when they have been disposed of or when they cease to  
be held for the purpose of generating rental income or for  
capital appreciation.  
Disposals are recognised on completion. Gains or losses arising  
are recognised in the income statement. The gain on disposal is 
determined as the difference between the net sales proceeds and  
the carrying amount of the asset at the commencement of the 
accounting period plus capital expenditure in the period.  
A property ceases to be recognised as investment and development 
property and is transferred at its fair value to trading property 
when, in the Directors’ judgement, development commences with 
the intention of sale. Criteria considered in this assessment include, 
the Board’s stated intention, contractual commitments and 
physical, legal and financial viability. 
When the use of a property changes from trading property to 
investment and development property, the property is transferred at 
fair value with any resulting gain recognised in the income statement. 
Trading property 
Trading property comprises those properties that in the  
Directors’ view are not held for long-term rental income or  
capital appreciation and are expected to be disposed of within  
one year of the balance sheet date or to be developed with the 
intention to sell.  
Such property is constructed, acquired, or if transferred from 
investment and development property, transferred at fair value 
which is deemed to represent cost. Subsequently trading property 
is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling costs. 
This approximates market value as determined by professionally 
qualified external valuers at the balance sheet date.  
The amount of any write down of trading property to market value 
is recognised as an expense in the period the write down occurs. 
Should a valuation uplift occur in a subsequent period, the amount 
of any reversal shall be recognised as a reduction in the previous 
write down in the period in which the uplift occurs. This may not 
exceed the property’s initial cost.  
The sale of trading property is recognised as income when the 
significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer. 
Total costs incurred in respect of trading property are recognised 
simultaneously as an expense.  
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. 
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards  
of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease.  
All other leases are normally classified as operating leases.  
Group as a lessee: 
In accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’, property  
held under finance and operating leases may be accounted for as 
investment property. Finance leases are recognised as both an asset 
and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.  
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet  
at the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum  
lease payments, gross of the recognised finance lease liability.  
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 
Other finance leased assets are capitalised at the lower of the  
fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and the useful life of the asset.  
Rental expenses under operating leases are charged to the  
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment consist of fixtures, fittings and other office 
equipment. Plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset plus any 
attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working condition  
for its intended use. Depreciation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated  
useful life to a maximum of five years. 
Investment in Group companies  
Investment in Group companies, which eliminate on consolidation, 
is stated in the Company’s separate financial statements at cost less 
impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses are determined with 
reference to the investment’s fair value less estimated selling costs. 
Fair value is derived from the subsidiary’s, and their subsidiaries, 
net assets at the balance sheet date. On disposal, the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is 
included in the income statement. 
Investment in joint ventures 
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has 
joint control, established by contractual agreement. Investments in 
joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. On initial 
recognition the investment is recognised at cost, and the carrying 
amount is subsequently increased or decreased to recognise the 
Group’s share of the profit or loss of the joint venture after the date 
of acquisition. Goodwill, if any, on acquisition is included in the 
carrying amount of the investment.  
The Group’s investment in joint ventures is presented separately  
on the balance sheet and the Group’s share of the joint venture’s 
post-tax profit or loss for the period is also presented separately  
in the income statement.  
Where there is an indication that the Group’s investment in joint 
ventures may be impaired the Group evaluates the recoverable 
amount of its investment, being the higher of the joint venture’s 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable 
amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement.  
If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds  
its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to 
make payments on behalf of the joint venture. 
   Governance Financial statements Strategic report

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
Available-for-sale investments 
Available-for-sale investments, being investments intended  
to be held for an indefinite period, are initially recognised and 
subsequently measured at fair value.  
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of  
available-for-sale investments are included in other comprehensive 
income, except to the extent that losses are determined to be 
attributable to impairment, in which case they are recognised in the 
income statement and may not be reversed in subsequent periods. 
Disposals are recorded upon distribution, at which time 
accumulated fair value adjustments are recycled from reserves  
to the income statement. 
Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses non-trading derivative financial instruments  
to manage exposure to interest rate risk. They are initially 
recognised on the trade date at fair value and subsequently 
remeasured at fair value based on market price. The method  
of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 
nature of the item being hedged.  
Instruments that have not been designated as qualifying for  
hedge accounting are classified as held for trading. Changes in  
fair value of these instruments are recognised directly in the  
income statement.  
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a highly 
probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). For hedging 
instruments, the Group documents at the inception of the 
transaction the relationship between hedging instruments  
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives  
and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions. The Group  
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on  
an on-going basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes  
in cash flows of hedged items. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives  
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised  
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit 
or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.  
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge  
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised 
in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in 
equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.  
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Directors 
exercise judgement as to the collectability of the Group’s trade  
and other receivables and determine when it is appropriate to 
impair these assets. 
Impairment of financial assets 
An annual review is conducted for financial assets to determine 
whether there is any evidence of a loss event as described by  
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
Factors such as days past due, credit status of the counterparty, 
historical evidence of collection and probability of deriving future 
economic benefit are considered to assess whether there is  
objective evidence of impairment. The amount of any potential loss 
is calculated by estimating future cash flows or by using fair value 
where this is available through observable market prices. If, in a 
subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the original impairment was recognised, the impairment 
reversal is recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent 
with the original charge. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks  
and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables are obligations for goods or services acquired in  
the ordinary course of business. Trade and other payables are 
recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost until settled. 
Deposits 
Property deposits and on account receipts are held within trade  
and other payables. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to shareholders are recognised as a liability 
once approved by shareholders. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current obligation 
arising from a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are ordinarily recognised initially at their net proceeds 
as an approximation of fair value. 
If the transaction price is not an approximation of fair value at 
initial recognition, the Group determines the fair value as 
evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical 
instrument or based on a valuation technique that uses data from 
observable markets. Where equity holders of the Group are party to 
the transaction the difference between the net proceeds and fair 
value is recognised within equity. 
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any 
transaction costs, premiums or discounts are capitalised and 
recognised over the contractual life of the loan using the effective 
interest rate method; or on a straight line basis where it is 
impractical to do so. 
In the event of early repayment, transaction costs, premiums or 
discounts paid or unamortised costs are recognised immediately  
in the income statement.  
Pensions 
The costs of the defined contribution scheme and the Group’s 
personal pension plans are charged against profits in the year in 
which they fall due.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments  
and changes in actuarial assumptions of the defined benefit  
scheme are recognised immediately as a charge in other 
comprehensive income for the period in which they arise with a 
corresponding increase in the pension surplus or deficit. These  
re-measurements are not reclassified to the income statement in 
subsequent periods. Past service costs, current service costs, 
curtailment or settlement gains or losses and net interest income  
or expense are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the 
opening plan assets and scheme obligation.  
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method  
and applying assumptions which are agreed between the Group 
and its actuaries.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed where there are present or 
possible obligations arising from past events, but the economic 
impact is uncertain in timing, occurrence or amount. A description 
of the nature and, where possible, an estimate of the financial effect 
of contingent liabilities are disclosed. 
Capital commitments are disclosed when the Group has a 
contractual future obligation which has not been provided for  
at the balance sheet date, as is the case for the CLSA. Amounts are 
only provided for where such obligations are onerous. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
Where the Group’s own shares are re-purchased, the consideration 
paid is classified as treasury shares and deducted from equity. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold or re-issued, any 
consideration received is included in equity. 
 
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
Management has determined the operating segments based  
on reports reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to  
be the chief operating decision maker. The principal performance 
measures have been identified as net rental income and net  
asset value. For management and reporting purposes the Group  
is organised into four divisions: 
– Covent Garden; 
– Earls Court Properties represents the Group’s interests in the 
Earls Court area, comprising properties held in ECPL, Lillie 
Square, the Empress State Building and a number of smaller 
properties in the Earls Court area; 
– Venues comprises the exhibitions business including the 
Olympia London property assets and Maclise Road
1
; and 
– Other comprises the discontinued activity of The Great Capital 
Partnership, the Group’s residual China investments, other 
head office companies and investments. 
Management information is reported on a proportionally 
consolidated basis. Segmental reporting has been presented in  
line with management information and therefore consolidation 
adjustments are presented to reconcile segmental performance  
and position to the IFRS total.  
The Group’s operating segments derive their revenue primarily 
from rental income from lessees, with the exception of Venues 
which generates revenue principally from the exhibition business.  
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally 
which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to 
individual segments. 
1 The comparative period has been re-presented to reflect the transfer of Maclise Road 
from the Earls Court Properties segment to the Venues segment.

11 DISCONTINUED OPERATION 
On 29 April 2013, the Group exchanged contracts for the disposal of the final asset, Park Crescent West, in The Great Capital Partnership 
(“GCP”). This was effected as part of the Group’s strategy to dispose of non-core assets in support of the Group’s core estates and, as a 
result, the partnership has been presented as a discontinued operation. GCP was established as a joint venture in 2007 with Great Portland 
Estates plc (“GPE”), to own, manage and develop a number of central London properties.  
A summary of the results of GCP for the year which have been presented separately in the consolidated income statement is set out below:

includes deferred tax on an element of the share-based payment. 
The main rate of corporation tax decreased from 21 per cent to 20 per cent on 1 April 2015. Following the Chancellor’s announcement  
in the July 2015 Budget, the main rate of corporation tax will fall to 19 per cent from April 2017 and 18 per cent from April 2020.

16 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED 
At 31 December 2015, the Group was contractually committed to £162.5 million (2014: £100.9 million) of future expenditure for the 
purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Refer to note 34 ‘Capital 
Commitments’ for further information on capital commitments.  
The fair value of the Group’s investment, development and trading property at 31 December 2015 was determined by independent, 
appropriately qualified external valuers, Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court Properties (excluding the Empress State Building)  
and Venues; and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Group’s property portfolio. The valuations conform to the Royal Institution  
of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation Professional Standards. Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts. 
Each year the Managing Directors, on behalf of the Board, appoints the external valuers. The valuers are selected based upon their 
knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group. 
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Group’s portfolio. At each reporting  
date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs. Valuers submit  
and present summary reports to the Group’s Audit Committee, with the Managing Directors reporting to the Board on the outcome  
of each valuation round. 
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition. The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent  
or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs 
including any site specific costs (for example Section 106), professional fees, planning fees, developer’s profit including contingencies, 
planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar 
properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development. 
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use. When considering the highest and best use a valuer will 
consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable. Where the 
highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing  
this change in arriving at its valuation.  
A number of the Group’s properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.  
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon 
assumptions of capital values, rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the 
development. Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developer’s profit before arriving at a valuation.  
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties, the Empress State Building has been valued on the basis of its development potential as a 
residential led scheme. The property is currently used as an office space, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to 
achieve the change in use is being implemented. Within the Covent Garden segment, where appropriate, a number of properties have also 
been valued on the basis of their development potential, principally for the conversion to residential use or for improving the 
configuration of retail units.  
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets. 
The most significant of these occur when planning permission is required or when a credit facility is in place. These restrictions are 
factored into the property’s valuation by the external valuer. Refer to disclosures surrounding property risks on page 17.  
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group, are required to  
be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ (“IFRS 13”). Trading property  
is exempted from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements. The different valuation levels are defined as: 
Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets; 
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either  
directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices; and 
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data. Valuations at this level are more subjective and 
therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models. Such testing has not indicated that any 
material difference would arise due to a change in input variables. 
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between  
fair value levels is deemed to have occurred. Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from  
Level 3 to Level 2. All investment and development property held by the Group are classified as Level 3.

On 21 February 2014, the Group entered into a £665 million unsecured five year revolving credit facility to replace existing secured debt 
facilities that were due to mature in 2016 and 2017 and to improve operational and financial flexibility. The Group incurred charges of 
£12.9 million as a result of the refinancing. Transaction costs of £8.1 million were capitalised and will be amortised over the contractual  
life of the facility. £375 million of the facility was drawn at year-end (2014: £190 million). 
On 16 December 2014, the Group issued a US Private Placement of £150 million 10 and 12 year senior unsecured notes. The Group incurred 
and capitalised charges of £0.6 million as a result of the placement. 
The market value of investment and development property secured as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 2015 was  
£286.0 million (2014: £278.0 million).  
Cash and undrawn committed facilities attributable to the Group at 31 December 2015 were £366.9 million (2014: £579.8 million). 
The fair values of floating rate borrowings have been established using the market value, which approximates nominal value.  
The fair values of fixed rate borrowings have been calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. 
Refer to note 42 ‘Events after the Reporting Period’ for further information on the new Covent Garden £705 million revolving credit 
facility which was completed in January 2016.   Governance Financial statements Strategic report

Finance lease liabilities are in respect of leasehold interests in investment and development property. Certain leases provide for payment  
of contingent rent, usually a proportion of net rental income, in addition to the minimum lease payments above. 
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.

27 OPERATING LEASES 
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment property to tenants under operating leases. 
In the United Kingdom standard commercial leases vary considerably between markets and locations but typically are for a term of five  
to 15 years at market rent with provisions to review every five years.

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s financial risk management strategy seeks to set financial limits for treasury activity to ensure they are in line with the risk 
appetite of the Group. The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Group’s operations: market risk (principally interest rate 
risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The following tables set out each class of financial assets, financial liabilities, and their fair values at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.

The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board  
of Directors. The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are  
summarised below. 
Market risk 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of  
a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial 
instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk,  
whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest  
rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives. Interest rate swaps 
have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the 
maximum interest rate payable at the collar’s ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.  
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn external borrowings profile of the Group and joint 
ventures. The table is disclosed on a proportionally consolidated basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.

Interest rate protection  91%  94%
1 Excludes current loan notes of £6.0 million to which the Group has no interest rate exposure under the terms of the borrowing. 
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is greater than 25 per cent. 
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective at 31 December 2015 was 2.2 per cent (2014: 2.2 per cent). 
Cash flow hedge: 
In 2014, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows  
arising on £50 million of outstanding debt from 2014 to 2024. The gain recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was  
£nil (2014: £0.3 million). This gain will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the 
term of the designated debt. The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2015 was £nil (2014: £nil). The hedge was 
100 per cent effective; therefore no charge for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement during the year.

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
The sensitivity analysis below illustrates the impact of a 50 basis point (“bp”) shift, upwards and downwards, in the level of interest rates 
on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments.

The sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that 
may actually occur and represents management’s assessment of possible changes in interest rates. The fixed rate derivative financial 
instruments are matched by floating rate debt, therefore such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.  
The Group’s policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing 
risk. The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost. 
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Group’s operational requirements and investment commitments.  
The Group’s policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed and undrawn facilities. 
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entity’s ability to meet the relevant facility’s 
financial covenants. The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.  
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through  
the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the 
contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk. This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time  
of the desired refinancing. This was the strategy employed in the refinancing of existing borrowings in 2014.  
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to 
make payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are  
those implied by the par yield curve.

Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, amounts receivable from joint ventures, loan notes and cash and  
cash equivalents. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk 
arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Group’s undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such  
as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties. The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account the value of any deposits or guarantees obtained.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 127 
 
28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
Trade and other receivables:  
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor 
and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default. Trade receivables are less than 1 per 
cent of total assets at 31 December 2015 (2014: Less than 1 per cent) and no one tenant accounts for more than 10 per cent of rental income. 
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial 
information. As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2015 was  
£7.3 million (2014: £5.9 million). 
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically  
on each contract. 
In relation to the Group’s exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are provided for in full. Additionally, specific provisions  
are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns. The amounts of trade 
receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.  
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: 
 
Group  
2015  
£m 
Group 
2014 
£m
Up to 90 days 6.6 7.9
Over 90 days –  0.2
Trade receivables 6.6 8.1
In 2015 there was an impairment write down on trade receivables of £0.1 million (2014: write back of £0.4 million).  
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk. However, this is mitigated by the 
extensive range of tenants from varying business sectors and the credit review process as noted above. 
Amounts receivable from joint ventures: 
Included within receivables is £10.0 million (2014: £19.1 million) of amounts advanced to LSJV. The carrying value of the investment in 
LSJV is £nil (2014: £nil) as the Group’s share of losses exceeds the cost of its investment. Total funding advanced to LSJV of £41.5 million 
(2014: £38.3 million) has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable to the joint venture, £31.5 million (2014: £19.2 million).  
LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and market value. However based on a market valuation 
undertaken by the Group’s valuers Jones Lang LaSalle, there is an unrecognised surplus of £91.6 million (Group share) as at 31 December 2015. 
This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when building work is physically complete. Therefore, while Lillie Square 
demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed to be at risk of default, for reporting purposes the 
Group is required to impair amounts advanced to LSJV until the unrecognised surplus on trading property is realised through sale. 
Loan notes: 
At 31 December 2015, included within receivables were £nil (2014: £6.2 million) of loan notes that related to the disposal of a subsidiary in 2008. 
The loan notes were settled on 19 June 2015 for £6.3 million. After selling costs a loss of £0.2 million was incurred as a result of the transaction.  
Cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments:  
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury. Relationships  
are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating  
to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties (between A- and A+). Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to 
authorised limits for all counterparties.

Capital structure 
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and  
by managing the capital structure. The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and other financial instruments and aims to access both debt  
and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.   Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 128 
Notes to the accounts continued 
 
28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio. The Group aims 
not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent. These ratios are 
disclosed on a proportionally consolidated basis excluding the non-controlling interest share of net debt and property in line with the 
reporting of this information internally to management. These metrics are discussed in the Financial Review on pages 40 to 45.

Fair value estimation  
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13. 
The different valuation levels are defined in note 16 ‘Property Portfolio’. 
The tables below present the Group’s financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014. The 
fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield curves at  
31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values.

29 DEFERRED TAX  
The decrease in corporation tax rate referred to in note 12 ‘Taxation’ has been substantively enacted for the purposes of IAS 12  
‘Income Taxes’ (“IAS 12”) and therefore has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing  
of the realisation of deferred tax.  
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the 
properties’ original tax base cost. Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Group’s holding structure.  
The Group’s recognised deferred tax liability on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is £15.6 million at  
31 December 2015 (2014: £11.8 million). The Group’s contingent tax liability on investment properties, calculated on the same tax base cost 
as above but based on a deemed market value disposal at year-end, is £17.6 million (2014: £nil). The variance between the two methods of 
calculation arise from the differing tax rates applicable at the time of each deemed disposal. 
A disposal of the Group’s trading properties including Lillie Square at their market value as per note 16 ‘Property Portfolio’ would result  
in a corporation tax charge to the Group of £20.2 million (20.25 per cent of £99.9 million).

In May 2014 the Company completed a placing of 75,900,000 new ordinary shares of 25 pence each (aggregate nominal value  
£18.9 million) at a price of 340 pence per share to UK and South African institutions. The placing generated gross proceeds of £258.1 
million, £251.7 million net of expenses. The terms of the placing were fixed on 14 May 2014. The market price of the Company’s shares  
on 14 May 2014 was 344.2 pence per share. Aggregate market price of placing shares on 14 May 2014 was £261.2 million.  
Full details of the rights and obligations attached to the ordinary shares are contained in the Company’s Articles of Association.  
These rights include an entitlement to receive the Company’s Annual Report & Accounts, to attend and speak at General Meetings of  
the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may also receive dividends and may receive  
a share of the Company’s residual assets on liquidation. There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares.  
At 24 February 2016, the Company had an unexpired authority to repurchase shares up to a maximum of 84,081,014 shares with  
a nominal value of £21.0 million, and the Directors had an unexpired authority to allot up to a maximum of 558,828,671 shares with  
a nominal value of £140.0 million of which 279,989,778 with a nominal value of £70.0 million can only be allotted pursuant to a fully  
pre-emptive rights issue.

Earls Court Properties Limited, a subsidiary of TfL, which is the non-controlling interest of the Group. As the transaction price of the loan 
notes was not an approximation of their fair value, the Group determined the fair value by using data from observable inputs. As a result, 
the initial fair value of the loan notes was valued at less than £0.1 million and therefore £398.3 million has been classified as equity.

34 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS 
At 31 December 2015, the Group was contractually committed to £162.5 million (2014: £100.9 million) of future expenditure for the 
purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Of the £162.5 million 
committed, £91.1 million is committed 2016 expenditure.  
In November 2013, the Group exercised its option under the CLSA which it entered into with LBHF in January 2013 in relation to  
LBHF’s land interest within the Earls Court Masterplan. Under the terms of the CLSA, the Group can draw down land in phases but  
no land can be transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession  
is given. The Group has already paid £45 million of the £105 million cash consideration payable under the CLSA. The residual £60 million 
will be settled in four annual instalments of £15 million with the next payment due on 31 December 2016. 
The Group’s share of joint venture capital commitments arising on LSJV amounts to £48.6 million (2014: £70.5 million).  
35 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims, guarantees and warranties arising from the ordinary course of business. 
Contingent liabilities that may result in material liabilities are described below.  
Under the terms of the CLSA the Group has certain compensation obligations relating to achieving vacant possession, which are subject  
to an overall cap of £55 million. Should any payments be made in respect of these obligations, they will be deducted from the total 
consideration payable to LBHF (refer to note 34 ‘Capital Commitments’). 
In March 2013, an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West  
London Line where it runs within the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area (“ECOA”). Within the terms of the agreement, 
the Group can exercise options during the next 50 years for further 999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow  
for development within the Earls Court Masterplan. Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value 
which will be payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan.  
Within the terms of the agreement of the acquisition of the Northern Access Road land, the vendor’s successor in title is entitled to  
further payments until 2027 if certain conditions are met. Further payments become due following the grant of a planning permission  
for change of use or on disposal. In the event such planning permission is implemented, the payment is calculated at 50 per cent of the 
uplift in land value following the grant of the permission. In the event of a disposal, the payment is calculated as 50 per cent of the 
difference between the sale value against the land value without the relevant permission.

39 DIRECTORS’ EMOLUMENTS 
The details of individual Directors’ remuneration and pension benefits as set out in the tables contained in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 68 to 87 form part of these consolidated financial statements.  
40 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives. All schemes are equity  
settled with the increase in equity measured by reference to the fair value of the Group’s equity instruments at the grant date of the share 
awards. The corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number 
of shares that are expected to vest. The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of share-based  
payments for 2015 was £4.6 million (2014: £4.8 million). 
Reconciliations of movements in share incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 134 to 136  
1. Performance share plan 
Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the  
Group Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
Exercise at the vesting date is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration  
Committee (“the Committee”) at the time of grant.  
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: 
– the Group’s Total Return (“TR”) over three consecutive financial years (“the TR Performance Period”) relative to the median  
of the TRs over the equivalent period of the Group, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc,  
Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc (“the Comparator Group”); and  
– the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) over a period of three years (“the TSR Performance Period”) relative to the median  
of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group. 
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.  
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the  
TR performance period. In calculating TR for a company which is not a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”), any provision for 
contingent capital gains tax will be added back.  
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period  
re-invested in ordinary shares.  
Full details of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 71, 80 and 81. 
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection  
of underlying financial performance and may exercise discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest. 
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has  
ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.  
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group (whether to replace a removed member or otherwise) if it  
believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group. 
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. In general, options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
In 2011 a schedule to the PSP was approved by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) as a Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”) 
scheme; therefore the Company may make a proportion of awards as approved options. 
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2015 were exercisable between nil pence and 402.9 pence and have a weighted average  
remaining contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2016 and 2025.

Deferred share awards made under the performance share plan vest on the third anniversary of the date of award, subject to continued 
employment and satisfaction of performance conditions. 
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the PSP was  
£2.7 million (2014: £2.7 million). 
2. Matching share plan 
Under the Group Matching Share Plan (“MSP”), deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus. These awards may also be made  
as nil cost options.  
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that 
participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award. Awards of nil cost 
options were made in both the current and comparative periods. The fair value of share awards is determined by the market price  
of the shares at the grant date.  
(a) Deferred share awards – nil cost options

Outstanding at 31 December  1,276,890 1,557,936
Exercisable at 31 December  452,280 525,256
Under the MSP, awards, which may be awarded as nil cost options, may also be made in respect of certain shares purchased by Directors  
or in respect of awards of the deferred shares or nil cost options described above made under the Company’s annual bonus scheme.  
The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred. In exceptional circumstances the matching 
awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred. 
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions. Vesting  
of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally 
determined. The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. Full details  
of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 71, 80 and 81. 
Matching nil cost options and share awards generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased  
or deferred shares. 
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the MSP was  
£1.9 million (2014: £2.1 million).

3. Fair value of share-based payment 
As stated above, one half of each award granted is subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance 
condition. The fair value of share awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the half that is subject to the  
TR performance condition and using the stochastic pricing model for the half that is subject to the TSR performance condition. Inputs  
to the models for share awards during the year are as follows:

41 PENSIONS 
1. Current pension arrangements 
The Venues business has a hybrid pension scheme comprising a money purchase section that was closed on 28 February 2014 and a final 
salary section which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011. The final salary section is a 
funded defined benefit scheme (“the Scheme”) which is contracted out of State Second Pension. On closure of the money purchase section 
of the Venues’ pension scheme, a defined contribution group personal pension plan was offered to eligible Venues employees.  
The Group’s current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements. 
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks: 
– Investment risk – the Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these 
assets are expected to provide positive real returns over the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be 
required if deficit emerges. 
– Interest rate risk – the Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.  
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way. 
– Inflation risk – a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. Although the Scheme’s assets are 
expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long-term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging. 
– Mortality risk – in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.

corporate debt as appropriate to the Scheme’s holdings of these instruments. The assets do not include any investment in shares of  
the Group.

Increases to deferred pensions before payment 2.2 2.2
Post retirement mortality assumption (S1 PXA CMI) 1.5 1.5
The discount rate is determined on the yield available on a high quality long dated corporate bond of appropriate term and currency.  
As a result, a discount rate of 3.7 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2015 (2014: 3.4 per cent). This is higher than the rate used  
in the prior year given the changes to the yields on bonds over the current year. 
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from 
time to time to reflect current trends. The standard table used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods is S1 PXA,  
CMI (150%), and Year of Birth. The table below makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of  
each member. 
2015  2014
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:

42 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD 
On 8 January 2016, the £665 million Covent Garden revolving credit facility was replaced by a new £705 million revolving credit facility. 
This new facility is repayable in December 2020 which on a pro-forma basis has extended the weighted average debt maturity to 5.3 years, 
has reduced the weighted average cost of debt to 2.8 per cent and has increased available facilities by £40 million. The Group has incurred a 
charge of approximately £2.7 million relating to fees on the new facility and has written off £5.2 million relating to unamortised fees on 
the existing facility.

The Directors of Capital & Counties Properties PLC have proposed  
a final dividend per ordinary share (ISIN GB00B62G9D36) of  
1.0 pence payable on 21 June 2016.  
Dates 
The following are the salient dates for payment of the proposed 
final dividend: 
Annual General Meeting 6 May 2016
Sterling/Rand exchange rate struck 12 May 2016
Sterling/Rand exchange rate and dividend amount  
in Rand announced 13 May 2016
Ordinary shares listed ex-dividend on the JSE, 
Johannesburg 23 May 2016
Ordinary shares listed ex-dividend on the London 
Stock Exchange 26 May 2016
Record date for final dividend in UK and South Africa 27 May 2016
Dividend payment date for shareholders 21 June 2016
South African shareholders should note that, in accordance with 
the requirements of Strate, the last day to trade cum-dividend  
will be 20 May 2016 and that no dematerialisation of shares will  
be possible from 23 May 2016 to 27 May 2016 inclusive. No transfers 
between the UK and South Africa registers may take place from  
12 May 2016 to 27 May 2016. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer an optional 
scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2015 final dividend.  
The above dates are proposed and subject to change. 
Important Information for South African Shareholders: 
The final cash dividend declared by the Company will constitute  
a dividend for Dividends Tax purposes. Dividends Tax will 
therefore be withheld from the amount of the final cash dividend 
which is paid at a rate of 15 per cent, unless a shareholder qualifies 
for an exemption and the prescribed requirements for effecting  
the exemption, as set out in the rules of the Scrip Dividend Scheme,  
are in place. 
It is the Company’s understanding that the issue and receipt of 
shares pursuant to the scrip dividend alternative will not have any 
Dividends Tax nor income tax implications. The new shares which 
are acquired under the scrip dividend alternative will be treated  
as having been acquired for nil consideration. 
This information is included only as a general guide to taxation  
for shareholders resident in South Africa based on Capco’s 
understanding of the law and the practice currently in force.  
Any shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position  
should seek independent professional advice. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 148

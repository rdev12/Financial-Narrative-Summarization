Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Chairman’s  
statement
Peter Erskine considers 
business performance, 
the r ole of corpor ate 
governance and how 
Boar d changes position 
Ladbrokes for 2013.
In addition to growth in the UK our 
retail businesses in Ireland, Belgium 
and Spain posted a combined  
51% increase in operating profit
(1)
.  
This reinforces the sustainability of 
these often unsung parts of our 
business and there is good future 
potential too with the possibility of 
increased opening hours in Ireland,  
the addition of machines to our shops 
in Belgium and ongoing expansion  
into new regions for our Spanish joint 
venture, Sportium. 
Moving to our Digital business, whilst 
experiencing a frustrating delay to the 
launch of our new sportsbook website 
in the summer , we end 2012 having 
taken significant steps forward.  
Our investment in new trading 
technology is starting to pay back 
through significant progress in our 
trading and liability management, 
which has contributed to an underlying 
increase in our sportsbook margin  
and improvement in the quality of  
our earnings. We expect to sustain  
this improvement going forward. 
We have also continued to expand our 
product range with more Bet in Play 
events and markets, new slots and 
more gaming opportunities. We have  
a clear road map of further product 
improvements going forward and are 
increasingly focusing on improved 
customer relationship management.
It is also pleasing to begin 2013  
with a genuine opportunity to further 
differentiate our customer offer from 
that of our competitors, with the 
acquisition of the Betdaq exchange 
business allowing us to offer the  
full spectrum of sports betting 
opportunities to customers.
Ladbrokes remains highly cash 
generative and we are pleased to see  
a further reduction in debt this year  
as well as an increased dividend. 
Board Changes
Christopher Rodrigues has decided  
to retire at the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting having served nine years as  
an independent non-executive director .  
We thank Christopher for his 
considerable contribution over the 
years and wish him well for the future. 
During 2012 we further strengthened 
the skills and diversity of the Board,  
with the appointment of two new 
non-executive directors, Richard Moross 
and Christine Hodgson. Richard’s 
experience in online businesses and 
Christine’s knowledge in the technology 
Dear Shareholder 
2012 has seen Ladbrokes continue  
on its upward path with record 
revenues in our UK Retail business, 
continued improvement in our Digital 
offering, some advances internationally 
and the continued strengthening of  
our balance sheet. 
Over the years many have questioned 
the sustainability of high street betting, 
so to secure a record year in terms of 
revenues is a real highlight. This is the 
third consecutive year of growth in 
profit per shop and we owe a particular 
note of thanks to our shop colleagues 
for their dedication and hard work.  
With our new operational structure, an 
increased focus on local competition 
and continued improvements in our 
machine offering, we are confident of 
further progress and we will continue 
to invest in new shops in 2013. 
field have added to the expertise of the 
Board and we value their input to our 
deliberations and decision making. 
Corporate Governance
The Board strives to provide the  
right leadership, strategic oversight 
and control environment to sustain 
delivery of value to our shareholders 
over the long term. The Board receives 
a detailed operational update on  
key strategic priorities at every  
meeting and holds the executive  
team accountable for the execution  
of these. 
We remain committed to high 
standards which is fundamental to 
ensuring the confidence and support  
of our shareholders, with whom  
I maintain an ongoing and open 
dialogue, meeting with many of  
them over the course of the year . 
Full details on how the Board and its 
committees apply the principles of 
good corporate governance can be 
found in the Corporate governance 
report on pages 30 to 36.
Dividend
The Group recommends paying a final 
dividend of 4.6 pence per share taking 
the full year dividend to 8.9 pence per 
share, an increase of 14.1%. This is in 
line with our policy of a target dividend 
cover of approximately 2.0 times 
underlying earnings.
The dividend will be payable on  
9 May 2013 to shareholders on  
the register on 22 March 2013.
Summary
Ladbrokes is showing clear  
and pleasing signs of improved 
performance as we deliver  
against our strategy and goals. 
With the reinvigoration of our Digital 
business gathering pace we look 
forward to making further advances  
in 2013.

new shops paying back on average  
in around 2.5 years, we are confident  
in further opportunities to grow the 
estate. Next year we plan to open 100 
new shops on a net basis, targeting 
areas that are currently under supplied. 
Enhancing trading capability
Increased OTC profitability in 2012 was 
driven largely by a strengthening of  
our horseracing and football margins. 
Sporting results are a key factor in 
determining the performance of any 
betting business and there is no doubt 
that results in 2012, particularly across 
football during the second half of the 
year , have been favourable when 
compared with 2011. 
Results however are only part of  
the equation. More significant is 
whether the business is well placed to  
maximise returns and minimise losses 
consistently. In that respect, we have 
taken great strides this year to leverage 
the investment in our new trading 
platform. Better technology, increased 
automation and the continual evolution 
of monitoring tools and algorithms are 
enabling our trading teams to develop 
more control; decreasing volatility, 
whilst still ensuring a competitive 
product. In short we are improving  
the quality of our earnings.
This has benefited all parts of the 
business, with tangible improvements 
in our Digital and Retail gross win 
margins. We expect to be able to 
develop this further in the year ahead 
with more innovation continuing 
throughout 2013.
Developing customer value
Over the past two years we have 
invested in technology to enable us to 
deliver the best products and customer 
experiences to our Digital customers. 
We have redefined our core IT 
architecture, increased the flexibility  
of core supplier relationships, 
significantly expanded the range of 
products offered to customers and 
developed a new proprietary trading 
platform. By the end of March 2013  
Richard Glynn
Chief Executive Officer
2012 has been an important year for 
Ladbrokes. We have increased revenues 
in every major division of the business,  
grown underlying earnings, further 
strengthened our balance sheet by 
reducing net debt and also increased  
our dividend to shareholders by 14.1%. 
However , 2012 has been important not 
only because of a strong financial 
performance, but because of the 
significant progress we have continued 
to make in developing the business.
Growing on the UK high street
The performance of UK Retail in 2012 
further demonstrates the continuing 
appeal of betting on the high street. 
2012 was a record year for shop 
revenues and it is pleasing to see 
growth driven by Over the Counter 
(OTC) and machines. Operating profit 
growth in UK Retail has been strong 
with profit per shop ahead for the third 
year in succession assisted by our 
strong control of costs.
During the year we strengthened our 
position as the clear market leader in 
machines. Only two years ago, our 
performance placed us third or fourth 
in the market. Since that time through 
a determination to create the best 
possible offer for our customers we 
have added a further £84 million of 
machines net revenue.
Our competitors are not standing still 
and the machines market is constantly 
developing; we will be working hard to 
develop our offer further in order to 
maintain our market leading position. 
In 2013 we will start the rollout of a 
new, advanced machine cabinet which 
offers customers more interactive 
features through improved technology. 
We will also continue to offer the 
broadest and most exciting range of 
content, introducing new and exclusive 
games throughout the year .
Revenue growth in our OTC business 
during 2012 was in spite of a significant 
reduction in UK horseracing meetings, 
with the calendar affected by the 
British weather throughout the year . 
We are encouraged that the number  
of customers coming into Ladbrokes 
shops to place a bet has remained 
broadly flat during the year , showing 
that the popularity of retail bookmaking 
endures, alongside growth in online 
and mobile. 
We face several specific headwinds 
within UK Retail in 2013. The introduction 
of Machine Games Duty and ongoing 
operational cost pressures, particularly 
regarding horseracing picture rights 
are significant and we will address 
them as part of a clear and focused 
growth agenda. This includes an 
improved sports experience with more 
broadcast events, an increased retail 
Bet in Play offer via more self service 
betting, new video walls and the trial of 
new shop formats designed to create a 
more interactive environment for staff 
and customers. With our investment in  Regulation

Business review
we will have launched a new Digital 
sportsbook, with a new mobile 
platform to follow in Q2.
The focus for the business can now 
turn to growing net revenue per 
customer . The ongoing development of 
our new Active Data Warehouse, which 
is beginning to enable more effective 
insight into customer behaviour is  
the foundation for this. In parallel, we 
have begun to improve our Customer 
Relationship Management capabilities, 
refining the way in which customers 
are segmented, developed and 
rewarded as well as working closer 
with key suppliers and product experts. 
This has started to show some positive
outcomes and we will continue to 
explore opportunities which will help 
us accelerate this process going 
forward. We expect this to lead to 
improving metrics as the year 
progresses, with growth in net revenue 
and Digital profits, particularly during 
the second half of 2013.
Aiming to lead in mobile
Mobile is the key driver of growth in  
the digital market. Mobile devices are 
portable, convenient and increasingly 
popular . They are driving a trend 
towards more spontaneous 
consumption of betting and gaming 
opportunities. Over 33% of our Digital 
customers bet via a mobile device, 
with the number of mobile customers 
growing up to five times quicker than 
those using traditional digital means.
During the year we have continued to 
develop the Ladbrokes Sports Betting 
app, improving functionality and 
usability as well as adding more 
innovative features. We have also 
delivered more gaming product, 
particularly on tablet with a new live 
dealer casino and several exclusive 
slots games.
Our new mobile platform will be live 
during the first half of 2013. It has  
been developed in parallel with new 
Application Programming Interface

Our business model
Ladbrokes is in the business of providing excitement to customers. We deliver the excitement of sports betting and 
gaming in retail, online, via tablet, mobile and on the telephone. We are building on our brand leadership and heritage in 
the UK, Ireland and Belgium by expanding into new markets like Spain, and by establishing a presence in markets with 
significant future potential like China and the USA. In developing our product offer in each market we are governed not 
only by regulatory frameworks, but by a commitment to corporate and social responsibility. Our approach is to put the 
customer at the heart of what we do, develop best of breed products utilising a newly invested flexible technology 
platform to deliver unique customer experiences.  Business review 14

adopt a flexible approach to launching 
apps, allowing the simultaneous 
development of a variety of products all 
targeted to meet the needs of different 
groups of customers. The ability to 
release new products quickly will be a 
real advantage in a market which is 
evolving rapidly. We expect to launch 
multiple new apps during 2013. 
Growing our international 
business
Our retail businesses in Ireland, 
Belgium and Spain contributed more 
than £20 million operating profit  
during 2012, an increase of over 50%.  
Despite tough economic conditions in 
Ireland our business there has been 
resilient. We expect legislation allowing 
extended shop opening hours in the 
Republic of Ireland to be introduced 
during the second half of 2013.  
In Belgium we expect further growth  
to be driven by the anticipated 
introduction of machines to shops.  
In Spain, our joint venture business, 
Sportium is now generating positive 
cash flow in Madrid and Aragon, 
regions where the business remains 
the clear market leader . During 2013 
we will roll out new Self Service Betting
T erminals, increase our presence  
in Valencia and expect to confirm 
opportunities for expansion into further 
regions. We also continue to develop 
our nascent businesses in the USA  
and China, both of which offer great 
potential for future growth.
Investing in our people
We are investing in making Ladbrokes 
a great place to work for our 15,000 
people. Employee engagement is 
critical to this, and we have rolled out 
several development programmes 
during 2012, aimed at giving people  
the motivation to go above and beyond 
to help Ladbrokes succeed.
Our Vision & Values programme is  
a long term initiative designed to give 
absolute clarity on how all of our 
people can make faster , better 
decisions using a common framework. 
It has been rolled out during the year 
through a series of roadshows, 
publications, videos and team 
development sessions, specifically  
with the aim of raising awareness  
and understanding of the company’s

Outlook
We have continued to make good 
progress throughout the Group during 
2012. The investments we have made 
over the past two years to reinvigorate 
the business are starting to drive 
performance. In 2013 we will invest 
further in our retail businesses and 
expect to see underlying benefits from 
our development of trading. With the 
launch of our new website and mobile 
services on track, our focus in Digital is 
on enhancing our customer relationship 
management capabilities. We expect  
all of these to drive increasing 
customer appeal and continued 
improvements in our operational

and core values required to take us 
there faster . 
We have also this year launched a  
new talent development programme  
to identify, nurture and stretch our  
high-potential employees, which is 
essential for succession planning.  
By fostering an internal culture of 
excellence, we believe we will deliver 
an even better experience for our 
customers and in turn become a  
more successful business.
UK regulatory update
We are currently facing an active and 
often misleading media and lobbying 
campaign in the UK targeted at both 
shops and in particular gaming 
machines. We continue to work both  
as a company and alongside industry 
organisations like the ABB to tackle the 
myths propagated by this well funded 
campaign. We aim to ensure that 
Government, MPs and Local 
Councillors are fully aware of the  
facts regarding betting shops. 
Ladbrokes is a responsible business 
and we continually develop our 
approach to tackling issues like 
problem gambling. T o further restrict 
regulated and licensed high street 
betting shops whether in terms of  
shop numbers or availability of product 
would merely drive people to online  
or mobile services which are freely 
available, or would give rise to an illegal 
gaming machine market. It would also 
have a significant economic impact on 
high street employment. We will  
play a full part in the forthcoming 
Triennial Review of stakes and prizes 
consultation and we are reassured that 
the Government’s current position is to 
maintain the status quo. 
Other regulatory matters in the UK 
include the introduction of Machine 
Games Duty and the draft bill to 
regulate offshore gambling operators. 
We continue to engage with Treasury 
on the latest data supporting our case 
that Machine Games Duty is in fact a 
tax increase on the industry and we 
await the Culture, Media and Sport 
Select Committee’s pre-legislative 
scrutiny of the bill to regulate remote 
gambling operators, where our key 
concerns are both the rate of tax and

The growth of £2 (B3) slot 
style games has been a key 
part of driving machines 
revenue. We are focusing  
on driving exclusive games 
which are a real point of 
difference for customers.
GROWTH
EXCLUSIVE GAMES
DRIVING
The UK Retail business achieved a 
record level of net revenue in 2012, 
even after excluding £5.8 million from 
Euro 2012 and despite a significant 
increase in the number of cancelled 
horserace meetings. T otal net revenue 
of £739.5 million for 2012 was up  
8.2% for the year .
The OTC business continues to 
demonstrate strong customer appeal 
with net revenue growing in every 
quarter , ending the year up 3.8%. 
Although we saw a decline in OTC 
amounts staked, this was not 
unexpected given the particularly high 
level of horseracing meetings lost to 
bad weather (132 in 2012 versus only 
23 in 2011). Amounts staked for 2012 
were down 2.7% on an absolute basis 
(down 1.7% adjusted for lost 
horseracing and Euro 2012). 
Gross win margin of 16.7% (2011: 
15.6%) was up by 110 basis points,  
with an increase in the key products of 
horseracing and football, which whilst 
partly results driven, also reflects 
strongly the improvements which we 
have made in our pricing, trading and 
liability management capabilities, 
particularly during H2. We expect these 
improvements, together with ongoing 
enhancements during 2013, to benefit 
us further going forward.
Machines net revenue of £339.9 million 
was up by 13.9%, with strong growth 
across all games categories. Despite 
annualising the roll out of our Global 
Draw terminals during H1, net revenue 
in H2 grew by 8.5%. During the course 
of the year we increased our average 
number of machines per shop from 
3.83 to 3.88 (Q4 3.89), a move which 
generated an additional £5.3 million 
annualised of gross win. At this new 
density, gross win per machine week 
was £946 (£958 at 2011 density level). 
We expect to continue to drive 
machines growth in 2013 through the 
annualisation of higher density, the 
ongoing introduction of new and 
exclusive games, increasing use of 
yield management techniques and the 
planned roll out of the next generation 
of cabinet towards the end of 2013.
In 2012 there were on average 8,345 
machines in the estate compared to 
8,050 in 2011. At 31 December 2012 
there were 8,583 machines  
(2011: 8,128). 
Operating costs for the year increased, 
slightly less than expected, at a rate 
of 5.6% or 3.3% on a like for like 
basis (includes costs of machine 
revenue share). In 2013 we expect 
a higher increase in like for like costs 
driven largely by the growing cost 
of picture rights.
Operating profit of £180.7 million was 
up 18.6% or £28.4 million for the year .
At 31 December 2012 there were 2,196 
shops (2011: 2,127) in Great Britain. 
During the year we opened 76 new 
shops, acquired a further 12 and closed 
19. In 2013 we expect to open circa 100 
shops net of closures.
Gr owth in UK R etail  
has been driven by  
an incr ease in r evenue  
in both over the  
counter and machines. 
T ogether with our 
continuing r obust

has enabled us to gr ow

nearly 19% in 2012.

The Irish retail business has again 
performed well despite difficult 
economic conditions, tough austerity 
measures and the significant impact  
on OTC of lost horseracing meetings. 
Although OTC amounts staked declined 
by 10.5%, gross win was marginally  
up by 0.8% following an increase in 
gross win margin, which was 14.2%  
for the year (2011: 12.7%). Whilst partly 
driven by an improvement in results, 
particularly across the Cheltenham  
and Aintree festivals, the increase  
also reflects a broader product  
offering across the estate and the 
enhancements made in trading 
technology and processes.
T otal gross win increased by 1.1% to 
£82.3 million with machines up 5.3%.
Within the context of the continuing 
economic downturn and highly 
competitive trading environment, 
particularly in the Republic of Ireland, 
we have continued to focus our efforts 
on reducing our operational cost base. 
Costs of £58.4 million were down 6.0% 
on 2011 and down 1.3% on a constant 
currency basis.
At 31 December 2012 there were  
213 shops (31 December 2011: 213)  
in the Republic of Ireland and 79  
shops (31 December 2011: 79)  
in Northern Ireland. 
Looking forward we expect tough 
trading conditions to prevail, though we 
do expect legislation allowing extended 
trading hours to be introduced in the 
Republic of Ireland.

Amounts staked in Belgium grew  
by 3.5% reflecting the first full year

tax in the first quarter of 2011 and a 
particularly strong football performance 
with amounts staked up in excess  
of 50% in local currency following  
a strong Euro 2012 performance.  
Net revenue for the year increased  
by 2.9% (local currency up 10.1%).
Operating costs were flat and up  
7.0% in local currency, largely due  
to increased commissions based 
payments to independent shop 
managers driven by the increase  
in gross win.
Operating profit for the year at  
£8.4 million was up by 27.3%  
(local currency up 35.5%).
As at 31 December 2012 there  
were 277 shops versus 282 at

Looking forward to 2013 we anticipate 
the introduction of new legislation, 
allowing us to introduce a machine

new points of sale in newsagents

In the mature Madrid region we

year of trading in Aragon has also  
been pleasing with like for like amounts

generating positive cash flow in Madrid 
and Aragon, regions where the 
business remains the clear market 
leader . The business incurred start up 
costs in the Valencia and Navarra 
regions during 2012.
During the year the business 
commenced the roll out of standalone 
Self Service Betting T erminals (SSBT) 
in the Valencia region and this channel

Our new Digital sportsbook

enable more dynamic 
presentation of our 
expanding offer , giving 
customers a more 
personalised and intuitive 
betting experience.
Digital
The growth of Bet in Play (BIP) remains 
a key driver of market growth in 
sportsbook volumes with the latest  
In Play Betting survey compiled by  
the industry monitor Gambling Data 
indicating an increase of events offered 
of 23% across the industry. Our BIP 
coverage grew by over 150% in 2012, 
with circa 70,000 different events/
matches offered to our customers.  
BIP volumes grew by 37.8% and 
represented over 60% of all non  
racing sportsbook stakes in the year . 
The full launch of our new sportsbook 
website during Q1 2013 will increase 
the prominence of BIP whilst also 
enabling customers to; navigate the 
site more easily, make quicker bet 
selections and personalise content.
Casino and Games net revenue  
was up 3.1% (5.6% adjusted for exited 
territories) driven by encouraging 
growth in activity from our core 
customer base. We have continued  
to expand our customer offer with 
additional games content from 
suppliers such as IGT , Openbet, 
Cryptologic and Realistic on mobile and 
tablet. This has helped us grow Games 
net revenue by 21.1% (25.7% adjusted 
for exited territories). Casino and 
Games actives increased by 11.8% 
driven by marketing campaigns 
including free spins and free bet 
promotions. Following the most 
significant marketing campaigns in  
Q1 2012, there has been an increased 
focus on improving customer yield, 
which grew by 10.0% for Casino and 
24.1% for Games during H2.
Poker net revenue fell 23.2% during the 
year to £10.9 million. Strong competition 
amongst poker operators, with 
increasing activity on recruitment of 
players continues to characterise a 
tough marketplace. We are starting to 
see initial signs of our run rate settling 
with stable revenue from Q2 onwards.
Bingo net revenue was £0.4 million or 
2.9% down for the year at £13.6 million. 
Bingo actives were broadly flat. 
Mobile net revenue was up 93.6%. 
Mobile sportsbook revenues were 
26.5% of the total sportsbook with over 
40% of sportsbook customers using 
mobile during the second half. Mobile 
gaming net revenue grew 96.1%, with 
new tablet specific games and casino 
content including live dealer table 
games and slots. Our new mobile 
platform, on track to launch in Q2 2013 
has been developed in parallel with 
new API technology, which will enable 
us to develop and launch multiple new 
mobile apps from H1 onwards.
An increase in total operating costs  
of 30.9% was in line with our plan, 
driven by uplift in marketing investment, 
additional IT , investment in people and 
an increase in depreciation, all of which 
are part of the overall improvement in 
the infrastructure of the Digital 
business. As anticipated, we also 
incurred start up costs in our  
regulated international businesses  
of £5.7 million following a successful 
application for licences in the  
Spanish and Danish markets  
which regulated during the year . 
Excluding these territories, operating 
costs were up 26.8% to £134.9 million. 
Marketing costs for the year were 
equal to 23.7% of net revenue (also 
adjusted for newly regulated markets).
Overall operating profit of £31.8 million 
(£34.4 million pre amortisation of 
customer relationships) for the division 
was down 39.3%.
Looking ahead to 2013 we expect to 
benefit from the H1 launches of our 
new sportsbook and mobile platforms, 
whilst seeing continued margin 
improvements driven by our focus on 
enhancements to trading and liability 
management. We are now better 
positioned to develop customer yield, 
with more timely data enabling us to 
target conversion and development in 
order to grow customer value. This is 
expected to drive growth in Digital net 
revenue and earnings particularly 
during the second half of the year .

Net revenue growth of 9.0% for the  
year (10.3% excluding territories  
exited during the year) has been 
predominantly driven by the 
development of our sportsbook offer  
in tandem with investment in a new

revenue of £77.8 million grew by 26.1% 
for the year , following growth in both

(2011: 6.0%).
Whilst sporting results were 
favourable, particularly during the 
latter part of the year (H2 gross win

introduction of new trading tools

liability management has driven  
an improvement in the quality of 
sportsbook earnings, a trend we expect 
to continue during 2013. Sportsbook

The introduction of Machine Games 
Duty in February 2013 represents  
a significant tax increase on the 
industry. We continue to engage with 
HM Treasury on the latest data in order 
to illustrate that the Government’s 
stated objective of fiscal neutrality has 
not been met with regard to the sector 
as a whole and instead represents  
a circa £14 million tax increase to 
Ladbrokes alone.
The Regulation of Remote 
Gambling Operators
The Culture, Media and Sport  
Select Committee is undertaking 
pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft bill
to regulate offshore operators and 
Ladbrokes has submitted written 
evidence highlighting our concern
about the level of enforcement that will 
underpin the regulation and about the 
level of the place of consumption tax 
that will be introduced following the 
regulations. We continue to await 
detailed timings of legislation and 
enforcement mechanisms in Ireland 
where a similar place of consumption
tax has been proposed.

Review of gaming machine 
stakes and prizes 
In January 2013 the Department for 
Culture, Media and Sport released its 
recommendations on the Triennial 
Review of Stakes and Prizes. While the 
recommendation on B2 machines 
reflects the industry’s submission for 
the status quo the Government has 
called for more evidence with regard  
to B2 machines and their impact on 
problem gambling, as well as what 
impact changes in stakes and prizes 
would have on both problem gambling 
and operators. The evidence-based 
approach reflects the seriousness with 
which Government is approaching the 
issue and includes consideration of 
other harm-mitigation measures that 
may be applied. B2 machines have 
been the subject of a highly organised 
and well funded negative PR and 
lobbying campaign which is also 
seeking liberalisation in other sectors 
of the gambling industry. Ladbrokes 
will take full use of the consultation to 
set the record straight on machines 
and the social responsibility measures  
we continually develop across all  
our products. Business review 20

Revenue from continuing operations 
increased by £108.3 million (11.1%)

Excluding High Rollers, revenue 
increased by £73.0 million (7.4%) to

The increase is mainly attributable  
to improved machines and OTC

European Retail performance and 
growth in Digital sportsbook partially 
offset by a decline in Poker and Bingo 
in Digital.

Business review
Profit before net  
finance expense, tax  
and exceptional items
Profit before net finance expense,  
tax and exceptional items increased  
by £48.4 million or 25.8% to  
£236.1 million (2011: £187.7 million). 
Excluding High Rollers, profit  
before net finance expense, tax  
and exceptional items increased by 
£15.2 million or 8.0% to £206.1 million 
(2011: £190.9 million) reflecting 
increased profit in UK Retail and 
European Retail, decreased losses  
in T elephones, partially offset by 
decreased profit in Digital and higher 
Corporate costs.
Corporate costs
Before exceptional items, total 
Corporate costs increased by  
£1.9 million to £25.1 million  
(2011: £23.2 million) including  
an increase in share-based  
payments charge.
Finance expense 
Before exceptional items, net  
finance expense of £29.7 million  
was £3.1 million lower than last  
year (2011: £32.8 million) mainly  
due to a lower average net debt. 
Profit before tax 
The increase in trading profits as  
well as a lower finance expense has 
resulted in a 33.2% increase in profit 
from continuing operations before 
taxation and exceptional items to 
£206.4 million (2011: £154.9 million).
Exceptional items before tax
£5.7 million of exceptional losses 
before tax include a £3.8 million loss  
on the closure of shops and disposal  
of assets within UK and European 
Retail, £2.2 million in respect of 
Spanish retrospective online gaming 
taxes and £0.3 million net gain on 
derivative financial instruments  
not in a hedging relationship.
T axation
The Group has made further progress 
in the resolution of historical tax 
matters and has reached settlement 
with HMRC on all outstanding items  
in respect of tax years through to  
31 December 2007. As a result, tax 
provisions no longer required have 
been released leading to a Group 
taxation charge for continuing 
operations before exceptional items  
of £10.7 million, representing an 
effective tax charge of 5.2% (2011: 
11.9%). There was a tax credit of  
£0.3 million in relation to exceptional 
items in 2012 (2011: £1.6 million).
Dividend
The Board recommends a final 
dividend of 4.60 pence per share 
taking the full year dividend to 8.90 
pence per share, an increase of 
14.1% over last year . 
The dividend will be payable  
on 9 May 2013 to shareholders  
on the register on 22 March 2013.
Earnings per share (EPS)  
– Group
Underlying
EPS (before exceptional items and  
High Rollers) increased by 20.3%  
to 18.4 pence (2011: 15.3 pence), 
reflecting the increased profit before 
tax and lower effective tax rate.
T otal 
EPS (before exceptional items) 
increased 40.0% to 21.6 pence  
(2011: 15.0 pence), reflecting the 
increased profit before tax and lower 
effective tax charge. EPS (including  
the impact of exceptional items)  
was 21.0 pence (2011: 13.0 pence). 
Fully diluted EPS (including the impact 
of exceptional items) was 20.6 pence 
(2011: 12.9 pence) after adjustment  
for outstanding share options and 
other potentially issuable shares.
Cash flow , capital  
expenditure, borrowings  
and banking facilities
Cash generated by operations was 
£283.2 million. After net finance 
expense paid of £32.7 million,  
income taxes paid of £5.2 million  
and £102.3 million on capital 
expenditure and intangible additions, 
cash inflow was £143.0 million.  
Post dividend payment of £74.0 million 
and other outflows of £2.0 million,  
free cash flow of £67.0 million was 
generated in the year .
At 31 December 2012, gross 
borrowings of £406.2 million less cash 
and cash equivalents of £19.3 million 
resulted in a reduction in net debt to 
£386.9 million (2011: £453.9 million).
On 11 July 2012, the Group repaid  
the remaining balance on the 7.125% 
bond of £131.4 million using existing 
facilities. The Group has a £225 million 
7.625% sterling bond due in 2017.
Going concern
In assessing the going concern basis, 
the directors considered the Group’s 
business activities, the financial 
position of the Group and the Group’s 
financial risk management objectives 
and policies. The directors consider 
that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future and that it is 
therefore appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing its 
financial statements. Business review 22

The Board endorses the aims of the Davies’ Report  
entitled “Women on Boards” and when considering  
future appointments, with the support of the Nomination 
Committee, will aim to build on its current position.  
The Company currently has two women on the Board  
(C M Hodgson and S Bailey) and therefore 20% of the Board 
is made up of women. The Company’s current aspiration is 
to increase the percentage of women on the Board to 30% by 
2015 and to continue to ensure appropriate representation 
by women, both on the Board and throughout the business, 
whilst at all times ensuring the Company selects on merit. 
The section "Nomination Committee" on page 33 contains 
further information on Board composition.
The other significant commitments of the Chairman during 
2012 are detailed in his biography on page 28. There were  
no significant changes to those commitments during 2012.
Of the seven Board meetings held in 2012 C P Wicks was 
unable to attend one meeting before she left the Company 
due to prior commitments, S Bailey was unable to attend 
one meeting due to other business commitments and  
C J Rodrigues was unable to attend one meeting due to 
illness and was unable to attend a further meeting due  
to other business commitments. 
In addition, the Chairman met during the year with  
the non-executive directors without the executive  
directors present.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for its decision and approval. These include the 
approval of the strategic and annual profit plans, key public 
information releases (e.g. financial statements), dividends, 
major acquisitions and disposals, material contracts, 
treasury and other Group policies. The section “Internal 
control and risk management systems” on pages 34 and 35 
contains further information on how the Board operates.
The Company seeks to ensure that the Board is supplied 
with appropriate and timely information to enable it to 
discharge its duties. The Board requests additional 
information or variations to regular reporting as it requires.  
A procedure exists for directors to seek independent 
professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, if 
necessary. All directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary.
All directors receive an induction on joining the Board.  
A combination of tailored Board and committee agenda 
items and other Board activities, including briefing sessions, 
assist the directors in continually updating their skills and 
the knowledge and familiarity with the Company required to 
fulfil their role both on the Board and on Board committees. 
In addition, external seminars, workshops and presentations 
are made available to directors. The Company provides the 
necessary resources for developing and updating directors’ 
knowledge and capabilities.
The Board continues to be committed to high standards of 
corporate governance. The Board strives to provide the right 
leadership, strategic oversight and control environment to 
produce and sustain delivery of value to all of the Company’s 
shareholders. The Board applies integrity, principles of  
good corporate governance and accountability throughout  
its activities and each director brings independence of 
character and judgement to the role. All of the members  
of the Board are individually and collectively aware of their 
responsibilities to the Company’s stakeholders. 
The following describes the Board’s approach to corporate 
governance and how the UK Corporate Governance Code 
has been applied. 
Compliance statement
In 2012 the Company was subject to and complied with  
all of the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published in 2010 by the Financial Reporting Council and 
which is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
Board
The Board currently comprises the non-executive  
Chairman, two executive directors and seven independent 
non-executive directors. The Chairman has a primary 
responsibility for the running of the Board and for relations 
with shareholders. The Chief Executive is responsible for  
the operations and for the development of strategic plans 
and initiatives for consideration by the Board. The division  
of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. J M Kelly acts as Senior Independent 
Director , whose role is to provide a sounding board to the 
Chairman and to serve as an intermediary for the other 
directors when necessary. Other roles and responsibilities  
of the Senior Independent Director are described elsewhere.
The Company recognises the value that diversity brings to its 
boardroom and believes that the Board performs better and 
supports its overall objectives within the business strategy 
when it includes the best people representing a range of 
capabilities, experience, perspectives and backgrounds.  
In line with this, the Company aims to foster a diverse  
Board, including a mix of genders and ethnicities. 
The Company has a well established and published equal 
opportunities policy that guides all colleagues in how they 
fairly deal with all colleagues and customers irrespective of 
age, gender , sexual orientation, religion, disability, or ethnic 
origin. That policy applies on how people are selected to 
work at the Company and applies at all levels. The Company 
has a succession policy that ensures all key roles including 
director positions are considered and the Company 
considers candidates for roles from the widest possible field. 
The Board regularly reviews succession arrangements for 
all key roles and the Nomination Committee reviews 
succession arrangements for directors. Governance 31
www.ladbrokesplc.com/ar2012
Governance
 any director may retire from office at any general meeting 
and that any director so retiring may offer himself or 
herself for appointment or re-appointment as a director  
by the members at the meeting; and
 if a director retires from office at any general meeting,  
the director shall retain office until the end of the meeting 
(irrespective of the outcome of any resolution that the 
director be appointed or re-appointed as a director put to 
the members at the meeting).
The UK Corporate Governance Code specifies that all 
directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to 
annual election by shareholders. The Company is a FTSE 
350 company and all directors will be subject to election or 
re-election at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
The independent non-executive directors understand that 
the Board will not automatically recommend their re-election 
by shareholders. The Chairman and the independent 
non-executive directors are appointed, subject to re-election, 
for a specified term of approximately three years, renewable 
by one additional period of three years and further 
renewable thereafter at the discretion of the Company. 
The Companies Act 2006 allows shareholders in general 
meeting by ordinary resolution (requiring a simple majority 
of the persons voting on the relevant resolution) to remove 
any director before the expiration of his or her period of 
office, but without prejudice to any claim for damages which 
the director may have for breach of any contract of service 
between him or her and the Company.
A person also ceases to be a director if he or she notifies the 
Company of his or her resignation, ceases to be a director by 
virtue of any provision of the Companies Act 2006, becomes 
prohibited by law from being a director , has a bankruptcy 
order against him or her or is the subject of a relevant 
insolvency procedure, or if a medical practitioner gives a 
written opinion stating the director has become physically  
or mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain 
so for more than three months, or is removed from office by 
notice signed by all the other directors sent to the director ,  
or if the Board so decides following at least six months’ 
consecutive absence without permission or he or she 
becomes subject to relevant procedures under the mental 
health laws.
The Board undertakes a formal annual evaluation process  
of its own performance and that of its committees and 
individual directors which in 2012 was externally facilitated 
by Lintstock. Lintstock has no other connection with  
the Company. Questionnaires tailored to the specific 
circumstances of the Company were completed by each 
director in relation to their own performance and on the 
effectiveness of the Board and its committees.
The Chairman conducts an appraisal of each director .  
The Senior Independent Director , having consulted with each 
of the other directors, conducts an appraisal interview with 
the Chairman. In 2012 a detailed report on the effectiveness 
of the Board and its committees was produced by Lintstock. 
The results of this were considered by the Board and the 
individual committees and actions arising were agreed.  
The following themes were addressed: Board composition, 
expertise and dynamics; Board support, time management 
and Board committees; strategic oversight; risk management 
and internal control; succession planning and human 
resources management; and priorities for change. 
Whilst all directors are expected to bring an independent 
judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, 
resources (including key appointments) and standards of 
conduct, the independent non-executive directors were 
selected and appointed for this purpose.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board through the Chairman on all governance matters.
Appointment and replacement of directors
A person who is willing to act as a director , and is permitted 
by law to do so, may be appointed as a director of the 
Company by shareholders in general meeting by ordinary 
resolution (requiring a simple majority of the persons voting 
on the relevant resolution) or by a decision of the directors. 
No person, other than a director retiring at that general 
meeting, shall be appointed or re-appointed a director at any 
general meeting unless he or she is recommended by the 
directors or , not less than seven nor more than 35 clear days 
before the date appointed for the meeting, notice executed 
by that person of his or her willingness to be appointed or 
re-appointed is lodged at the Company’s registered office.
The articles of association of the Company provide that:
 at every Annual General Meeting any director who has 
been appointed as a director by the directors since the  
last Annual General Meeting, or who was not appointed or 
re-appointed as a director at one of the preceding two 
Annual General Meetings, must retire from office 
(notwithstanding any agreement the director may have 
with the Company) and that any director so retiring may 
offer himself or herself for appointment or re-appointment 
as a director by the members at the meeting; Governance 32

The Committee is the body which carries out the functions 
required by DTR 7.1.3. The main role and responsibilities of 
the Committee in 2012 were to:
 monitor the integrity of the financial statements of  
the Company;
 review the Company’s internal financial control and risk 
management systems;
 monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit function; and
 oversee the Company’s relationship with the external 
auditor including the recommendation to the Board of its 
appointment and remuneration.
Should the Committee’s monitoring and review activities 
reveal any material cause for concern or scope for 
improvement, it will make recommendations to the Board on 
action needed to address the issue or make improvements. 
The main activities of the Committee in 2012 were as follows:
 with the assistance of reports received from management 
and the external auditor , the critical review of the significant 
financial reporting issues in connection with the preparation 
of the Company’s financial and related formal statements;
 assessing the scope and effectiveness of the systems 
established to identify, assess, manage and monitor 
financial and non-financial risks; 
 monitoring the integrity of the Company’s internal financial 
controls. The Committee does so by reference to:
 (a) summaries of business risks and mitigating controls;
 (b)  regular reports and presentations from the heads of  
key risk functions, internal audit and external audit; and
 (c)  the results of the system of annual self-certification of 
compliance with key controls and procedures;
 monitoring and reviewing the plans, work and effectiveness 
of the internal audit function, including any actions taken 
following any significant failures in internal controls;
 reviewing, with the external auditor , its terms of 
engagement, the findings of its work, and at the end  
of the audit process reviewing its effectiveness; and
 reviewing the independence and objectivity of the  
external auditor .
Powers of the Company’s directors
Subject to the articles, the directors are responsible for  
the management of the Company’s business, for which 
purpose they may exercise all the powers of the Company. 
The shareholders may, by special resolution, direct the 
directors to take, or refrain from taking, specified action.  
The directors’ exercise of the powers of the Company to 
borrow money is restricted. The directors have power to 
issue new shares and to purchase the Company’s own 
shares, in each case to the extent permitted by law or as 
allowed by shareholder resolution (resolutions to issue and 
purchase shares are regularly proposed at the Company’s 
Annual General Meetings).
Board committees
The Board has five standing committees, all of which  
have written terms of reference clearly setting out their 
authority and duties. The terms of reference of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees, which are 
reviewed annually, can be viewed at www.ladbrokesplc.com. 
In addition, the Executive Committee, Risk Committee, 
Investment Committee, Digital Committee and Compliance 
Committee referred to elsewhere are not formal  
Board committees.

Committee 
role
Darren M Shapland 16 F ebruary 2010 Chairman
John M Kelly 1 September 2010 Member
Christine M Hodgson 1 May 2012 Member
All members of the Committee are independent  
non-executive directors. Appointments to the Committee  
are made by the Board at the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee, which consults with the Chairman  
of the Audit Committee.
The Board has satisfied itself that the members of the 
Committee have recent and relevant financial experience.
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources  
to undertake its duties. It has access to the services of  
the Company Secretary (who acts as secretary to the 
Committee) and all other employees. The Committee is  
able to take independent legal or professional advice  
when it believes it necessary to do so. 
The Committee meets as required, but not less than three 
times a year . There was full attendance at the four meetings 
held in 2012.
Although other directors, including the Chief Financial  
Officer , attend Audit Committee meetings, the Committee 
also meets for private discussions with the external auditor , 
who attends all of its meetings, and can do so with the 
internal auditor . Governance 33
www.ladbrokesplc.com/ar2012
Governance
The external auditor reports to the Committee on the  
actions taken to comply with professional and regulatory 
requirements and with best practice designed to ensure its 
independence. The Committee has agreed a policy on the 
engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit 
services, the application of which it monitors. The policy, 
which can be viewed at www.ladbrokesplc.com, specifies 
services that may not be provided and contains a level of 
cost at which Committee approval is required enabling the 
Committee to satisfy itself that auditor objectivity and 
independence are safeguarded.
The Company acknowledges the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in September 2012  
in relation to external audit tendering. It is currently 
anticipated that the Company will put the external audit 
contract out to tender in summer 2013 unless any material 
changes emerge from the EUs considerations of audit policy. 
The results of that tender will determine the identity of the 
external auditor to be appointed or re-appointed at the  
2014 Annual General Meeting.
Finance Committee
This Committee meets as required to deal with all routine 
business excluding matters that are specifically reserved to 
the Board or to another committee and specific matters 
delegated to it by the Board requiring attention between 
scheduled Board meetings. Any two directors can conduct 
the business of this Committee.

Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board.
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources  
to undertake its duties. It has access to the services  
of the Company Secretary (who acts as secretary to the 
Committee) and all other employees. The Committee is able 
to take independent legal and professional advice when it 
believes it necessary to do so.
The Committee meets as required but not less than twice a 
year . Two meetings of the Committee were held in 2012 and 
there was full attendance at these meetings. 
The main role and responsibilities of the Committee are to:
 review the structure, size and composition of the Board 
(which includes an objective and comprehensive evaluation 
of the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity 
of the Board) and make recommendations to the Board 
with regard to any changes;
 consider succession planning for the directors and other 
senior executives and make recommendations to the Board;
 identify and nominate for the approval of the Board 
candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise;
 review the leadership of the Company to ensure the 
continued ability of the Company to compete effectively  
in the marketplace;
 recommend candidates for the role of Senior Independent 
Director and for membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees, in consultation with the 
Chairmen of those Committees; and
 make recommendations to the Board concerning the  
re-appointment of non-executive directors at the end of 
their specified term of office and the re-election by 
shareholders of any director under the retirement by 
rotation provisions or otherwise.
The Committee performed the above activities as necessary 
in 2012.
C M Hodgson and R Moross were appointed as non-executive 
directors with effect from 1 May 2012. Descriptions of the 
roles and capabilities required were prepared and suitable 
candidates were identified by external advisers, JCA Group, 
following a review of the structure, size and composition 
(including skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) of  
the Board. JCA Group has no other connection with the 
Company. When recommending appointments to the Board, 
the Committee considers the Company’s equal opportunities 
policy and aspirations regarding women on the Board as set 
out on page 30, whilst ensuring that the Company selects  
on merit.
C J Rodrigues has served as an independent non-executive 
director of the Company for nine years and will retire  
from the Company at the 2013 Annual General Meeting. 
During the course of 2012, the Committee met and 
considered the balance of the Board (including its size, the 
balance of skills, experience, independence and diversity 
(including gender)) and also reflected on the findings of the 
Lintstock Board evaluation. It was determined that there  
was no need to appoint a non-executive director to replace  
C J Rodrigues at this time.  Governance 34

In addition to these, there are four Business Support Units:
 Information T echnology;
 Customer;
 Finance and Development; and
 Human Resources.
There is an Executive Head responsible for each of these 
Business Units.
 as well as weekly updates, the Chief Executive and the 
Executive Heads meet monthly (the Executive Committee) 
to consider Group strategy, financial performance,  
business development and management issues. Other 
senior executives participate as appropriate. In addition 
there are weekly and monthly financial and operational 
review meetings together with an annual programme of 
plan/reforecasting and strategy reviews attended by the 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer together with,  
as appropriate, other Executive Heads and executives;
 the Business Units comprise executives with defined 
responsibilities. Business Unit management meet  
regularly to manage their respective operations; 
 key policies and control procedures (including treasury, 
compliance and information system controls) are 
documented and have Group-wide application. There are 
also operating procedure manuals that are integrated with 
Group-wide controls;
 high standards of business ethics and compliance with 
laws, regulations and internal policies are demanded  
from employees at all levels. T o underpin the effectiveness 
of controls, it is Group policy to recruit and develop 
management and other employees of high calibre,  
integrity and with appropriate disciplines; 
 there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group. Key risks and their 
financial implications are appraised by the Executive 
Committee which is assisted by a committee of Business 
Unit executives (the Risk Committee). This is an integral 
part of the strategic planning process. The appropriateness 
of controls is considered, having regard to cost/benefit, 
materiality and the likelihood of risks crystallising; 
 key risks and actions to mitigate those risks are considered 
at each regular Board meeting and are formally reviewed 
and approved by the Board twice yearly. Each key risk is 
assigned executive director/Executive Head ownership;
 the Board establishes corporate strategy and Group-wide 
business objectives which are formally reviewed annually. 
Business Unit management integrate such objectives into 
business strategies for presentation to the Board with 
supporting financial objectives;
 Business Unit budgets, containing financial and operating 
targets, capital expenditure proposals and performance 
indicators, are reviewed by the Executive Committee and 
support Group strategies. The Group profit plan is approved 
by the Board;
Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee, including 
membership, are set out in the Directors’ remuneration 
report, which should be read in conjunction with this section.
Disclosure Committee
In 2012, the Board established a Disclosure Committee 
which meets on an ad hoc basis to consider and make 
decisions relating to the handling of inside information 
concerning the Company and the Group. Any executive 
director of the Company together with the Chairman of the 
Board can conduct the business of the Committee.  
The Committee is responsible for ensuring the timely and 
accurate disclosure of inside information to the market in 
accordance with the Company’s obligations under the 
UKLA ’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules and for 
monitoring compliance with the Company’s disclosure 
controls and procedures. The Committee receives advice 
from the Company’s external legal, financial and public 
relations advisers as required and reports to the Board.  
In appropriate cases, the decisions of the Committee may  
be subject to confirmation from the Board.
Internal control and risk management systems
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the internal control 
and risk management systems operating throughout the 
Group and for reviewing their effectiveness. No such 
systems can provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Group’s systems are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and to provide the Board with reasonable 
assurance that potential problems will normally be 
prevented or will be detected in a timely manner for 
appropriate action.
The Company had procedures in place throughout the year 
and up to 21 February 2013, the date of approval of this 
Annual Report, which accord with the Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code 
published in October 2005.
The Board has delegated the detailed design of the  
systems of internal control and risk management to the 
executive directors.
The control framework and key procedures during 2012 in 
relation to the financial reporting process were as follows:
The Group manages its operations through two primary 
Business Units: 
 Retail (UK and Ireland and International); and
 Digital (UK and Ireland and International). Governance 35

Governance
 reports on financial and non-financial performance are 
regularly provided to directors and discussed at Board 
meetings. Performance against both budgets and 
objectives together with management of business risks, 
are reviewed with Group management, as are forecasts 
and material sensitivities;
 the Board regularly receives reports from Executive Heads 
covering areas such as operations, forecasts, business 
development, strategic planning, human resources, legal 
and corporate matters, compliance, health and safety and 
corporate responsibility;
 there is a Group-wide policy governing appraisal and 
approval of investment expenditure and asset disposals.  
A committee of the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer considers all significant financial commitments, 
including past investment appraisals (the Investment 
Committee). Major projects are reported on at each 
scheduled Board meeting. Post-investment appraisals  
are undertaken on a systematic basis and are formally 
reviewed by the Board twice yearly;
 a system of annual self-certification of compliance with  
key controls and procedures is operated throughout the 
Group; and 
 the Group has an internal audit function, outsourced  
to Deloitte LLP , which reports to management and the  
Audit Committee on Group operations.
The role of the Audit Committee in reviewing the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal control and risk 
management is explained in the Audit Committee section.
The Board also conducts an assessment of the effectiveness 
of the internal control and risk management systems.  
The assessment takes account of all significant aspects 
including: risk assessment; the control environment  
and control activities; information and communication;  
and monitoring.
Anti-bribery and whistleblowing policies
The Board recognises that as a global betting and gaming 
business there is potential for exposure to bribery and 
corruption. Failure by employees, suppliers or agents to 
comply with anti-bribery and corruption legislation (including 
the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act), or any failure in policies and procedures to monitor and 
prevent non-compliance, anywhere in the world, could result 
in substantial penalties, criminal prosecution and significant 
damage to the reputation of the Company.
The Board ensures that there are a number of policies, 
procedures, management systems and internal controls  
in place across the business to prevent bribery and 
corruption occurring. This includes policies on whistleblowing, 
anti-bribery , gifts and hospitality , charitable donations and 
sponsorship. Supplementary audit, monitoring and review 
processes are designed to identify breaches of Group controls.
The whistleblowing policy enables and encourages 
employees to report in confidence any possible malpractice, 
impropriety or other matters of concern which may arise  
in the business. Any matters raised in accordance with the 
policy are investigated thoroughly and reports are provided 
at each meeting of the Audit Committee.
Relations with shareholders
There is a regular programme of meetings with major 
institutional shareholders to consider the Group’s 
performance and prospects. In addition, presentations  
are made twice yearly after the announcement of results, 
the details of which, together with the Group’s financial 
reports and announcements, can be accessed at  
www.ladbrokesplc.com. The Chairman met in 2012 with 
several institutional investors and their representative  
bodies in addition to results presentations and the Annual 
General Meeting. Other directors are available to meet the 
Company’s major shareholders if requested.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns, where contact through the usual 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer has failed to solve, or for which such contact  
is inappropriate.
A report on investor relations, which includes updates on 
meetings with major institutional shareholders, is given at 
each Board meeting. The Company’s brokers also present  
to the Board annually. Principles of ownership, corporate 
governance and voting guidelines issued by the Company’s 
major institutional shareholders, their representative bodies 
and advisory organisations are circulated to, and considered 
by, the Board.
The Company corresponds regularly on a range of subjects 
with its individual shareholders who have an opportunity to 
question the Board at the Annual General Meeting. Further 
information on our relations with shareholders is contained 
in the "Shareholder information" section on page 118.
Rights attaching to the shares and restrictions  
on voting and transfer
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares  
of 28
1
/ 3p each. Subject to any suspension or abrogation of 
rights pursuant to relevant law or the Company’s articles  
of association, the ordinary shares confer on their holders 
(other than the Company in respect of its treasury shares):
(a)  the right to receive out of profits available for distribution 
such dividends as may be agreed to be paid (in the case 
of a final dividend in an amount not exceeding the amount 
recommended by the Board as approved by shareholders 
in general meeting, or in the case of an interim dividend  
in an amount determined by the Board). All dividends 
unclaimed for a period of 12 years after having become 
due for payment are forfeited automatically and cease to 
remain owing by the Company; Governance 36
Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
A member may choose whether his or her shares are 
evidenced by share certificates (certificated shares) or  
held in electronic (uncertificated) form in CREST (the UK 
electronic settlement system). Any member may transfer  
all or any of his or her shares subject in the case of 
certificated shares to the rules set out in the Company’s 
articles of association or in the case of uncertificated shares 
the regulations governing the operation of CREST (which 
allow the directors to refuse to register a transfer as therein 
set out); the transferor remains the holder of the shares until 
the name of the transferee is entered in the register of 
members. The directors may refuse to register a transfer  
of certificated shares in favour of more than four persons 
jointly or where there is no adequate evidence of ownership 
or the transfer is not duly stamped (if so required).  
The directors may also refuse to register a share transfer  
if it is in respect of a certificated share which is not fully paid 
up or on which the Company has a lien provided that, where 
the share transfer is in respect of any share admitted to the 
Official List maintained by the UK Listing Authority, any such 
discretion may not be exercised so as to prevent dealings 
taking place on an open and proper basis, or if in the opinion 
of the directors (and with the concurrence of the UK Listing 
Authority) exceptional circumstances so warrant provided 
that the exercise of such power will not disturb the market in 
those shares. Whilst there are no squeeze-out and sell out 
rules relating to the shares in the Company’s articles of 
association, shareholders are subject to the compulsory 
acquisition provisions in sections 974 to 991 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and can be required by the Company  
to transfer their shares following certain action by a 
gambling industry regulator (as more specifically set out  
in the Company’s articles of association).
Significant agreements that take effect, alter  
or terminate upon a change of control following  
a takeover bid
The agreements between Ladbrokes Group Finance plc 
(“LGF”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and eight 
separate banks for the provision by the banks of revolving 
credit facilities of up to £540 million on a committed basis 
provide that the banks may give notice of cancellation if a 
change of control occurs. On cancellation the amounts 
drawn would be immediately repayable. In the context of a 
takeover bid, the acquirer would normally arrange substitute 
facilities. In addition, LGF issued a bond in March 2010. The 
bond has a “Put Event” that allows bondholders to exercise a 
put option when a change of control occurs. The put option 
allows the bondholders to require LGF to purchase the 
bonds at a price of 101 pence.
Amendment of the Company’s articles  
of association
The Company’s articles of association may be amended  
by the members of the Company by special resolution 
(requiring a majority of at least 75% of the persons voting  
on the relevant resolution).
(b)  the right, on a return of assets on a liquidation, reduction 
of capital or otherwise, to share in the surplus assets of 
the Company remaining after payment of its liabilities pari 
passu with the other holders of ordinary shares; and
(c)  the right to receive notice of and to attend and speak and 
vote in person or by proxy at any general meeting of the 
Company. On a show of hands every member present  
(or in the case of a corporation, represented) and voting 
has one vote and every proxy present who has been 
appointed by one or more members present has one vote 
(and a second vote where the proxy has been appointed 
by more than one member and has been instructed by 
one or more members to vote for the resolution and by 
one or more other members to vote against the 
resolution). On a poll every member present (or 
represented) in person or by proxy has one vote for every 
share of which that member is the holder . Normally, the 
appointment of a proxy must be received not less than  
48 hours before the time of the holding of the relevant 
meeting or adjourned meeting; special provision is made 
in the Company’s articles of association as to the delivery 
of proxies for use on a poll not taken during the meeting 
at which the poll is demanded.
These rights can be suspended. If the member , or any other 
person appearing to be interested in shares held by that 
member , has failed to comply with a notice pursuant to 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (notice by company 
requiring information about interests in its shares) the 
Company can suspend (until one week after the default 
ceases) the right to attend and speak and vote at a general 
meeting and if the shares represent at least 0.25% of their 
class the Company can withhold any dividend or other 
money payable in respect of the shares and refuse to accept 
certain transfers of the relevant shares. In addition, following 
certain action by a gambling industry regulator (as more 
specifically set out in the Company’s articles of association), 
the Company may suspend all or some of the rights 
attaching to all or some of the shares held by any relevant 
shareholder to attend and to speak at meetings and to vote, 
to receive any dividend or other money payable in respect of 
the shares, and to the issue of further shares or other 
securities in respect of the shares.
Shareholders, either alone or with other shareholders,  
have other rights as set out in the Company’s articles of 
association and in company law (principally the Companies 
Act 2006).
The Trustee of the Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust,  
which is used in connection with certain of the Company’s 
employee share ownership plans, held 884,126 ordinary 
shares in the Company at 31 December 2012 which are  
not voted by plan members and which it can vote in its 
absolute discretion.

Corporate responsibility
The 2012 Corporate Responsibility (CR) report is available  
at www.ladbrokesplc.com and highlights, with which the 
following should be considered in conjunction, are given  
on pages 25 to 27.
The processes described in the section “Internal control and 
risk management systems” on pages 34 and 35 applied to 
CR, as did the practices described on page 30 for ensuring 
the Board is supplied with appropriate and timely information 
and training and for assisting the directors to update their 
knowledge. In addition to business presentations regularly 
made to the Board at which CR was considered as 
appropriate, the Board conducts an annual CR review  
and Board members regularly receive CR updates.  
CR performance is included in business unit accountability 
systems and remuneration arrangements. The Remuneration 
Committee in determining executive remuneration takes  
into account CR matters as described in the Directors’ 
remuneration report.
The risks and opportunities relating to CR in 2012 and going 
forward primarily revolve around the reputation of the Group 
and the quality of its brands.

Of particular importance was the promotion of responsible 
gambling and the protection of children and the vulnerable. 
CR also impacted (i) the performance of the Group’s 
employees on whom the Group relies for the provision of 
high quality services to customers and (ii) the health and 
safety of these employees and the customers they serve.
Performance indicators continued to be developed in 
accordance with Group-wide CR. No breaches of CR policies 
and procedures material to the Group were identified by the 
Board in 2012.
The identification and management of CR issues, the CR 
reporting framework and any associated data has been 
reviewed by the Company’s CR adviser , Carnstone  
Partners LLP .
Employee policies
The Board values two-way communication between  
senior management and employees on all aspects of the 
Company’s strategy, Company performance, management 
effectiveness and approach to wellbeing.
There is a rolling three year internal communications 
strategy and delivery plan which includes interventions  
such as regular management roadshows, virtual strategy 
briefings, visits to operating units, responses to the annual 
colleague opinion survey and updates on performance 
against the Company’s Vision & Values.
The internal communications channels include a mobile 
device platform, face to face events, a corporate intranet, 
phone broadcasting, SMS alerts, a Company magazine, 
leadership and line manager briefing packs.
The UK Retail Colleague Forum, which was launched in  
2012 as an evolution of our Staff Council, provides a further 
mechanism for employee dialogue and engagement.
In addition, those employees who are eligible are also 
encouraged to become involved in the Group’s performance 
through participation in share schemes.
Throughout the Group, the principles of equal opportunities 
are recognised in the formulation and development of 
employment policies.
It is the Company’s policy to give full and fair consideration  
to applications from people with disabilities, having regard  
to their particular aptitudes and abilities. If an employee 
becomes disabled, the Company’s objective is the continued 
provision of suitable employment, either in the same or an 
alternative position, with appropriate adjustments being 
made if necessary. Employees with disabilities share equally 
in the opportunities for training, career development  
and promotion.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company continues to maintain directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance. In accordance with the Company’s  
articles of association, the Company has entered into a  
deed of indemnity to the extent permitted by law with  
each of the directors.
Charitable donations
During 2012, in addition to donations made to overseas 
charities, Group companies donated £945,305 to UK 
charitable organisations for charitable purposes.
Supplier payment policy
The Company does not follow any code or standard  
on payment practice. However , the Company agrees 
payment terms for its business transactions when goods 
and services are ordered. It ensures that suppliers are aware 
of the terms of payment and the relevant terms are included 
in contracts where appropriate. Subject to satisfactory 
performance by the supplier , arrangements are adhered  
to when making payments. At the year end, the Company 
had no trade creditors.
Going concern
In assessing the going concern basis, the directors 
considered the Group’s business activities, the financial 
position of the Group as described in pages 10 to 27 and the 
Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies as 
included in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
The directors consider that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing its financial statements.

Dear Shareholder
This has been a year in which Ladbrokes has delivered 
improved results and made good progress against the 
majority of its specific strategic goals. The Company’s 
share price rose by 50% during the year .
For the 2012 annual bonus, the Committee set  
stretching targets in relation to Group profit performance. 
Strong profit
(1) 
growth of 8% represented 97% achievement  
of plan and, as a result, 43% of the profit-related portion  
of the bonus vested. The digital performance threshold, 
which the Committee had put in place for 2012 to cap 
bonuses unless a specified level of increase in Digital net 
revenue was achieved, did not materialise.
The remainder of the annual bonus based on individual 
performance saw a range of assessments for individual 
performances from 67% of target to 72% of target for 
current executive directors. These awards reflected  
strong individual performances. 
The significant improvement in Company performance 
over recent years was reflected in the outcome of the 2010 
cycle of the Performance Share Plan. I am pleased to 
report that, unlike the previous three cycles under the 
scheme, the 2010 PSP awards paid out. The vesting level  
at 81.5% of maximum reflected EPS growth of 9.4% per 
annum and a TSR ranking of fifth out of 14 comparator 
companies resulting from share price growth of 44% over 
the three year period. Currently, outstanding awards under 
the 2011 and 2012 cycles are also on track to vest. 
The Ladbrokes Growth Plan was a one-off arrangement 
designed to reward a substantial improvement in share 
price. The Plan, which requires significant personal 
shareholdings by participants, only rewards a considerable 
increase in share price above the base price of 147.5p at 
the time of Richard Glynn’s appointment. The share price 
has to reach a threshold of £2.00 before participants can 
earn anything. Awards under this Plan are now 
approaching this threshold for the first time.
During the year , as part of our management restructuring, 
Richard Ames left the Group. Richard had played a 
significant and valuable part in the reinvigoration of 
Ladbrokes. The Committee determined his departure 
arrangements with reference to the Company’s 
remuneration policy as outlined in this report, and  
further details on this are provided on page 53.
The Committee considers the current remuneration 
framework incentivises management to maintain the 
business momentum they have achieved this year . 
You will notice that this year’s report is structured in a 
different way. We fully support the focus on transparency  
in the new disclosure regulations for UK listed companies 
proposed by the Department of Business, Innovation and 
Skills (BIS), which are due to take effect from October 2013. 
Ladbrokes has therefore voluntarily decided to structure  
the 2012 report to incorporate as many of the proposed 
features this year as practicable. 
At this year’s AGM, I will be retiring after my ninth year as  
a non-executive director of Ladbrokes and my sixth year  
as Chair of the Committee. In bringing about the increased 
orientation to performance pay and tightening of individual 
performance criteria that we have introduced during my 
chairmanship, I have been fortunate to work with a diligent 
Remuneration Committee, a hard working HR team, good 
external advice, a responsible management team and 
thoughtful shareholders. 
I believe the key to good remuneration management  
lies in transparency and clear linkage between pay, the 
delivery of strategic objectives, annual results and 
individual performance. 
As a shareholder myself, I wish the Board every success  
in the future. I know that if the Company does well, so  
will shareholders – and so, rightly, and proportionately,  
will management.

salary
 Core element of remuneration reflecting 
individual role and experience. 
 Salary levels are set to both support 
retention and reward performance at  
a competitive level. 
 Salaries are reviewed annually on  
1 March, with reference to market practice  
at companies of a similar size and 
complexity, business performance  
and personal performance.
Pension
 Fixed element of remuneration to assist 
employees with retirement planning.
 Aim to provide market competitive 
arrangements and adhere to  
legislative requirements.
 Executives can opt upon appointment to join 
the defined contribution scheme or take a 
cash supplement.
 The Company has closed its defined benefit 
scheme to new members and none of the 
current executive directors are members of 
this plan.
Benefits
 Fixed element of remuneration providing 
market competitive benefits.
 Benefits include private healthcare, life 
assurance, tax advice and a cash allowance  
in lieu of a company car .
Non-executive  
director fees
 Sole element of non-executive  
director remuneration.
 Fees are reviewed periodically.
 The Committee determines the fees of the 
Chairman of the Board and the Board as a 
whole determines the remuneration of each 
of the non-executive directors. Non-executive 
directors receive fees set relative to median 
market practice and are regularly reviewed.
Introduction 
The Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in 
accordance with the Large and Medium-Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and 
meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Services 
Authority’s Listing Rules. As outlined above, the Company 
has voluntarily structured this report to incorporate many of 
the proposed features of the new BIS disclosure regulations 
due to apply from October 2013.
In forming the remuneration policy, the best practice 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
have been followed and the guidelines issued by the 
Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National 
Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) have been noted. 
Remuneration policy report
Summary of 2013 remuneration policy
The principles underlying the remuneration policy are that 
total remuneration packages should:
 be aligned with and support the business strategy;
 enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate  
key individuals; 
 be strongly aligned with shareholder value creation; and
 be positioned competitively against market practice in 
companies of a similar size. Governance 41

Maximum opportunity Performance metrics Any planned changes  
to the policy
 Maximum opportunity is set at a level which 
the Committee considers appropriate, taking 
into consideration the individual’s skills, 
experience and recent performance, the 
external environment and affordability.
 Salary increases are reviewed in the  
context of wider workforce increases  
and the Committee considers any  
increases out of line with this very carefully . 
Higher increases may be awarded in 
exceptional circumstances such as 
significant changes in scope or responsibility .
 None, although overall performance of the 
individual is one of the considerations in 
setting salary levels.
 No changes to policy.
 Following the annual salary review,  
R I Glynn’s salary will be maintained at the 
current level of £580,000 with effect from  
1 March 2013.
 I A Bull’s salary will be increased from 
£380,000 to £400,000 with effect from  
1 March 2013.
 Both current executive directors have  
elected to receive a cash supplement 
equivalent to 22.5% of base salary.
 None. All executive directors will be required to  
be invited to participate in the Company’s 
defined contribution scheme under 
auto-enrolment legislation from 1 March 
2013. Any employer contribution under the 
scheme will be deducted from their cash 
supplement of 22.5% of base salary.
 The standard benefit package is around  
£20,000 for each executive director .
 None. None. 
 Fees are set at a level which is considered 
appropriate but the Company avoids paying 
more than necessary for this purpose. 
Opportunity is linked to the external 
environment and affordability.
 This is the sole element of non-executive 
director remuneration. Non-executive 
directors are not eligible for annual bonus, 
share incentives, pensions or other benefits.

 Maximum awards as a percentage of base 
salary – 170% for the Chief Executive and 
130% for the Chief Financial Officer .
 70% of total bonus opportunity is based on 
financial performance. Profit is used as our 
key financial measure. 
 In setting the level of profit required to 
achieve threshold and maximum 
performance under this element, the 
Committee pays particular attention to the 
level of stretch inherent in the Company’s 
profit plan for the year .
 30% of total bonus opportunity is based on 
performance against individual objectives. 
For executive directors, these are primarily 
financial in nature.
 Individual performance objectives are 
reviewed and approved by the Committee  
at the start of the financial year and clearly 
aligned to the strategic objectives of  
the Company.
 Profit attributed to High Rollers is excluded 
from the profit performance calculations  
for annual bonus purposes. However , the 
impact of High Rollers may be included in 
the assessment of individual objectives for 
those directly responsible for the relevant 
area of the business.
 Vesting of deferred element is subject to 
continued employment at the end of the 
three year vesting period.
 No change has been made to performance 
metrics or weighting for 2013. Governance 44

 Award levels are determined by reference  
to individual performance prior to grant

Maximum opportunity Performance metrics Any planned changes

 Maximum awards as a percentage of base 
salary – 175% for the Chief Executive and 
150% for the Chief Financial Officer .
 Awards of up to 250% of base salary may  
be made in exceptional circumstances  
(e.g. recruitment or retention) at the 
Committee’s discretion.
 Performance is assessed over three  
financial years.
 50% of the award is based on T otal 
Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company 
against a select group of industry peers. 
 25% of this element of the award vests for 
median performance and 100% for upper 
quartile performance. Vesting will be on a 
straight line basis between median and 
upper quartile.
  The comparator group for 2013 is 
unchanged and is as follows: 888 Holdings; 
Boyd Gaming; Bwin PartyGaming;  
Enterprise Inns; Lottomatica; Mitchells  
and Butlers; OP AP; Paddy Power;  
Punch T averns; Rank Group; Sportingbet; 
Whitbread and William Hill.
 The remaining 50% of the award is based on 
the achievement of stretching absolute EPS 
growth targets.
  25% of this element of the award vests for 
absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and 
100% for growth of 10% per annum. Vesting 
will be on a straight line basis between 
minimum and maximum EPS targets.
 None.
 Executive directors are required to invest  
up to 150% of base salary and receive up to 
a four times matching award.
 In the case of the Chief Executive he was 
required to invest in circa one million 
Ladbrokes shares and received a four  
times matching award.
 Performance is assessed over a five  
year period.
 Awards are subject to stretching share price 
performance conditions. Any share price 
target must be attained throughout a period 
of 30 consecutive dealing days. 
 25% of the award will vest if a share price of 
£2.00 is achieved. 100% of the award will 
vest if a share price of £2.97 is achieved. 
Vesting will be on a straight line basis 
between the minimum and maximum share 
price targets (i.e. between £2.00 and £2.97).
 The Committee is mindful that absolute 
share price targets must demand a real 
stretch performance. In particular , the 
Committee will retain responsibility to 
amend the targets if it is necessary to take 
account of exceptional factors including, for 
example, corporate events or exceptional 
market or industry factors which would 
otherwise render the targets inappropriate.
 None. Governance 46
Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Directors’

continued
In cases where the Company hires a new executive director , 
the Committee will use the policy detailed in the previous 
table for 2013 onwards to determine the executive director’s 
ongoing remuneration package.
T o facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make a one-off 
award to “buy out” incentive arrangements and any other 
compensation forfeited on leaving a previous employer .  
In doing so the Committee will ensure that any such awards 
would be on a comparable basis, taking account of all 
relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions 
being met, the proportion of the vesting/performance period 
remaining and the form of the award.
In determining whether it is appropriate to use such 
judgement, the Committee will ensure that any awards 
made are in the best interests of both Ladbrokes and its 
shareholders and will give due regard to all relevant  
factors (including quantum, the nature of remuneration  
and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from).  
The Committee is at all times conscious of the need not  
to pay more than is necessary.
The remuneration policy applied to other senior managers  
in the business is similar to the policy for the executive 
directors set out in this report. Remuneration is linked to 
company and individual performance and aims to deliver 
shareholder value.
The reward framework at senior levels intentionally  
focuses heavily on variable remuneration. Approximately 
120 key senior employees essential to the success of  
the business participate in the PSP and LGP , ensuring 
management are aligned with shareholders with  
a common goal to drive the business forward. 
Ladbrokes strives to align the performance measures under 
its long-term incentive schemes with the long-term strategy 
of the Company. 50% of PSP awards are based on EPS 
performance, as this is considered to be the most relevant 
financial performance metric. The remaining 50% of PSP 
awards is assessed with reference to TSR as the Committee 
considers this the best measure of shareholder value 
creation. The LGP is designed to drive exceptional future 
share price performance. T argets were calibrated to 
represent a doubling in the size of the business, which would 
represent significant value creation over a five year period.
Within the wider workforce, there is alignment on overall 
profit targets under the annual bonus plan; this is then 
supported by relevant team and individual targets to focus 
colleagues on key deliverables in their area of the business. 
The specific bonus framework varies by job level and scope, 
as appropriate.
All of the Company’s UK staff with either six or twelve 
months’ service can participate in the Company’s  
HMRC approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme  
and Share Incentive Plan respectively. 
Newly appointed employees, including executive directors, 
are entitled to join the defined contribution pension plan 
subject to eligibility criteria. Ladbrokes will be introducing 
auto-enrolment to its UK workforce during 2013 in line  
with new legislation.
Remuneration mix and scenarios
In support of the remuneration philosophy, the mixture of 
fixed and variable reward is heavily weighted towards the 
performance-related elements. In particular , there is an 
emphasis on long-term share based incentives, i.e. the  
PSP and the LGP .
The chart below provides a breakdown of expected 
remuneration for each executive director at three levels of 
performance, below threshold, target and maximum, with 
details of actual remuneration received in respect of 2011 
and 2012 for information.

For the purpose of the analysis above, the following 
assumptions have been made: 
 target bonus is 60% of maximum, and target vesting under 
the PSP and LGP is 25% of maximum;
 no share price growth or dividend accrual assumption  
has been included in calculating the value of the Deferred 
Annual Bonus, PSP or LGP; Governance 47

Governance
 absolute plan maximum awards have been used for the 
PSP (R I Glynn: 175% of salary, I A Bull: 150% of salary). 
Awards in respect of 2012 were lower than this level at 
150% and 135% of salary respectively. The 2011 PSP 
award level shown for I A Bull excludes the impact of his 
one-off incremental award upon appointment;
 in respect of the LGP , the value shown is an annualised 
figure to reflect the fact that it is a one-off plan  
(i.e. expected level of vesting divided by the length  
of the 5-year performance period);
 benefits have been included at the same level as 2012; and 
 the 2011 actual remuneration received by I A Bull has been 
increased pro-rata to take account of the fact he joined the 
Board in July 2011 (i.e. to show a 12-month equivalent 
value of remuneration received in respect of that year).
Spend on pay
For information purposes, the following table shows the 
percentage change in profit, dividends and total expenditure 
on pay as a whole between the 2011 and 2012 financial 
years, compared with the two preceding periods: 
 operating profit increased significantly between 2009  
and 2010 with double digit growth across all operating 
segments. The operating profit in 2011 was lower than the 
prior year as the pressures on consumer spending took its 
toll on our core business. In 2012, operating profit has 
grown by 8%;
 the significant year-on-year dividend growth in 2010 
reflects the decision taken in 2010 to pay dividends 
following the rights issue in 2009. In the following years, 
there has been a steadily increasing dividend payout; and
 overall expenditure on pay has not changed significantly 
over the past three periods as we have continued to 
maintain control over our operational costs.

 R J Ames resigned as a director of the Company on 1 August 2012.
New appointments to the Board will normally be made on a 
one year rolling contract.
Upon termination of employment, an executive may receive 
a payment equivalent to the value of base salary and 
benefits in respect of the notice period. 
The Company normally expects executive directors upon 
departure to mitigate their loss. In any specific case that  
may arise, the Committee will carefully consider any 
compensatory payments having regard to performance, age, 
service, health or other circumstances that may be relevant. Governance 48

to modify the policy outlined above after obtaining specific legal advice. Governance 49

Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are retained on terms set out in 
their letters of appointment. They do not have service 
contracts with either the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
The standard letter of appointment for non-executive 
directors is available for inspection upon request.
The appointment of a non-executive director is terminable 
without notice, and therefore they will not be eligible for any 
exit payment upon leaving office. 
Wider workforce remuneration 
The Committee takes into consideration the pay and 
conditions of employees throughout the Group when 
determining remuneration arrangements for executive 
directors. Information relating to wider workforce 
remuneration is provided in regular updates to the 
Committee. This takes the form of a comparison of reward 
elements across all main workforce groups, updates on  
total reward communications and details of business wide 
reviews such as annual bonus awards and salary increases.
While the Company does not directly consult with employees 
as part of the process of reviewing executive pay, the 
Committee does receive updates and feedback on employee 
engagement surveys and takes these into account when 
reviewing executive pay. In the most recent survey in 2012, 
the indicators relating to perceptions around pay and 
benefits showed an improvement of 7% (13 points) when 
compared to 2011.
The wider workforce salary increase for 2013 is 
differentiated across divisions and groups of employees. 
Salary increases are linked to specific roles with a range  
of normal increases between 1% and 4%, with a small 
number of targeted higher increases linked to specific 
market based reviews and individual contribution.
In 2013 the Company will continue to align employee bonus 
arrangements with those of the executive directors to ensure 
consistency across the organisation and delivery of strategic 
goals. The Committee considers it important to maximise 
this alignment of bonus structures whilst also retaining line 
of sight for individual business units.
This has been supported by a Company-wide initiative to 
improve communication, awareness and understanding  
of the total reward offerings within Ladbrokes. This has 
included total reward statements to all management levels 
including executive directors and booklets to all employees 
covering salary, pensions, benefits, bonuses, recognition and 
incentive arrangements. 
Ladbrokes is committed to strengthening and widening 
employee share ownership. It therefore operates an additional 
discretionary share plan (Restricted Share Plan) below Board 
level and two all-employee share incentive plans. 
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The RSP is used from time to time as an attraction  
and retention vehicle for key management positions.  
Awards vest at the end of a three year period, subject  
to continued employment. Executive directors are not  
eligible to participate in the plan.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
The Company offers a Savings Related Share Option 
Scheme which is approved by HMRC (the 1983 Scheme), 
and is linked to a Save-As- You-Earn contract under which 
participants save a regular monthly sum by deducting from 
earnings up to £250 per month for either three or five years. 
Subject to common service criteria, the 1983 Scheme is 
open to all UK employees (including executive directors).
Options are normally exercisable during a period of six 
months following the expiry of three and five years (as 
previously selected by the participant) from the dates  
of grant and there are no performance conditions.  
Option prices are calculated by reference to the average  
mid-market quotation of shares as shown on the Stock 
Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of grant, discounted by  
up to 20% per share.
Share Incentive Plan
The Share Incentive Plan which is approved by HMRC is  
open to all UK employees (including executive directors) who 
have completed at least 12 months’ service. T o encourage 
employee participation, the Company provides a match of one 
bonus share for every two shares purchased by employees. 
The bonus shares are held conditionally upon satisfaction  
of a one year service requirement. The maximum monthly 
contribution by employees has been set at £75 per month. Governance 50

Shareholder context
The Committee considers shareholder views to be of great importance. In early 2012, Ladbrokes consulted a number of its 
major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies in order to discuss our current approach to executive remuneration. 
We received valuable feedback from a number of key shareholders. 
The consultation included details on the following:
 2012 base salary freezes for executive directors; 
 differentiation of 2012 PSP awards based on individual performance during 2011; and
 for 2012 the introduction of a cap to the annual bonus unless specific levels of performance were attained in the  
Digital business. 
As outlined in the implementation report below, Ladbrokes received strong support from its shareholders with a 93% vote in 
favour of last year’s remuneration report. 
The Committee continues to be mindful of shareholder views when determining ongoing remuneration strategy, and 
commits to undergoing shareholder consultation in advance of any significant changes to remuneration policy.

Methodology 
(1)
  Base salary and fees paid in the year under review. R Moross’ fees includes £1 7 ,000 received for being Chairman and a member of the Digital Committee which 
involved additional time commitment from him. The Chairman and membership fee for this Committee are the same as for other Board Committees.
(2) 
Taxable benefits including private healthcare, tax advice and a cash allowance in lieu of a company car. 
(3)  
Includes all pension related benefits. For R I Glynn and I A Bull, this reflects the cash allowance of 22.5% of salary paid in lieu of pension. For R J Ames, this 
includes:
   an amount in respect of his defined benefit pension, calculated as the additional annual benefit accrued in the year adjusted by a multiple of 20 using a 
methodology applied by HMRC (as stipulated under the draft BIS regulations); and 
  his cash allowance above the relevant earnings cap limit (£137 ,400 for 2012/13) prior to cessation of employment. 
(4)
 Bonus awarded in relation to the 2012 performance year, including deferred portion (based on the face value on award). See page 51 for further details.
(5)
  The 201 1 sub-total represents salary, benefits, pension cash allowance above the earnings cap and annual bonus (cash and DBP). It excludes the impact  
of R J Ames’ defined benefit pension plan, unlike the 2012 sub-total figure.
(6)
  Value of the PSP awards where final vesting has been determined as a result of achieving the performance conditions in the period to 31 December 2012. 
Further details on the achievement of the performance conditions are provided on page 52. The value shown in the table is calculated by multiplying the number 
of shares vesting by the three-month average share price to 31 December 2012.
(7)
  The figure within ‘Other payments’ represents 56.25% of R J Ames’ compensation payment in respect of cessation of employment. It also includes a payment of 
c.£10,300 which relate to legal costs and restrictive covenants. Further payments in relation to the balance of his compensation payment will be made in 
instalments in 2013. Please refer to page 53 for further details.

Base salary , pension and benefits 
In 2012, no annual salary increases were awarded to the executive directors. 
At its January 2013 meeting, the Committee determined salary levels with effect from 1 March 2013. It was decided that  
R I Glynn’s salary would be maintained at its current level. The Committee determined that I A Bull should receive a targeted 
increase of 5.3% to reflect his strong performance since joining the Board, and therefore his salary will be increased from 
£380,000 to £400,000 from 1 March 2013. In line with the Company’s policy on salary increases, the Committee considered 
this increase very carefully to ensure that it was appropriate.
The average executive director salary increase is 2.65%, which is broadly in line with the wider workforce average of 2.5%.
The table below shows the current base salaries for the executive directors and proposed salaries with effect from  
1 March 2013: 
Executive

R I Glynn £580,000 £580,000

Annual bonus
70% of the 2012 annual bonus was based on financial performance assessed against profit targets and the remaining 30% 
on individual performance objectives:
 targets were set by the Board at the beginning of 2012 by reference to internal projections and the prevailing economic 
conditions at the time;
 the minimum threshold below which no payments are made is 94% of the profit plan; and
 maximum awards would be delivered for achieving 106% of the profit plan.
Given the importance of growing the Company’s Digital business, for 2012, the Committee capped the amount payable under 
the financial element of the bonus at 60% of maximum unless a significant specified increase in net gaming revenue for the 
division is achieved. This performance threshold was not met.
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2012 was 170% for the Chief Executive and 130% of base salary for other executive 
directors. One third of any annual bonus earned will be delivered in shares and will only vest subject to continued 
employment after a three year vesting period. 
The Company exceeded the bonus plan threshold for the 2012 financial year despite stretching performance targets and  
a challenging economic environment and bonuses have been paid to executive directors in respect of 2012 performance. 
Profit growth of 8% represented 97% achievement of plan and, as a result, 43% of this portion of the annual bonus vested. 
Assessments of individual performance targets resulted in vesting of 67% to 72% of this portion. Bonuses have therefore 
been determined as follows for the executive directors:

Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The performance period for the 2010 PSP awards ended on 31 December 2012. The structure of the 2010 PSP was the 
same as outlined on page 45.
50% of the awards was based on TSR performance against selected industry peers, using the same comparator group as 
outlined on page 45. The Company ranked fifth out of 14 comparator companies and therefore 75% of this portion of the 
award vested. 
The remaining 50% of the award was subject to EPS performance and the same performance targets applied as outlined on 
page 45 for the 2013 awards. For awards made in 2010, EPS growth performance of 9.4% was achieved and therefore 88% 
of this portion of the award vested. The Committee did not apply any discretion in relation to vesting percentages in the year 
under review.
The maximum award levels, and individual awards for 2013, are provided in the table below:

Directors’ retirement provision
R I Glynn and I A Bull have received a cash supplement of 22.5% of base salary since their appointment in April 2010 and  
July 2011 respectively.
R J Ames is a member of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan (LPP). Up until cessation of employment, he continued to accrue 
benefits under the plan and also received a cash supplement of 22.5% of base salary above the LPP specific Earnings Cap 
(£137,400 in 2012/13) until he left the Company.
The information below details the pension benefits payable on retirement at age 65 under the LPP to R J Ames who was  
the only executive director member of the LPP during 2012. The figures shown, including the accrued pensions, are the  
total pension entitlements in respect of all pensionable service with the Company including any service with Ladbrokes  
prior to becoming an executive director . The transfer value increase over the year includes the effect of any increase in 
pensionable salary, completing further service, being a year closer to their normal pension retirement date and changes  
in market conditions.

The transfer value figures above have been provided by the independent actuarial advisors appointed by the Trustees of the 
LPP , calculated in accordance with the LPP’s agreed transfer value policy. The accrued pension benefit is an annual figure. 
The transfer value represents the amount that would be paid to another pension scheme if this accrued pension benefit  
were to be transferred away from the LPP . A transfer value represents a liability of the LPP but not a sum paid or due to  
the individual.  Governance 53

Matters relating to Board changes 
R J Ames resigned as a director of the Company on 1 August 2012 and remained employed with the Group until  
30 November 2012. 
The Company took legal advice to determine the most appropriate treatment with reference to his contractual obligations. 
The Committee carefully considered both the best interests of the Company and its shareholders when determining his  
exit payments.
The main features of his treatment upon cessation of employment are as follows:
 during the period to 30 November 2012 he remained in service on his existing terms and conditions and as such  
continued to be eligible for salary and benefits, plus incentive participation prorated for time and performance as 
appropriate (see below);
 under the annual bonus plan, the Committee determined that R J Ames’ 2012 bonus should be subject to time pro-ration  
to reflect the period of employment during the year and should continue to be subject to the Company and individual 
performance targets set at the beginning of 2012 (as outlined on page 51). His payment of £175,553 will be made in  
March 2013 at the same time as for all other continuing executives;
 in settlement of all claims, he is eligible for a compensation payment of £506,585 which relates to salary and benefits, 
bonus for the remaining notice period and compensation for statutory claims. Half of this payment was made in  
December 2012, and the balance paid in eight monthly instalments ending July 2013. In the event that R J Ames  
obtains alternative employment during the eight month period, the monthly instalments will be reduced by reference  
to percentage of the earnings from such alternative employment. An additional c.£10,300 was paid for associated legal 
costs and restrictive covenants;
 R J Ames’ existing share awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan were released to him following cessation of employment 
in line with the relevant treatment for redundancy under the plan rules; and
 in relation to the PSP and LGP , the Committee has determined that R J Ames should be treated as a good leaver .  
Therefore his share awards will continue to exist, and will vest to the extent that relevant performance targets are met  
at the end of the relevant performance period. The vested amount will be subject to time pro rating to reflect his period  
of employment during the performance period. For his LGP award to vest, he will have to maintain his co-investment 
shareholding as required under the plan rules. 
Long-term incentives awarded during the financial year 
Under the PSP , the maximum award as a percentage of salary is 175% for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% for other 
executive directors. 
Actual annual award levels are determined by the Committee by reference to individual performance in the year prior to 
grant. The 2012 PSP awards granted to executive directors were between 75% and 90% of maximum representing their 
strong performance during 2011. 
The PSP awards granted on 17 February 2012 are detailed below. The performance period runs from 1 January 2012 to  
31 December 2014.

The impact of the Company’s long-term performance has been reflected in the lapsing of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 PSP awards. 
The 2010 PSP awards vested at 81.5%, a consequence of improved share price performance in recent years (as shown by 
the right-hand graph above showing 3-year TSR performance) and improved EPS performance. 
This demonstrates the link between executive remuneration at Ladbrokes and the creation of long-term shareholder value.

1 Corporate information
Ladbrokes plc (the Company) is a limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly 
traded. The address of its registered office and principal place of 
business is disclosed in the corporate information section of the 
Annual Report.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and  
its subsidiaries (together , ‘the Group’) for the year ended  
31 December 201 2 were authorised for issue in accordance  
with a resolution of the directors on 21 February 201 3. 
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 5.
2 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is the Group’s functional and presentational 
currency. All values are in millions (£m) rounded to one decimal 
place except where otherwise indicated.
To assist in understanding its underlying performance, the Group 
has defined the following items of income and expense as 
exceptional in nature:
 profits or losses on disposal or impairment of non-current assets 
or businesses;
 unrealised gains and losses on derivative financial instruments; 
and 
 corporate transaction costs.
Any other non-recurring items are considered individually for 
classification as exceptional by virtue of their nature and size.
The exceptional items have been included within the appropriate 
classifications in the consolidated income statement. The Group 
previously classified the above items of income and expense, as 
well as business restructuring costs, as non-trading items.
3 Changes in accounting policies 
From 1 January 201 2 the Group adopted the amendments to  
IAS 1 2 Income T axes, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments and made a 
voluntary change in accounting policy under IAS 8 as described 
below. These did not have a material impact on the results or 
financial position of the Group.
The amendments to IAS 1 2 Income T axes provided an exception 
that the measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities should reflect the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the entity expects to recover the 
carrying amount of an asset.
The amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments increase the 
disclosure requirements for transactions involving transfers of 
financial assets.
Interest or penalties payable and receivable in relation to income 
tax are recognised as an income tax expense or credit in the 
consolidated income statement. This represents a voluntary 
change in accounting policy under IAS 8 Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, as these items  
were previously presented as finance expenses or income.  
As interest and penalties on income tax are inextricably linked to 
the underlying income tax charge or credit, the Group considers 
that their presentation within the income tax line in the 
consolidated income statement provides reliable and more 
relevant information. The retrospective application of this change 
in accounting policy had no impact on the results or financial 
position of the Group in prior years. The impact of the change in 
the current year is described in note 10.
4 Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the  
financial statements of the Group at 31 December each year .  
The underlying financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared 
for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent 
accounting policies. Control is achieved where the Company has 
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiaries are consolidated, using the purchase method of 
accounting, from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred from the Group. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities  
of a subsidiary are measured at fair value at the date of 
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
values of the separately identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. Where necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used in line with those used by the Group.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information requires the use of 
assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions. 
Use of available information and application of judgement are 
inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future 
may differ from those reported. In this regard, management 
believes that the accounting policies where judgement is 
necessarily applied are those that relate to: the measurement  
and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets; the 
measurement of pension and other post-employment benefit 
obligations; the determination of the initial fair value of betting and 
gaming transactions; the recoverable amount of trade receivables; 
income tax and the valuation of financial guarantee contracts.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects 
only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, 
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Further information about key assumptions concerning the future 
and other key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below.
Indefinite life intangible assets
The Group has determined that betting shop licences have 
indefinite lives.
The Group determines whether indefinite life intangible assets are 
impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation 
of the ‘value in use’ of the cash generating units to which the 
intangible assets are allocated. Estimating a value in use amount 
requires management to make an estimate of the expected future 
cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to choose a 
suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of 
those cash flows. Further details are given in notes 13 and 14.
Notes to the consolidated  
financial statements Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Financial statements 66
Statutory reports and financial statements
continued
Pension and other post-employment benefit obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post-
employment benefits is determined using actuarial valuations.  
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about 
discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary 
increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the 
long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to 
significant uncertainty. Further details are given in note 29.
Betting and gaming transactions
Betting and gaming transactions are measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable from customers. This is 
normally the nominal amount of the consideration but on certain 
occasions, the fair value is estimated using valuation techniques, 
taking into account the credit profile of customers in determining 
the collectability of the consideration. In addition, where there are 
indicators that any trade receivable is impaired at the balance 
sheet date, management makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount. Further details are given in note 18.
Income tax
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions.  
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for 
income taxes due to uncertainty of the amount of income tax that 
may be payable, and in respect of determining the level of the 
future taxable profits of the Group that support the recoverability 
of deferred tax assets. Further details are given in note 10.
Financial guarantee contracts
The valuation of financial guarantee contracts and related 
indemnities requires use of assumptions of the risks of default  
of the guaranteed entities and the credit profiles of the 
counterparties. Further details are given in note 24.
Investments in joint ventures 
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on 
a long-term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and 
one or more other venturers under a contractual agreement. 
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the 
Group consolidated income statement using the equity method of 
accounting. Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Group 
consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any impairment 
in value. The carrying value of investments in joint ventures 
includes acquired goodwill.
If the Group’s share of losses in the joint venture equals or exceeds 
its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made 
payments on behalf of the joint venture. 
Investments in associates
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a 
long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence 
over the financial and operational policies but does not have 
control or joint control over those policies.
The Group’s share of results of associates is included in the Group 
consolidated income statement using the equity method of 
accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the Group 
consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any impairment 
in value. The carrying value of investments in associates includes 
acquired goodwill.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at 
the date of acquisition. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations, goodwill is not amortised but reviewed annually for 
impairment and as such, is stated at cost less any provision for 
impairment of value. Any impairment is recognised immediately  
in the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently 
reversed. On acquisition, any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash 
generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. Where 
goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the 
operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of 
the operation. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and 
those acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised 
separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably 
on initial recognition. The costs relating to internally generated 
intangible assets, principally software costs, are capitalised if the 
criteria for recognition as assets are met. Other expenditure is 
charged against profit in the year in which the expenditure is 
incurred. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried 
at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. 
The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be 
either finite or indefinite. Where amortisation is charged on assets 
with finite lives, this expense is taken to the consolidated income 
statement through the ‘depreciation, amortisation and amounts 
written off non-current assets’ line item. Useful lives are reviewed 
on an annual basis. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually, either individually, or at the cash generating 
unit level. 
A summary of the policies applied to the Group’s intangible assets 
is as follows:

Property, plant and equipment
Land is stated at cost less any impairment in value. Buildings, plant 
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated using the 
straight line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its 
residual value over its useful economic life as follows:
Buildings – 50 years or estimated useful life of the building,  
or lease, whichever is less, to estimated residual value. 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – four to 10 years as considered 
appropriate to write down cost to estimated residual value.
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment annually as to whether there are events or changes  
in circumstances indicating that the carrying values may not  
be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the 
carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount,  
the assets or cash generating units are written down to their 
recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of plant and equipment is the greater  
of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in the ‘depreciation and amounts written off non-
current assets’ line item.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal, with any gain or loss arising (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
item) included in the consolidated income statement in the year 
of disposal. 
Leases
Leases that transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and 
benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item are capitalised 
at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or ,  
if lower , at the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges 
and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant  
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.  
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the benefits and 
risks of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments, other than contingent rentals, are 
recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement 
on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Recoverable amount of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any 
indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the 
recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for 
an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets  
or groups of assets.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash at bank and in hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than 
three months, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party  
to the contracts that give rise to them.
The Group classifies financial assets at inception as either loans 
and receivables or as financial assets at fair value through profit  
or loss.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. On initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured 
at fair value net of transaction costs. Subsequently, the fair values 
are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
method, less any allowance for impairment.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss comprise 
derivative financial instruments. Financial assets through  
profit or loss are measured initially at fair value with transaction 
costs taken directly to the consolidated income statement. 
Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured, and gains and 
losses from changes therein are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
T rade receivables are generally accounted for at amortised cost. 
The Group reviews indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis 
and where such indicators exist, the Group makes an estimate of 
the asset’s recoverable amount.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise interest bearing loans and 
borrowings, derivative financial instruments, ante post bets and 
guarantees given to third parties. On initial recognition, financial 
liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs where 
they are not categorised as financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or  
loss include derivative financial instruments, ante-post bets  
and guarantees.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured 
initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly to the 
consolidated income statement. Subsequently, the fair values are 
remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Financial statements 68
Statutory reports and financial statements
continued
All interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised 
at fair value net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.  
After initial recognition, fixed rate interest bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method.
The Group has provided financial guarantees to third parties  
in respect of lease obligations of certain of the Group’s  
former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division.  
Financial guarantee contracts are classified as financial  
liabilities and are measured at fair value by estimating the 
probability of the guarantees being called upon and the  
related cash outflows from the Group.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive  
cash flows from the assets has expired or when the Group has 
transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the 
financial assets or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party, and either:
 substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or
 substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been retained 
nor transferred but control is not retained.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross 
currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps, 
to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign 
currency fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are 
recognised initially and subsequently at fair value. The gains  
or losses on remeasurement are taken to the consolidated  
income statement. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as assets where 
their fair value is positive, or as liabilities where their fair value is 
negative. Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different 
transactions are only offset if the transactions are with the same 
counterparty, a legal right of offset exists and the parties intend  
to settle the cash flows on a net basis. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet 
date and are discounted to present value where the effect is 
material using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific  
to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a 
finance expense.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation and functional currency of Ladbrokes plc and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries is pounds sterling (£). 
T ransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling 
at the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the foreign currency rate of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date. 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the 
consolidated income statement with the exception of differences 
on foreign currency borrowings that provide a post-tax hedge 
against a net investment in a foreign entity. These are taken 
directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which 
time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
T ax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on 
those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
when the fair value was determined.
The main functional currency of overseas subsidiaries is the Euro. 
At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas 
subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the year . The post-tax 
exchange differences arising on the retranslation, since the date of 
transition to IFRSs, are taken directly to a separate component of 
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative 
amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign 
entity is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Income tax 
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all 
temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 
financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences:
 except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor the tax profit; and
 associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences and carry forward of unused tax assets and unused 
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences and 
carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can  
be utilised: 
 except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither  
the accounting profit nor the tax profit; and

 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, deferred tax assets 
are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all 
or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance  
sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Interest or penalties payable and receivable in relation to income 
tax are recognised as an income tax expense or credit in the 
consolidated income statement. The impact of the change in the 
current year is described in note 10. 
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is 
recognised in equity and not in the consolidated income statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount 
of sales tax except:
 where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which 
case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition 
of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
 receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales 
tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The defined benefit pension fund holds assets separately from  
the Group. The pension cost relating to this fund is assessed in 
accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries 
using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which  
they arise.
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that 
the benefits have already vested and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight line basis over the average period until the benefits vest. 
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the fair value of scheme assets less the value of the 
defined benefit obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past 
service cost.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are 
charged to the consolidated income statement in the period to 
which the contributions relate.
4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
For defined benefit schemes, management makes annual 
estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future 
changes in salaries, employee turnover , inflation rates and life 
expectancy. In making these estimates and assumptions, 
management considers advice provided by external advisers, such 
as actuaries. Where actual experience differs to these estimates, 
actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. Refer 
to note 29 for details of the values of assets and obligations and 
key assumptions used.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
T reasury shares
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own 
equity instruments.
ESOP trusts
Where the Group holds its own equity shares through ESOP trusts 
these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any consideration 
paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown 
in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and no 
gain or loss is recognised within the consolidated income 
statement or the statement of comprehensive income on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of these shares.
Dividends
Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid  
at the year end are not recognised in the financial statements  
until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable from customers for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT 
and other sales-related taxes.
For licensed betting offices, on course betting, Core Telephone 
Betting, mobile betting, High Rollers, Digital businesses (including 
sportsbook, casino, games, other number bets), revenue 
represents gains and losses, being the amounts staked and fees 
received, less total payouts and the fair value of reward points 
issued from betting activity in the period. Open betting positions 
are carried at fair market value and gains and losses arising on 
these positions are recognised in revenue.
When a bet is placed and reward points are issued under the Odds 
On loyalty scheme, the fair value of the reward points is deferred 
and recorded as a liability. The deferred revenue is recognised 
when the reward points are used or when they expire.
Revenue from the online poker business reflects the net income 
(rake) earned from poker games completed by the period end.
In the case of the greyhound stadia, revenue represents income 
arising from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, 
including sales of refreshments. Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Finance expense and income 
Finance expense and income arising on interest bearing financial 
instruments carried at amortised cost are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate 
method. Finance expense includes the amortisation of fees that 
are an integral part of the effective finance cost of a financial 
instrument, including issue costs, and the amortisation of any 
other differences between the amount initially recognised and the 
redemption price.
Net gains and losses in respect of mark-to-market adjustments 
on financial instruments carried at fair value, foreign exchange 
adjustments and net gains and losses on financial guarantees  
are included in exceptional items in the consolidated  
income statement.
Share-based payment transactions 
Certain employees (including directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for 
shares or rights over shares (equity settled transactions).
The cost of equity settled transactions is measured by reference  
to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair 
value is determined using a binomial model, further details of 
which are given in note 30. In valuing equity settled transactions, 
no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than 
conditions linked to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc 
(market conditions).
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which 
the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting 
date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number 
of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Group at that 
date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity 
instruments, will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether  
or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional 
share dilution in the computation of earnings per share as shown 
in note 1 2.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee 
share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to 
executives and senior employees. Shares in the Group held by  
the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and 
presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.  
Refer to consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Future accounting developments
The following new standards, interpretations and amendments 
have been issued but were not effective for the financial year 
beginning 1 January 201 2 and have not been early adopted:
On 1 2 May 201 1, the IASB issued IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements, IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 1 2 Disclosure of 
Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 
and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures which 
are all effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2014.
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all 
entities including special purpose entities. The changes  
introduced by IFRS 10 will require management to exercise 
significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, 
and therefore, are required to be consolidated by a parent, 
compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27 . 
IFRS 1 1 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and  
removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities  
using proportionate consolidation. Instead entities that meet the 
definition of a joint venture, based on rights to net assets only, 
must be accounted for using the equity method.
IFRS 1 2 includes all of the disclosures required by IFRS 10, IAS 27 , 
IAS 28 and IFRS 1 1 in one standard. These disclosures relate to an 
entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates 
and structured entities. A number of new disclosures are also 
required including how the entity determines that it controls 
another entity where judgement is used.
As a consequence of the IASB consolidations project, IAS 27  
is renamed Separate Financial Statements and is limited to 
accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities, and 
associates in separate financial statements. IAS 28 has been 
renamed Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, and 
describes the application of the equity method to investments  
in joint ventures in addition to associates.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. It establishes a single source 
of guidance for fair value measurements. The standard defines fair 
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and 
requires disclosures about fair value measurements. In general, 
the disclosure requirements in IFRS 13 are more extensive than 
those required in the current standards.
The revision of IAS 19 Employee Benefits is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The most significant 
change to the Group relates to the net interest on the pension 
asset being based on a single discount rate rather than the 
expected asset return. The impact on the Group of applying this 
amendment retrospectively for the year is an expected increase  
in actuarial charge of £0.4m.
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 
are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 201 2 
and require the Group to separate items of other comprehensive 
income into two distinct categories: items that will not be 
reclassified subsequently to the income statement; and items that 
will be reclassified subsequently to the income statement when 
specific conditions are met. Income tax on items of other 
comprehensive income is required to be allocated on the  
same basis.

Financial statements
The amendment of IFRS 7 is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 201 3. The most significant change relates to 
offsetting financial assets and liabilities. The amendments require 
disclosure about rights of set-off and related arrangements and 
are required for all recognised financial instruments that are set 
off in accordance with IAS 32. The disclosures also apply to 
recognised financial instruments that are subject to an 
enforceable master netting arrangement irrespective of whether 
they are set off in accordance with IAS 32.
IAS 32 has been amended and is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The amendments clarify that 
rights of set-off must not only be legally enforceable in the normal 
course of business, but must also be enforceable in the event of 
default, bankruptcy or insolvency. The amendments also clarify 
that rights of set-off must not be contingent on a future event.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was reissued in October 2010.  
The Group is required to adopt this standard for the year ended  
31 December 201 5. IFRS 9 addresses the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. The key requirements  
of IFRS 9 are that at initial recognition, all financial instruments are 
measured at fair value with different requirements for subsequent 
measurement for debt and equity instruments. The standard 
provides relief from the requirement to restate comparative 
financial statements for the effect of applying IFRS 9.
The International Accounting Standards Board’s Annual 
Improvements Project (published in May 201 2) made minor 
amendments to a number of standards, primarily with a view  
to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.  
The amendments to these standards are effective from  
1 January 201 3.
The Group has decided not to early adopt the above standards,  
and is currently assessing their impact on its financial statements.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRICs in issue but not yet effective 
that are expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 5 Segment information
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors to make  
strategic decisions.
The performance of the Group’s continuing business is assessed and measured according to the nature of the services provided.  
IFRS 8 requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used by the Board for assessing performance and 
allocating resources, and the Group’s operating segments are aggregated into the five reportable segments detailed below:
 UK Retail: comprises betting activities in the shop estate in Great Britain.
 European Retail: comprises all activities connected with the Ireland (Northern and Republic of), Belgium and Spain shop estates.
 Digital: comprises betting and gaming activities from online and mobile operations.
 Core Telephone Betting: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone, excluding High Rollers.
 High Rollers: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone from High Rollers.
Discontinued operations in 201 1 comprise Hotels. 
The Board continues to assess the performance of operating segments based on a measure of net revenue, profit before tax and net 
finance expense. This measurement basis excludes the effect of exceptional income and expenditure from the operating segments.
T ransfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s-length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

  The £3.8 million loss on closure of shops is made up of a £1.8 million loss on closure of UK Retail shops (201 1: £1.2 million) and a £2.0 million loss on closure of 
European Retail shops (201 1: £0.7 million). These include a loss on disposal of intangible assets of £1.8 million (201 1: £0.3 million), a loss on disposal of property, 
plant and equipment of £0.5 million (201 1: £0.6 million) and cost accruals of £1.5 million (201 1: £1.0 million).

 Spain issued online gaming licences for all products (except slots) effective from 1 June 2012. The Spanish tax authority has required that online operators with 
customers in Spain pay taxes retrospectively under two historic laws that previously were not applied to offshore online gaming. Having completed a 
self-assessment in accordance with the Spanish tax authority’s requirements, the Group has incurred costs of £2.2 million (including surcharges, interest and 
related professional fees) in relation to these retrospective taxes. These costs have been recorded in the Digital segment.

  In 201 1, following the termination of the Group’s interest rate swaps in 2010, the remaining £0.5 million of losses deferred in equity were recycled to the income 
statement as a non-trading finance expense to match the interest payments on the underlying borrowings.

In addition to salary, employees may qualify for various benefit schemes operated by the Group. Eligibility for benefits is normally 
determined primarily according to an employee’s length of service and level of responsibility. The amounts of some benefits are 
proportionate to individual salary.
Benefits may include paid leave for holidays, maternity and illness, as well as insured benefits. The latter can cover private healthcare for 
the employee and their immediate family, long-term disability, personal accident and death in service cover . Company cars, including fuel 
benefits, are provided predominantly to meet job requirements but also to certain executives.
The principal benefit schemes are:
(i) Pensions
 (a) Ladbrokes Group Stakeholder Pension Plan
   New employees in the UK are offered membership of Ladbrokes Group Stakeholder Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension 
scheme. Subject to meeting certain eligibility and employment grade criteria, the Group matches employees’ contributions up to a 
maximum of 1 5% of base salary.
 (b)  Ladbrokes Pension Plan (LPP)
   This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007 . Members contribute on average six per cent of pensionable salary per 
annum. Benefit generally accrues to provide a target pension of two thirds (for joiners after June 2002: half) of final pensionable 
salary for an employee attaining age 65 with at least 40 years’ membership. A spouse’s pension is payable following death.
   LPP – Executive Section
   Members contribute on average seven per cent of pensionable salary per annum. Benefit accrues to provide a target pension  
from all sources of two thirds of final pensionable salary for an executive attaining age 60 with at least 20 years’ membership  
(for joiners after June 2002, employees attaining age 65 with at least 26.7 years’ service). A spouse’s and children’s pensions are 
payable following death.
   Senior executives subject to the Earnings Cap:
   Following the A-Day pensions review, the pre-A-Day Revenue limits regime has been maintained as the framework for the LPP , 
including a LPP-specific Earnings Cap. Executive directors and senior executives have a choice between:
  (i)  membership of the Executive Section of the LPP plus a cash supplement of up to 22.5% (30% prior to 1 January 201 1 ) of base 
salary above the Earnings Cap; or
  (ii) a cash supplement of up to 22.5% (30% prior to 1 January 201 1 ) of base salary in lieu of membership of the LPP .
(ii)  Share-based payments 
Details of employee share schemes operated by the Group are shown in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 39 to 58 that 
forms part of the Annual Report 201 2.
  Details of options granted in 201 2 and outstanding at 31 December 201 2 are shown in note 30. Details of directors’ remuneration and 
the policies adopted in determining it can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 39 to 58.

 The Group has now reached a settlement with HMRC on all outstanding items in respect of tax years through to 31 December 2007 , resulting in an effective tax 
charge, excluding exceptional items, of 5.2%. Included within adjustments in respect of prior periods is a tax credit of £21.7 million and associated interest credit 
of £8.1 million, in respect of the settlement.
  In the year ended 31 December 201 1, the Group made progress in the resolution of historic tax matters and as a result reduced the level of the tax creditor 
required. The Group also reassessed the availability of suitable profits of its subsidiaries against which agreed losses can be offset in the foreseeable future 
and reduced the level of deferred tax asset recognised. The impact of these was a net £10.9 million reduction in the income tax charge for the year.

The Group has further tax losses at 31 December 201 2 of £106.9 million (201 1: £90.4 million) that are available indefinitely for offset 
against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of 
these losses as there is insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of temporary 
differences may be deducted. There are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associated undertakings and joint ventures.
The Chancellor , in the Autumn Statement on 5 December 201 2, announced a further 1 % reduction in the main rate of corporation tax, 
with effect from 1 April 2014. This is in addition to the 2% reduction announced in the Budget on 21 March 201 2. The standard rate of 
Corporation T ax was reduced from 26% to 24% from 1 April 201 2, and there will be progressive annual reductions to 23% and 21 % with 
effect from 1 April 2013 and April 2014, respectively.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 23%. The reduction to 
23%, effective 1 April 2013, was substantively enacted on 3 July 201 2. Whilst detailed calculations have not been prepared at this stage, it 
is estimated that the impact of the remaining annual corporation tax rate reductions would be to reduce the value of the group’s deferred 
tax liabilities at the balance sheet date by approximately £6.5 million, and to reduce the value of the Group’s deferred tax assets at the 
balance sheet date by approximately £2. 1 million.

Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company 
of £190.3 million (201 1: £1 18.2 million) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year of 908.3 million (201 1 :

(939.6 million including treasury shares).
At 31 December 201 2, 2.7 million (201 1: 6.2 million) shares were deemed anti-dilutive for the purpose of calculating adjusted earnings  
per share.
The calculation of adjusted earnings per share before exceptional items is included as it provides a better understanding of the

Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of business combinations including the deferred tax liability 
arising on statutory licence acquisitions.
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences. The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are 
considered to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons:
 Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well-established markets;
 there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services;
 existing law acts to restrict entry; and
 Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost.
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software.
The customer relationships intangible asset relates to the Group’s acquisition of its former partner in the Nordic region.

Notes to the consolidated

continued 14 Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment at each reporting date by comparing the carrying 
amounts of these assets with their recoverable amounts (being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use).
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill 
allocated to that group would be regarded as not impaired. The carrying amounts of goodwill by segment are as follows:
 
2012 
£m
2011 
£m
Goodwill
UK Retail 35.4 35.4
European Retail 12.7 13.0
Digital 1.7 –
49.8 48.4
No impairments were identified in both years.
Licences
Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets. Each CGU 
represents the lowest level within the Group at which the licences are monitored for internal management purposes which in the 
majority of instances is an individual shop. The carrying value of licences at 31 December 201 2 was £488.5 million (201 1: £487 .9 million) 
allocated as £324. 1 million to UK Retail (201 1 : £323.4 million) and £164.4 million to European Retail (201 1: £164.5 million).
Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These are based on budgets approved by 
management for the next three years extrapolated thereafter using a 2.5% growth rate (201 1: 2.5%). This rate does not exceed the 
average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The key assumptions taken into account by management are the amounts staked, the gross win margin and the discount rate applied. 
The estimated amounts staked and gross win margin are based upon historic experience, management’s best estimate of future trends 
and performance taking account of industry sources. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections for CGUs in UK Retail is 
1 1.4% (201 1: 1 1.2%) and in European Retail is between 10.3% and 1 1.4% (201 1: between 10.0% and 1 1.5%).
The recoverable amounts of certain individual European Retail CGUs were below their carrying amounts at 31 December 201 1  
and accordingly an impairment loss of £10.2 million was recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 
31 December 201 1, within the ‘Depreciation and amounts written off non-current assets’ line, as an exceptional item.
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensitive to changes in cash flows or discount rate. Change in the cash flow projections or 
the discount rate would trigger a further impairment loss. For example, an increase of 0.5% in the pre-tax discount rate would have 
resulted in an impairment loss of approximately £1.2 million (201 1: £0.7 million) for UK Retail and £4.8 million (201 1: £3. 1 million) for 
European Retail, or a reduction in projected cash flows of 5% would have resulted in an impairment loss of approximately £0.9 million 
(201 1: £0.5 million) for UK Retail and £3.4 million (201 1: £2.4 million) for European Retail.

continued 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, 
foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Group’s treasury exposures to reduce 
risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board.
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, and cash 
and short-term deposits, together with certain derivative financial instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to 
raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables 
and accruals that arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps.  
The purpose of these transactions is to assist in the management of the Group’s financial risk and to generate the desired effective 
currency and interest rate profile. At 31 December 201 1, the Group had an interest rate swap with a nominal value of £131.3 million and  
a fair value of £0. 1 million. This swap was settled on 1 1 July 201 2, and at 31 December 201 2 the Group had no significant derivatives.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken  
other than betting and gaming transactions. The Group’s exposure to ante post betting and gaming transactions is not significant.
On 1 1 July 201 2, the Group repaid the remaining balance on the 7 . 1 25% bond of £131.4 million using existing facilities. The Group has  
a £225 million 7 .625% sterling bond due in 201 7 .
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and 
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The Group also monitors the market price risk arising 
from all financial instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Group’s policy for the year ended 31 December 201 2 was to maintain a minimum of 25% (201 1: 25%) of total borrowings at fixed 
interest rates to reduce its sensitivity to movements in variable short-term interest rates. At 31 December 201 2, £222.4 million or 54.8% 
(201 1 : £222.3 million or 46.3%, after taking account of interest rate swaps) of the Group’s gross borrowings were at fixed rates.
Interest on financial instruments at floating rates is re-priced at intervals of less than six months. Interest on financial instruments at 
fixed rates is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate sensitivity
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when 
this movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
Profit before tax Equity

£m
2011 
£m
100 basis points increase (0.9) (1.7) – –
200 basis points increase (2.0) (3.5) – –
The sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities, 
subject to interest at floating rates, held by the Group at the year end. Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not 
have a material impact on income and equity for the year . As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented.
Foreign currency risk
Other than the translation of foreign currency subsidiaries, there is no significant foreign currency exposure.
The Group had no foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 201 2 (201 1: £nil).
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties  
and customers.
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, 
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior 
management on an individual basis.
The Group’s High Rollers division consists of individuals who place sizeable stakes. The Group manages this activity and the associated 
risk exposure by utilising senior management expertise to manage the levels of stakes placed. Of the £3.3 million (201 1: £4.5 million) 
trade receivables balance, £2.8 million (201 1 : £4.0 million) relates to the Group’s Core Telephone Betting and High Rollers divisions.

Financial statements 87
Financial statements 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and a loan to a 
joint venture, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying 
amount of these instruments. Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents is managed by restricting those transactions to banks 
that have a defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group. This risk is partly 
mitigated by the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees.  
For further detail of these guarantees refer to note 24.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range  
of maturities. The Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term and long-term committed borrowing 
facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements. At 31 December 201 2, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities  
of £348.5 million (201 1 : £405.4 million). Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 3.9 years (201 1: 4.9 years).
The total gross contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, including interest payments, fall due as follows. Cash flows  
in respect of financial guarantee contracts reflect the probability weighted cash flows. The maximum exposure is described in note 24.

The total gross contractual undiscounted cash inflows in relation to interest rate swaps used to hedge the risks associated with interest 
bearing loans and borrowings are £nil (201 1 : £0.7 million) within one year .
Cash flow hedges
In the prior year , £0.5 million of losses, which had been deferred in equity, were reclassified to the consolidated income statement as an 
exceptional finance expense. The Group no longer has any cash flow hedges. 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
The Group previously used interest rate swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements by swapping borrowings 
from fixed to floating rates in accordance with the policy of the Group. At 31 December 201 2, the Group had no interest rate swaps.  
At 31 December 201 1, the Group had contracts for interest rate swaps with nominal values of £131.0 million and a fair value of  
£0. 1 million. These swaps were not designated as fair value hedges under IAS 39 but were economic hedges of the Group’s borrowings.
Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a credit rating that enables the Group to raise 
funds at an economic interest rate and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder 
value. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue  
new shares.
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio. The target range is less than 2.0 (201 1: less than 3.0) times net debt to 
EBITDA ratio. The ratio at 31 December 201 2 was 1.3 (1.5 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers) and at 31 December 201 1 was 
1.9 (1.9 adjusted to remove loss from High Rollers).

Fair value of financial instruments
Assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value. There were no derivatives in a hedging 
relationship in both years.
The fair value of cash at bank and in hand approximates to book value due to its short-term maturity. The fair value of the £225 million 
7 .625% bond at 31 December 201 2 was £251.9 million (201 1 : £225.8 million). The amortised cost of interest bearing loans and borrowings, 
with the exception of the £225 million 7 .625% bond, and the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximates to fair value.  
The fair value of the £250 million 7 . 1 25% bond at 31 December 201 1, of which £131.3 million remained outstanding, was £133.7 million. 
This was repaid on 1 1 July 201 2.

No financial instruments are classified as level 1, for which fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  
or liabilities.
The Group classifies all derivatives as level 2 financial instruments, as their fair value is determined based on techniques for which all 
significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Included in trade and other payables are £5.2 million of ante post liabilities (201 1: £8.6 million). Other current financial liabilities are 
deferred revenues associated with the fair value of reward points issued; both are classified as level 3 financial instruments as their fair 
value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data. Changes in the fair value of 
these instruments are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
Financial guarantee contracts, included within other non-current financial liabilities, are classified as level 3 financial instruments, as 
their fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data. Further information 
about financial guarantee contracts, including sensitivities, and a reconciliation of changes in fair value in the year , is included below.
Financial guarantee contracts
The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. 
The Group received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Group 
may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 201 7 and 2042 and the lease liabilities 
comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is £827 .9 million (201 1: £860.6 
million), with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is £475.5 million (201 1 : 
£490.7 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £352.4 million (201 1: £369.9 million) in relation to the 
minimum contractual based element. The undiscounted maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the 
non-cancellable agreements into which the Group has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 201 2 is £351.6 million (201 1: £357 . 1 million). Included in the net present 
value of the maximum exposure is £182. 1 million (201 1: £183.3 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 
£169.5 million (201 1 : £1 73.8 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations. 
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities 
payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being 
identified.
At 31 December 201 2 the Group has recognised a financial liability of £7 .7 million (201 1: £7 .7 million) in respect of these guarantees. 
No asset has been recognised in respect of the indemnity in both years.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate. A rate of 2.2% has been used at 31 December 201 2 (201 1: 2.2%).  
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.3 million.

Plan, the Restricted Share Plan and the 2010 Share Award Plan (together ‘the Plans’) (refer to note 30 for further details of the Plans and 
the various performance conditions). The LSOT may also be used in connection with the Company’s other share-based plans, including 
the 1978 Share Option Scheme and the International Share Option Scheme. The trustee of the LSOT, Computershare T rustees (CI) 
Limited, subscribes for the Company’s shares or purchases them in the open market, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the 
anticipated commitments of the Group, with financing provided by the Company.
The Ladbrokes Share Incentive Plan (‘LSIP’) is currently used in connection with the Company’s OWN share plan (‘the OWN plan’) and 
Freeshare share plan (‘Freeshare’) (refer to note 30 for further details). The trustee of the LSIP , Computershare T rustees Limited, 
purchases the Company’s shares in the open market, as required, using: (i) deductions made from the salaries of participants in the OWN 
plan; and (ii) dividends paid on the shares held by the LSIP . Under the OWN plan, to match those shares acquired using participants’ 
salary deductions, one additional share is allotted by the Company to the LSIP for every two held per employee.
All expenses of the LSOT and LSIP are settled directly by the Company and charged in the financial statements as incurred. 
The following table shows the number of shares held in trust that have not yet vested unconditionally and the associated reduction in 
shareholders’ funds.

Defined contribution schemes
The total cost charged to the consolidated income statement of £1.4 million (201 1: £1.0 million) represents contributions payable to these 
schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s only significant defined benefit retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension plan for UK 
employees. This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007 . Assets are held separately from those of the Group. Although the 
Group is responsible for the operation of this arrangement, professional advisers are appointed to assist the trustees in running it.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 June 2010.
The latest actuarial valuation was updated to 31 December 201 2 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19 
Employee Benefits. The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit 
credit method, as required by IAS 19.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:

The post-retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard SAPS mortality table with the CMI 2009 projections, 
which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience. The assumption used implies that the 
expected future lifetime of members aged 65 in 201 2 is 86.7 years for males and 88.4 years for females. For members with large 
pensions a longer lifetime is assumed (90.0 for males and 90.4 for females). These are the same mortality assumptions as adopted for 
31 December 201 1.
Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income 
statement in respect of the plan. For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact for 
the year ended 31 December 201 2, excluding the impact on the associated deferred tax items:

  This ignores the potential positive impact that a general fall in bond yields may have on the value  
of the bond assets held by the plan.

continued 30 Share-based payments
The Company has the following share-based payment plans, all of which are settled by equity: the Restricted Share Plan; the Deferred 
Bonus Plan; the Performance Share Plan; the Ladbrokes Growth Plan; the 2010 Share Award Plan; the International Share Option 
Scheme; the 1978 Share Option Scheme; Sharesave; the OWN Plan; and Freeshare. The plans and the various performance conditions 
are discussed in more detail below. 
(i) Restricted Share Plan
Awards made under the Restricted Share Plan will vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. 
(ii) Deferred Bonus Plan
For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest after three years. For other employees, 
one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest after two years.
(iii) Performance Share Plan 
An award under the Performance Share Plan consists of a conditional allocation of shares that will vest, subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions, at the end of the three year performance period. The awards have two separate performance conditions; half  
of the award vests based on TSR and half of the award vests based on EPS growth.
(iv) Ladbrokes Growth Plan
Awards are subject to share price growth performance conditions. Any share price target must be attained throughout a period of 30 
consecutive dealing days and performance is assessed over a five year period. Up to one third of the award may vest at the end of year 
three if the performance targets have been achieved at that time. A further third may vest at the end of year four if the targets have been 
met at that time. The remainder of the award may vest at the end of year five, subject to the achievement of the performance targets. 
(v) 2010 Share Award Plan 
An award under the 2010 Share Award Plan consists of a one-off compensatory share award to the Chief Executive in the form of a nil 
cost option. The award is not subject to performance conditions and will vest after three years. 
(vi) International Share Option Scheme and the 1 978 Share Option Scheme
The share options granted are all market value options with a three year vesting period. Vested options lapse if they have not been 
exercised within ten years of the date of grant. All options have an EPS growth based performance condition. Options have not been 
granted since 2009 and there is no present intention to grant options in the future.
(vii) 1 983 Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘Sharesave’) 
Under Sharesave, options are granted at a 20% discount to market value. The scheme operates with a savings period of either three  
or five years, at the end of which the option may be exercised.
(viii) OWN Plan 
Under the OWN Plan, employees can contribute up to £75 per month to acquire shares. For every two shares purchased, the Group 
provides a match of one additional share. 
(ix) Freeshare 
Under Freeshare, an award of up to £250 in value was made to participating employees on reaching one year’s service. Freeshares have 
not been awarded since 2010 and there is no present intention to make awards in the future. 
For a more detailed description of each of the above plans, refer to the Directors’ remuneration report.

198.3 pence (31 December 201 1: 130.0 pence). The total value of these shares is £7 .8 million (201 1: £14.6 million).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £1.67 (201 1: £1.44).  
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 36.0 pence (201 1 : 4 1.0 pence). The weighted average remaining 
contractual life for the share options outstanding at 31 December 201 2 is between one and three years (201 1: between three and seven

At 31 December 201 2, there were 3,864,439 options outstanding with an exercise price between £1. 10 and £2.00, 1,023,36 1 options

Expected life (years) 3.94 3.94
Risk free rate (%) 0.60 2.2
Expected dividends (%) 4.6 4.6
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years.  
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses before tax of £9.2 million (201 1: £6.6 million) relating to equity settled share-based

Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee
The Group has a number of lease agreements that, pursuant to their economic substance, qualify as non-cancellable operating lease 
agreements. These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings. The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be 
summarised as follows:
Lease terms
Shop leases are typically agreed on five year exit cycles (either expiry or break), with a maximum term length of 1 5 years. Some leases 
are shorter in duration or with earlier exits, to reflect our assessment of risk..
Determination of rent payments
Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement.
T erms of renewal
The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options 
have been agreed upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor .
Restrictions
There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group, concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing 
lease arrangements.

In September 201 2, the UK government’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced a change to UK legislation with 
respect to the requirement for a UK company to be subject to annual audit. An additional audit exemption has been introduced, such that 
for a subsidiary of a parent established in a European Economic Area state, that subsidiary can be exempt from annual audit if certain 
conditions are met. The principal conditions are the requirement for the subsidiary’s shareholders to agree to the exemption and a 
guarantee to be issued to the subsidiary by the parent undertaking, guaranteeing all of the subsidiary’s outstanding liabilities at the year 
end, until they are satisfied in full.
The Group will be exempting the following companies from an audit in 201 2 under section 479A of the Companies Act 2006, all of which

T erms and conditions of transactions with related parties
Sales to and purchases from related parties are made at normal market prices and in the ordinary course of business. Outstanding 
balances at 31 December 201 2 are unsecured and settlement occurs in cash. For the year ended 31 December 201 2, the Group has not 
raised any provision (201 1 : £nil) for doubtful debts relating to amounts owed by related parties as the payment history has been good. 
This assessment is undertaken each financial year through examining the financial position of the related party and the market in which 
the related party operates.
Compensation of key management personnel of the Group
The remuneration of key management personnel is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 Related 
Party Disclosures. Key management personnel comprise executive directors, non-executive directors and members of the Executive 
Committee. Further information about the remuneration of individual directors, which totalled £5.0 million (201 1: £4.2 million), is provided 
in the audited part of the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 39 to 58.

33 Events after the balance sheet date
On 24 January 201 3, the Group agreed to acquire 1 00% of the issued share capital of Global Betting Exchange Alderney Limited, a company 
registered in Alderney which operates the Betdaq exchange business, for an initial consideration of €30.0 million (£25.6 million: 50% in 
cash and 50% in the Company’s shares). The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. The transaction 
also includes the payment of contingent consideration, linked to the performance of the business over a four year period and capped at 
€535.0 million. Management’s current expectation is that the contingent consideration is likely to be significantly less than this. The Group 
is in the process of finalising the fair value of the consideration, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and expect to provide the full 
disclosures required under IFRS 3 Business Combinations with the interim results for the six months ending 30 June 2013.
In connection with the acquisition described above, on 24 January 2013 the Group also agreed to acquire 10% of the issued share capital 
of TBH Guernsey Limited, a company registered in Guernsey, for cash consideration of €4.0 million (£3.2 million) with a call option to 
acquire the remaining shares after four years at a discount to the fair value at that point. The transaction also includes a put option to 
recover the purchase consideration of €4 million in full. Management is in the process of ascertaining the fair value of the consideration 
(including the call option) as well as other contractual terms. This will determine the classification and accounting for the 10% investment. 
Management expects to provide the required disclosures with the interim results for the six months ending 30 June 2013.

Notes to the consolidated  
financial statements
continued The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year . Under that law the directors 
have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under Company law 
the directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 state whether the applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained by the financial statements;
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue 
in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
T ransparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
pages 28 and 29 of this Annual Report, confirm that, to the best 
of each person’s knowledge and belief:
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
 the directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Financial statements We have audited the Group financial statements of Ladbrokes plc 
for the year ended 31 December 201 2 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet,  
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 33.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to  
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or  
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 103, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion, the Group financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as  
at 31 December 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Group financial statements; and
 the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement  
set out on pages 34 to 35 with respect to internal control and  
risk management systems in relation to financial reporting 
processes and about share capital structures is consistent  
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by 
the Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 38, in relation to going 
concern; and
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial 
statements of Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 201 2 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that 
is described as having been audited.

Statutory reports and financial statements
continued 1 Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention except as otherwise stated. They have been drawn 
up to comply with applicable UK accounting standards. The parent 
Company profit for the year was £562. 1 million (201 1: £1 2.9 million).
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from 
preparing a cash flow statement under the provisions of FRS 1 
(revised 1996) Cash flow statements. The Ladbrokes plc 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
201 2 contain a consolidated statement of cash flows.
2 Change in accounting policies
The amendment to FRS 29 Disclosures – T ransfers of Financial 
Assets was adopted by the Company in the year . Adoption had  
no effect on the results or financial position of the Company or  
its disclosures.
The Financial Reporting Council recently issued changes to the  
UK financial reporting framework, which will result in companies 
reporting either under the principles of EU-adopted IFRS or a  
new set of UK financial reporting standards. In certain cases 
companies will be able to report reduced disclosures. 
This new financial reporting framework is effective for the  
year ending 31 December 201 5, and is required to be applied 
retrospectively. The Company has taken the decision not to adopt 
the new requirements for the year ended 31 December 201 2.
3 Summary of significant accounting policies
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision 
for impairment.
The Company assesses these investments for impairment 
wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any 
such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an 
estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is 
less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered 
to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.  
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and 
loss account.
An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the 
Company has control over its operating and financial policies.
An undertaking is regarded as an associate if the Company holds a 
participating interest and has significant influence, but not control, 
over its operating and financial policies.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes 
party to the contracts that give rise to them.
The Company classifies financial assets at inception as either 
financial assets at fair value or loans and receivables. On initial 
recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value. 
Financial assets at fair value comprise guarantees provided to  
the Company. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
are measured initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken 
directly to the profit and loss account. Subsequently, the fair values 
are remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial guarantees provided to the Company are classified as 
financial assets and are measured at fair value by estimating the 
probability of the guarantees being called upon and the related 
cash inflows to the Company.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise guarantees given to third parties.  
On initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at fair value 
plus transaction costs where they are not categorised as financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss are measured initially at fair value, 
with transaction costs taken directly to the profit and loss account. 
Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured and gains and 
losses from changes therein are recognised in the profit and  
loss account.
Financial guarantee contracts
The Company has provided financial guarantees to third parties  
in respect of lease obligations of certain of the Company’s former 
subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. 
Financial guarantee contracts are classified as financial liabilities 
and are measured at fair value by estimating the probability of the 
guarantees being called upon and the related cash outflows from 
the Company.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash 
flows from the assets has expired or when the Company has 
transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the 
financial assets or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party, and either:
 substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or
 substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been 
retained nor transferred but control is not retained.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or liability, at appropriate 
rates, in respect of transactions and events recognised in the 
financial statements of the current and previous periods that give 
the entity a right to pay less, or an obligation to pay more, tax in 
future periods. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the 
extent it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from 
which they can be recovered.
No provision is made for any taxation on capital gains that would 
arise from the future disposal of any fixed assets shown in the 
financial statements at valuation, except to the extent that at the 
balance sheet date there is a binding sale agreement.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation and functional currency of the Company and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries, is pounds sterling (£). 
T ransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling 
at the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated into pounds sterling at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date (the closing rate).

Financial statements 107
Financial statements
Notes to the Company  
financial statements 3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency 
borrowings that provide a post-tax hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal 
of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the profit and loss account. T ax charges and credits attributable to exchange 
differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate  
at the date when the fair value was determined.
Pensions
The Company is the principal employer of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, a funded defined benefit group plan. The pension cost relating  
to the plan is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Any actuarial gains or losses are taken to equity in the period in which they arise. Any past service costs are recognised immediately  
to the extent that benefits have already vested and, otherwise, are amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the 
benefits vest.
The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of defined 
benefit obligations as adjusted for any unrecognised past service costs. If necessary, the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the 
amount that can be recovered through reduced Company contributions in the future plus any refunds that have been agreed at the 
balance sheet date.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
The fair value is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 30 of the consolidated IFRSs financial 
statements. In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the 
price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc (market conditions). 
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting 
date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, based 
on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will ultimately vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied.
ESOP trusts
Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an ESOP trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any 
consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ 
funds and no gain or loss is recognised within the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses on the 
purchase, sale or cancellation of these shares.
T reasury shares
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on 
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
4 Profit and loss account disclosures
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and 
losses of the parent Company have not been separately presented in these financial statements.

Financial guarantee contracts
The Company has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. 
The Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the 
Company may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 201 7 and 2042 and the lease 
liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is £827 .9 million (201 1:  
£860.6 million), with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is £475.5 million 
(201 1: £490.7 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £352.4 million (201 1: £369.9 million) in relation to 
the minimum contractual based element. The undiscounted maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the 
non-cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 201 2 is £351.6 million (201 1: £357 . 1 million). Included in the net present 
value of the maximum exposure is £182. 1 million (201 1 : £183.3 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 
£169.5 million (201 1: £1 73.8 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations. 
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the 
liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new 
tenants being identified.
At 31 December 201 2 the Company has recognised a financial liability of £7 .7 million (201 1: £7 .7 million) in respect of these guarantees. 
No asset has been recognised in respect of the indemnity in both years.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate. A rate of 2.2% has been used at 31 December 201 2 (201 1: 2.2%).  
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.3 million.

1 5 Pensions
The Company’s main pension plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan. This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007 .
The last formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 June 2010. The latest actuarial valuation was 
updated to 31 December 201 2 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 1 7 . The defined benefit obligations and 
current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
The following table sets out the key FRS 1 7 principle assumptions used for the plan. The table also sets out at 31 December 2012 and 
31 December 201 1, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 
liabilities, the surplus (or deficit) of assets compared to the FRS 1 7 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability (or asset) and the net 
pension asset (or liability).

The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the expected rates of return on each of the major asset  
classes invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes at the balance sheet date, using the figures shown above. 
The sources used to determine the expected rates of return include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived 
from market data and analysts’ or government’s expectations.
The contributions made by the employers in 201 2, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were £10. 1 million (201 1: £7 .9 million).
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 22.2% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional £44 1,667 per month to remove 
the shortfall in funding identified at 30 June 2010 and £62,500 per month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan.  
These lead to an expected contribution of £9.6 million in 2013. As the plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to 
calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 1 7 , the service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to  
increase over time as the average age of the membership increases.
The following table sets out the amounts charged to the profit and loss account and directly in equity for the year ended  
31 December 201 2 in accordance with the requirements of FRS 1 7 , together with the prior year comparative.

18 Post balance sheet events
On 24 January 201 3, the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Global Betting Exchange Alderney Limited,  
a company registered in Alderney which operates the Betdaq exchange business, for an initial consideration of €30.0 million  
(£25.6 million: 50% in cash and 50% in the Company’s shares). The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory 
approvals. The transaction also includes the payment of contingent consideration, linked to the performance of the business over  
a four year period and capped at €535.0 million. Management’s current expectation is that the contingent consideration is likely to  
be significantly less than this.
In connection with the acquisition described above, on 24 January 2013 the Company also agreed to acquire 10% of the issued share 
capital of TBH Guernsey Limited, a company registered in Guernsey, for cash consideration of €4.0 million (£3.2 million) with a call option 
to acquire the remaining shares after four years at a discount to the fair value at that point. The transaction also includes a put option to 
recover the purchase consideration of €4 million in full.

Financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year . Under that law the directors 
have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 state whether the applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained by the financial statements;
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
T ransparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
pages 28 and 29 of this Annual Report, confirm that, to the best of 
each person’s knowledge and belief:
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Company; and
 the Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

We have audited the parent Company financial statements of 
Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 201 2 which 
comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes  
1 to 18. The financial reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 1 1 5, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the parent Company financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2012;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law  
are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 201 2.

ownership of the Company’s underlying ordinary shares. ADRs are 
quoted in US Dollars and trade just like any other US security.
Ladbrokes has a sponsored level 1 ADR programme for which 
Deutsche Bank T rust Company Americas acts as depositary. The 
ADRs are traded on the Over the Counter market in the US under 
the symbol LDBKY, where one ADR is equal to one ordinary share.
When dividends are paid to shareholders, the depositary makes the 
equivalent payment in US Dollars to ADR holders. For enquiries, 
brokers may contact the Deutsche Bank T rust Company Americas 
Broker Service Desk on +44 20 7547 6500 or + 1 21 2 250 9100. 
Registered ADR holders may contact the Ladbrokes ADR 
shareholder services line on + 1 866 249 2593. Further information, 
including an ADR share price quote, is available at www.adr .db.com.
Unsolicited calls 
Over the last year the Company has become aware of a rise 
in shareholders receiving unsolicited calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. Calls are typically from people 
stating they are “brokers” based overseas and they offer to “buy” the 
individual’s shares at inflated prices claiming that there is a “secret” 
takeover or merger . Shareholders are advised to be very wary of 
any unsolicited advice, offers to sell or buy their shares or offers of 
free company reports. Operations to buy shares at inflated prices or 
to sell what often turn out to be worthless, high risk or even 
non-existent shares are commonly known as “boiler room” scams.
More detailed information on boiler room scams is available at 
www.ladbrokesplc.com. If you think you have been contacted by 
share fraudsters, you can report the matter to the FSA by calling 
0845 606 1 234 or by completing the online form available at  
www.fsa.gov.uk.

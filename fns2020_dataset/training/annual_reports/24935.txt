This document comprises the Annual Report and Accounts 
2010 for HSBC Holdings plc and its subsidiaries. It 
contains the Report of the Directors and Financial 
Statements, together with the Independent Auditor’s 
Report thereon, as required by the UK Companies Act 
2006. The Annual Review 2010 of HSBC Holdings plc is 
published as a separate document. The Report of the 
Directors on pages 2 to 219 and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 220 to 233 have each been 
drawn up in accordance with the requirements of English 
law, and liability in respect thereof is also governed by 
English law. In particular, the liability of the Directors for 
these reports is solely to HSBC Holdings plc. 
Additional information, including commentary 
on 2009 compared with 2008, may be found in the 
Form 20-F filed with the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission and available on www.hsbc.com and

Certain defined terms 
Unless the context requires otherwise, ‘HSBC Holdings’ 
means HSBC Holdings plc and ‘HSBC’, the ‘Group’, ‘we’, 
‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to HSBC Holdings together with its 
subsidiaries. Within this document the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 
is referred to as ‘Hong Kong’. When used in the terms 
‘shareholders’ equity’ and ‘total shareholders’ equity’, 
‘shareholders’ means holders of HSBC Holdings ordinary 
shares and those preference shares classified as equity. 
The abbreviations ‘US$m’ and ‘US$bn’ represent millions 
and billions (thousands of millions) of US dollars, 
respectively.
Financial statements 
The consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the 
separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and 
as endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’). EU-endorsed 
IFRSs may differ from IFRSs as issued by the IASB if, at 
any point in time, new or amended IFRSs have not been 
endorsed by the EU. At 31 December 2010, there were 
no unendorsed standards effective for the year ended 
31 December 2010 affecting these consolidated and 
separate financial statements, and there was no difference 
between IFRSs endorsed by the EU and IFRSs issued by 
the IASB in terms of their application to HSBC. 
Accordingly, HSBC’s financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2010 are prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
We use the US dollar as our presentation currency 
because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form 
the major currency bloc in which we transact and fund our
business. Unless otherwise stated, the information 
presented in this document has been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs. 
When reference to ‘underlying’ or ‘underlying basis’ 
is made in tables or commentaries, comparative 
information has been expressed at constant currency 
(see page 14), eliminating the impact of fair value 
movements in respect of credit spread changes on HSBC’s 
own debt and adjusting for the effects of acquisitions and 
disposals. A reconciliation of reported and underlying 
profit before tax is presented on page 15. 1

Report of the Directors: Overview (continued) 
Group Chairman’s Statement

Group Chairman’s Statement 
When I took on the role of Chairman less than 90 
days ago, I was acutely aware of the challenges 
facing our industry. I was conscious too of the need 
to demonstrate to all of our stakeholders that HSBC 
understands the responsibilities that accompany the 
systemic significance which continued success has 
built for HSBC in many of the markets in which we 
operate, not least those in Asia, given their historical 
significance to the Group. 145 years after we were 
founded, Hong Kong and the rest of Asia remain at 
the heart of HSBC’s strength and identity and our 
commitment to the region is unwavering.  
I fully acknowledge that our scale, the trust that 
our depositors place in us and our relevance to our 
personal and corporate clients – for their financing, 
banking, investment and risk management needs – 
all depend upon our maintaining our reputation and 
our integrity.  
I also understand how important it is for you, 
our shareholders, that HSBC builds sustainable long-
term value that is reflected through the share price 
and rebuilds, as quickly as competing regulatory 
demands allow, the dividend that was reduced during 
the financial crisis.
I firmly believe that HSBC has the people, the 
financial strength and the organisational structure 
best able to deliver all of the above and it is a 
privilege to have the opportunity to serve as Group 
Chairman as we enter a fresh chapter in our history. 
Before I go any further, I want to pay tribute to 
both Stephen Green and Michael Geoghegan, who 
stepped down at the end of last year from their roles 
as Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
after, respectively, 28 and 37 years service to HSBC. 
It fell to them to be at the helm as HSBC navigated 
its way through the worst financial crisis since the 
1930s. Mike led from the front in addressing the 
problems in our consumer finance subsidiary in the 
United States and in reshaping HSBC’s 
organisational structure and operational practices in 
order to better and more efficiently serve an 
increasingly interconnected world. Stephen’s 
personal reputation for integrity and probity stood 
out and distinguished HSBC during a period of 
intense disaffection with the banking industry. For 
their contribution over many years we owe them a 
deep debt of gratitude and wish them both well.  
Our performance in 2010 
The Group Chief Executive’s business review sets 
out clearly how HSBC delivered a much improved 
balance of profits in 2010. It is reassuring to see our 
Personal Financial Services businesses returning to 
profitability in aggregate and Commercial Banking 
growing significantly, largely in emerging markets. 
These achievements augmented another year of 
strong performance in Global Banking and Markets. 
Earnings per share improved strongly, rising by 
115% to reach US$0.73 per share. 
The Group’s capital position also strengthened 
with the core tier 1 ratio, the ratio most favoured by 
regulators as it comprises equity capital after 
regulatory adjustments and deductions, increasing 
from 9.4% to 10.5%, largely due to profit retention 
throughout the year. 
As a consequence of this strong capital 
generation, together with greater clarity on the 
direction of regulatory reform of capital 
requirements and an improving economic backdrop 
in the developed world – particularly in the United 
States – the Board has approved increases in both the 
final dividend payment in respect of 2010 and the 
planned quarterly dividends for 2011. The final 
dividend for 2010, payable on 5 May 2011 to 
shareholders on the register on 17 March 2011, will 
be 12 cents per ordinary share, up from 10 cents at 
the same point last year. For the remainder of 2011 
we plan to pay quarterly dividends of nine cents for 
each of the first three quarters compared with eight 
cents in respect of the equivalent quarters of 2010. 
A new leadership team 
We enter 2011 with a new leadership team, but only 
in the sense of changed roles. Everyone has worked 
together over many years and there is immense 
experience to draw on both from within HSBC and 
from earlier careers at peer organisations. Stuart 
Gulliver is leading the management team as Group 
Chief Executive. His clear objective is to deliver  5
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
sustainable long-term value for shareholders 
consistently in a manner that maintains the 
confidence of all other key stakeholders in our 
businesses including depositors, counterparties, 
long-term creditors, customers, employees, 
regulators and governments. His review on pages 7 
to 9 gives an insight into his immediate priorities. 
Everything we do is governed by the imperative 
of upholding HSBC’s corporate reputation and 
character at the highest level and adding further 
strength to our brand; we deeply regret that a number 
of weaknesses in regulatory compliance were 
highlighted in 2010 and we are resolved to remedy 
these and reinforce the high standards we demand of 
ourselves.  
For my part, I shall be focusing on engaging at 
the highest level in the regulatory reform debates 
that will, in large part, shape our future. I shall also 
lead the Board in the stewardship and review of 
performance of our financial and human resources. 
In the interest of full transparency, we have 
today published on our website the respective roles 
and responsibilities of the Group Chairman, the 
Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director 
and the Group Chief Executive. 
Board changes 
I have already paid tribute to the contributions of 
Stephen Green and Michael Geoghegan. Vincent 
Cheng has indicated that he will step down at the 
next AGM and on behalf of the Board I want to 
thank him for his immense contribution in many 
roles over 33 years. Vincent will retain an 
association with the Group by taking on an advisory 
role to the Group Chief Executive on regional 
matters. Laura Cha will join the Board on 1 March; 
Laura has been Deputy Chair of The Hongkong and 
Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited for four 
years and brings a wealth of experience of China; 
fuller details of her background and experience are 
set out in the Directors’ Report. 
Regulatory update 
There was much progress made during 2010 on the 
regulatory reform agenda. Although there is still a 
great deal to do, the shape of capital requirements 
was broadly clarified and an implementation 
timetable stretching out to 2019 was agreed to allow 
time for the industry to adjust progressively. A 
minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of 7%, 
including a capital conservation buffer, has been 
agreed. HSBC already meets this threshold 
requirement. The Group Chief Executive’s Business 
Review addresses how these revised requirements 
will impact our targeted return on equity. 
During 2011, the debate will be dominated by 
consideration of the calibration of minimum liquidity 
standards. Although it is clear that liquidity and 
funding weaknesses were key elements contributing 
to the crisis, HSBC agrees with the industry consensus 
that the revised requirements in these areas are 
overly conservative and could lead to unnecessary 
deleveraging at a time of fragile economic recovery 
in much of the developed world. It will be a near 
impossibility for the industry to expand business 
lending at the same time as increasing the amount of 
deposits deployed in government bonds while, for 
many banks but not HSBC, reducing dependency on 
central bank liquidity support arrangements. It is to 
be hoped that the observation period, which starts 
this year and precedes the formal introduction of the 
new requirements, will inform a recalibration of 
these minimum liquidity standards.  
A second debate of importance to HSBC’s 
shareholders in 2011 will concern the designation 
of ‘Systemically Important Financial Institutions’ 
(‘SIFI’s). Consideration is being given in the 
regulatory community to mandating higher capital 
requirements, together with more intense 
supervision, for institutions classified as SIFIs. We 
agree with heightened supervision but it is not clear 
that the reduced shareholder returns that would 
follow the imposition of incremental capital would 
be compensated for by improved stability. 
Classification as a SIFI with a requirement to hold 
incremental capital would, however, probably lead 
others to favour SIFIs as counterparties, and may 
therefore have the unintended consequence of further 
concentrating the industry.  
HSBC’s position is that systemic importance 
should not be determined by size alone. It is clear, 
however, that, on almost any basis, HSBC would be 
classified as systemically important. For this reason 
we are engaging fully in the debate around the 
consequences of designation as a SIFI. In particular, 
we draw attention to the benefits of our corporate 
organisation through separate subsidiaries in 
mitigation against the imposition of incremental 
capital for SIFIs based on size alone. 
In October 2010, the UK government confirmed 
its intention to raise the sum of £2.5bn (US$3.9bn) 
through a levy on bank balance sheets, and recently 
announced it will accelerate the full impact of this 
levy to 2011. We take no issue with the right of the 
UK government to raise a levy on the banking 
industry, particularly when having had to risk 
taxpayers’ money to rescue a number of important 
UK institutions. However, as the proposed levy is to   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Overview (continued) 
Group Chairman’s Statement / Group Chief Executive’s Business Review 
6
be applied to the consolidated balance sheet, it 
applies beyond the legal boundary of the domestic 
institution to include overseas operations conducted 
through separately capitalised subsidiaries. This 
therefore constitutes an additional cost of basing a 
growing multinational banking group in the UK.  
We intend to clarify in each set of results going 
forward the impact of the levy, split between UK and 
overseas operations, and Stuart Gulliver covers this 
in more detail in his review. We regard the levy, 
which is not tax deductible, as akin to a distribution 
of profits. For this reason, we intend to add to future 
shareholder dividends that would otherwise be paid, 
any amount saved in the event that the levy is 
restructured or relieved in due course. 
The role of banks in society 
The recent crisis has caused a proper introspection 
as to the role that banks play in society and at HSBC 
we welcome this. Banking is not simply about 
money. It is about helping individuals and 
organisations within society to meet personal and 
corporate objectives by facilitating access to 
financial capital and protecting value for those who 
make capital available. Payment mechanisms, the 
provision of long-term credit, trade finance, hedging 
and other risk management products, deposit, 
investment and retirement services are but a few of 
the activities through which banking groups contribute 
to today’s financial system. Society cannot function 
without an effective financial system that delivers 
value to those it serves at an intermediation cost that 
is proportionate to the value created. Somehow, 
many participants and not just banks, lost sight of 
this basic principle in the run-up to the recent 
financial crisis and the consequences for all have, 
inevitably, been far reaching. There is no doubt that 
the scale of regulatory reform will bring many 
challenges, but it will also open new opportunities.  
At HSBC, we shall not forget what happened to 
precipitate the scale of reform now underway. Although 
the financial turmoil arising from the events of 2007-
2008 has largely moderated, in large part as a result 
of co-ordinated government action and support to the 
financial system, we enter 2011 with humility, ready 
to apply right across HSBC all of the lessons 
learned, notwithstanding that HSBC itself neither 
sought nor received support from any government. 
Society has a right to ask if banks ‘get it’. At 
HSBC, we do – and we are focused on embedding 
the necessary changes in our business model for 
long-term sustainable value creation. But we also do 
not forget that value creation depends upon HSBC 
recruiting, training and retaining the right talent in 
order to manage the risks we accept through 
intermediating customer flows; design solutions to 
address complex financial problems; build enduring 
relationships with core customers; build confidence 
in the Group’s financial strength; and create the 
strategic options that offer the next generation fresh 
opportunities to continue building sustainable value. 
In this globalised world, there is intense 
competition for the best people and, given our long 
history within and connections into the faster-
growing developing markets, our best people are 
highly marketable. It would be irresponsible to allow 
our comparative advantages to wither by ignoring 
the market forces that exist around compensation, 
even though we understand how sensitive this subject 
is. Reform in this area can only be achieved if there 
is concerted international agreement on limiting the 
quantum of pay as well as harmonising pay structures 
but there appears to be no appetite to take the 
initiative on this. Our duty to shareholders is to build 
sustainable value in the economic and competitive 
environment in which we operate and our principal 
resource for achieving this is human talent. Under 
the governance of the Board, we will continue to 
operate and apply remuneration policies and practices 
that take full recognition of best practice and are 
aligned with the long-term interests of shareholders. 
HSBC’s people 
Finally, I want to pay tribute to my 307,000 
colleagues. So many of HSBC’s people have 
exemplified commitment and endeavour again in 
2010, helping our customers and clients to meet their 
financial objectives while taking on the additional 
burden of preparing for regulatory change. This has 
been done against a backdrop of continuing broad-
based fiscal support to many economies, with public 
opinion consistently and highly critical of our 
industry. As I look forward, it is the combination of 
the capabilities of HSBC’s people, their 
determination to do the right thing for our customers 
and their deep sense of responsibility to the 
communities they serve that makes me confident that 
HSBC will play a leading role in rebuilding the trust 
that our industry has lost and, by doing so, will build 
sustainable value for you, our shareholders.

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Group Chief Executive’s  
Business Review 
Underlying financial performance continued to 
improve in 2010 and shareholders continued to 
benefit from HSBC’s universal banking model. All 
regions and customer groups were profitable, as 
Personal Financial Services and North America 
returned to profit. Commercial Banking made an 
increased contribution to underlying earnings and 
Global Banking and Markets also remained strongly 
profitable, albeit behind 2009’s record performance, 
reflecting a well-balanced and diversified business.  
Credit experience continued to improve, as a 
result of a stronger global economy and our actions 
to reduce balance sheet risk. As a globally-connected 
bank with a growing presence across the world’s 
faster-growing regions, HSBC also benefitted from 
higher trade volumes and strong momentum in 
emerging economies, especially in Asia. Asia 
contributed the largest proportion to underlying 
pre-tax profits, while the contributions made by 
Latin America and the Middle East also increased. 
Together with our conservative management of the 
balance sheet, this improved performance allowed us 
to concentrate on serving our customers and to 
further strengthen our capital position.
Group performance headlines 
• Profit before tax

 improved year on year. On a 
reported basis, profits increased by nearly 
US$12bn from US$7.1bn to US$19bn. On an 
underlying basis, profits increased by 36%, or 
almost US$5bn, from US$13.5bn to US$18.4bn. 
1 All references to profits are profits before tax unless 
otherwise stated.
• In a period of sustained low interest rates, 
revenues remained constrained, reflecting four 
principal factors: reducing loan balances in our 
US business; lower trading income in Global 
Banking and Markets resulting from lower 
client activity; adverse fair value movements on 
non-qualifying hedges; and a reduced 
contribution from Balance Sheet Management 
in line with earlier guidance. 
• Strong asset growth in Commercial Banking, 
particularly in Asia, higher trade-related 
revenues generally, and expansion of our wealth 
management business, again most notably in 
Asia, partially offset these revenue pressures.  
• Loan impairment charges reduced by almost 
half to US$14.0bn. All regions and customer 
groups improved. The US experienced the 
greatest improvement, largely in the cards and 
consumer finance portfolios. Loan impairment 
charges also declined significantly in Latin 
America and the Middle East. 
• In Global Banking and Markets, loan 
impairment charges fell significantly, notably in 
Europe as economic conditions improved. 
Credit risk provisions reduced by US$1bn to 
US$0.4bn in the available-for-sale asset-backed-
securities portfolios due to a slowing in the rate 
of anticipated losses on underlying assets, in 
line with previous guidance. The associated 
available for sale reserve declined to US$6.4bn 
from US$12.2bn. 
• The cost efficiency ratio rose to 55.2%, which is 
above our target range and unacceptable to me. 
The causes were constrained revenues and, in 
part, investment in strategic growth initiatives 
across the business together with higher staff 
costs. It additionally reflected one-off payroll 
taxes of US$0.3bn paid in 2010 in respect of the 
previous year and a pension accounting credit 
of US$0.5bn in 2009 and US$0.1bn in 2010. 
However, it is also clear that we need to re-
engineer the business to remove inefficiencies. 
• Return on average total shareholders’ equity 
rose from 5.1% to 9.5%, reflecting increased 
profit generation during the year. 
• HSBC continued to grow its capital base and 
strengthen its capital ratios further. The core 
tier 1 ratio increased from 9.4% to 10.5%, as 
a result of capital generation and lower risk 
weighted assets.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Overview (continued) 
Group Chief Executive’s Business Review

• Total loans and advances to customers increased 
by 7% to US$958bn while deposits increased by 
6% to US$1.2 trillion. 
Impact of the evolving regulatory 
environment on the business 
Much of the detail around the potential impact 
of change for banks remains uncertain. However, 
analysis of what we know confirms that our ability 
to generate capital and manage our risk-weighted 
assets positions HSBC strongly – and competitively 
– within the industry as the pace of change 
intensifies.
HSBC fully supports the rationale of the 
Basel III proposals which require banks to hold more 
capital. This is absolutely core to ensuring that 
governments and taxpayers are better protected in 
future than they have been in the past.
Certain aspects of the Basel III rules remain 
uncertain as to interpretation and application by 
national regulators. Notably, this includes any capital 
requirements which may be imposed on the Group 
over the implementation period in respect of the 
countercyclical capital buffer and any additional 
regulatory requirements for SIFIs. However, we 
believe that ultimately the level for the common 
equity tier 1 ratio of the Group may lie in the range 
9.5 to 10.5%. This exceeds the minimum 
requirement for common equity tier 1 capital plus 
the capital conservation buffer.  
We have estimated the pro forma common 
equity tier 1 ratio of the Group based on our 
interpretation of the new Basel III rules as they will 
apply from 1 January 2019, based on the position of 
the Group at year-end 2010. The rules will be phased 
in from 2013 with a gradual impact and we have 
estimated that their full application, on a proforma 
basis, would result in a common equity tier 1 ratio 
which is lower than the Basel II core tier 1 ratio by 
some 250–300 basis points. The changes relate 
to increased capital deductions, new regulatory 
adjustments and increases in risk-weighted assets. 
However, as the changes will progressively take 
effect over six years leading up to 2019 and as 
HSBC has a strong track record of capital generation 
and actively manages its risk-weighted assets, we 
are confident in our ability to mitigate the effect of 
the new rules before they come into force. 
Last year, HSBC committed to reviewing its 
target shareholder return on equity once the effects 
of new regulation became clearer. Now that we have 
better visibility on the impact of increased capital 
requirements, we believe that higher costs of the 
evolving regulatory framework will, all other things 
being equal, depress returns for shareholders of 
banks. We will therefore target a return on average 
shareholders’ equity of 12-15% in the future.  
As Group Chief Executive, it is right that, in 
managing the business and developing Group 
strategy, my principal office should be in Hong 
Kong – a global financial hub of growing importance 
at the centre of HSBC’s strategically most important 
region. However, the company is headquartered in 
London and we hope to remain there. London’s pre-
eminence as an international financial services centre 
is widely recognised and well-deserved and reflects 
successful government policy over decades to build 
that position. It is therefore important to us that the 
UK’s competitive position is protected and 
sustained. Appropriate supervision is an important 
part of the larger equation. Policymakers should 
continue to legislate and regulate, but they must not 
destroy London’s competitive position in the 
process.
As the Group Chairman has outlined, new 
legislation is expected to be enacted in the UK, 
effective from the start of 2011, one curious 
consequence of which is an explicit incremental cost 
of being headquartered in the UK for any global 
bank. Had this been applied for 2010, this annual 
charge would have amounted to approximately 
US$0.6bn in HSBC’s case. Moreover, the overseas 
balance sheet would account for the majority of the 
annual charge, with the UK balance sheet accounting 
for approximately one third of the total. 
Outlook  
We have been closely watching events unfold in 
parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Our 
primary concern is for the security of our 12,000 
staff across the region and we continue to work to 
ensure their safety. We have also activated robust 
continuity plans so that we can also stay open for 
business and support the needs of our customers. As 
a strongly capitalised global bank, HSBC’s financial 
performance has not been materially affected by 
events to date. HSBC has been present in the Middle 
East for more than 50 years and we remain 
absolutely committed to its future. We also believe 
that the region’s economies have a number of 
structural strengths which leave us positive on the 
longer-term outlook. 
In the short-term, risks to global growth remain, 
not least from an elevated oil price. We therefore 
expect cyclical volatility to continue – including in 
emerging markets – and progress is unlikely to be 
linear. In the longer-term, we believe that growth  9
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
rates in many Western markets will continue to 
significantly underperform those of the emerging 
world. Emerging markets are no longer simply 
leading the recovery from a Western crisis: the 
growth gap has become a sustained secular trend.  
The global economy’s structural position also 
still requires fundamental readjustment. Many 
Western economies must still deal with a large 
overhang of household and government debt and 
weak growth and high unemployment will make this 
a slow and painful process. As faster-growing 
nations seek to limit the effect of Western monetary 
policy on their own economies, we cannot discount 
the risk of increased tension over exchange rate and 
trade issues.  
HSBC’s balance sheet remains strongly 
positioned to benefit from future interest rate rises. 
We are realistic that, in many developed countries at 
least, historically low rates may continue to constrain 
income growth in the near-term. Nevertheless, 
maintaining a conservative liquidity position is core 
to our proposition and to our funding strength. In our 
risk appetite statement approved by the Board we 
have set a maximum advances-to-deposits ratio for 
the Group of 90%. This underlines our continuing 
commitment to a high level of liquidity and reflects 
our philosophy that HSBC should not be reliant on 
wholesale markets for funding. Even with a ratio 
currently slightly below 80%, we have capacity for 
further lending growth.
In the short-term, we expect the benefits of asset 
growth achieved in 2010 to continue to flow into 
revenues. In the medium-term, we will continue to 
target growth in the most strategically attractive 
markets for HSBC and build our capabilities in 
connectivity, one of our distinctive strengths as a 
globally-connected bank. 
At the same time, with demand in many 
developed markets constrained and interest spreads 
remaining compressed, we fully recognise the 
importance of ever more robust cost management 
discipline and the need to continue re-engineering 
the business to improve efficiency. 
Furthermore, capital is becoming a scarcer 
resource and, as a new regulatory environment 
evolves, I am committed to making capital allocation 
a more disciplined and rigorous process at HSBC in 
order to drive the correct investment decisions for 
the future.
We will talk more to investors about each of 
these initiatives later in the spring. However, as a 
result of this focus, we are committed to delivering a 
cost efficiency ratio and a return on average 
shareholders’ equity within our published target 
range.
We also recognise the importance of reliable 
dividend income for our shareholders and I believe it 
should be possible to benchmark a payout ratio of 
between 40-60% of attributable profits under normal 
market conditions. 
In closing, I would like to acknowledge the huge 
contribution that my predecessor, Mike Geoghegan, 
made to HSBC in his five years as Group Chief 
Executive – not least during 2010 – and I wish him 
well for the future. 
Finally, I am pleased to report that we have had 
a good start to the year, with continued momentum 
in lending, mainly in emerging markets and in 
respect of global trade.

Report of the Directors: Overview (continued) 
Principal activities / Strategic direction / Top and emerging risks / KPIs

Principal activities 
HSBC is one of the largest banking and financial 
services organisations in the world, with a market 
capitalisation of US$180bn at 31 December 2010. 
We are headquartered in London. 
As ‘The world’s local bank’, we combine the 
largest global emerging markets banking business 
and a uniquely cosmopolitan customer base with 
an extensive international network and substantial 
financial strength. 
HSBC operates through long-established 
businesses and has an international network of some 
7,500 offices in 87 countries and territories in six 
geographical regions; Europe, Hong Kong, Rest of 
Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, North America and 
Latin America.  
Our products and services are delivered through 
two customer groups, Personal Financial Services 
(‘PFS’) and Commercial Banking (‘CMB’), and two 
global businesses, Global Banking and Markets 
(‘GB&M’), and Global Private Banking (‘GPB’). 
PFS incorporates the Group’s consumer finance 
businesses, the largest of which is HSBC Finance 
Corporation (‘HSBC Finance’). 
Taken together, our five largest customers do 
not account for more than 1% of our income. 
We have contractual and other arrangements 
with numerous third parties in support of our 
business activities. None of the arrangements is 
individually considered to be essential to the 
business of the Group. 
There were no significant acquisitions during 
the year (for details of acquisitions see page 340).
Strategic direction 
Our objective is to deliver sustainable long-term 
value to shareholders through consistent earnings 
and superior risk-adjusted returns.  
Our strategy is to be the world’s leading 
international bank, by: 
• leveraging the HSBC brand and our network of 
businesses which covers the world’s most 
relevant geographies. This network provides 
access to the world’s fastest growing economies, 
for example Greater China. We serve companies 
as they grow and become more international and 
individuals as they become wealthier and 
require more sophisticated financial services, 
such as wealth management; and 
• competing as a universal bank across the full 
financial services spectrum only where we have 
scale and can achieve appropriate returns. This 
implies building scale in attractive geographical 
regions and businesses where we can be 
competitive and reviewing businesses which do 
not meet our financial hurdles. 
The strategy reflects the key trends which are 
shaping the global economy. In particular, we 
recognise that over the long term, developing 
markets are growing faster than mature economies 
and connectivity continues to increase as world trade 
is expanding at a greater rate than gross domestic 
product, generating increased demand for financial 
services. We are, therefore, continuing to direct 
incremental investment primarily to the faster 
growing markets and client segments which have 
international connectivity. In order to deliver this 
strategy we pursue a series of initiatives, reflected 
in the Group’s key performance indicators: 
• enhance efficiency by taking full advantage of 
local, regional and global economies of scale, in 
particular by adopting a common systems 
architecture wherever possible; 
• maintain capital strength and a strong liquidity 
position. Capital and liquidity are critical for our 
strategy and are the foundation of decisions 
about the pace and direction of investment; and 
• align objectives and incentives to motivate and 
reward staff for being fully engaged in 
delivering the strategy. 
Top and emerging risks 
All of our activities involve, to varying degrees, 
the measurement, evaluation, acceptance and 
management of risk or combinations of risks. We 
classify risks as ‘top’ and ‘emerging’. A ‘top risk’ 
is a current, visible risk with the potential to have 
a material effect on our financial results or 
our reputation. An ‘emerging risk’ is one which 
has large unknown components which could have a 
material impact on our long-term strategy. Top and 
emerging risks are viewed as falling under four 
broad categories, as summarised below:  11
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Categories  Top and emerging risks 
Challenges to our business operations  • Challenges to our operating model in an economic downturn (in developed 
countries) and rapid growth (in emerging markets) 
• Internet crime and fraud 
Challenges to our governance and internal control 
systems 
• Level of change creating operational complexity 
• Information security risk 
Macro-economic and geopolitical risk • Potential emerging markets asset bubble 
• Increased geopolitical risk in Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions 
Macro-prudential and regulatory risks to our business 
model 
• Regulatory change impacting our business model and Group profitability 
• Regulatory requirements affecting conduct of business  
Key performance indicators 
The Board of Directors and the Group Management 
Board (‘GMB’) monitor HSBC’s progress against 
its strategic objectives. Progress is assessed by  
comparison with our strategy, our operating plan 
targets and our historical performance using both 
financial and non-financial measures. 
Following a review of our high-level key 
performance indicators (‘KPI’s), the GMB decided 
to make the following changes to the Group’s 
published indicators in order to restrict their number 
to those which most accurately reflect its 
management priorities. The Group now has seven 
financial and three non-financial KPIs. 
• the ratio of advances to core funding has been 
added to highlight the relationship between 
loans and advances to customers and core 
customer deposits in our principal banking 
entities;
• tier 1 capital has been added as a primary 
indicator of the strength of our capital base, and 
its ability to support the growth of the business 
and meet regulatory capital requirements; 
• revenue growth, revenue mix factors and credit 
performance as measured by risk-adjusted 
margin have been replaced with risk-adjusted 
revenue growth; 
• the GMB will prioritise return on average total 
shareholders’ equity in place of return on 
average invested capital, which has therefore 
been excluded; and 
• customer transactions processed and percentage 
of information technology (‘IT’) services 
meeting targets form part of management 
information within our IT function. However, 
the GMB decided that these measures, which we 
have previously disclosed, were not appropriate 
proxies for assessing efficiencies and progress 
with implementing standard systems 
architecture. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Target: to deliver sustained dividend per 
share growth. 
Key Performance Indicators 
Outcome: reported risk-adjusted revenue 
increased, primarily due to a reversal of 
adverse movements in previous years on 
the fair value of own debt designated at 
fair value. Both reported and underlying 
risk-adjusted revenue increased primarily 
due to lower loan impairment charges. 
Outcome: Earnings per share (‘EPS’) 
increased in 2010, reflecting significantly 
lower adverse movements on the fair value 
of own debt due to credit spreads and 
lower loan impairment charges, which 
resulted in an increase in reported profit.
Outcome: dividends per share increased 
by 5.9%.

The management commentary included in the Report of the Directors: ‘Overview’ and ‘Operating and Financial Review’, together with the 
‘Employees’ and ‘Corporate sustainability’ sections of ‘Governance’ and the ‘Directors’ Remuneration Report’ is presented in compliance
with the IFRS Practice Statement Management Commentary issued by the IASB. 
Reconciliation of reported and 
underlying profit before tax 
We measure our performance internally on a like-
for-like basis by eliminating the effects of foreign 
currency translation differences, acquisitions and 
disposals of subsidiaries and businesses, and fair 
value movements on own debt attributable to credit 
spread where the net result of such movements will 
be zero upon maturity of the debt; all of which 
distort year-on-year comparisons. We refer to this 
as our underlying performance. 
Reported results include the effects of the above 
items. They are excluded when monitoring progress 
against operating plans and past results because 
management believes that the underlying basis more 
accurately reflects operating performance. 
Constant currency 
Constant currency comparatives for 2009 referred to in the 
commentaries are computed by retranslating into US dollars 
for non-US dollar branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates:
• the income statements for 2009 at the average rates of 
exchange for 2010; and 
• the balance sheet at 31 December 2009 at the prevailing 
rates of exchange on 31 December 2010. 
No adjustment has been made to the exchange rates used to 
translate foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
into the functional currencies of any HSBC branches, 
subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates. When reference is 
made to ‘constant currency’ in tables or commentaries, 
comparative data reported in the functional currencies of 
HSBC’s operations have been translated at the appropriate 
exchange rates applied in the current period on the basis 
described above. 
Underlying performance 
The tables below compare our underlying 
performance in 2010 and 2009 with reported profits 
in those years.  
The foreign currency translation differences 
reflect the relative strengthening of the US dollar 
against the euro and sterling, which offset its relative 
weakness against currencies in Asia, Mexico and 
Brazil during 2010. 
The following acquisitions and disposals 
affected both comparisons:  
• the acquisition of PT Bank Ekonomi Raharja 
Tbk (‘Bank Ekonomi’) in May 2009; 
• the gain on sale of our 49% interest in a joint 
venture for a UK merchant acquiring business in 
June 2009 of US$280m; 
• the gain of US$62m on reclassification of Bao 
Viet Holdings (‘Bao Viet’) from an available-
for-sale asset to an associate in January 2010; 
• the gain on sale of our stake in Wells Fargo 
HSBC Trade Bank in March 2010 of US$66m; 
• the gain on disposal of HSBC Insurance Brokers 
Limited of US$107m in April 2010;  
• the dilution gain of US$188m which arose 
on our holding in Ping An Insurance (Group) 
Company of China, Limited (‘Ping An 
Insurance’) following the issue of shares by the 
company in May 2010; 
• the loss of US$42m on the completion of the 
sale of our investment in British Arab 
Commercial Bank plc in October 2010;  
• the gain on sale of Eversholt Rail Group of 
US$255m in December 2010; and 
• the gain of US$74m on the deconsolidation of 
private equity funds following the management 
buy-out of Headland Capital Partners Ltd 
(formally known as HSBC Private Equity (Asia) 
Ltd) in November 2010.  15

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Reported profit before tax of US$19.0bn in 2010 
was 169% higher than in 2009, and 36% higher on 
an underlying basis. The difference between reported 
and underlying results is explained on page 14. 
Except where stated otherwise, the commentaries in 
the Financial Summary are on an underlying basis 
and references to HSBC Finance and HSBC Bank 
USA are on a management basis, rather than a legal 
entity basis (for details see page 37). 
Net operating income before loan impairment 
charges and other credit risk provisions (‘revenue’) 
was lower than in 2009, notably due to a decline in 
balances in North America, lower trading income 
from adverse movements on non-qualifying hedges 
and a fall in revenue from GB&M. In the former, we 
continued to reposition our core businesses and we 
remained focused on managing down our run-off 
portfolios. As a consequence, revenue fell, reflecting 
declining balances in the run-off portfolios and in the 
Card and Retail Services business, where revenue 
was also adversely affected by new regulations. In 
GB&M, lower revenue was generated in Balance 
Sheet Management as higher yielding positions 
matured and funds were invested in lower yielding 
assets. Trading income declined driven by increased 
competition and reduced margins across core 
products, and less favourable market conditions 
caused by the European sovereign debt crisis. These 
factors were partly offset by increased CMB revenue 
from balance sheet growth, particularly in Asia, and 
higher trade-related fees.
Loan impairment charges were significantly 
lower than in 2009, with decreases across all regions 
and customer groups as economic conditions 
improved. The most significant decline in loan 
impairment charges was in North America, 
reflecting lower balances due to increased 
repayments, an improvement in delinquency rates in 
Card and Retail Services, and the continued run-off 
of balances in the Consumer Finance business. There 
were also marked declines in the Middle East and in 
Latin America, primarily in Mexico and Brazil, 
reflecting a reduction in personal lending balances 
as selected portfolios were managed down, and an 
improvement in credit quality as origination criteria 
were tightened and collection practices improved. In 
GB&M, loan impairment charges were significantly 
lower, reflecting the improvement in the credit 
environment which resulted in fewer significant 
charges than those taken in 2009 in relation to a 
small number of clients, notably in Europe and other 
credit risk provisions fell in the available-for-sale 
asset-backed securities (‘ABS’) portfolio due to a 
slowing in the rate of anticipated losses in the 
underlying collateral pools.  
Underlying profit before tax rose by 36% as 
a significant fall in impairment charges offset 
a decline in revenue. 
Operating expenses were higher than in 2009, 
in part due to specific one-off items such as a 
US$0.3bn charge for UK bank payroll tax in 2010 
and the non-recurrence of a pension accounting gain 
of US$0.5bn in 2009 relating to the treatment of staff 
benefits. Excluding these items, operating expenses 
rose in support of strategic growth initiatives in our 
target markets to invest in operational infrastructure 
and the selective recruitment of customer-facing 
staff.  
Income from associates increased, driven 
by strong results in Asia which reflected robust 
economic growth in mainland China. 
In 2010, taxable profits were achieved in the 
US, principally as the result of a gain from an 
internal reorganisation that was not recognised for 
accounting purposes which increased the effective 
tax rate by 6.4 percentage points. If this were 
excluded, the effective tax rate would be 19.1% 
which is in line with our geographical range of 
business activities. Reported profit after tax was 
US$7.5bn higher than in 2009.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Reported net interest income fell by 3% to US$39bn; 
the decline was 5% on an underlying basis. This was 
driven by the exceptionally low interest rate 
environment and by the effect of repositioning our 
customer assets towards secured lending as we 
reduced our higher risk and higher yielding 
portfolios.
Revenues in Balance Sheet Management 
decreased, as expected, from the strong levels of 
2009 as higher yielding positions taken in prior years 
matured and opportunities for reinvestment at 
equivalent yields were limited by the prevailing low 
interest rates and flatter yield curves.   19
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
The fall in income from interest-earning assets 
was driven by declining yields on loans and 
advances to customers following the Group’s 
decision to reposition the lending portfolio towards 
higher quality assets. Higher yielding unsecured 
lending balances decreased, particularly in North 
America, where the run-off portfolios continued to 
diminish and credit card balances fell as the number 
of active accounts declined and repayments by 
customers increased. Certain higher risk portfolios 
were also managed down in Latin America, Asia and 
the Middle East. This reduction was partly offset by 
commercial lending growth in CMB and GB&M, 
and growth in secured lending in the UK in 
residential mortgages.  
The interest expense on debt issued by the 
Group fell, largely due to a decline in average 
balances in debt securities in issue as HSBC 
Finance’s funding requirements continued to 
decrease in line with the run-off of the residual 
balances in Mortgage Services and Consumer 
Lending and the sale of the vehicle finance 
portfolios.
Net interest income includes the expense of the 
internal funding of trading assets, while related 
revenue is reported in trading income. The cost of 
funding these assets declined as a result of the low 
interest rates. In reporting our customer group 
results, this cost is included within net trading 
income. 
Net interest spread decreased due to lower 
yields on loans and advances to customers, partly as 
a result of the greater focus on secured lending. In 
addition, returns on financial investments and 
deposit spreads remained constrained due to low 
interest rates. Our net interest margin fell by a lesser 
amount due to the benefit from an increase in net 
free funds as customers held more funds in liquid 
non-interest bearing current accounts in the current 
low interest rate environment.

Net fee income marginally decreased compared with 
2009 on both a reported and an underlying basis. The 
significant decrease in fee income in North America, 
primarily in Card and Retail Services, was mostly 
offset by higher investment-related fees in Asia and 
Europe and an increase in trade-related fee income in 
Asia.
The significant fall in fee income from cards 
occurred primarily in North America, driven by 
lower volumes, improved delinquency rates and the 
revision to charging practices following the 
implementation of the Credit Card Accountability, 
Responsibility and Disclosure Act (‘CARD Act’).  
Insurance fee income was markedly down. In 
the US, the decline resulted from lower sales of 
credit protection products associated with the cards 
business. In the UK, income was lower on a reported 
basis due to the sale of the insurance brokerage 
business in the first half of 2010. 
Overall, underwriting fee income declined, 
particularly in Europe as a result of reduced 
capital market activity in the uncertain economic 
environment, although in Asia underwriting fees 
increased following several notable transactions.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Net fee income from sales of investment 
products in Asia and Europe increased, driven by a 
stronger investment performance in funds and 
improved customer sentiment which led to higher 
volumes. 
Credit facilities fees also rose, notably in Asia, 
as a result of an increase in loan syndication 
transactions completed during the year.  
Net fee income from trade finance also 
increased, particularly in Asia, reflecting a rise in 
trade activity.

Reported net trading income was US$7.2bn, 27% 
lower than in 2009. On an underlying basis, net 
trading income declined by 28% due to adverse 
movements on non-qualifying hedges and lower 
income from trading activities. 
A US$1.1bn adverse fair value movement was 
reported on non-qualifying hedges compared with a 
favourable fair value movement of US$954m in 2009. 
These instruments are derivatives entered into as part 
of a documented interest rate management strategy 
for which hedge accounting was not, or could not be, 
applied. They are principally cross-currency and 
interest rate swaps used to economically hedge fixed 
rate debt issued by HSBC Holdings, floating rate debt 
issued by HSBC Finance and certain operating leased 
assets. The loss recognised on non-qualifying hedges 
was a result of fair value losses on these instruments, 
driven by the decrease in long-term US interest rates 
relative to sterling and euro rates. In HSBC Finance, 
the volume of non-qualifying hedge positions also 
increased as the duration of the mortgage book 
lengthened and swaps were used to align more closely 
the duration of the funding liabilities. The size and 
direction of the changes in fair value of non-
qualifying hedges which are recognised in the income 
statement can be volatile from year to year, but do not 
alter the cash flows expected as part of the 
documented interest rate management strategy for 
both the instruments and the underlying economically 
hedged assets and liabilities. 
The remaining decline in net trading income 
was driven by increased competition and reduced 
margins across core products. European sovereign 
debt concerns and increased economic uncertainty 
resulted in less favourable market conditions 
compared with 2009. 
In the Credit business, corporate bond trading 
volumes remained robust following investment in 
electronic trading capabilities, though revenues were 
affected as margins declined and credit spread 
movements were more favourable in 2009. This was 
partly offset by gains on the legacy portfolio which 
included a net release of write-downs on legacy 
positions and monoline credit exposures of 
US$429m. This compared with a reported 
write-down of US$331m in 2009. 
Rates income decreased, reflecting reduced 
margins and increased risk aversion from customers 
due to economic uncertainty. Turmoil in the eurozone 
led to sovereign debt downgrades and falling asset 
prices in certain European countries, leading to 
lower revenues in the trading portfolio. These factors 
were partly offset by a small favourable fair value 
movement on structured liabilities, compared with 
an adverse movement in 2009. 
Lower net trading income was driven by a 
US$2.0bn adverse movement on non-
qualifying hedges from 2009. 
Performance in the Foreign Exchange business 
remained strong, although was affected by a 
competitive trading environment and tighter bid-
offer spreads as competitors sought to rebuild their 
businesses. In addition, revenues fell as market 
volatility declined from the exceptional levels seen 
in early 2009.  
The Equities business continued to increase 
market share in its target markets, following  21
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
investment in the equities platform. However, core 
revenues fell, as overall market volumes and margins 
declined.
Trading income benefitted from foreign 
exchange gains on trading assets held as economic 
hedges of foreign currency debt designated at fair 
value compared with losses on these instruments 
in 2009. These gains were largely offset by 
corresponding losses reported in ‘Net income from 
financial instruments designated at fair value’. 
Net interest income earned on trading activities 
decreased by 30%, driven by reduced holdings of 
debt securities. The cost of internally funding these 
assets also declined, but this interest expense is 
reported under ‘Net interest income’ and excluded 
from net trading income.

For footnotes, see page 83. 
The accounting policies for the designation of 
financial instruments at fair value and the treatment 
of the associated income and expenses are described 
in Notes 2i and 2b on the Financial Statements, 
respectively.  
The majority of the financial liabilities 
designated at fair value relate to certain fixed-rate 
long-term debt issues whose rate profile has been 
changed to floating through interest rate swaps as 
part of a documented interest rate management 
strategy. The movement in fair value of these long-
term debt issues includes the effect of our credit 
spread changes and any ineffectiveness in the 
economic relationship between the related swaps 
and own debt. As credit spreads widen or narrow, 
accounting profits or losses, respectively, are 
booked. The size and direction of the changes in the 
credit spread on our debt and ineffectiveness, which 
are recognised in the income statement, can be 
volatile from year to year, but do not alter the cash 
flows envisaged as part of the documented interest 
rate management strategy. As a consequence, fair 
value movements arising from changes in our own 
credit spread on long-term debt and other fair value 
movements on the debt and related derivatives 
are not regarded internally as part of managed 
performance and are therefore not allocated to 
customer groups, but are reported in ‘Other’. Credit 
spread movements on own debt are excluded from 
underlying results, and related fair value movements 
are not included in the calculation of regulatory 
capital.
We reported net income from financial 
instruments designated at fair value of US$1.2bn in 
2010 compared with a net expense of US$3.5bn in 
2009. On an underlying basis, the equivalent figures 
were income of US$1.3bn in 2010 and US$2.9bn 
in 2009. The difference between the reported and 
underlying results arises from the exclusion from the 
latter of the credit spread-related movements in the 
fair value of our own long-term debt, on which we 
reported adverse fair value movements of US$63m  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Financial summary > Group performance  
22
in 2010 and US$6.5bn in 2009. In North America, a 
small favourable fair value movement was reported 
in 2010 as credit spreads widened marginally, in 
contrast with a significant adverse fair value 
movement in 2009. In Europe, significantly lower 
adverse fair value movements were reported in 2010 
as credit spreads tightened, but to a lesser extent than 
in the previous year. 
Income arising from financial assets held to 
meet liabilities under insurance and investment 
contracts reflected lower investment gains as the 
growth in equity markets was less than that of 2009. 
This predominantly affected the value of assets held 
to support unit-linked contracts in the UK, Hong 
Kong, Singapore and Brazil and participating 
contracts in France. 
For investment gains or losses related to assets 
held to back investment contracts, the corresponding 
movement in liabilities to customers is also recorded 
under ‘Net income from financial instruments 
designated at fair value’. 
Investment gains or losses related to assets held 
to back insurance contracts or investment contracts 
with discretionary participation features (‘DPF’) are 
offset by a corresponding change in ‘Net insurance 
claims incurred and movement in liabilities to 
policyholders’ to reflect the extent to which unit-
linked policyholders, in particular, participate in the 
investment performance of the associated asset 
portfolios.

Reported gains less losses from financial

On an underlying basis, excluding an accounting 
gain arising from the reclassification of Bao Viet as 
an associate following our purchase of additional 
shares, they increased by 69%. This was driven by 
a decrease in the level of impairments on available-
for-sale equity investments as market values 
improved, along with an increase in gains on the 
disposal of equity and debt securities.  
Impairments on equity investments declined 
markedly compared with 2009 as the improving 
economic situation resulted in a reduction in the 
level of write-downs required on private equity and 
other strategic equity investments.  
Higher net gains were reported in Balance Sheet 
Management on disposals of available-for-sale debt 
securities, mainly in Europe and Asia. These were 
partly offset by a decrease in North America, where 
net gains realised from the sale of mortgage-backed 
securities and other ABSs in 2009 did not recur. 
Net gains on the disposal of equity securities 
increased, primarily in our private equity portfolio in 
Europe, as the market offered greater opportunities 
for divestment. This was partly offset by the non-
recurrence of the gain on disposal of our holdings of 
Visa Inc. shares in 2009.

Net earned insurance premiums increased by 6% to 
US$11.1bn on both a reported and an underlying 
basis.  
Growth was largely attributable to the continued 
strong performance of life insurance products 
in Asia. Successful sales campaigns and the  23
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
recruitment of additional insurance sales managers 
increased net earned premiums in Hong Kong, 
particularly from deferred annuity and unit-linked 
products, and a life insurance product designed for 
high net worth individuals. Higher sales were also 
reported in Malaysia, Taiwan and mainland China, 
primarily from successful product launches and 
marketing campaigns. 
Net earned premiums in Latin America 
increased marginally in the improved economic 
conditions, driven by higher sales in Brazil, 
Argentina and Mexico and repricing initiatives in 
Argentina.
In France, an increase in sales of investment 
contracts with DPF drove higher net earned 
premiums. Strong sales activity also led to higher net 
earned premiums in our UK life insurance business. 
This growth was partly offset by a reduction in 
non-life insurance premiums, primarily due to the 
run-off of the legacy motor book in the UK, which 
was closed during the second half of 2009, and the 
decision taken during 2010 not to renew certain 
contracts in the Irish business.  
Net earned premiums in North America also 
decreased, reflecting a decline in sales of payment 
protection products following the discontinuation of 
mortgage originations in HSBC Finance.

Reported other operating income of US$2.6bn was

gains of US$188m following the dilution of our 
holding in Ping An Insurance, US$107m from the 
sale of HSBC Insurance Brokers, US$66m from the 
disposal of our interest in the Wells Fargo HSBC 
Trade Bank and US$255m from the sale of Eversholt 
Rail Group. In addition, we reported a gain of 
US$74m resulting from the sale of HSBC Private 
Equity (Asia) Ltd, partly offset by a loss of US$42m 
on the disposal of our shareholding in British Arab 
Commercial Bank plc. Reported results in 2009 
included a gain of US$280m from the sale of the 
remaining stake in the card merchant-acquiring 
business in the UK. 
On an underlying basis, excluding the items 
referred to above, other operating income decreased 
by 23%, primarily because gains on the sale of 
properties in London and Hong Kong in 2009 did 
not recur. 
Net losses recognised on assets held for sale 
increased, reflecting a US$207m loss on the sale 
of the US vehicle finance servicing operation and 
associated US$5.3bn loan portfolio.  
Net investment valuation gains on investment 
properties contrasted with losses in 2009. This 
reflected improvements in the property markets in 
Hong Kong and the UK which led to net valuation 
gains on investment properties, compared with net 
valuation losses in 2009. 
A loss on sale of the US vehicle finance 
business contributed to a fall in Other 
operating income. 
We recognised gains of US$194m and US$56m 
in 2010 on the sale and leaseback of our Paris and 
New York headquarters buildings, respectively. 
These compared with more substantial underlying 
gains of US$667m (US$686m as reported) on the 
sale and leaseback of 8 Canada Square and the sale 
of a property in Hong Kong in 2009.  
Strong sales of life insurance products, notably 
in Hong Kong, resulted in favourable movements 
in the present value of in-force (‘PVIF’) long-term 
insurance business. These were offset in part by 
the non-recurrence of gains recognised in 2009 
following the refinement of the income recognition 
methodology in HSBC Finance.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

For footnote, see page 83. 
Net insurance claims incurred and movement in 
liabilities to policyholders decreased by 5% and 4% 
on a reported and an underlying basis, respectively. 
Lower investment returns than in 2009, 
particularly in Asia, Europe and Brazil, led to 
a decrease in the movement in liabilities to 
policyholders on unit-linked insurance contracts and, 
to a certain extent, participating contracts, whose 
policyholders share in the investment performance of 
the assets supporting their policies. The gains or 
losses experienced on the financial assets designated 
at fair value held to support insurance contract 
liabilities and investment contracts with DPF are 
reported in ‘Net income from financial instruments 
designated at fair value’.  
In Asia, the effect of the lower investment 
returns was more than offset by additional reserves 
established for new business written, consistent with 
the increase in net insurance premiums earned, 
particularly in Hong Kong, as a result of successful 
sales campaigns and the recruitment of additional 
insurance sales managers. 
In addition, the increase in reserves in 2009 on 
the now closed UK motor insurance book, which 
reflected the rising incidence and severity of claims 
at that time, did not recur. The decision taken in 
2010 not to renew certain contracts in our Irish 
business resulted in a further decrease in net 
insurance claims incurred and movement in 
liabilities to policyholders.

all regions and in all customer groups. 
At 31 December 2010, the aggregate balance 
of customer loan impairment allowances was 
US$20.1bn. This represented 2.2% of gross 
loans and advances to customers (net of reverse 
repos and settlement accounts) compared with 3.0% 
at 31 December 2009.  25
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
We actively managed down some of our higher 
risk portfolios in all regions and enhanced credit 
quality through tighter underwriting and increased 
focus on the sale of secured products to customers 
where we already held a banking relationship. 
Loan impairment charges in our CMB and GB&M 
businesses fell as economic conditions improved and 
we recognised fewer large loan impairment charges 
against specific clients than in 2009. 
Loan impairment charges and other credit 
risk provisions of US$14bn were 48% or 
US$12.8bn lower than in 2009. 
Impairments on available-for-sale debt 
securities declined markedly to US$472m from the 
US$1.5bn reported in 2009, mainly reflecting a 
slowing in the rate of anticipated losses in the 
underlying collateral pools. 
The most significant decline in loan impairment 
charges was in our HSBC Finance portfolios in 
the US, where lending balances reduced and 
delinquency levels improved.  
Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions in the US declined by 48% to US$7.9bn, 
the lowest level since 2006, representing 57% of the 
Group’s total reduction compared with 2009. This 
mainly occurred in the US PFS business, where loan 
impairment charges declined by US$6.1bn to 
US$8.0bn, primarily in the Card and Retail Services 
business of HSBC Finance and, to a lesser extent, in 
the run-off consumer finance portfolios. 
In Cards and Retail Services, loan impairment 
charges declined by 57% to US$2.2bn. This 
improvement reflected the continuing effects of 
additional steps taken from the fourth quarter 
of 2007 to manage risk, including tightening 
underwriting criteria, lowering credit limits and 
reducing the number of active cards. An increased 
focus by our customers on reducing outstanding 
credit card debt helped improve delinquency levels. 
Loan impairment charges in our Consumer 
Lending and Mortgage Services businesses declined 
by 29% to US$5.7bn, due to the continued run-off 
of lending balances in these portfolios and lower 
delinquency balances. Total loss severities on 
foreclosed loans improved compared with 2009, 
reflecting an increase in the number of properties for 
which we accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a 
short sale, both of which result in lower losses 
compared with loans which are subject to a formal 
foreclosure process. 
During 2010, state and federal prosecutors 
announced investigations into foreclosure practices 
of certain mortgage service providers. As a result, 
we expect that the scrutiny of documents will 
increase, and in some states additional verification of 
information will be required. If these trends continue 
there may be delays in their processing. See page 83 
for more information on the investigation into US 
foreclosure practices.  
In HSBC Bank USA, loan impairment charges 
in PFS fell by 92% to US$50m, reflecting lower 
lending balances and improved credit quality in the 
residential mortgage portfolio. 
In GB&M in the US, a net release of loan 
impairment charges and other credit risk provisions 
reflected the improved credit environment and a 
release of impairments of available-for-sale ABSs as 
mentioned previously. In CMB, loan impairment 
charges declined by US$194m as the improved 
economic conditions resulted in credit upgrades on 
certain accounts, and fewer downgrades across all 
business lines.
In the UK, loan impairment charges in PFS and 
CMB declined as economic conditions improved and 
interest rates remained at low levels, resulting in an 
improvement in delinquency levels. In PFS, loan 
impairment charges fell by 35% to US$1.1bn as we 
actively reduced our exposure to unsecured lending, 
while collections increased mainly due to programmes 
implemented to improve performance. In the UK 
secured lending book, credit quality continued to be 
high and loan impairment charges remained at low 
levels. In CMB, loan impairment charges declined 
by US$159m due to strengthened credit risk 
management and improved collections, notably in 
the UK property, retail and service sectors. 
Loan impairment charges and other credit 
provisions fell markedly in GB&M reflecting the 
improved credit outlook, loan restructuring activity 
and the non-recurrence of significant charges against 
a small number of clients in the financial and 
property sectors. Credit risk provisions on certain 
available-for-sale ABSs also reduced.  
Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions in Latin America declined by 44% to 
US$1.5bn. In PFS, loan impairment charges of 
US$1.2bn were 45% lower, mainly in Mexico due to 
a reduction in balances and improved delinquency 
rates in our credit card portfolio. In Brazil, they also 
declined as we managed down the size of certain 
consumer finance portfolios and economic 
conditions improved. In 2010, initiatives taken in the 
region to improve the quality of the loan portfolios 
continued. These steps included the tightening of 
underwriting criteria, reducing and, in some  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued)

26
instances, eliminating the use of higher risk, non-
branch sales channels, and continued investment in 
our collections infrastructure. In our CMB portfolios, 
loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions declined by 50% to US$293m, as 
improved economic conditions and credit quality 
resulted in lower specific impairment charges in all 
sectors.  
In the Middle East, loan impairment charges 
and other credit risk provisions fell by 53% to 
US$627m as lower loan impairment charges in both 
PFS and CMB were partly offset by an increase in 
GB&M following restructuring activities. In our 
PFS business, loan impairment charges declined 
by 61% to US$227m, reflecting a marked decline 
in delinquency levels and lower lending balances, 
particularly in our credit card and unsecured 
personal lending book, as a result of managing down 
higher risk portfolios. Credit limits were tightened 
and our customer acquisition strategy was revised in 
the region to concentrate on Premier and Advance 
customers. This resulted in an improvement in credit 
quality. In CMB, lower loan impairment charges 
reflected a reduction in collective impairment 
charges and fewer specific loan impairment charges 
as economic conditions improved. 
In Rest of Asia-Pacific, loan impairment 
charges declined as the credit environment 
improved. In India, loan impairment charges fell by 
83% to US$82m, mainly in PFS as certain unsecured 
lending portfolios and the higher risk elements of the 
credit card portfolio were managed down, and 
economic conditions improved. Impairment charges 
also declined in CMB, due to the non-recurrence of 
charges against specific technology-related 
exposures in 2009. Partly offsetting these increases 
were higher specific loan impairment charges in 
GB&M. 
In Hong Kong, loan impairment charges fell by 
77% to US$114m, as economic conditions improved 
and fewer large specific loan impairment charges 
were reported against the CMB and GB&M 
portfolios. Loan impairment charges fell in PFS too, 
mainly on unsecured lending as unemployment and 
bankruptcy levels reduced.

Operating expenses increased by 10% to US$37.7bn 
on a reported basis and by 8% on an underlying 
basis. Significant one-off items included aggregate 
payroll taxes of US$324m levied on 2009 bonuses in 
the UK and France, and the curtailment of certain 
benefits delivered through pension schemes, which 
generated accounting credits of US$148m in the US 
and US$480m (US$499m as reported) in the UK in 
2010 and 2009, respectively. Excluding these items, 
expenses grew by 6% as we continued to invest in 
our operational infrastructure, customer-facing and 
support staff, and GB&M’s capabilities and 
platforms. 
Employee compensation and benefits increased 
by 7%, partly due to the net effect of the curtailment 
gains and the payroll tax referred to above.  27
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Excluding these items, staff costs rose by 3%. 
Performance-related costs increased, primarily in 
Asia, reflecting improved business performance and 
increased staff numbers. While year-end staff 
numbers increased as the pace of recruitment 
accelerated in the second half of the year, average 
staff numbers remained below 2009 levels. The 
growth in staff numbers in Asia encompassed both 
customer-facing and back-office staff supporting 
business growth and increased operational capacity. 
In Latin America, staff costs grew following union-
agreed salary increases and the recruitment of 
customer-facing and regional support staff, primarily 
in the latter part of the year. We also increased 
resources in our Global Service Centres as we 
continued to move processes there.  
Staff costs declined in the US due to the non-
recurrence of restructuring costs associated with the 
closure of the Consumer Lending branch network in 
2009. Also, headcount fell due to the sale of the 
vehicle finance portfolio and related servicing 
platform. Similarly, reported staff numbers fell in 
Europe due to the sale of the insurance broking 
business in the UK and business reorganisation in 
France, though this was partly offset by higher 
numbers of customer-facing staff in the UK and 
Turkey.  
Premises and equipment costs increased as 
rental costs in the UK, the US and France rose 
following the sale and leaseback of 8 Canada 
Square, London and our headquarters buildings 
in the US and France, combined with business 
expansion in Asia and Europe and refurbishment 
costs in Europe and Latin America. This was partly 
offset by lower costs in the US following the closure 
of the Consumer Lending branch offices and the 
non-recurrence of the related restructuring costs. 
General and administrative expenses rose, 
reflecting in part higher marketing and advertising 
costs. These grew in North America in Card and 
Retail Services, partly from complying with the 
CARD Act. Marketing costs also rose in Asia and 
Latin America in support of the launch of Advance 
and sales campaigns for credit cards and investment 
products. Project costs increased from various 
initiatives to enhance operational capabilities, in 
connection with which consultancy and contractors’ 
fees rose, primarily in the UK as GB&M continued 
to invest in strategic initiatives to drive future 
revenue growth. These included the development of 
Prime Services and equity market capabilities, and 
the expansion of the Rates and foreign exchange 
e-commerce platforms. 
Travel costs increased as we increased our focus 
on international connectivity and business growth. 
Costs also increased due to litigation provisions in 
North America and Europe.

Financial summary > Group performance / Balance sheet

Asia in support of business expansion was broadly 
offset by strict cost control across the Group and 
lower costs in the US. Revenue fell, largely in the 
run-off portfolio and in Card and Retail Services in 
North America.  
In CMB, the cost efficiency ratio deteriorated by 
2.9 percentage points as we continued to invest for 
future revenue growth in those markets that we see 
as central to international connectivity. Revenue 
grew in all regions, albeit at a slower pace, resulting 
in a deterioration in the cost efficiency ratio, with the 
exception of Hong Kong where strong revenue 
growth led to an improvement of 1.5 percentage 
points.
In GB&M, the cost efficiency ratio deteriorated 
by 12.1 percentage points reflecting the one-off 
payroll and bonus taxes in the UK and France. 
Excluding them, the ratio deteriorated by 10.5 
percentage points following a rise in costs related to 
higher support costs and continued investment in 
strategic initiatives being undertaken to drive future 
revenue growth. Revenue fell during 2010 mainly 
due to lower net interest income in Balance Sheet 
Management and lower trading income. 
In GPB, the cost efficiency ratio deteriorated by 
5.3 percentage points as costs increased, reflecting 
the hiring of front-line staff, investment in systems 
and higher compliance costs coupled with lower 
revenue in the low interest rate environment.

Our share of profits in Ping An Insurance

while fee income and lending growth resulted in 
higher profits from the Bank of Communications

These results were partly offset by a decrease in 
our share of profits from The Saudi British Bank as 
revenue declined amidst challenging economic

The most significant factor influencing the year on

The impact of the tax on profit on associates and 
joint ventures included within pre-tax profits was a 
reduction in the effective tax rate of 3.7% in 2010 
and 7.1% in 2009. 
In 2010 HSBC’s US operations achieved 
taxable profits, principally as a result of realising a 
taxable gain from an internal reorganisation which 
increased the effective tax rate by 6.4%. If this was 
excluded the effective tax rate would be 19.1% 
which is in line with the geographic profile of the

Financial summary > Balance sheet

Movement in 2010
Total assets amounted to US$2.5 trillion, 4% higher 
than at 31 December 2009. Excluding the effect 
of currency movements, underlying total assets 
increased by 5%. This reflected higher mortgage 
lending in Hong Kong and the UK, strong demand 
for commercial loans and a rise in trading assets in 
North America and Asia as a result of customer 
demand, supported by improved liquidity generated 
by higher deposits and our debt issuance programme. 
The Group’s reported tier 1 ratio increased from 
10.8% to 12.1% due to the contribution from profits 
attributable to shareholders for the year net of 
dividends paid, the issue of hybrid capital securities 
net of redemptions, and a reduction in the reported 
level of risk-weighted assets (‘RWA’s). The latter 
was driven by a decline in some retail portfolio 
exposures in North America as a result of run-off, 
partly offset by the effect of lending growth in Asia. 
Market risk RWAs decreased as a result of reduced 
volatility and continuing exposure management. For 
more details of capital and RWAs, see page 177.  
The following commentary is on an underlying 
basis. 
Assets
Cash and balances at central banks decreased by 4% 
as a result of lower year-end cash balances in North 
America as excess liquidity was redeployed into 
highly-rated government debt securities. This was 
partly offset by higher year-end cash balances in 
Europe.
Trading assets fell by 6%, due to the 
deconsolidation of the Constant Net Asset Value 
(‘CNAV’) funds totalling US$44bn (see Note 43 on 
the Financial Statements). This was offset, in part, 
by higher issuance of and customer demand for 
government and government agency debt securities, 
particularly in North America and Asia, and an 
increase in holdings of equities to hedge derivative 
positions arising from a rise in client trading activity. 
Higher customer-driven trading volumes also 
resulted in an increase in reverse repo balances in 
North America; this was partly offset by a reduction 
in reverse repo balances in Europe due to market 
uncertainty. 
Strong increase in loans and advances to 
customers and customer accounts, notably 
in Asia, drove balance sheet growth. 
Financial assets designated at fair value grew 
by 3% due to an increase in volumes in equity funds 
and a rise in the fair value of equity securities held 
within the insurance business, particularly in Europe 
and Hong Kong, as market values recovered and 
client risk appetite returned. This was partly offset 
by the sale of European government debt securities 
by Balance Sheet Management.  
Derivative assets rose by 8%. This was 
driven by increases in the fair value of interest rate 
contracts as a result of downward shifts of major 
yield curves, offset by higher netting from increased 
trading with clearing houses. The notional value of 
outstanding contracts also rose, reflecting an 
increase in the number of open transactions 
compared with 2009.
Loans and advances to banks increased by 16% 
due to higher placements with commercial and 
central banks in Europe and Latin America. 
Loans and advances to customers grew by 
8% as we targeted commercial loans and, in the 
improved economic conditions, demand grew from 
customers, notably in Asia. The increase in demand 
for credit, along with competitive pricing, also drove 
continued growth in mortgage lending in Hong Kong 
and the UK, though mortgage balances declined in 
North America as the Consumer Lending and 
Mortgage Services portfolios continued to run off 
and credit card lending fell. 
Financial investments rose by 9%, mainly in 
North America and Europe, as Balance Sheet 
Management redeployed cash into available-for-sale 
treasury bills and government agency debt securities. 
This was partly offset by a decline in financial 
investments in Asia, as a result of disposals and debt 
securities that matured and were not replaced to 
support growth in commercial lending. 
Liabilities
Deposits by banks decreased by 8%, reflecting a 
notable decline in central bank deposits in Europe 
which was partly offset by an increase in central 
bank deposits in Asia.  
Customer accounts were 7% higher, driven by 
an overall increase in savings and current accounts 
across most regions, particularly in Asia and Europe. 
Growth in Premier and online savings contributed to 
a significant increase in current account balances as 
customers responded well to targeted promotional 
campaigns.  
Trading liabilities increased by 16%. Higher 
repo balances in North America were reported as a 
result of increased trading volumes of treasury and 
corporate bonds driven by market volatility in the 
bond market. In Europe, short bond and equity  31
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
positions used to hedge derivative transactions 
increased, reflecting higher client demand. 
Financial liabilities designated at fair value 
rose by 12% due to debt issuances by HSBC entities 
in Europe during 2010.
Derivative businesses are managed within 
market risk limits and, as a consequence, the 
increase in the value of derivative liabilities broadly 
matched that of derivative assets. 
Debt securities in issue were in line with 2009, 
as new issuances of medium-term notes by HSBC 
entities in Europe during 2010 were offset by lower 
funding requirements in North America as the 
consumer finance portfolios in run-off declined. 
Liabilities under insurance contracts grew by 
12%. This was driven by strong life insurance sales 
in Hong Kong following the launch of several new 
products, and gains on unit-linked products as 
investment market values improved. 
Other liabilities were 26% lower than at 
31 December 2009 due to the deconsolidation of the 
CNAV funds (see ‘Trading assets’ above). 
Equity
Total shareholders’ equity increased by 17%, driven 
by profits generated during the year and the issue of 
Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities, a form of 
tier 1 hybrid capital securities, in June 2010. In 
addition, the negative balance on the available-
for-sale reserve declined from US$10.0bn at 31 
December 2009 to US$4.1bn at 31 December 2010, 
largely reflecting improvements in the market value 
of assets.

Financial summary > Economic profit / Critical accounting policies

Economic profit 
Our internal performance measures include 
economic profit/(loss), a calculation which compares 
the return on financial capital invested in HSBC by 
our shareholders with the cost of that capital. We 
price our cost of capital internally and the difference 
between that cost and the post-tax profit attributable 
to ordinary shareholders represents the amount of 
economic profit/(loss) generated. Economic 
profit/(loss) generated is used by management as 
one input in deciding where to allocate capital and 
other resources.  
In order to concentrate on external factors rather 
than measurement bases, we emphasise the trend in 
economic profit/(loss) ahead of absolute amounts 
within business units. Our long-term cost of capital 
is reviewed annually and for 2010 it was revised to 
11% from the 10% used in 2009. We use a Capital 
Asset Pricing Model to determine our cost of capital. 
The main drivers of the increase were an increase in 
the risk free rate and an increase in the betas used in 
the calculation. The following commentary is on a 
reported basis. 
Our economic loss decreased by US$4.7bn to 
US$3.3bn as a result of an increase in profit 
attributable to shareholders. This was predominantly 
driven by lower loan impairment charges across all 
regions and customer groups, notably in the US due 
to lower balances and decreased delinquency rates 
in Card and Retail Services, and the run-off of the 
Consumer Lending and mortgage services portfolio.  
The increase in average invested capital 
reflected higher retained earnings and a significant 
decrease in reserves representing unrealised losses 
on available-for-sale securities due to a slowing in 
the rate of anticipated losses in the underlying 
collateral pools. 
The return on invested capital increased by 
4.6 percentage points, although it remained below our 
benchmark cost of capital. The economic spread 
improved by 3.6 percentage points, the result of an 
increase in return on invested capital, partly offset by 
the rise in the cost of capital in 2010.

Critical accounting policies 
(Audited) 
Introduction 
The results of HSBC are sensitive to the accounting 
policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
The significant accounting policies are described in 
Note 2 on the Financial Statements.
When preparing the financial statements, it is 
the Directors’ responsibility under UK company law 
to select suitable accounting policies and to make 
judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent. The accounting policies that are deemed 
critical to our results and financial position, in terms 
of the materiality of the items to which the policies 
are applied and the high degree of judgement 
involved, including the use of assumptions and 
estimation, are discussed below.
Impairment of loans and advances 
Our accounting policy for losses arising from the 
impairment of customer loans and advances is 
described in Note 2g on the Financial Statements. 
Loan impairment allowances represent 
management’s best estimate of losses incurred 
in the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. 
Management is required to exercise judgement 
in making assumptions and estimations when 
calculating loan impairment allowances on both 
individually and collectively assessed loans and 
advances. Of the Group’s total loans and advances 
to customers before impairment allowances of 
US$978bn (2009: US$922bn), US$15bn or 2% 
(2009: US$15bn; 2%) were individually assessed 
for impairment, and US$963bn or 98% (2009: 
US$907bn; 98%) were collectively assessed for 
impairment. 
The most significant judgemental area is the 
calculation of collective impairment allowances. The 
geographical area with most exposure to collectively 
assessed loans and advances is North America, 
which comprised US$198bn or 21% (2009: 
US$219bn; 24%) of the total. Collective impairment 
allowances in North America were US$9bn, 
representing 64% (2009: US$13bn; 68%) of the total 
collectively assessed loan impairment allowance. 
The methods used to calculate collective 
impairment allowances on homogeneous groups 
of loans and advances that are not considered 
individually significant are disclosed in Note 2g 
on the Financial Statements. They are subject to 
estimation uncertainty, in part because it is not 
practicable to identify losses on an individual loan 
basis because of the large number of individually 
insignificant loans in the portfolio. 
The methods involve the use of statistically 
assessed historical information which is 
supplemented with significant management 
judgement to assess whether current economic and 
credit conditions are such that the actual level of 
inherent losses is likely to be greater or less than that 
suggested by historical experience. In normal 
circumstances, historical experience provides the 
most objective and relevant information from which 
to assess inherent loss within each portfolio, though 
sometimes it provides less relevant information 
about the inherent loss in a given portfolio at the 
balance sheet date, for example, when there have 
been changes in economic, regulatory or behavioural 
conditions which result in the most recent trends in 
portfolio risk factors being not fully reflected in the 
statistical models. In these circumstances, the risk 
factors are taken into account by adjusting the 
impairment allowances derived solely from 
historical loss experience. 
Risk factors include loan portfolio growth, 
product mix, unemployment rates, bankruptcy trends, 
geographical concentrations, loan product features, 
economic conditions such as national and local 
trends in housing markets, the level of interest rates, 
portfolio seasoning, account management policies 
and practices, changes in laws and regulations, and 
other influences on customer payment patterns. 
Different factors are applied in different regions 
and countries to reflect local economic conditions, 
laws and regulations. The methodology and the 
assumptions used in calculating impairment losses 
are reviewed regularly in the light of differences 
between loss estimates and actual loss experience. 
For example, roll rates, loss rates and the expected 
timing of future recoveries are regularly 
benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they 
remain appropriate. 
However, the exercise of judgement requires the 
use of assumptions which are highly subjective and 
very sensitive to the risk factors, in particular to 
changes in economic and credit conditions across 
a large number of geographical areas. Many of the 
factors have a high degree of interdependency 
and there is no single factor to which our loan 
impairment allowances as a whole are sensitive. They 
are particularly sensitive to general economic and 
credit conditions in North America, however. For 
example, a 10% increase in impairment allowances 
on collectively assessed loans and advances in North 
America would increase loan impairment allowances 
by US$0.9bn at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$1.3bn). 
It is possible that the outcomes within the next  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

financial year could differ from the assumptions built 
into the models, resulting in a material adjustment to 
the carrying amount of loans and advances. 
Goodwill impairment 
Our accounting policy for goodwill is described in 
Note 2p on the Financial Statements. Note 24 on the 
Financial Statements lists our cash generating units 
(‘CGU’s) by geographical region and global 
business. HSBC’s total goodwill amounted to 
US$22bn at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$23bn). 
The review of goodwill impairment reflects 
management’s best estimate of the following factors: 
• the future cash flows of the CGUs are sensitive 
to the cash flows projected for the periods for 
which detailed forecasts are available and to 
assumptions regarding the long-term pattern 
of sustainable cash flows thereafter. Forecasts 
are compared with actual performance and 
verifiable economic data, but they necessarily 
and appropriately reflect management’s view 
of future business prospects at the time of the 
assessment; and 
• the rates used to discount future expected cash 
flows are based on the costs of capital assigned 
to individual CGUs and can have a significant 
effect on their valuation. The cost of capital 
percentage is generally derived from a Capital 
Asset Pricing Model, which incorporates inputs 
reflecting a number of financial and economic 
variables, including the risk-free interest rate in 
the country concerned and a premium for the 
inherent risk of the business being evaluated. 
These variables are subject to fluctuations in 
external market rates and economic conditions 
beyond our control and therefore require the 
exercise of significant judgement and are 
consequently subject to uncertainty. 
A decline in a CGU’s expected cash flows 
and/or an increase in its cost of capital reduces the 
CGU’s estimated recoverable amount. If this is 
lower than the carrying value of the CGU, a charge 
for impairment of goodwill is recognised in our 
income statement for the year. 
The accuracy of forecast cash flows is subject to 
a high degree of uncertainty in volatile market 
conditions. In such market conditions, management 
retests goodwill for impairment more frequently than 
annually to ensure that the assumptions on which the 
cash flow forecasts are based continue to reflect 
current market conditions and management’s best 
estimate of future business prospects. 
During 2010, no impairment of goodwill was 
identified (2009: nil). In addition to the annual 
impairment test which was performed as at 1 July 
2010, management reviewed the current and expected 
performance of the CGUs as at 31 December 2010 
and determined that there was no indication of 
potential impairment of the goodwill allocated to 
them. However, in the event of a significant 
deterioration in economic and credit conditions 
compared with those reflected by management in 
the cash flow forecasts for the CGUs, a material 
adjustment to a CGU’s recoverable amount may 
occur which may result in the recognition of an 
impairment charge in the income statement. 
Note 24 on the Financial Statements includes 
details of the CGU’s with significant balances of 
goodwill, states the key assumptions used to assess 
the goodwill in each of those CGUs for impairment 
and provides a discussion of the sensitivity of the 
carrying value of goodwill to changes in key 
assumptions. 
Valuation of financial instruments 
Our accounting policy for determining the fair value 
of financial instruments is described in Note 2d on 
the Financial Statements.  
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price 
in an actively traded market. In the event that the 
market for a financial instrument is not active, a 
valuation technique is used. The majority of 
valuation techniques employ only observable market 
data and so the reliability of the fair value 
measurement is high. However, certain financial 
instruments are valued on the basis of valuation 
techniques that feature one or more significant 
market inputs that are unobservable. Valuation 
techniques that rely to a greater extent on 
unobservable inputs require a higher level of 
management judgement to calculate a fair value than 
those based wholly on observable inputs. 
Valuation techniques used to calculate fair 
values are discussed in Note 16 on the Financial 
Statements. The main assumptions and estimates 
which management consider when applying a model 
with valuation techniques are: 
• the likelihood and expected timing of future 
cash flows on the instrument. These cash flows 
are usually governed by the terms of the 
instrument, although judgement may be required 
when the ability of the counterparty to service 
the instrument in accordance with the 
contractual terms is in doubt. Future cash flows 
may be sensitive to changes in market rates;  35
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
• selecting an appropriate discount rate for 
the instrument. The determination of this rate 
is based on an assessment of what a market 
participant would regard as the appropriate 
spread of the rate for the instrument over the 
appropriate risk-free rate; and 
• judgement to determine what model to use to 
calculate fair value in areas where the choice of 
valuation model is particularly subjective, for 
example, when valuing complex derivative 
products.
When applying a model with unobservable 
inputs, estimates are made to reflect uncertainties 
in fair values resulting from a lack of market data 
inputs, for example, as a result of illiquidity in 
the market. For these instruments, the fair value 
measurement is less reliable. Inputs into valuations 
based on unobservable data are inherently uncertain 
because there is little or no current market data 
available from which to determine the level at which 
an arm’s length transaction would occur under 
normal business conditions. However, in most cases 
there is some market data available on which to base 
a determination of fair value, for example historical 
data, and the fair values of most financial 
instruments are based on some market observable 
inputs even when unobservable inputs are 
significant.
The value of financial assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value using a valuation technique 
was US$599bn (2009: US$599bn) and US$499bn 
(2009: US$447bn), respectively or 56% (2009: 56%) 
of total financial assets and 77% (2009: 75%) of 
total financial liabilities measured at fair value. 
Disclosures of the types and amounts of 
adjustments made in determining the fair value of 
financial instruments measured at fair value using 
valuation techniques, and a sensitivity analysis of 
fair values for financial instruments with significant 
unobservable inputs to reasonably possible 
alternative assumptions can be found in Note 16 on 
the Financial Statements. Given the uncertainty and 
subjective nature of valuing financial instruments at 
fair value, it is possible that the outcomes in the next 
financial year could differ from the assumptions 
used, and this could result in a material adjustment 
to the carrying amount of financial instruments 
measured at fair value. 
Impairment of available-for-sale financial 
assets
Our accounting policy for impairment of available-
for-sale financial assets is described in Note 2j on 
the Financial Statements. 
At 31 December 2010, our total available-for-
sale financial assets amounted to US$381bn (2009: 
US$352bn), of which US$373bn or 98% (2009: 
US$342bn; 97%) were debt securities. The 
available-for-sale fair value reserve relating to 
debt securities amounted to a deficit of US$6.2bn 
(2009: deficit of US$11.4bn). A deficit in the 
available-for-sale fair value reserve occurs on debt 
securities when the fair value of a relevant security 
is less than its acquisition cost (net of any principal 
repayments and amortisation) after deducting any 
previous impairment loss recognised in the income 
statement, but where there is no evidence of any 
impairment or, if an impairment was previously 
recognised, any subsequent impairment. 
Management is required to exercise judgement 
in determining whether there is objective evidence 
that an impairment loss has occurred. Once an 
impairment has been identified, the amount of 
impairment loss is measured with reference to the 
fair value of the asset. More information on 
assumptions and estimates requiring management 
judgement relating to the determination of fair 
values of financial instruments is provided above 
in ‘Valuation of financial instruments’. 
Deciding whether an available-for-sale debt 
security is impaired requires objective evidence of 
both the occurrence of a loss event and a related 
decrease in estimated future cash flows. The degree 
of judgement involved is less when cash flows 
are readily determinable, but increases when 
estimating future cash flows requires consideration 
of a number of variables, some of which may be 
unobservable in current market conditions. 
There is no single factor to which the Group’s 
charge for impairment of available-for-sale debt 
securities is particularly sensitive, because of the 
various types of securities we hold, the range of 
geographical areas in which those securities are held, 
and the wide range of factors which can affect the 
occurrence of loss events and the cash flows of 
securities, including different types of collateral. 
The most significant judgements concern more 
complex instruments, such as ABSs, where it is 
necessary to consider factors such as the estimated 
future cash flows on underlying pools of collateral 
including prepayment speeds, the extent and depth of 
market price declines and changes in credit ratings. 
The review of estimated future cash flows on 
underlying collateral is subject to uncertainties when 
the assessment is based on historical information on 
pools of assets, and judgement is required to 
determine whether historical performance remains  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

36
representative of current economic and credit 
conditions. 
Further details of the nature and extent of our 
exposures to ABSs classified as available-for-sale 
and a more detailed description of the assumptions 
and estimates used in assessing these securities for 
impairment, together with a discussion of those 
assets which are most sensitive to possible future 
impairment, are provided in ‘Securitisation 
exposures and other structured products’ on 
page 128. 
It is possible that outcomes in the next financial 
year could be different from those modelled when 
seeking to identify impairment on available-for-sale 
debt securities. In this event, impairment may be 
identified in available-for-sale debt securities which 
had previously been determined not to be impaired, 
potentially resulting in the recognition of material 
impairment losses in the next financial year. 
Deferred tax assets  
Our accounting policy for the recognition of deferred 
tax assets is described in Note 2s on the Financial 
Statements. The recognition of a deferred tax asset 
relies on an assessment of the probability and 
sufficiency of future taxable profits, future reversals 
of existing taxable temporary differences and 
ongoing tax planning strategies. 
The most significant judgements concern the US 
deferred tax assets, given the recent history of losses 
in our US operations. Net US deferred tax assets 
amounted to US$4bn or 58% (2009: US$5.1bn; 
59%) of deferred tax assets recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet. 
Recognition of US deferred tax assets is 
based on the evidence available about conditions 
at the balance sheet date, and requires significant 
judgements to be made regarding projections of loan 
impairment charges and the timing of recovery in 
the US economy. These judgements take into 
consideration the effect of both positive and negative  
evidence, including historical financial performance, 
projections of future taxable income, future 
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, 
tax planning strategies and the availability of loss 
carrybacks. 
Projections of future taxable income in the 
US are based on business plans, future capital 
requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies. 
These projections include assumptions about future 
house prices, US economic conditions, including 
unemployment levels and their impact on loan 
impairment charges, and capital support from HSBC 
Holdings. These forecasts are consistent with 
the assumption that it is probable that the results 
of future operations will generate sufficient taxable 
income to support the deferred tax assets. In 
management’s judgement, recent market conditions, 
which have resulted in losses being incurred in the 
US, will create significant downward pressure and 
volatility regarding the profit or loss before tax in 
the next few years. To reflect this, the assessment of 
recoverability of the deferred tax assets in the US 
significantly discounts any future expected taxable 
income and relies to a greater extent on capital 
support to the US operations from HSBC Holdings, 
including tax planning strategies implemented in 
relation to such support. 
The most significant tax planning strategy is the 
investment of capital in our US operations to ensure 
the realisation of the deferred tax assets. The transfer 
of a subsidiary as part of an internal reorganisation 
on 31 January 2010 provided substantial support 
for the recoverability of the US deferred tax assets. 
Management expects that, with support, our US 
operations will continue to execute their business 
strategies and plans until they return to profitability. 
If HSBC Holdings were to decide not to provide 
ongoing support, the full recovery of the deferred tax 
asset may no longer be probable and could result in a 
significant reduction of the deferred tax asset which 
would be recognised as a charge in the income 
statement.  37

Basis of preparation 
The results are presented in accordance with the accounting 
policies used in the preparation of HSBC’s consolidated 
financial statements. Our operations are closely integrated and, 
accordingly, the presentation of customer group and global 
business data includes internal allocations of certain items of 
income and expense. These allocations include the costs of 
certain support services and GMO functions, to the extent that 
these can be meaningfully attributed to operational business 
lines. While such allocations have been made on a systematic 
and consistent basis, they necessarily involve a degree of 
subjectivity.
Where relevant, income and expense amounts presented 
include the results of inter-segment funding as well as inter-
company and inter-business line transactions. All such 
transactions are undertaken on arm’s length terms. 
Summary
HSBC’s senior management reviews operating 
activity on a number of bases, including by 
geographical region and by customer group and 
global business. Capital resources are allocated and 
performance is assessed primarily by geographical 
region, as presented on page 50.  
The commentaries below present customer 
groups and global businesses followed by 
geographical regions. Performance is discussed in 
this order because certain strategic themes, business 
initiatives and trends affect more than one 
geographical region. All commentaries are on an 
underlying basis (see page 14) unless stated 
otherwise. All references to HSBC Finance and 
HSBC Bank USA are also on a management basis as 
loans referred to HSBC Bank USA from HSBC 
Finance are managed by the latter and all costs and 
benefits accrue thereto.

Significant increase

Strategic direction 
Our strategy for PFS is to use our global reach and scale to grow 
profitably in selected markets by providing relationship banking 
and wealth management services. PFS employs two globally 
consistent propositions in Premier and Advance and focuses on 
deepening customer relationships and increasing the penetration of 
wealth management services. In markets where we already have 
scale or where scale can be built over time, we provide services to 
all customer segments. In other markets, we participate more 
selectively, targeting mass affluent customers which have strong 
international connectivity or where our global scale is crucial.

Review of performance  
• PFS reported a profit before tax of US$3.5bn 
compared with a reported and underlying loss of 
US$2.1bn in 2009. This was largely attributable 
to a decline in loan impairment charges in the US 
and the managed reduction of certain higher risk 
portfolios in Latin America, Asia and the Middle 
East. Performance improved in all regions as the 
credit quality of our lending portfolios generally 
rose and revenue grew in Asia and Europe, 
reflecting higher investment-related income, 
increased insurance revenue in Hong Kong and 
mortgage lending growth combined with wider 
spreads in the UK. Income from associates, 
particularly Ping An Insurance, increased, driven 
by strong sales growth. 
• Revenue fell, largely in HSBC Finance, due to 
lower lending balances in both the run-off 
portfolio and in the Card and Retail Services 
business. Card fees also decreased in North 
America following the implementation of the 
CARD Act. Revenue was further affected by an 
adverse fair value movement related to the non-
qualifying hedges recorded in HSBC Finance 
compared with a favourable movement in 2009, 
as long-term interest rates declined. 
• We continued to invest in our business by hiring 
new relationship managers, investing in systems 
and infrastructure and developing our product 
offerings. Operating expenses remained broadly 
unchanged as a rise in costs in Asia from 
increased headcount and higher marketing 
expenditure in support of business expansion 
was broadly offset by strict cost control across 
the Group and lower costs associated with the 
reduced scope of the business in the US. 
• Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions fell by 44% in the improved economic 
conditions, reflecting a decline in lending 
balances, enhanced collection processes and 
tighter lending criteria. The decline in lending 
was significant in the US as the run-off of the 
non-core portfolio continued and balances fell 
in the Card and Retail Services business, where 
there were fewer active accounts and customers 
reduced their credit card debt. In addition, certain 
higher risk portfolios in Latin America, Asia and 
the Middle East were managed down and 
repositioned to higher quality assets, resulting in 
an improvement in credit quality.  
• In the UK, we increased our market share of 
mortgage lending, while maintaining a 
conservative loan to value ratio on new 
business. We grew mortgage lending in Asia,  41
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
significantly in Hong Kong, where the 
introduction of HIBOR-linked mortgages drove 
volume growth and enabled us to maintain our 
market leadership. In Australia, Singapore and 
Malaysia we were able to grow mortgage 
volumes through targeted marketing campaigns. 
Customer account balances also grew, largely on 
the back of increased customer numbers in Asia 
and the UK. 
• HSBC Premier, our flagship global customer 
proposition, was available in 47 markets and 
had grown to 4.4m customers at the end of 
2010. We attracted over 980,000 net new 
customers in 2010, of whom over 50% were 
new to HSBC. 
• We made further progress in standardising our 
various offerings across the Group for emerging 
mass affluent customers with the continued 
transition of eligible customers to HSBC 
Advance, our second globally consistent 
proposition. At 31 December 2010, Advance 
had a customer base of 4.6 million and was 
available in 34 markets. 
• During 2010, HSBC’s Global View and Global 
Transfer online capabilities were extended to 
our Advance customer base. These services 
allow Premier and Advance customers to access 
and manage all their accounts through one 
single logon and transfer funds between their 
overseas accounts online. Both the volume and 
the value of transfers increased strongly during 
the year as our target customer base and general 
awareness of these services grew. 
• Our World Selection global investment offering 
continued to grow and is now available in 
26 markets with total assets under management 
of US$7.2bn at 31 December 2010.  
• We further enhanced our services and made 
banking easier for our customers with initiatives 
such as increased Saturday branch opening in 
the UK, the launch of retail renminbi wealth 
management products, mobile banking and 
online real time bond trading in Hong Kong, 
and the upgrading of the US automatic teller 
machine (‘ATM’) network to accept deposits.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Strategic direction 
CMB’s core strategy is focused on two key initiatives: 
• to be the leading international business bank in all our markets, 
leveraging HSBC’s extensive geographical network together 
with its product expertise in payments, trade, receivables 
finance and foreign exchange to actively support customers who 
are trading and investing internationally; and 
• to be the best bank for small and medium-sized enterprises in 
our largest markets.
For footnotes, see page 83.
Review of performance 
• In 2010, CMB reported profit before tax of 
US$6.1bn, 42% higher than in 2009 with growth 
across all regions. Excluding the gains from the 
sales in 2010 of HSBC Insurance Brokers and 
our stake in the Wells Fargo HSBC Trade Bank, 
and similar non-recurring items in 2009, (see 
page 14), profit before tax increased by 48%. 
The rise in profit reflected an improvement in 
the credit environment and strong growth in 
world trade. 
• Revenue grew by 8% to US$13.7bn, mainly in 
Asia, where we expanded customer lending 
significantly and increased our fee income 
from remittances, trade and investments. Our 
insurance operations also performed strongly 
in Asia, with an increased uptake of our life 
insurance products in Hong Kong. In North 
America, repricing initiatives led to a notable 
increase in revenue. 
• Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions declined by 46% to US$1.8bn with 
favourable variances in all regions as the credit 
environment improved and our exposure to 
higher risk portfolios was managed down. 
• Excluding CMB’s share of the non-recurring 
accounting gains related to the change in the UK 
pension scheme, (see page 26), operating 
expenses increased by 11% to US$6.8bn as we 
continued to invest for future revenue growth 
in those markets that we see as central 
to international connectivity. We hired more 
relationship managers in France, Brazil, Mexico 
and Hong Kong, and continued to invest in 
systems to improve our customer experience. 
As a result, our cost efficiency ratio rose to 
49.8% in 2010. 
• CMB’s share of income from associates grew 
by 33% to US$892m, notably in mainland 
China. 
• Customer lending balances rose by 21% to 
US$239bn, driven by increased demand in Asia 
as market sentiment improved, and growth in 
key developed markets such as France and the 
UK, where we actively supported corporates and 
SMEs in response to changes in the economy. 
Our corporate segment increased lending by 
25% to US$183bn, notably in Hong Kong and 
mainland China.  
• CMB attracted over half a million new 
customers in 2010, taking the total to 
3.6 million, and we grew customer account 
balances by 8%, with significant growth in Asia  43
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
where HSBC was ranked as the best cash 
management bank in 2010 by Euromoney.
• In line with our strategy to be the leading 
international business bank, we continued to 
pursue opportunities to expand our customer 
base of businesses that trade and invest 
internationally. In 2010, we opened CMB’s 
first corporate branch in Switzerland to enable 
our Swiss-based customers to access our 
international banking services, particularly in 
faster growing markets. In the UK, we recruited 
139 new International Commercial Managers to 
support the international expansion plans of UK 
businesses. 
• Our geographical presence across both 
developed and emerging markets allowed us to 
capitalise on the rising levels of international 
trade flows, notably in Asia and Europe, where 
we gained export market share in 2010. In 
the Middle East, we increased our lending 
to exporters in the region by 69%. In the United 
Arab Emirates (‘UAE’) specifically, our average 
lending to exporters more than doubled in 2010 
to US$700m.  
• The number of successful cross-border referrals 
increased by 77% compared with 2009, with 
a total transaction value in 2010 of almost 
US$15bn. Significantly, successful intra-Asia 
referrals doubled from 2009, while referrals 
from mainland China more than doubled 
reflecting the increased appetite of Chinese 
business to explore international opportunities. 
• CMB continued to demonstrate connectivity 
with other customer groups within HSBC. Our 
partnership with GB&M allowed us to support 
our customers in accessing capital markets to 
help them grow and expand internationally. 
Successful referrals from CMB represented 51% 
of total net new money generated from internal 
referrals to GPB in 2010, while 5% of new 
Premier accounts were referred from CMB.  
• CMB has a diverse suite of products to support 
businesses that trade internationally. We are the 
second largest export factor globally and, in 
2010, we launched our Receivables Finance 
proposition in Germany, Europe’s largest 
economy, which has rapidly growing export 
ties with Asia. In the UK, we increased 
international trade finance by 13%. In addition, 
we successfully piloted the Supplier Invoice 
Finance Scheme, a reverse factoring product, 
in India, mainland China and Hong Kong.  
• We became the first international bank to 
provide renminbi-denominated trade settlements 
across six continents in 2010 and we are one of 
the largest international banks in Hong Kong to 
offer renminbi products, with total transactions 
exceeding US$6.7bn in 2010. 
• Our Business Banking propositions are focused 
on better serving SMEs, especially those that 
trade internationally. At the end of 2010, we had 
over 3.4 million customers worldwide in the 
Business Banking segment, representing 55% of 
CMB’s total deposit balances and providing an 
important source of funding for our Corporate 
segment. 
• We continue to recognise the importance of 
SMEs to sustained economic recovery and 
provided working capital finance for this sector 
throughout 2010. In Hong Kong, we maintained 
our active participation in the Government 
Special Loan Guarantee Scheme, through which 
we provided US$1.5bn in SME financing in 
2010. In the UK, we increased new lending to 
SMEs by 19% in 2010, opened accounts for 
over 125,000 customers starting new businesses 
and added over 170 extra local business 
managers.  
• We continued to develop and improve our direct 
channels through enhanced telephone-based 
relationship management services in key 
markets, including the launch of smartphone 
services in Hong Kong. In the UK, we also 
launched straight-through foreign exchange 
services. Notably, we are now the leading direct 
bank in Europe with over one million SME 
business customers using our Business Internet 
Banking platform.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Strategic direction 
In 2010, GB&M continued to pursue its now well-established 
‘emerging markets-led and financing-focused’ strategy, 
encompassing HSBC’s objective to be a leading wholesale bank 
by:  
• utilising the Group’s extensive distribution network;
• developing GB&M’s hub-and-spoke business model; and 
• continuing to build capabilities in major hubs to support the 
delivery of an advanced suite of services to major government, 
corporate and institutional clients across the HSBC network. 
This combination of product depth and distribution strength is 
fundamental to meeting the needs of existing and new clients and 
allowing GB&M to achieve its strategic goals. 
For footnotes, see page 83.   
Review of performance 
• GB&M reported profit before tax of US$9.5bn, 
9% lower than in 2009. On an underlying basis, 
which excludes the gains resulting from the sale 
of Eversholt Rail Group and HSBC Private 
Equity (Asia) Ltd in 2010, profit before tax 
declined by 14%, driven by lower income from 
Balance Sheet Management and Credit and 
Rates trading and higher operating costs. 
Profitability benefitted from a significant 
reduction in loan impairment charges and other 
credit risk provisions. Operating results 
remained well diversified across our businesses 
with a strong contribution from emerging 
markets, where we continued to support existing 
and anticipated new business, including 
introducing a ‘China desk’ in the Middle East 
and a ‘Latam desk’ in Hong Kong.  
• Net operating income before loan impairment 
charges and other credit risk provisions 
decreased by 11%, mainly due to lower net 
interest income in Balance Sheet Management 
from the maturing of higher yielding positions, 
low interest rates and flattening yield curves. 
Lower trading income largely reflected 
uncertainty in the eurozone, particularly in the 
second half of 2010. This was offset in part by a 
net release of US$429m largely relating to 
legacy positions in Credit trading and monoline 
Credit exposures, compared with a reported 
write-down of US$331m in 2009, following a 
general improvement in ABS prices. Trading 
income also benefitted from a small favourable 
fair value movement on structured liabilities, 
compared with an adverse fair value movement 
in 2009, resulting in a reported favourable 
movement of US$466m. 
• Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions decreased by US$2.2bn. A US$1.2bn 
reduction in loan impairment charges to 
US$500m was driven by a general improvement 
in the credit environment and the non-recurrence 
of significant charges taken in relation to a small 
number of clients in 2009. Credit risk provisions 
on the available-for-sale portfolio decreased by 
US$981m to US$490m, of which US$444m 
related to ABSs, significantly lower than the 
US$1.5bn impairment reported in 2009, due to a 
slowing in the rate of anticipated losses in the 
underlying collateral pools.  
• Higher operating expenses in 2010 reflected the 
one-off payroll and bonus taxes in the UK and 
France on certain bonuses paid in respect of 
2009 totalling US$309m, the non-recurrence of 
an accounting gain related to a change in the   45

delivery of certain staff benefits in the main UK 
pension scheme in 2009, higher support costs 
and continued investment in strategic initiatives 
being undertaken to drive future revenue 
growth. These included the development of 
Prime Services and equity market capabilities 
and the expansion of the Rates and Foreign 
Exchange e-commerce platforms. The 
percentage of total reported compensation pool 
allocated in respect of performance in 2010 to 
revenues net of loan impairment charges 
(excluding payroll taxes levied on 2009 
bonuses) remained consistent with 2009 on a 
reported basis.
• Global Markets’ revenues were second only to 
the results recorded in 2009, demonstrating the 
continuing strength of our client-facing 
businesses. Trading income declined, driven by 
increased competition and reduced margins 
across core products. Credit and Rates were 
adversely affected by less favourable market 
conditions as European sovereign debt concerns 
resulted in increased economic uncertainty in 
the eurozone. Foreign Exchange revenues were 
lower, reflecting spread compression in the 
more competitive trading environment and a 
decline in market volatility. Investment in the 
Equities business, particularly the enhancement 
of the sales and trading platforms, led to 
increased market share in our target markets 
despite lower market volumes and increased 
competition. Securities Services income grew 
by 4%, with particularly strong performances in 
Asia driven by increasing market values and 
Latin America due to higher interest income. 
Asset and Structured Finance reported higher 
revenues from increased deal activity during the 
year.  
• Global Banking produced a robust performance 
as it continued the strategy of focusing on key 
client relationships to drive market share growth 
in event-driven and other ancillary businesses. 
A decrease in revenues from Financing and 
Equity Capital Markets was due to the adverse 
effect of continued spread compression. Higher 
project and export finance revenues were driven 
by increased deal volumes, while growth in 
revenue and market share was achieved in the 
advisory business. Equity Capital Markets 
revenues fell as total deal values declined due 
to a reduction in client activity. Despite the 
adverse effect of the continued low interest rate 
environment, Payments and Cash Management 
delivered a 6% increase in revenue driven by 
strong growth in transaction-driven fee income 
and customer account balances in Asia. 
• Revenues in Balance Sheet Management 
remained high by historical standards but, as 
expected, declined in 2010 as higher-yielding 
positions matured and the opportunity for 
reinvestment was limited by the prevailing low 
interest rate environment and flatter yield 
curves.
• Robust revenue growth was reported in Global 
Asset Management. Higher management fee 
income was recorded across all regions, most 
notably in our emerging markets businesses. 
Funds under management (‘FuM’) reached a 
year-end high of US$439bn at 31 December 
2010 of which emerging markets FuM, in 
countries outside North America, Western 
Europe, Japan and Australia, were US$145bn. 
Total FuM grew by 4% compared with 2009, 
benefiting from positive net inflows of 
US$16bn and strengthening market 
performance. New funds launched in the year 
included the Global High Income Fund and the 
MultiAlpha Global High Yield Bond Fund.  
• Principal Investments reported an increase 
in revenues as improved market conditions 
resulted in higher gains on sale and a reduction 
in impairments.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

GPB strives to be the world’s leading international private bank, 
recognised for excellent client experience and global connections. 
Our brand, capital strength, extensive global network and 
positioning provide a strong foundation from which GPB 
continues to attract and retain clients. Product and service 
leadership in areas such as alternative investments, foreign 
exchange, estate planning, credit and investment advice helps us 
meet the complex international financial needs of individuals and 
families.  
We are well-positioned for sustainable long-term growth 
through continuing investment in our people, integrated IT 
solutions and emerging markets-focused domestic operations, 
along with ensuring our cross-border business meets high 
standards in the evolving regulatory environment.  
For footnotes, see page 83.
Review of performance 
• Reported profit before tax was US$1.1bn, 5% 
below 2009 on a reported and an underlying 
basis, driven by lower net interest income as 
the persistent low interest rate environment 
continued to affect deposit spreads and higher 
operating expenses. Loan impairment charges fell 
following the non-recurrence of a single specific 
impairment charge in North America in 2009 and 
the release of several charges made in previous 
years as markets recovered.  
• Net fee income and trading income rose, notably 
in Asia, as improved client risk appetite led to 
higher levels of activity, an increase in transaction 
volumes and positive net inflows of client assets.  
• Operating expenses increased, reflecting the 
hiring of front-line staff to cover emerging 
markets as part of a long-term strategy to further 
strengthen our international network to better 
serve clients, along with investment in systems 
and higher compliance costs resulting from the 
evolving regulatory environment.

• Reported client assets, which include funds under 
management and cash deposits, increased by 
US$23bn due to net new money inflows 
compared with outflows in 2009, and favourable 
market movements. Net inflows benefitted from 
our strength in emerging markets, newly recruited 
key relationship managers, and cross-business 
referrals which generated US$8bn in 2010. This 
also resulted in an increase in ‘total client assets’, 
the equivalent to many industry definitions of 
assets under management which includes some 
non-financial assets held in client trusts, from 
US$460bn to US$499bn. Investor demand for 
alternatives, including real estate investments, 
also attracted strong inflows into HSBC 
Alternative Investments Limited.  
• The Family Office Partnership had a number 
of successes in its first full year, producing a 
complete range of corporate and personal 
solutions for top tier clients and strengthening 
its links with GB&M.  47

Notes 
• Reported loss before tax of US$1.2bn compared 
with a loss before tax of US$6.7bn in 2009. This 
included adverse movements of US$63m on 
the fair value of our own debt attributable to 
movements in credit spreads in 2010, compared 
with adverse movements of US$6.5bn in 2009. 
In addition, 2010 included gains of US$188m 
following the dilution of our holding in Ping An 
Insurance and US$62m on the reclassification of 
Bao Viet to an associate following the purchase 
of an additional 8% stake. On an underlying 
basis, the loss before tax increased by US$1.2bn 
to US$1.3bn. The main items reported under 
‘Other’, are described in footnote 44 on page 85. 
• Net trading expense of US$311m compared 
with income of US$276m in 2009. This change 
was largely attributable to fair value movements 
on cross-currency swaps used to economically 
hedge fixed rate long-term debt issued by HSBC 
Holdings. The adverse fair value movements of 
US$304m, which were driven by a decline in 
long-term US interest rates relative to sterling 
and euro rates, compared with favourable fair 
value movements of US$748m on these 
instruments in 2009. This was partly offset by 
the non-recurrence of fair value losses arising 
from the implied contingent forward contract 
entered into with the underwriters of our rights 
issue in 2009 and forward foreign exchange 
contracts associated with the rights issue, which 
were accounted as derivatives with fair value 
taken to profit or loss in 2009. 
• We recognised gains of US$194m and US$56m, 
respectively, from the sale and leaseback of our 
headquarters buildings in Paris and New York. 
These compared with more substantial 
underlying gains totalling US$667m (US$686m 
as reported) on the sale and leaseback of 
8 Canada Square, London and the sale of a 
property in Hong Kong in 2009.  
• Operating expenses rose by 24% to US$5.9bn as 
an increasing number of operational activities 
were centralised, notably in the US. These costs 
were previously incurred directly by customer 
groups, but are now recorded in ‘Other’ and 
charged to customer groups through a recharge 
mechanism with income reported as ‘Other 
operating income’. In addition, costs at our 
Group Service Centres rose by 6% as the 
number of migrated activities increased in line 
with our Global Resourcing model.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Economic background
After falling by 4.9% in 2009, UK Gross Domestic 
Product (‘GDP’) only partially recovered in 2010, 
rising 1.4%. This revival in activity was not reflected 
in a corresponding rise in employment, and the 
unemployment rate remained at 7.9% in the three 
months to November. Despite the general economic 
weakness, the annual rate of Consumer Price Index 
(‘CPI’) inflation rose during 2010, reaching 3.7% in 
December, partly because of the rise in value added 
tax to 17.5% in January, and increases in the price of 
food and energy following rapid gains in global 
commodity prices. Wage growth remained subdued, 
however, with average earnings rising just 2.0% in 
the year to December. The Bank of England chose to 
maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% throughout 2010. 
The eurozone economy also partially recovered 
during the year, with GDP rising 1.7% in 2010 
compared to 2009. The region benefitted from 
the pick-up in the world economy and some 
improvement in domestic demand. Within the 
region, Germany recorded the strongest growth rate 
with its GDP rising 3.5% in the year as a whole. The 
unemployment rate in the eurozone increased 
slightly to 10.0% by the end of 2010. The large 
increases in government debt that emerged in certain 
parts of the region in recent years began to put 
upward pressure on government bond yields during 
2010, and some governments encountered funding 
difficulties. In response, a temporary European 
support fund, the €440bn European Financial 
Stability Facility was created, and the EU set aside 
€60bn in a package named the European Financial 
Stabilisation Mechanism. Greece received a €110bn 
aid package provided jointly by the International 
Monetary Fund and eurozone governments. Ireland 
also drew on international assistance in December. 
The European Central Bank left its key interest rate 
at 1.0% throughout the year. 
Review of performance 
Our European operations reported a pre-tax profit of 
US$4.3bn, compared with US$4.0bn in 2009, an 
increase of 7%. In 2010, this included adverse fair 
value movements of US$198m due to the change in 
credit spreads on the Group’s own debt held at fair 
value, compared with adverse fair value movements 
of US$2.8bn in 2009. In addition, we made gains of 
US$107m on the disposal of the HSBC Insurance 
Brokers business and US$255m on the sale of 
Eversholt Rail Group. In 2009, we recorded a gain 
on the sale of the residual stake in our UK card 
merchant acquiring business. Excluding these items, 
underlying pre-tax profits decreased by 35%,   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

largely due to lower income from GB&M, whose 
exceptional results of 2009 were not repeated, and an 
unfavourable year on year movement in certain non-
qualifying hedges of US$1.1bn.  
GB&M results remained strong by historical 
standards. However, revenues decreased in 2010 
due to less favourable market conditions caused by 
the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis, 
particularly in the second half of the year, and lower 
revenues, as forecast, in Balance Sheet Management. 
In PFS, we continued to build long-term 
relationships through our Premier and Advance 
offerings, focusing on wealth management and 
secured lending. We increased our total UK 
mortgage market share to 5.2%, while maintaining a 
conservative new lending loan to value ratio of 54%. 
In CMB, we made further progress on our 
strategy of becoming the leading international 
business bank. We also expanded our business in 
Germany and launched in Switzerland. In the UK, 
we increased new lending to SMEs by 19% in 2010. 
Net interest income decreased by 7%. Balance 
Sheet Management revenues declined, as higher-
yielding positions matured, interest rates remained 
low and yield curves flattened in 2010. In Global 
Banking, tighter spreads in the lending business 
and lower average lending balances as customers 
reduced their debt also contributed to the decrease. 
Customer deposit spreads were adversely affected 
by the low interest rate environment and competition 
for deposits. These reductions were offset in part by 
growth in mortgage lending in the UK and improved 
asset spreads in both PFS and CMB. 
Net fee income increased by 7%, reflecting 
higher management fees due to an increase in the 
average value of funds under management, which 
arose from net inflows and higher market 
performance. Fees were also received for 
management services we provided to certain of our 
Structured Investment Conduits. Partly offsetting 
these increases were reductions in the levels of debt 
and equity issuance in the market, compared with the 
significant volumes seen in 2009. 53
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Net trading income decreased by 47% to 
US$2.9bn. Less favourable market conditions caused 
by the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis 
adversely affected Credit and Rates income. Spread 
compression from increased competition similarly 
affected foreign exchange revenues. In addition, net 
interest income earned on trading activities 
decreased, driven by reduced holdings of debt 
securities. These decreases were offset in part by 
lower net adverse fair value movements 
on structured liabilities.  
Net trading income also included adverse fair 
value movements of US$304m on non-qualifying 
hedges used to economically hedge fixed-rate 
long-term debt issued by HSBC Holdings. These 
movements were driven by the decline in long-term 
US dollar interest rates relative to sterling and euro 
rates in 2010, and compared with favourable fair 
value movements of US$748m on these instruments 
in 2009. 
Within our legacy Credit book, a net release of 
previous write-downs on ABSs and monoline 
exposures as asset prices improved was more than 
offset by the non-recurrence of gains in other parts 
of the business. 
Net income from financial instruments 
designated at fair value fell by US$808m. The 
growth in equity markets in 2010 was lower than in 
2009, resulting in lower investment gains recognised 
on the fair value of assets held to meet liabilities 
under insurance and investment contracts. To the 
extent that these gains accrued to policyholders 
holding unit-linked insurance policies and insurance 
or investment contracts with DPF, there was 
a corresponding decrease in ‘Net insurance 
claims incurred and movement in liabilities to 
policyholders’. In addition, adverse foreign 
exchange movements were reported in the year on 
foreign currency debt designated at fair value, issued 
as part of our overall funding strategy with an offset 
from trading assets held as economic hedges 
reported in ‘Net trading income’. 
Gains less losses from financial investments
increased by US$455m as improved market 
conditions led to gains on sale of private equity 
investments and lower impairment charges on 
certain available-for-sale investments.  
Net earned insurance premiums were in line 
with 2009. The decision in 2009 to place our UK 
motor insurance business into run-off resulted in no 
new premiums being written in 2010. In addition, a 
decision was taken during 2010 not to renew certain 
contracts in the Irish business. By contrast, we 
generated strong sales activity in the UK life and 
French insurance businesses. 
Other operating income decreased by US$193m 
because the gain on the sale and leaseback of our 
Paris headquarters building in 2010 was exceeded by 
the gain on the sale and leaseback of the Group’s 
London headquarters building in 2009. 
Net insurance claims incurred and movement in 
liabilities to policyholders decreased by 11%. This 
was driven by lower investment gains compared 
with 2009 and by the non-recurrence of the 
strengthening of reserves in 2009 on the now-closed 
UK motor insurance book which reflected the rising 
incidence and severity of claims at that time. The 
decision not to renew certain contracts in the Irish 
business resulted in a further decrease in claims. 
Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions decreased by 45% to US$3.0bn, reflecting 
the more stable credit environment and helped by 
mitigating actions taken by management. In GB&M, 
the improved credit outlook, loan restructuring 
activity, a release of previous collective impairments 
and lower specific impairment charges in 2010 
contributed to a decline in loan impairment charges 
and other credit risk provisions. Credit risk 
provisions on certain available-for-sale ABSs also 
reduced due to a slowing in the rate of anticipated 
losses in the underlying collateral pools.  
In CMB, the reduction in loan impairment 
charges and other credit risk provisions was largely 
due to an improvement in the UK property, retail 
and services sectors, with reductions also seen in our 
Continental European businesses. The improvement 
in economic conditions across the region and the 
effect of low interest rates also resulted in lower 
delinquencies in the PFS portfolios.  
Operating expenses in 2010 included one-off 
payroll and bonus taxes in the UK and France on 
certain bonuses paid in respect of 2009 totalling 
US$324m, primarily in GB&M. Operating expenses 
in 2009 included an accounting gain of US$480m 
(US$499m as reported) related to a change in the 
delivery of certain staff benefits in the main UK 
pension scheme. Excluding these items, operating 
expenses were 8% higher than in 2009. This was 
driven by continued strategic investments in people 
and infrastructure to support our customers, drive 
future growth and deliver sustainable long-term 
reductions in our cost base by re-engineering 
business processes. In addition, rental expenses 
increased following the sale and leaseback of our 
headquarters buildings in London and Paris. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

HSBC’s principal banking subsidiaries in Hong 
Kong are The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking 
Corporation Limited and Hang Seng Bank 
Limited. The former is the largest bank 
incorporated in Hong Kong and is our flagship 
bank in the Asia-Pacific region. It is one of Hong

The commentary on Hong Kong is on an underlying basis unless 
stated otherwise. 
Economic background
Relatively low interest rates and rapid growth in 
demand from mainland China contributed to Hong 
Kong’s economic recovery in 2010. GDP in the year 
was 6.8% higher than in 2009. A revival in both 
employment and wage growth helped to boost 
consumer demand. Inflationary pressures began to 
emerge in the second half of the year with the annual 
rate of CPI inflation rising to 3.1% in December. 
The government initiated a number of measures in 
November aimed at restricting the pace of price 
increases in the property market. 
Review of performance 
Our operations in Hong Kong reported pre-tax 
profits of US$5.7bn compared with US$5.0bn in 
2009, an increase of 13%. On an underlying basis, 
excluding accounting gains arising from the 
reclassification of Bao Viet as an associate and 
following the sale of HSBC Private Equity (Asia) 
Ltd, profit before tax increased by 11%.  
The increase in profitability was driven by 
strong revenue growth, particularly in investment 
and insurance product sales and trade-related fees, 
as we capitalised on the improved economic 
conditions. Lending balances rose, most notably in 
CMB and GB&M following a recovery in trade 
flows and strong economic growth. Customer 
deposit balances increased, reflecting growth in 
customer numbers in PFS and CMB. Loan 
impairment charges were significantly lower than 
in 2009 across all customer groups, reflecting an 
improvement in credit conditions. Revenue growth 
was in part offset by an increase in staff and IT costs 
driven by business expansion to maintain our strong 
market position.  
We retained our market leadership in residential 
mortgages, credit cards, life insurance and deposits. 
The Premier customer base increased by 31% 
compared with 31 December 2009 to more than 
500,000 customers. The Advance proposition, which 
was launched in early 2010, had a customer base 
of over 670,000 by the end of the year. In life 
insurance, we retained the number one market share 
position for new business annualised premiums as 
a result of successful sales activity and customer 
demand and a strategy targeted towards the high 
net worth customer segment. CMB’s cross-border 
referrals more than doubled with the increase in 
trade flows from mainland China. We continued the 
development of offshore renminbi-related products 
and maintained our position as a market leader for 
renminbi products in Hong Kong.   57

Net interest income was broadly in line with 2009, as 
strong loan growth was partly offset by lower 
spreads resulting from competitive pressures and the 
low interest rate environment. In Balance Sheet 
Management, net interest income decreased as yield 
curves flattened, higher yielding positions matured 
and funds were reinvested at lower rates. 
The recovery in trade volumes in 2010 and the 
pursuit of CMB’s leading international bank for 
business strategy resulted in significant growth in 
commercial lending, notably in commercial, industrial 
and trade related lending. To a lesser extent, growth 
was also noted in commercial real estate, supported 
by a buoyant property market. Average personal 
lending balances also rose, driven by strong growth 
in residential mortgage lending, where we continued 
to lend conservatively with average loan-to-value 
ratios of 55% on new mortgage drawdowns and 
an estimated 38% on the overall portfolio.  
Asset spreads narrowed as a result of 
competitive pressures, particularly in trade-related 
lending and HIBOR-linked residential mortgages. 
The growth in customer numbers in the Premier 
proposition in PFS and new-to-bank customers in 
CMB resulted in increased customer deposits. The 
benefit of the higher average deposit balances was 
limited by narrower deposit spreads as interest rates 
remained at historically low levels. 
Net fee income increased by 11%, primarily due 
to an increase in sales of investment products driven 
by improved market sentiment and successful sales 
campaigns, and growth in trade-related fees and 
income from Payments and Cash Management 
as volumes improved. Fees from funds under 
management also grew as a result of higher net 
inflows and improved fund performance, while 
underwriting fees rose due to several significant 
initial public offerings (‘IPO’s) and loan 
syndications concluded in 2010.  
Net trading income was 7% higher than in 2009. 
Increased holdings of debt securities led to a rise in 
net interest income from trading activities. Foreign 
exchange revenues benefitted from increased 
turnover due to high levels of client demand. This 
was partly offset by lower revenues from Credit 
trading, following the strong results achieved in 
2009 as credit spreads narrowed, and from Rates 
trading as market volatility reduced in 2010.  
Net income from financial instruments 
designated at fair value was US$384m compared 
with US$784m in 2009. The movement was 
primarily due to lower revaluation gains in 2010 on 
assets held to support linked insurance liabilities, 
where the value of our liabilities to policyholders is 
determined in line with the value of supporting 
assets. To the extent that these lower investment 
gains were attributed to policyholders, there was a 
corresponding decrease in Net insurance claims 
incurred and movement in liabilities to policyholders.
Net earned insurance premiums grew by 18% to 
US$4.3bn as successful sales campaigns drove 
strong growth, particularly in deferred annuity and 
unit-linked products. A life insurance product 
targeted at high net worth individuals also performed 
well. Growth in the insurance business resulted in a 
related increase in ‘Net insurance claims incurred 
and movement in liabilities to policyholders’.
Other operating income increased by 21% to 
US$1.5bn due to an increase in PVIF reflecting 
higher life insurance sales, partly offset by the non-
recurrence of a gain on sale of a property in 2009. 
Loan impairment charges and other credit 
risk provisions decreased by 77% to US$114m, 
reflecting the recovery in economic conditions. Lower 
specific impairment charges in CMB and GB&M were 
incurred as credit conditions improved and loan 
impairment charges fell in PFS, mainly on unsecured 
lending as unemployment and bankruptcy levels fell.  
Operating expenses rose by 12% as the business 
grew and the economy recovered. Staff costs grew 
as we recruited in a competitive market and from 
general wage increases, while bonuses rose in line 
with the strong business performance. Marketing 
costs rose notably in PFS due to the launch of 
several large campaigns, including Advance and 
credit cards promotions and rising transaction 
volumes led to higher back office and support costs.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

The commentary on Rest of Asia-Pacific is on an underlying basis 
unless stated otherwise. 
Economic background
Economic activity accelerated in mainland China,
building on the recovery which began in 2009. 
Annual GDP growth peaked at 11.9% in the first 
quarter of the year, as resilient domestic demand 
coincided with an acceleration in export growth as 
world demand recovered. Investment growth 
remained strong amid large scale government 
infrastructure projects and construction of public 
housing. Meanwhile, consumer spending was 
boosted by robust growth in employment and wages. 
In the final months of 2010, inflation became more 
of a concern, with the annual rate of CPI inflation 
rising to 4.6% in December. The People’s Bank of 
China increased the commercial banking sector’s 
required Statutory Deposit Ratio by 4.5 percentage 
points to 19.5% (for major banks) and 17.0% (for 
the rest) and raised the policy rate by 50 basis points 
over the course of the year. The renminbi exchange 
rate rose by 3% against the US dollar throughout the 
course of the year.  
Japan’s economic conditions improved in 2010, 
led mainly by a recovery in world trade, though 
unemployment remained at about 5% throughout 
the year. The Bank of Japan introduced a new 
programme of monetary stimulus in October 2010, 
aimed at curbing yen appreciation and reducing the 
deflationary pressures evident in the economy.  
Elsewhere in the region, economies rebounded 
strongly, with growth in external demand a common 
feature. Comparing the third quarter of 2010 with the 
same period in 2009, GDP in Taiwan grew by 9.8%, 
in South Korea by 4.4% and in India by 8.9%. In 
the last, concerns emerged over the rate of wholesale 
price inflation, which rose to 8.4% in December. In 
Singapore, GDP growth was volatile as activity in 
the pharmaceutical sector fluctuated, contracting at 
an annualised rate of nearly 19% in the third quarter 
but rising 6.9% in the fourth quarter. Malaysian
GDP, boosted by private consumption and exports, 
rose by 5.3% year on year in the third quarter, after 
surging 10.1% in the first quarter and 8.9% in the 
second quarter. In Thailand, the re-emergence of 
political risks in the second quarter of 2010 appeared 
not to dent household consumption or foreign direct 
investment. Foreign direct investment into 
Indonesia underpinned GDP growth of 5.8% in the 
third quarter. The economies of the Philippines and 
Vietnam also grew strongly. In Australia growth 
was more modest, in part because of a rise in the 
Reserve Bank of Australia’s interest rate to 4.75% in 
the second half of the year. Activity in the mining 
sector continued to grow rapidly.  61

Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Geographical regions > Rest of Asia-Pacific

Review of performance 
Our operations in the Rest of Asia-Pacific region 
reported pre-tax profits of US$5.9bn compared with 
US$4.2bn in 2009, an increase of 41%. Reported 
profits included an accounting gain of US$188m 
arising from the dilution of HSBC’s shareholding 
in Ping An Insurance following its issue of share 
capital to a third party in 2010. On an underlying 
basis, which excludes this dilution gain, pre-tax profit 
rose by 29% as business volumes increased across 
many countries and all customer groups as the 
economic environment in the region improved.  
The economic performance of the region was 
reflected in a recovery in trade volumes, an increase 
in our customers’ appetite for investment-related 
products, strong growth in lending balances and 
a significant decline in loan impairment charges. 
All these factors contributed to an increase in our 
profitability, as did a rise in our share of profit from 
associates in mainland China. Operating expenses 
increased to support this business growth.  
During 2010 we continued to target growth, 
particularly in the key regional markets of mainland 
China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and 
Australia. We consolidated our position as the leading 
foreign bank in mainland China with 106 outlets in 
27 cities, 16 rural bank outlets and 38 Hang Seng 
Bank outlets in 13 cities. We maintained our 
leadership in the development of renminbi products 
and now have renminbi capabilities in 36 countries 
across all six continents. In July 2010 we agreed to 
acquire a substantial part of The Royal Bank of 
Scotland Group plc’s commercial and retail 
businesses in India. In Malaysia, four additional 
Amanah branches were opened.  
Our focus on higher value segments was 
reflected in the Premier customer base in the region 
which grew by 33% while the Advance proposition 
was launched in nine markets, exceeding 660,000 
customers by the year end. In CMB, we continued to 
build on our international connectivity, with 
cross-regional referrals nearly doubling as we 
pursued our objective to be the leading international 
business bank.  
Net interest income was broadly in line with 
2009 as strong loan growth was offset by narrower 
asset spreads in the face of strong competition. 
Higher average lending balances resulted from 
business growth in GB&M and CMB across the 
region, reflecting the recovery in trade activity. 
Average PFS lending balances also rose, mainly in 
the mortgage book, most notably in Australia, 
Singapore and Malaysia, as well as in Taiwan and 
mainland China, supported by successful marketing 
campaigns. 
The narrower asset spreads were also the 
consequence of a shift to lower risk customers 
following the managed reduction of certain 
unsecured lending portfolios, particularly in India. 
Average customer deposit balances grew, 
primarily in mainland China, Australia and 
Singapore as a result of a targeted strategy to expand 
the customer base. 
Balance Sheet Management income declined 
from 2009 as higher yielding trades matured, interest 
rates generally remained low and yield curves 
flattened.
Net fee income was 16% higher. An 
improvement in equity markets and inflows of funds 
under management drove a significant increase in 
fee income in GB&M while, in CMB, the recovery 
in trade activity led to higher trade-related fees and 
credit facilities. In PFS, fee income also rose from 
the increased sales of investment and insurance 
products.
Net trading income declined by 7%, as reduced 
market volatility led to lower Rates trading income. 
In India, trading income further declined as gains 
achieved in 2009 from narrowing bond yields did not 
recur while in South Korea, lower trading revenues 
reflected the non-recurrence of one-off gains 
recognised in 2009. These were partly offset by 
higher foreign exchange income in mainland China 
and wider margins in India as a result of strong client 
volumes in the growing economies and a rise in 
interest income from trading activities resulting from 
increased holdings of debt securities. 
Net income from financial instruments 
designated at fair value fell by US$95m. The 
movement was due to lower revaluation gains 
in 2010 than in 2009 on assets held to support 
insurance contracts. To the extent that these lower 
investment gains were attributed to policyholders, 
there was a corresponding decrease in ‘Net insurance 
claims incurred and movement in liabilities to 
policyholders’. 
Gains less losses from financial investments
were US$141m compared with losses of US$15m 
in 2009, as a result of a gain on disposal of an equity 
investment in a Singaporean property company 
and gains on sales of other available-for-sale 
investments. Impairments reported in 2009 did not 
recur in 2010. 
Other operating income increased by 8% to 
US$1.4bn, largely due to an increase in PVIF,  63
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
reflecting higher life insurance sales in the region 
and recoveries against initial fair value on loan 
portfolios acquired with Bank Ekonomi in Indonesia 
and from The Chinese Bank Co., Ltd in Taiwan. 
Net earned insurance premiums increased by 
15% to US$448m, largely due to higher sales in 
Malaysia, Taiwan and mainland China, primarily 
from successful product launches and marketing 
campaigns.  
Growth in the insurance business resulted in a 
related increase in Net insurance claims incurred 
and movement in liabilities to policyholders which 
was more than offset by the decrease corresponding 
to the lower investment gains reported above in ‘Net
income from financial instruments designated at fair 
value’.
Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions decreased by 55% to US$439m. As 
economic and credit conditions improved across the 
region, loan impairment charges fell in PFS, most 
notably in India as certain unsecured lending portfolios 
were managed down, and fewer specific impairments 
were recognised in CMB. Partly offsetting this 
improvement were specific impairment charges 
booked in GB&M. 
Operating expenses increased by 8% to US$5.1bn 
in support of business growth and to capitalise on the 
region’s economic recovery. Examples were the 
continuing expansion of the branch network in 
mainland China and the opening of the new 
headquarters building in Shanghai, as well as local 
incorporation and expansion of the Taiwan operations. 
Staff numbers rose to support business expansion, 
particularly in the key regional markets of mainland 
China, Australia, Singapore and Indonesia. Business 
initiatives were supported by marketing campaigns in 
most markets and higher transaction volumes which 
led to increased processing costs. 
Share of profit from associates and joint ventures
in the region increased by 45%, with a higher 
contribution from Ping An Insurance driven by strong 
sales growth. The share of profit from Bank of 
Communications also increased due to growth in 
lending and higher fee income from cards, wealth 
management and settlement activity. Growth in 
lending and an increase in fee income led to a higher 
contribution from Industrial Bank.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Economic background  
Economic activity in much of the Middle East 
showed signs of stabilising during 2010. A 30% year 
on year rise in average oil prices led to a marked 
strengthening of public finances in the Gulf states, 
allowing governments such as Saudi Arabia to 
boost public current and capital spending. The high 
and stable average oil prices also improved external 
account positions in the Gulf, leading to an increase 
in reserves and overall net foreign asset 
accumulation following the modest drawdowns in 
2009.
As well as receiving support from rising public 
spending, non-oil goods and service exporters in the 
region also benefitted from rising external demand, 
particularly from Asia. The UAE was a leading 
beneficiary, most notably in its transport and 
logistics sectors. Banking sector activity remained 
relatively subdued, with rates of credit growth flat or 
negative in real terms across much of the region. 
This contributed to subdued consumer and asset 
price inflation. Although there was some evidence in 
Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait that stronger 
growth and higher commodity prices were putting 
pressure on prices in late in 2010, the pace of 
increase remained below that seen in other emerging 
markets. Inflation was largely absent in the UAE. 
Dubai had another challenging year in 2010, as 
it continued to struggle with high levels of debt, 
falling real estate prices and a stagnant credit market. 
Although no figures have been released, officials 
estimated in October that real GDP was likely to 
have grown by 2.3% in 2010, mostly from global 
trade as exports rose 35% in the year to the third 
quarter. The domestic economy was considerably 
weaker through most of the year although there were 
signs of an improvement by the year end.  
In Egypt, GDP growth returned to 6% by the 
end of 2010, driven primarily by domestic demand. 
Egypt’s structural economic strengths leave us 
positive on the medium-term outlook, although 
recent political turmoil might overshadow its near-
term prospects. 
Review of performance 
Our operations in the Middle East reported pre-tax 
profits of US$892m, an increase of US$437m 
compared with 2009.  
In October 2010, we completed the sale of our 
investment in the British Arab Commercial Bank, on 
which a loss of US$42m was recorded. On an  67

underlying basis and excluding this loss, pre-tax 
profits increased by US$481m.  
Profits increased strongly in the second half of 
2010 compared with the first half of the year, 
reflecting increased stability in the regional economy 
and growing momentum in several of the key 
markets. 
The improvement in the credit environment and 
our risk management actions combined to contribute 
to significantly lower loan impairment charges and 
other credit risk provisions. The benefit was partly 
offset by lower revenues from the run-off of higher 
yielding unsecured loans, mainly in the UAE. 
Our Premier and Advance customer base 
continued to grow in line with our strategy to build 
a sustainable wealth-driven, premium-based PFS 
business, with Premier attracting 35,000 net new 
customers in the year, of whom 19,000 were new to 
the Group. During 2010, we launched the Advance 
proposition across most of the region and the number 
of customers reached 152,000 at 31 December 2010. 
The opening of our 100th branch in Egypt is an 
example of initiatives to expand our regional 
presence. 
In CMB, we continued to build on our 
competitive advantage in international connectivity. 
The increased opportunities to support business and 
trade flows between the region and the rest of the 
world, particularly mainland China and India, led to 
strong trade-related revenues and supported our 
market-leading position in this business. As a result, 
we gained market share in our key markets and 
received several awards for trade services including 
‘Leading Trade Services Bank in the Middle East 
and North Africa’ which was awarded by Global
Trade Review for the fourth consecutive year.  
As part of our continued support to local 
internationally-focused businesses, we fully 
allocated the pledged US$100m fund to UAE SME 
customers engaged in international cross-border 
business. 
In GB&M we continued to invest in the region 
to support existing and anticipated new business and 
we now have a fully functional dealing room in Abu 
Dhabi and a ‘China desk’ in the UAE to support 
‘East-East’ business. We continued to be recognised 
as the dominant player in regional bond markets and  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

won several awards, including ‘Best Investment 
Bank in the Middle East’ awarded by Euromoney.
Net interest income decreased by 8% as average 
lending balances declined in both PFS and CMB, the 
proportion of higher yielding assets fell and the cost 
of liquidity remained high.  
In PFS, spreads narrowed as we focused new 
lending on Premier and Advance customers, while 
concurrently managing down higher risk unsecured 
lending balances, mostly in the UAE. 
In CMB, asset balances and net interest income 
rose throughout the second half of 2010 as 
increasing trade finance balances contributed to 
growing revenues.  
Average customer accounts declined as 
corporate customers reduced their deposits in 
response to tighter liquidity in the local markets. 
This was partly offset by an increase in average 
liability balances in PFS, which was driven by 
successful deposit campaigns launched in 2010 and 
by the acquisition of Premier and A dvance 
customers. Our overall liquidity position improved 
although the market returns on the deployment of 
liquidity remained low. 
Net fee income increased by 8%, primarily 
driven by higher volumes of credit facilities related 
to trade, guarantees and remittances in CMB. The 
benefit was partly offset by lower advisory revenues 
from equity capital markets in GB&M as a result of 
limited issuances in the regional equity markets. 
Net trading income fell by 6% to US$370m. 
Subdued trading conditions and the non-recurrence 
of gains which had resulted from the tightening of 
credit spreads on certain positions in early 2009 
resulted in lower Credit trading income. Foreign 
exchange income decreased with the easing in 
market volatility as speculation regarding the 
unpegging of Gulf currencies from the US dollar 
receded.
Other operating income declined by US$37m as 
gains arising in 2009 from the buy-back and 
extinguishment of own debt did not recur.  
Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions decreased by 53%. An overall 
improvement in credit conditions in the region along 
with enhanced collections processes, improvements 
in the quality of our customer base and a reduction 
in unsecured lending resulted in significantly lower 
net collective impairment provisions, notably in the 
UAE, and lower requirements for specific corporate 
provisions. 
In PFS, strengthened collections processes 
and a repositioning of the loan book contributed to 
lower delinquency rates. In CMB, loan impairment 
charges and other credit risk provisions decreased 
due to significantly lower net collectively assessed 
impairment charges and fewer specific loan 
impairment charges, with the majority of the charge 
in 2010 relating to a small number of large corporate 
customers.  
Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions in GB&M rose, mainly from restructuring 
activity which drove UAE-related loan impairments 
for a small number of large corporate customers in 
the first half of 2010. The improvement in economic 
conditions during the latter part of 2010 resulted in 
lower loan impairment charges in the second half of 
the year. 
Operating expenses increased by 8%, driven by 
increased investment in marketing and advertising, 
including key sponsorship deals and the promotion 
of the HSBC brand through strategic messaging in 
the Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports, together with an 
increase in premises and people costs, mainly from 
the investment in the branch network expansion in 
Egypt.
Profit from associates and joint ventures
decreased by 5%. The contribution from The 
Saudi British Bank was lower as revenue fell in 
challenging operating conditions.  69

Economic background
The economic recession in the US officially ended in 
the middle of 2009 but, given its depth and duration, 
the subsequent recovery was disappointing. In 2010, 
GDP expanded by 2.9%. The initial stage of the 
recovery was helped by tax reductions and direct 
subsidies for home purchases, but the growth 
momentum faded as their impact waned. In addition, 
fiscal tightening by state and local governments 
intensified, leading to spending cutbacks and job 
cuts that adversely affected consumer confidence 
and the rate of growth of consumer spending. 
Unemployment fell from 10.0% in the fourth quarter 
of 2009 to 9.4% by the end of 2010. The annual rate 
of ‘core’ inflation (excluding food and energy 
products) fell steadily during the year to 0.8% in 
December, the smallest rate of annual increase in 
the 50 year history of the series.  
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Federal 
Reserve launched a US$600bn programme of large 
scale asset purchases to ease monetary conditions. 
Asset prices rebounded and consumer spending 
picked up sharply, helping to renew economic 
activity.  
In the year ended November 2010, Canadian 
GDP rose by 3.0%, compared with a decline of 1.2% 
in the year to November 2009, driven by housing 
construction, consumer spending and inventory 
restocking. Employment growth in the first half of 
2010 was strong and the unemployment rate fell to 
7.6% in December 2010 from the high of 8.7% in 
2009. CPI inflation remained close to the Bank of 
Canada’s 2% target through much of 2010 but the 
recovery in economic activity prompted the central 
bank to begin normalising the policy rate from a 
low of 0.25% to 1.0% by October. 
Review of performance 
In North America, a reported profit before tax of 
US$454m in 2010 compared with a loss of 
US$7.7bn in 2009. On an underlying basis, the pre-
tax profit of US$246m compared with a pre-tax loss 
of US$4.0bn. The improved performance was 
largely due to a marked decline in loan impairment 
charges in our Card and Retail Services business and 
run-off portfolios, partly offset by lower revenue 
reflecting a reduction in lending balances, the effects 
of the CARD Act (see page 19) and adverse fair 
value movements on non-qualifying hedges. 
Our results in 2011 will continue to be affected 
in general terms by the strength of the US economy

our business and, specifically, by the extent to which 
unemployment rates improve and the recovery in the 
housing market is sustained. 
In 2010, we continued to reposition our core 
businesses and we remained focused on managing 
down our run-off assets. In addition, we made 
progress with the changes required to conform with 
new regulatory frameworks and policies. 
In our core PFS business, we continued to grow 
our Premier proposition, with customer numbers 
increasing by 37% to over 700,000, and we expanded 
our branch network, opening five new branches in 
the states of California, Maryland and Virginia. Our 
Card and Retail Services business continued to be 
profitable, despite a decline in lending balances as 
customers reduced their outstanding credit card debt. 
In CMB, we increased pre-tax profits by 51% to 
US$873m as credit quality improved and we grew our 
revenue through repricing. In line with our global 
strategy to be the leading international business bank, 
CMB actively targeted the growing number of 
companies with international banking requirements 
achieving a 28% increase in referral volumes to other 
HSBC sites, and GB&M drove cross-regional and 
cross-customer group connectivity. GB&M and GPB 
also continued to appeal to internationally focused 
customers, attracted by the Group’s presence in both 
emerging and developed markets. 
Net interest income fell by 10% to US$12.4bn as 
customer lending balances declined, mainly in HSBC 
Finance, due to the run-off of the residual balances 
in our Mortgage Services, Consumer Lending and 
vehicle finance portfolios. We took additional steps 
during 2010 to accelerate this process, selling 
US$1.0bn in vehicle finance loans in March and the 
remainder of the portfolio (US$4.3bn) in August to 
the same purchaser. Lower balances in our Card and 
Retail Services business reflected a decline in active 
accounts, actions taken to mitigate risk and an 
increased focus by our customers on reducing their 
credit card debt. 
Asset spreads in Mortgage Services and 
Consumer Lending widened, reflecting lower funding 
costs and higher yields resulting from lower levels of 
modified loans and delinquent balances. In our Card 
and Retail Services portfolio asset spreads also 
widened due to lower funding costs, re-pricing 
initiatives and contract re-negotiation with certain 
merchants, partly offset by the effects of the CARD 
Act.
Average customer deposit balances increased in 
PFS and CMB as we continued to grow our 
customer base. In GB&M, our increased deposit 
base reflected a rise in repurchase transactions. 
Deposit spreads improved, despite falling interest 
rates, mainly due to repricing as competitive 
pressures eased. 
Lower net interest income from Balance Sheet 
Management reflected the sales and maturities of 
higher yielding assets and the reinvestment of the 
proceeds into lower yielding, lower risk assets.  73
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Net fee income fell by 25% to US$3.7bn. Lower 
transaction volumes, a reduction in customer 
spending and customers actively seeking to reduce 
credit card debt improved delinquency trends, and 
the effects of changes required by the CARD Act led 
to lower late and overlimit fees in our Card and 
Retail Services business.  
Net trading income of US$314m was 8% lower 
than in 2009, primarily because of US$353m adverse 
fair value movements in non-qualifying hedges due 
to the decrease in long-term US interest rates. This 
compared with US$184m in favourable fair value 
movements on these instruments in 2009. The 
majority of these instruments were interest rate 
swaps used to economically hedge floating rate debt 
issued by HSBC Finance. The debt was issued to 
offset the increase in the duration of the company’s 
mortgage portfolio resulting from lower prepayment 
rates and the corresponding rise in interest rate risk. 
In 2010, we increased our estimates of exposure 
on repurchase obligations associated with loans 
previously sold, primarily to Government-sponsored 
enterprises (‘GSE’s), which reduced our trading 
income by US$341m compared with US$65m in 
2009. This related mainly to mortgages originated 
through broker channels. These trading losses were 
partly offset by a rise in GB&M, despite lower 
revenue from Rates, as write-backs on legacy 
positions in Credit trading compared with write-
downs in 2009. 
Net expense from financial instruments 
designated at fair value of US$31m compared with 
net income of US$192m in 2009. This was due to 
adverse fair value movements from interest rate 
ineffectiveness in the economic hedging of our 
long-term debt. In 2009, fair value movements 
on economic hedges resulted in net income. 
Gains less losses from financial investments
declined by 52% due to lower gains from asset sales 
in the available-for-sale portfolio, undertaken to 
reduce the overall level of balance sheet risk. 
Net earned insurance premiums and Net
insurance claims incurred and movement in 
liabilities to policyholders both declined. Lower 
premiums reflected a fall in sales of payment 
protection products following the discontinuance of 
mortgage originations in HSBC Finance. Claims and 
reserves declined as the lending balances and 
associated in-force insurance contracts reduced. 
Other operating income declined by 70% to 
US$167m as we recognised a loss of US$207m on 
the sale of our vehicle finance loan portfolio and 
loan servicing platform. In addition, gains in 2009 
from the sale of residential mortgages and the 
refinement of the income recognition methodology 
of long-term insurance contracts did not recur. This 
was partly offset by a gain on the sale of our New 
York headquarters building in 2010. 
Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions decreased by 47% to US$8.3bn, the 
lowest level since 2006. Although most significant 
in PFS, the decline was across all businesses as the 
economy generally improved in 2010.  
Loan impairment charges in Card and Retail 
Services declined by 57%, reflecting lower lending 
balances and an increased focus by our customers 
on reducing outstanding credit card debt. There was 
also an overall improvement in the credit quality of 
the portfolio, with lower delinquency levels and 
better delinquency roll rates.  
Loan impairment charges in our Mortgage 
Services and Consumer Lending businesses fell 
by 29% as balances continued to run-off and 
delinquent balances reduced. Loss severity also 
improved reflecting an increase in deed-in-lieu and 
short sales agreements, both of which result in lower 
losses than foreclosed loans. 
As a result of investigations into the foreclosure 
practices of certain mortgage service providers, there 
could be additional delays in the processing of 
foreclosures. See page 83 for more information. 
In GB&M, a net release of loan impairment 
charges and other credit risk provisions of US$184m 
compared with a reported net charge of US$621m in 
2009. This reflected an improvement in the credit 
environment and a release of impairments on 
available-for-sale ABSs. In CMB, loan impairment 
charges declined as the improved economic 
conditions resulted in credit upgrades on certain 
accounts and fewer downgrades across all business 
lines. Further commentary on delinquency trends in 
the US PFS portfolios is provided on page 110. 
Operating expenses fell by 2% to US$8.3bn, 
reflecting the non-recurrence of restructuring costs 
following the closure of the Consumer Lending 
branch network in 2009 and the reduced scope of our 
business operations in the US as we ran off the 
legacy portfolios in HSBC Finance. In addition, we 
recorded a pension curtailment gain in 2010 and 
deposit insurance costs declined as a 2009 special 
assessment did not recur. These reductions were 
partly offset by a rise in marketing expenses in 
Card and Retail Services, an increase in litigation 
provisions and higher regulatory and compliance 
costs.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Economic background
The Brazilian economy expanded at its fastest rate 
in three decades in 2010, with GDP growing 7.5% 
on an annual basis in the third quarter. Consumer 
demand played a major role supported by a rapid 
expansion of credit, which rose by 20.5% in 2010, 
and robust labour market conditions, as the 
unemployment rate fell to an all-time low of 5.3% 
in December. The growth of domestic demand led 
to a rapid rise in import growth and a widening of 
Brazil’s current account deficit and contributed, 
along with a rise in food prices during the year, to 
an increase in CPI inflation to 5.9% in December 
compared with 4.3% at the end of 2009. The Central 
Bank tightened monetary policy by 2 percentage 
points between April and July 2010 and raised 
commercial banks’ reserve requirements and capital 
adequacy ratios on certain consumer loans in 
December. 
Mexico’s economy continued to recover in 
2010, and GDP rose by 5.5% in the year. Strong 
external demand was the main driver of the 
recovery, leading to robust growth in the production 
of Mexican manufactured goods. By contrast, 
domestic demand was lacklustre, reflecting high 
unemployment, restricted credit availability and low 
levels of consumer confidence. This weak domestic 
demand and the rise in the peso kept inflation 
subdued during 2010 and the Central Bank of 
Mexico maintained its policy rate at 4.5% 
throughout the year.  
In Argentina, third quarter GDP was 7.5% 
higher than for the comparable period in 2009. This 
improvement was led by a strong rebound in 
industrial production, which expanded by 12.7% in 
the year to November 2010. The manufacture of 
motor vehicles recovered particularly strongly, rising 
by 35% during the year, with many being exported 
to Brazil. Inflation remained high, in part due to 
rapid growth in the price of food and beverages. 
Review of performance 
Our operations in Latin America reported pre-tax 
profits of US$1.8bn compared with US$1.1bn in 
2009, largely reflecting the strong performance in 
Brazil, which recorded pre-tax profits in excess of 
US$1bn for the first time. On an underlying basis, 
pre-tax profits increased by 49% as loan impairment 
charges declined, reflecting better economic 
conditions and actions taken to improve asset quality 
by managing down riskier portfolios and enhancing 
risk management processes. Revenue was marginally 
lower as trading income declined from the strong 
performance recorded in 2009 and fee income fell   77

due to reduced transaction volumes, although this 
was largely offset by increased income from Balance 
Sheet Management.  
In PFS, spreads tightened in Mexico as lending 
was refocused from higher-yielding consumer loans 
to higher quality assets. The managing down of 
certain portfolios in Brazil and Mexico and the 
strengthening of underwriting and collections 
processes resulted in an overall increase in pre-tax 
profit in PFS. Across the region we continued to 
focus on new customer acquisition in the mass 
affluent market segment through our Premier and 
Advance propositions. The number of Premier 
customers increased to over 790,000 at 31 December 
2010. Advance was launched in Brazil, Mexico, 
Argentina, Panama and Chile in 2010 and customer 
numbers exceeded 425,000 at the end of the year. 
The insurance business continued to perform 
strongly, with revenue growing in Brazil, Mexico 
and Argentina due to the improving economic 
conditions. 
The regional economic recovery and our focus 
on growing the CMB business drove increased 
domestic lending in our major markets. GB&M and 
CMB both benefitted from our global connectivity 
by increasing intra-regional and inter-regional 
business, with GB&M in particular contributing to 
other regions and customer groups through increased 
cross-referrals. Our operations in Brazil and 
mainland China worked closely together on a 
number of initiatives, including the completion of 
the first renminbi-denominated trade settlement in 
the region. Dedicated sales desks were established in 
mainland China and Hong Kong to support our Latin 
America customers and promote trade with Brazil.  
Net interest income increased by 4% to 
US$6.3bn. Increased volumes of financial 
investments, a decline in the cost of funding trading 
positions as market interest rates fell and a change 
in the portfolio mix to higher-yielding longer-term 
assets drove a rise in revenue from Balance Sheet 
Management. 
Average customer lending balances fell in PFS, 
as certain portfolios were managed down, notably in 
credit cards in Mexico and other higher-risk personal 
loan balances in Mexico and Brazil. However, 
year-end balances were higher than in 2009 as we 
reversed the decline in customer lending by 
selectively growing certain portfolios. Demand-
driven lending increased in CMB and GB&M in 
Brazil and Argentina while, in Mexico, increased 
average lending balances in CMB were attributable 
to the continued strategy of targeting state and 
municipal customers.  
Our operations in Brazil actively grew customer 
account balances to fund loan growth and meet 
higher liquidity requirements following regulatory  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

changes. In Mexico and Argentina, sales and 
marketing initiatives supported by product and 
channel enhancements resulted in an increase in 
current and savings account balances. However, 
the benefit was partly offset by tighter spreads on 
customer accounts as a result of decreased market 
interest rates in Mexico and Argentina.  
Fee income fell by 7% to US$1.7bn, driven by 
lower transaction volumes in credit cards and 
account services in Mexico and reduced account 
services income in Brazil. Regulatory restrictions in 
Brazil and Mexico also reduced the fees that could 
be charged for certain banking services.  
Net trading income of US$733m was 23% lower 
than in 2009. A decline in market volatility which 
resulted in fewer trading opportunities meant that the 
strong performances in Foreign Exchange and Rates 
in 2009 were not repeated.
Net income on financial instruments designated 
at fair value declined by 21% to US$425m, 
primarily due to lower investment returns 
experienced on assets held in support of the pension-
linked portfolio in Brazil and annuity products in 
Argentina. An offsetting decrease was recorded in 
‘Net insurance claims incurred and movement in 
liabilities to policyholders’.  
Gains less losses from financial investments
declined by US$93m, largely because the gains on 
the sale of Visa Inc. shares in 2009 did not recur. 
Net earned insurance premiums increased 
marginally to US$2.1bn, driven by improved 
economic conditions which resulted in higher sales 
of policies in Brazil and Argentina through the 
branch network and a rise in premiums in Mexico. 
This, combined with repricing initiatives in 
Argentina and higher contributions in the pension-
linked product in Brazil from PFS and CMB 
customers, resulted in increased premiums. 
Net insurance claims incurred and movement in 
liabilities to policyholders of US$1.8bn declined by 
9%, mainly in pension-linked products in Brazil as 
lower investment gains were allocated to 
policyholders. This was partly offset by an increase 
related to higher premiums in Argentina and Mexico. 
Loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions declined by 44% in 2010 to US$1.5bn. In 
PFS, the reduction in loan impairment charges 
reflected a significant decline in the size of the credit 
card portfolio in Mexico and an improvement in its 
quality as a result of repositioning the portfolio 
towards higher quality customers, tighter origination 
criteria and improved collection practices. Loan 
impairment charges also declined in Brazil, 
primarily in consumer finance portfolios including 
motor vehicle finance and payroll loans, as economic 
conditions improved and these portfolios were 
managed down. In CMB, loan impairment charges 
fell, largely in Brazil, as improved economic 
conditions and better credit quality resulted in lower 
specific impairment charges, while in Mexico loan 
impairment charges remained broadly unchanged. 
Operating expenses increased by 10% to 
US$6.4bn, driven largely by inflationary pressures 
and investment in infrastructure and technology 
projects across the region in support of improved 
operational efficiency and business growth. Staff 
costs increased in Brazil and Argentina due to 
union-agreed wage increases, although this was 
partly offset by a decline in average headcount as 
costs continued to be managed carefully. Non-staff 
expenditure also rose, driven mainly by higher 
marketing and advertising costs in Brazil as we 
positioned ourselves in this key growth market, 
and transactional taxes increased as sales grew.  79

Funds under management at 31 December 2010 
amounted to US$925bn, an increase of 8% 
when compared with 2009. Both Global Asset 
Management and GPB fund holdings increased, 
reflecting an improvement in equity market 
performance and strong net inflows. 
Global Asset Management funds, including 
emerging market funds, increased by 4% to 
US$439bn as a result of market performance gains 
and strong net inflows, particularly in Europe and 
Asia, partly offset by adverse foreign exchange 
movements. We remain one of the world’s largest 
emerging market asset managers with funds under 
management of US$145bn at 31 December 2010 in 
countries outside North America, Western Europe, 
Japan and Australia. 
GPB funds increased by 10% in 2010 to 
US$277bn, driven by an improvement in equity 
market performance and strong net inflows which 
benefitted from our strength in emerging markets, 
hiring of key relationship managers and cross-
business referrals. Client assets, which include funds 
under management and cash deposits and provide an 
indicator of the scale of GPB, increased by US$23bn 
to US$390bn due to the increase in funds under 
management. 
Other funds under management, which are 
mainly held by a corporate trust business in Asia, 
increased by 14% to US$206bn. 
We announced in November 2010 that, with 
effect from 1 March 2011, Retail Banking and 
Wealth Management will be managed as a single 
global business from Hong Kong. Global Asset 
Management will become part of this business and 
will be transferred from GB&M.  
Assets held in custody and under 
administration 
Custody is the safekeeping and servicing of 
securities and other financial assets on behalf of 
clients. At 31 December 2010, we held assets as 
custodian of US$5.7 trillion, 9% higher than the 
US$5.2 trillion held at 31 December 2009. This was 
mainly driven by an increase in the market value of 
assets and favourable foreign exchange movements. 
Our assets under administration business, which 
includes the provision of various support function 
activities including the valuation of portfolios of 
securities and other financial assets on behalf of 
clients, complements the custody business. At 
31 December 2010, the value of assets held under 
administration by the Group amounted to 
US$2.7 trillion, compared with US$2.8 trillion 
in 2009. 
Property 
At 31 December 2010, we operated from some 
9,950 operational properties worldwide, of which 
approximately 2,500 were located in Europe, 3,100 
in Hong Kong and Rest of Asia-Pacific, 800 in North 
America, 3,350 in Latin America and 200 in the 
Middle East. These properties had an area of 
approximately 71.3m square feet (2009: 70.8m 
square feet). 
Our freehold and long leasehold properties, 
together with all our leasehold land in Hong Kong, 
were valued in 2010. The value of these properties 
was US$7.1bn (2009: US$4.1bn) in excess of their 
carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet. 
In addition, properties with a net book value of 
US$1,133m were held for investment purposes.  
HSBC’s operational properties are stated at cost, 
being historical cost or fair value at the date of 
transition to IFRSs (their deemed cost) less any 
impairment losses, and are depreciated on a basis 
calculated to write off the assets over their estimated 
useful lives. Properties owned as a consequence of 
an acquisition are recognised initially at fair value.

Financial Statements.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Legal proceedings, investigations and 
regulatory matters 
As a result of an August 2002 restatement of 
previously reported consolidated financial statements 
and other corporate events, including the 2002 
settlement with 46 State Attorneys General relating 
to real estate lending practices, Household 
International (now HSBC Finance) and certain 
former officers were named as defendants in a class 
action law suit, Jaffe v Household International Inc, 
et al No 2. C 5893 (N.D.Ill, filed 19 August 2002). 
Following a jury trial concluded in April 2009, the 
Court issued a ruling on 22 November 2010, within 
the second phase of the case to determine actual 
damages, that claim forms should be mailed to class 
members and also set out a method for calculating 
damages for class members who filed claims. 
Despite the jury verdict and the November 2010 
ruling, HSBC continues to believe that it has 
meritorious defences and intends to seek an appeal 
of the Court’s ruling. The timing and outcome of the 
resolution of this matter is uncertain. Given the 
complexity and uncertainties associated with the 
actual determination of damages, including but not 
limited to the number of class members that may file 
valid claims, the number of claims that can be 
substantiated by class members providing adequate 
documentation, the reduction of trading losses by 
any trading gains made over the relevant period, the 
determination of reliance by class members on the 
financial statements, and whether any given class 
member was the beneficial owner of the shares, 
HSBC is unable at this time to estimate reliably the 
amount of any damages or range of possible 
damages that could arise, but they could be 
significant.
In December 2008, Bernard L Madoff 
(‘Madoff’) was arrested for running a Ponzi scheme 
and a trustee was appointed for the liquidation of his 
firm, Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities LLC 
(‘Madoff Securities’), a Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘SEC’) registered broker-dealer and 
investment adviser. Madoff subsequently pleaded 
guilty to various charges and is serving a 150-year 
prison sentence. Various non-US HSBC companies 
provide custodial, administration and similar 
services to a number of funds incorporated outside 
the US whose assets were invested with Madoff 
Securities and have been named as defendants in 
suits in the US, Ireland, Luxembourg and other 
jurisdictions. There are many factors which may 
affect the range of possible outcomes including, but 
not limited to, the circumstances of the fraud, the 
multiple jurisdictions in which the proceedings have 
been brought, and the number of different plaintiffs 
and defendants in such proceedings. The cases are at 
an early stage. For these reasons, among others, it is 
not practicable at this time for HSBC to estimate 
reliably the aggregate liabilities or ranges of 
liabilities that may arise as a result of all such claims 
but they could be significant. In any event, HSBC 
considers that it has good defences to these claims 
and will continue to defend them vigorously.  
HSBC Bank USA entered into a consent cease 
and desist order with the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency and the indirect parent of that company, 
HSBC North America, entered into a consent cease 
and desist order with the Federal Reserve Board in 
the first week of October 2010. These actions require 
improvements for an effective compliance risk 
management programme across the Group’s US 
businesses, including US Bank Secrecy Act (‘BSA’) 
and Anti Money Laundering (‘AML’) compliance. 
Steps continue to be taken to address the 
requirements of these Orders and to ensure that 
compliance and effective policies and procedures are 
maintained. 
Various HSBC Group companies are the subject 
of ongoing investigations, including Grand Jury 
subpoenas and other requests for information, by US 
Government agencies, including the US Attorney’s 
Office, the US Department of Justice and the New 
York County District Attorney’s Office. These 
investigations pertain to, among other matters, HSBC 
Bank USA’s bank note and foreign correspondent 
banking businesses and its compliance with BSA and 
AML controls, as well as various HSBC companies’ 
compliance with Office of Foreign Asset Control 
(‘OFAC’) requirements, and adherence by certain 
customers to US tax reporting requirements.  
The consent cease and desist orders do not 
preclude additional enforcement actions against 
HSBC Bank USA or HSBC North America by bank 
regulatory or law enforcement agencies, including 
actions to recover civil money penalties, fines and 
other financial penalties relating to activities which 
were the subject of the cease and desist orders. In 
addition, it is likely that there could be some form of 
formal enforcement action in respect of some or all of 
the ongoing investigations. Actual or threatened 
enforcement actions against other financial 
institutions for breaches of BSA, AML and OFAC 
requirements have resulted in settlements involving 
fines and penalties, some of which have been 
significant depending on the individual circumstances 
of each action. The ongoing investigations are at an 
early stage. Based on the facts currently known, it is 
not practicable at this time for HSBC to determine the 
terms on which the ongoing investigations will be 
resolved or the timing of such resolution or for HSBC  83
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
to estimate reliably the amounts, or range of possible 
amounts, of any fines and/or penalties. As matters 
progress, it is possible that any fines and/or penalties 
could be significant. 
For further information see Note 44 on the 
Financial Statements. 
Foreclosures 
US State and federal officials recently announced 
investigations into the procedures followed by 
mortgage servicing companies and banks, including 
HSBC Finance and HSBC Bank USA, relating to 
foreclosures. We have responded to all related 
inquiries and co-operated with all applicable 
investigations, including a joint examination by 
staffs of the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency as part of their 
broad review of industry foreclosure practices. 
Following the examination, our examiners issued 
supervisory letters noting certain deficiencies in our 
processing, preparation and signing of affidavits and 
other documents supporting foreclosures, and in the 
governance of and resources devoted to our 
foreclosure processes, including the evaluation and 
monitoring of third party law firms retained to effect 
our foreclosures. Certain other processes were 
deemed adequate. Management is reviewing 
foreclosures where judgement has not yet been 
entered and will correct deficient documentation and 
re-file affidavits where necessary. We have 
suspended foreclosures until such time as we have 
substantially addressed noted deficiencies in our 
processes. We are engaged in discussions with the 
Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency regarding the terms of 
consent cease and desist orders, which will prescribe 
actions to address the deficiencies noted in the joint 
examination. We expect the consent orders will be 
finalised shortly. While the impact of the consent 
orders depends on the final terms, we believe they 
have the potential to increase our operational, 
reputational and legal risk profiles and expect 
implementation of their provisions will require 
significant and managerial resources. In addition, the 
consent orders will not preclude further actions 
against HSBC Bank USA or HSBC Finance by bank 
regulatory or other agencies, including the 
imposition of fines and civil money penalties. We are 
unable at this time, however, to determine the 
likelihood of any further action or the amount of 
fines or penalties, if any, that may be imposed by the 
regulators or agencies.  
Data security 
In March 2010 HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA 
announced that it had been the victim of a significant 
data theft. In 2010, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA 
conducted a comprehensive review of its information 
security procedures, formulated and implemented 
major security upgrade programmes and continued a 
multi-million franc investment programme in 
systems to ensure industry-leading security 
standards. It also reviewed and strengthened risk 
management and operational controls and will 
continue to invest in these areas. In March 2010, the 
Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority 
(‘FINMA’) launched an investigation into the 
circumstances of the data theft. On 22 February 2011 
a notice of decision with a declaratory ruling was 
received from FINMA following such investigation 
which found that, because of deficiencies in its 
internal organisation and oversight of its IT 
activities, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA had 
breached various regulatory provisions. HSBC 
Private Bank (Suisse) SA is currently considering the 
details of the notice of decision and actions required 
by FINMA.

Financial highlights 
1 Dividends recorded in the financial statements are dividends per ordinary share declared in a year and are not dividends in respect of, 
or for, that year. The third interim dividend for 2009 of US$0.08 was paid on 13 January 2010. The fourth interim dividend for 2009 of 
US$0.10 was paid on 5 May 2010. First, second and third interim dividends for 2010, each of US$0.08 per ordinary share, were paid
on 7 July 2010, 6 October 2010 and 12 January 2011, respectively. Note 11 on the Financial Statements provides more information on 
the dividends declared in 2010. On 28 February 2011 the Directors declared a fourth interim dividend for 2010 of US$0.12 per 
ordinary share in lieu of a final dividend, which will be payable to ordinary shareholders on 5 May 2011 in cash in US dollars, or in 
pounds sterling or Hong Kong dollars at exchange rates to be determined on 27 April 2011, with a scrip dividend alternative. The
reserves available for distribution at 31 December 2010 were US$36,013m. 
Quarterly dividends of US$15.50 per 6.2% non-cumulative Series A US dollar preference share, equivalent to a dividend of US$0.3875
per Series A ADS, each of which represents one-fortieth of a Series A dollar preference share, were paid on 15 March 2010, 15 June
2010, 15 September 2010 and 15 December 2010.
Quarterly coupons of US$0.508 per security were paid with respect to 8.125% capital securities on 15 January 2010, 15 April 2010,

18 The effect of the bonus element of the rights issue in 2009 has been included within the basic and diluted earnings per share. 
19 Dividends per ordinary share expressed as a percentage of earnings per ordinary share.
20 Net interest income includes the cost of funding trading assets, while the related external revenues are reported in trading income. In 
our customer group results, the cost of funding trading assets is included with GB&M’ s net trading income as interest expense. 
21 Gross interest yield is the average annualised interest rate earned on average interest-earning assets (‘AIEA’).  
22 Net interest spread is the difference between the average annualised interest rate earned on AIEA, net of amortised premiums and loan 
fees, and the average annualised interest rate paid on average interest-bearing funds. 
23 Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as an annualised percentage of AIEA.
24 Other interest-earning assets includes intercompany eliminations.
25 Interest income on trading assets is reported as ‘Net trading income’ in the consolidated income statement.
26 Interest income on financial assets designated at fair value is reported as ‘Net income from financial instruments designated at fair 
value’ in the consolidated income statement. 
27 This includes interest-bearing bank deposits only. 
28 Interest expense on financial liabilities designated at fair value is reported as ‘Net income on financial instruments designated at fair 
value’ in the consolidated income statement, other than interest on own debt which is reported in ‘Interest Expense’.
29 This includes interest-bearing customer accounts only.  
30 The cost of internal funding of trading assets was US$902m (2009: US$1,309m; 2008: US$5,547m) and is excluded from the reported
‘Net trading income’ line and included in ‘Net interest income’. However, this cost is reinstated in ‘Net trading income’ in HSBC’ s 
customer group and global business reporting. 
31 Net trading income includes income of US$23m (2009: expense of US$444m; 2008: income of US$529m), associated with changes in 
the fair value of issued structured notes and other hybrid instrument liabilities derived from movements in HSBC issuance spreads. 
32 Other changes in fair value include gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are managed in
conjunction with HSBC’ s long-term debt issued. 
33 Discretionary participation features. 
34 Net insurance claims incurred and movement in liabilities to policyholders arise from both life and non-life insurance business. For 
non-life business, amounts reported represent the cost of claims paid during the year and the estimated cost of notified claims. For life 
business, the main element of claims is the liability to policyholders created on the initial underwriting of the policy and any subsequent 
movement in the liability that arises, primarily from the attribution of investment performance to savings-related policies. Consequently, 
claims rise in line with increases in sales of savings-related business and with investment market growth. 
Consolidated balance sheet
35 Net of impairment allowances. 
36 The calculation of capital resources, capital ratios and risk-weighted assets for 2008 to 2010 is on a Basel II basis. 2006 and 2007 
comparatives are on a Basel I basis. 
37 Capital resources are total regulatory capital, the calculation of which is set out on page 180. 
38 Includes perpetual preferred securities, details of which can be found in Note 34 on the Financial Statements.  85
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
39 The definition of net asset value per share is total shareholders’ equity, less non-cumulative preference shares and capital securities, 
divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue. 
40 ‘Currency translation’ is the effect of translating the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries and associates for the previous year-end at the 
rates of exchange applicable at the current year-end. 
Economic profit
41 Expressed as a percentage of average invested capital. 
42 Average invested capital is measured as average total shareholders’ equity after: 
–  adding back the average balance of goodwill amortised pre-transition to IFRSs or subsequently written-off, directly to reserves (less 
goodwill previously amortised in respect of the French regional banks sold in 2008); 
–  deducting the average balance of HSBC’ s revaluation surplus relating to property held for own use. This reserve was generated when 
determining the deemed carrying cost of such properties on transition to IFRSs and will run down over time as the 
properties are sold; 
–  deducting average preference shares and other equity instruments issued by HSBC Holdings; and 
–  deducting average reserves for unrealised gains/(losses) on effective cash flow hedges and available-for-sale securities.  
43 Return on invested capital is profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent company, which can be found in Note 12 on the 
Financial Statements on page 296. 
Customer groups and global businesses and Geographical regions  
44 The main items reported under ‘Other’ are certain property activities, unallocated investment activities, centrally held investment
companies, gains arising from the dilution of interests in associates, movements in the fair value of own debt designated at fair value 
(the remainder of the Group’ s gain on own debt is included in GB&M) and HSBC’ s holding company and financing operations. The 
results also include net interest earned on free capital held centrally, operating costs incurred by the head office operations in providing 
stewardship and central management services to HSBC, and costs incurred by the Group Service Centres and Shared Service 
Organisations and associated recoveries. At 31 December 2010, there was a US$188m gain arising from the dilution of interests in
associates (2009: nil; 2008: nil) and adverse fair value movements on HSBC’ s own debt designated at fair value were US$0.1bn (2009: 
US$6.5bn adverse; 2008: US$6.6bn favourable). 
45 Assets by geographical region and customer group include intra-HSBC items. These items are eliminated, where appropriate, under the 
heading ‘Intra-HSBC items’.
46 Net operating income before loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions. 
47 Loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions. 
48 Share of profit in associates and joint ventures. 
49 In the analyses of customer groups and global businesses, net trading income comprises all gains and losses from changes in the fair 
value of financial assets and financial liabilities classified as held for trading, together with related external and internal interest 
income and interest expense, and dividends received; in the statutory presentation internal interest income and expense are eliminated. 
50 In 2010, Global Markets included a favourable fair value movement of US$23m on the widening of credit spreads on structured 
liabilities (2009: adverse fair value movement of US$444m; 2008: favourable fair value movement of US$529m).
51 Total income earned on securities services products in the Group amounted to US$1.5bn (2009: US$1.4bn; 2008: US$2.2bn), of which
US$1.5bn was in GB&M (2009: US$1.4bn; 2008: US$2.1bn) and US$29m was in CMB (2009: US$19m; 2008: US$45m). 
52 Total income earned on payments and cash management products in the Group amounted to US$4.4bn (2009: US$4.1bn; 2008: 
US$5.8bn), of which US$3.3bn was in CMB (2009: US$3.1bn; 2008: US$4.1bn) and US$1.1bn was in GB&M (2009: US$1.1bn; 2008: 
US$1.7bn). 
53 Total income earned on other transaction services in the Group amounted to US$2.3bn (2009: US$1.8bn; 2008: US$1.8bn), of which
US$1.6bn was in CMB relating to trade and supply chain (2009: US$1.3bn; 2008: US$1.3bn) and US$636m was in GB&M of which 
US$523m related to trade and supply chain (2009: US$382m; 2008: US$355m) and US$113m related to banknotes and other (2009: 
US$125m; 2008: US$126m). 
54 In each Group entity, Balance Sheet Management is responsible for managing liquidity and funding under the supervision of the local
ALCO. Balance Sheet Management also manages the structural interest rate position of the entity within a Global Markets limit 
structure.
55 ‘Other’ in GB&M includes net interest earned on free capital held in the global business not assigned to products. 
56 Inter-segment elimination comprises (i) the costs of shared services and Group Service Centres included within ‘Other’ which are
recovered from customer groups, and (ii) the intra-segment funding costs of trading activities undertaken within GB&M. HSBC’ s 
Balance Sheet Management business, reported within GB&M, provides funding to the trading businesses. To report GB&M’ s ‘Net 
trading income’ on a fully funded basis, ‘Net interest income’ and ‘Net interest income/(expense) on trading activities’ are grossed up to 
reflect internal funding transactions prior to their elimination in the inter-segment column. 
57 Net insurance claims incurred and movement in liabilities to policyholders. 
58 ‘Employee expenses’ comprises costs directly incurred by each customer group. The reallocation and recharging of employee and other
expenses directly incurred in the ‘Other’ customer group is shown in ‘Other operating expenses’. 
59 RWAs are non-additive across geographical regions due to market risk diversification effects within the Group. 
60 France primarily comprises the domestic operations of HSBC France, HSBC Assurances Vie and the Paris branch of HSBC Bank plc. 
61 Hong Kong Government certificates of indebtedness were reclassified from PFS to ‘Other’ at 1 January 2010. 
62 US includes the impairment of goodwill in respect of PFS – North America.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Managing risk 
(Unaudited) 
The continued growth in our business in 2010 was 
achieved while ensuring risks were assumed in a 
measured manner and in line with our appetite for 
such risks. This approach is encapsulated within our 
risk appetite framework. It is approved by the Group 
Risk Committee and the Board. 
The framework is maintained at Group, 
regional, global business and customer group levels, 
operating through governance bodies, processes and 
metrics designed to assist in risk management. Risk 
appetite statements define, at various levels of the 
business, the qualitative and quantitative expressions 
of the risks which HSBC is prepared to embrace in 
alignment with its strategy and business plans. 
Quantitative metrics are assigned to five key 
categories: earnings, capital and liquidity, 
impairments and expected losses, risk category 
and diversification and scenario stress testing. 
Measurement against the metrics serves to: 
• guide underlying business activity, ensuring it 
is aligned to risk appetite statements; 
• determine risk-adjusted remuneration;  
• enable the key underlying assumptions to be 
monitored and, where necessary, adjusted 
through subsequent business planning cycles; 
and
• promptly identify business decisions needed to 
mitigate risk. 
Report of the Group Risk Committee
Further commentary on risk appetite, risk governance and 
stress testing can be found within the Report of the Group Risk 
Committee, on pages 197 to 201 of the Governance section. 
The diversification of our lending portfolio 
across our regions, together with our broad range of 
customer groups and products, ensure that we are not 
dependent on a few countries or markets to generate 
income and growth. Our geographical diversification 
also provides impetus to our strategies for growth in 
faster-growing markets and those with international 
connectivity. 
During 2010, the financial markets were 
dominated by concerns over sovereign debt. In 
addition, the perception that the world economic 
recovery remained fragile created volatility in certain 
financial markets. Further quantitative easing from 
the US temporarily boosted market confidence, but 
inflationary pressures remained an issue, especially 
in the UK and some emerging markets.  
With an ever-changing economic and financial 
environment, we pro-actively review our risk profile 
and, where appropriate, introduce new risk 
measures. Stress testing will continue to evolve 
to ensure that it considers prevailing concerns.  
Our insurance operations are managed with 
regard to the effects on financial markets of 
prevailing economic conditions such as the low 
yields available on fixed-interest investments and 
continuing high unemployment rates, particularly in 
the US and Europe. 
Capital and liquidity 
We maintained a strong balance sheet during 2010 
while reducing the overall risk in our portfolio. Our 
balance sheet assets grew by 4% during the year 
while our credit risk-weighted assets fell by 1.4%. 
This was achieved, in part, by concentrating on our 
growth in core portfolios and running off those that 
were not core to our business.
In addition, we reduced our loan impairment 
charges and other credit risk provisions from 
US$26.5bn in 2009 to US$14.0bn in 2010, reflecting 
the general improvement in the credit quality of our 
portfolio.
Preserving our strong capital position has long 
been, and will remain, a key priority for HSBC. We 
are equipped to respond to the capital requirements 
imposed by Basel III, which are discussed further 
on pages 181 and 182, and to sustain future growth. 
We have adopted a holistic approach to testing the 
sensitivities of our capital plans against a number 
of scenarios; our approach to scenario stress testing 
analysis is discussed below. 
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity 
position and are well positioned for the new 
regulatory landscape. The run-off of the HSBC 
Finance portfolio and the continuing moderation of 
market conditions in 2010 contributed to our strong 
liquidity position. 
Risk governance
(Unaudited) 
Our strong risk governance reflects the importance 
placed by the Board on shaping the Group’s risk 
strategy and managing risks effectively. It is 
supported by a clear policy framework of risk 
ownership, by the cascading from the GMB of 
balanced scorecards that align business and risk 
objectives, and by the accountability of all officers for 
identifying, assessing and managing risks within the 
scope of their assigned responsibilities. This personal 
accountability, reinforced by the governance structure, 
experience and mandatory learning, helps to foster 
throughout HSBC a disciplined and constructive 
culture of risk management and control.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Scenario stress testing 
We conduct a range of Group stress testing scenarios 
including, but not limited to, severe global economic 
downturn, country, sector and counterparty failures, 
and a variety of projected major operational risk 
events. The outcomes of the stress scenarios are used 
to assess the potential impact on demand for 
regulatory capital against its supply. We also 
participate, where appropriate, in scenario analyses 
requested by regulatory bodies. 
In addition to the suite of risk scenarios 
considered for the Group, each major HSBC 
subsidiary conducts regular macro-economic and 
event-driven scenario analyses specific to its region.  
Stress testing is also used by the market risk 
discipline to evaluate the potential impact on 
portfolio values of events or movements in a set 
of financial variables.
Challenges and uncertainties 
(Unaudited)  
The top and emerging risks identified through our 
risk management processes and outlined in the 
Report of the Group Risk Committee on page 199, 
present challenges and uncertainties as we carry out 
our activities. These are considered in further detail 
below.
Business operations, governance and 
control 
Operational risks are inherent in our 
business
We are exposed to many types of operational risk, 
including fraudulent and other criminal activities 
(both internal and external), breakdowns in 
processes or procedures, or systems failure or 
unavailability. We are also subject to the risk of 
disruption to our business arising from events that 
are wholly or partially beyond our control (for 
example: natural disasters, acts of terrorism, 
epidemics and transport or utility failures) which 
may give rise to losses in service to customers and/or 
economic loss to HSBC. All of these risks are also 
applicable where we rely on external suppliers or 
vendors to provide services to us and our customers. 
The reliability and security of our information 
and technology infrastructure and its customer 
databases, for example to combat internet fraud, are 
crucial to maintaining our banking applications and 
processes and to protecting the HSBC brand. Critical 
system failure, any prolonged loss of service 
availability or any material breach of data security, 
particularly involving confidential customer data, 
could cause serious damage to our ability to serve 
our clients, could breach regulations under which we 
operate and could cause long-term damage to our 
business and brand. Information security and the 
management of increasing operational complexity 
are two of the key emerging operational risks that we 
face.
We are subject to legal and compliance risks, 
which could have an adverse effect on the 
Group 
Legal and compliance risks arise from a variety of 
sources with the potential to cause harm to HSBC 
and our ability to operate. These issues require us to 
deal appropriately with potential conflicts of interest; 
regulatory requirements; ethical issues; anti-money 
laundering laws and regulations; privacy laws; 
information security policies; sales and trading 
practices; and the conduct of companies with which 
we are associated. Failure to address these issues 
appropriately may give rise to additional legal and 
compliance risk to HSBC, with an increase in the 
number of litigation claims and the amount of 
damages asserted against us, or subject us to 
regulatory enforcement actions, fines or penalties or 
reputational damage. 
We are subject to tax-related risks in the 
countries in which we operate  
We are subject to the substance and interpretation of 
tax laws in all countries in which we operate. Failure 
to respond to changes in tax rates and comply with 
procedures required by tax authorities could lead to 
increased tax charges, including financial or 
operating penalties. 
Liquidity and funding risks are inherent in 
our business  
HSBC’s business model is founded upon having 
ready access to financial resources whenever required 
to meet our obligations and grow our business. To this 
end, our entities seek to maintain a diversified and 
stable funding base comprising core retail and 
corporate customer deposits and institutional 
balances, and certain entities augment this with 
amounts of long-term wholesale funding. In addition, 
we hold portfolios of highly liquid assets to enable us 
to respond to unusual liquidity requirements. We 
continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, 
moving into the new regulatory landscape. 
Where markets become illiquid, the value at 
which financial instruments can be realised is highly 
uncertain, and capital resources may shrink as 
valuations decline. Rating agency downgrades of  89
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
instruments to which we have exposure, or threats of 
downgrades, can exacerbate the effect. The liquidity 
of those HSBC entities that utilise long-term 
wholesale markets could be constrained by an 
inability to access them due to a variety of 
unforeseen market dislocations or interruptions. 
The market conditions that the financial services 
industry experienced during the recent financial 
crisis highlighted the significant benefits of a 
diversified core deposit base, leading to increased 
competition for such deposits and the greater risk of 
deposit migration between competitors.  
Our GB&M business operates in many markets 
affected by illiquidity and is subject to the threat of 
extreme price volatility, either directly or indirectly, 
through exposures to securities, loans, derivatives 
and other commitments. Although market conditions 
continued to moderate in 2010, it is difficult to 
predict if this trend will continue and, if conditions 
worsen, which of our markets, products and other 
businesses will be affected. Any repeat of these 
factors could have an adverse effect on our results. 
Macro-economic and geopolitical 
Prevailing economic and market conditions 
may adversely affect our results 
Our earnings are affected by global and local 
economic and market conditions. Following the 
problems experienced in financial markets in 
2007-8, concerted government action in 2009 paved 
the way for a general improvement in the economic 
environment in 2010, though recovery was variable 
between regions. The eurozone economies came 
under greater pressure, the dominant concern being 
over sovereign debt. The financial services industry 
continued to face an unusually high degree of 
uncertainty. 
With unemployment remaining high, consumer 
confidence weak in developed markets and amid 
signs of emerging inflationary pressures, economic 
conditions remain fragile and volatile. Some 
countries may recover only slowly to past levels of 
growth, with the possibility of a return to recessionary 
conditions in more sluggish economies, while others 
which are growing rapidly may need to undertake 
major adjustments to counter the formation of asset 
bubbles. This could have an adverse effect on our 
operating results. In particular, we may face the 
following challenges in connection with these events 
to our operations and operating model: 
• the demand for borrowing from creditworthy 
customers may diminish if economic activity 
slows;
• trade and capital flows may contract as a result 
of protectionist measures being introduced in 
certain markets, or on the emergence of 
geopolitical risks;
• a prolonged period of low interest rates will 
constrain, for example through margin 
compression and low returns on assets, net 
interest income we earn on our excess deposits;
• our ability to borrow from other financial 
institutions or to engage in funding transactions 
could be adversely affected by market disruption, 
for example in the event of contagion from stress 
in the eurozone sovereign and financial sectors; 
• market developments may depress consumer 
and business confidence, for example if growth 
in the US or the UK were to be poor, adversely 
affecting both asset prices and payment patterns 
and leading to increases in delinquencies and 
default rates, write-offs and loan impairment 
charges beyond our expectations. The effect of 
such conditions in 2010 and previous years on 
our North American retail business is described 
on page 110.
We are subject to political and economic 
risks in the countries in which we operate 
We responded effectively to the financial crisis and, 
more recently, the sovereign debt problems within 
the eurozone, where we continued during 2010 to 
support our operations and carry out wider market 
functions.
As an organisation which operates in 87 
countries and territories, however, our results are 
subject to the risk of loss from unfavourable political 
developments, currency fluctuations, social 
instability and changes in government policies on 
such matters as expropriation, authorisations, 
international ownership, interest-rate caps, foreign 
exchange transferability and tax in the jurisdictions 
in which we operate.  
The ability of HSBC’s subsidiaries and affiliates 
to pay dividends could be restricted by changes in 
official banking measures, exchange controls and 
other requirements. We prepare our accounts in US 
dollars, but because a substantial portion of our 
assets, liabilities, funds under management, revenues 
and expenses are denominated in other currencies, 
changes in foreign exchange rates have an effect on 
our reported income, cash flows and shareholders’ 
equity.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Risk > Challenges and uncertainties > Macro-prudential and regulatory

We have significant exposure to 
counterparty risk within our portfolio  
We have exposure to virtually all major industries 
and counterparties, and we routinely execute 
transactions with counterparties in financial services, 
including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, 
investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other 
institutional clients. Many of these transactions 
expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our 
counterparty or client. Financial institutions are 
necessarily interdependent because of trading, 
clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a 
consequence, a default by, or decline in market 
confidence in, individual institutions, or anxiety 
about the financial services industry generally, can 
lead to further individual and/or systemic losses. Our 
credit risk may remain high if the collateral taken to 
mitigate counterparty risk cannot be realised or has 
to be liquidated at prices which are insufficient to 
recover the full amount of our loan or derivative 
exposure. For further information relating to the 
major risk areas, see ‘Areas of Special Interest’ on 
page 103. 
Macro-prudential and regulatory 
We face a number of challenges in 
regulation and supervision 
Financial services providers face increased 
regulation and supervision, with more stringent and 
costly requirements in the areas of capital and 
liquidity management and of compliance relating to 
conduct of business and the integrity of financial 
services delivery. Increased government intervention 
and control over financial institutions, together with 
measures to reduce systemic risk, could significantly 
alter the competitive landscape.
Recent regulatory and supervisory 
developments have largely been shaped by the 
leaders, Finance Ministers and Central Bank 
Governors of the Group of Twenty nations (‘the 
G20’), who delegated the development and issuance 
of standards to the Basel Committee of Banking 
Supervisors (‘the Basel Committee’). The G20 also 
established the Financial Stability Board (‘FSB’) to 
assess vulnerabilities affecting the financial system 
as a whole, as well as to monitor and advise on 
market developments and best practice in meeting 
regulatory standards. 
In looking to address the systemic failures that 
caused the financial crisis of 2007-8, the authorities 
asserted two primary objectives: to establish a 
resilient system to reduce substantially the risks of 
failure of financial institutions and, in case failure in 
the end proved unavoidable, to have in place 
measures to achieve orderly resolution without cost 
to taxpayers. Governments and regulators have 
embarked on significant change in the regulation of 
the financial system, highlighting the following 
priorities:
• a stronger international framework for 
prudential regulation, ensuring significantly 
increased liquidity and regulatory capital buffers 
and enhanced quality of capital; 
• convergence towards a single set of high-
quality, global, independent accounting 
standards, with particular focus on accounting 
for financial instruments and off-balance sheet 
exposures;
• strengthening the regulation of hedge funds 
and credit rating agencies, and improving the 
infrastructure for derivative transactions, 
including central counterparty clearing of over-
the-counter derivatives; 
• design and implementation of a system which 
will allow for the restructuring or resolution of 
financial institutions, without taxpayers 
ultimately bearing the burden; 
• an increased role for colleges of supervisors to 
coordinate oversight of systemically significant 
institutions such as HSBC, and effective 
coordination of resolution regimes for failed 
banks;
• measures on financial sector compensation 
arrangements to prevent excessive short-term 
risk taking and mitigate systemic risk on a 
globally consistent basis; and 
• a fair and substantial contribution by the 
financial sector towards paying for any burden 
associated with government interventions, 
where they occur, to repair and reduce risks 
from the financial system or to fund the 
resolution of problems.
Measures proposed by the Basel Committee to 
increase resilience in the financial system 
The Basel Committee, following consultation, 
impact analyses and draft proposals during 2010, 
issued final proposals in December 2010, known as 
Basel III, on the twin areas of capital and liquidity, 
the key aspects of which are set out below.  
• Risk weightings: increased weightings for the 
trading book and re-securitisations are planned 
for implementation by the end of 2011. A 
fundamental review of the trading book will 
continue during 2011. 91
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
• Quality of capital: there is renewed emphasis on 
common equity as the principal component of 
tier 1 capital, with increased deductions from 
shareholders’ equity (calculated on an 
accounting basis) to determine the level of 
regulatory capital. The phasing-in periods for 
these new deductions will start in 2014, to be 
fully implemented by 2018.  
• Minimum ratios: a new minimum common 
equity requirement of 4.5% is to be 
implemented in full by 1 January 2015. An 
additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% in 
common equity effectively acts as a trigger for 
restrictions on management actions (such as the 
payment of dividends or bonuses) so that the 
capital structure can be rebuilt. This will be 
phased in between 1 January 2016 and 
1 January 2019. In addition to these core 
tier 1 levels, additional requirements from the 
Basel Committee for tier 1 capital of 1.5% and 
tier 2 capital of 2.0%, by 2019, will lift the 
minimum total capital requirement for banks to 
around 10.5%. 
• Countercyclical capital buffer: the Basel 
Committee has finalised its proposals for a 
countercyclical capital buffer of 2.5% in 
common equity, to be built up in periods of 
excess credit growth compared with GDP 
growth. It is not clear how these may operate in 
practice and there is doubt that either 
supervisors or the market would support release 
of a buffer again as the economic cycle turned. 
• Total leverage: the Committee has proposed a 
leverage ratio of 3% of total assets to constrain 
aggregate size relative to the capital base. It is 
intended that an observation period of parallel 
running from 2013 to 2017 should enable a 
minimum standard to become mandatory in 
2018.
• Liquidity and funding: a new minimum 
standard, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, has 
been developed to promote the short-term 
resilience of a bank’s liquidity risk profile. 
A Net Stable Funding Ratio has also been 
introduced to provide a sustainable maturity 
structure of assets and liabilities. As it is not 
yet clear what unintended consequences these 
measures may have, they will be phased in after 
observation periods in 2015 and 2018, 
respectively.  
• The Basel Committee is also developing an 
approach, due by the end of 2011, to defining 
Global Systemically Important Financial 
Institutions (‘G-SIFI’s) to introduce more 
rigorous oversight and co-ordinated assessment 
of their risks through international supervisory 
colleges, provide for higher levels of capital and 
liquidity resilience, and require mandatory 
recovery and resolution plans with institution-
specific crisis cooperation agreements between 
cross-border crisis management groups.  
A strong capital position has long been, and will 
remain, a key priority for HSBC. We are equipped to 
respond to the capital requirement standards of 
Basel III, as discussed further on pages 181 and 182, 
and to sustain future growth. 
Other measures 
• Remuneration: the FSB has issued principles on 
remuneration designed to guide regional and 
national authorities in establishing appropriate 
regimes to align remuneration in a risk-based 
manner with the long-term interests of 
stakeholders. The EU has implemented rule 
changes in the Capital Requirements Directive 
which impact the balance between fixed and 
variable remuneration, establishing limits on the 
percentage of bonus which can be paid in cash. 
Approaches to the issue remain divergent 
globally, however.  
• Bank levies: a number of levies are being raised 
on banks, notably by the UK, Germany and 
France. There is a renewed US proposal to raise 
a financial crisis responsibility fee on certain 
financial companies with assets over US$50bn. 
The European levies are calculated with 
reference to measures of stability of funding, in 
order to encourage more stable structures. In the 
UK, for example, the levy is to be charged at a 
rate of 0.075% on all liabilities excluding 
insured deposits and certain other elements, but 
with a lower rate for longer-term liabilities and 
uninsured deposits. Germany will hypothecate 
levy income to create resolution funds to 
support failing banks, while in other 
jurisdictions it will accrue to general tax 
revenues. Under the draft legislation, the UK 
levy is not tax deductible and does not meet the 
definition of an income tax for income statement 
purposes. For indicative purposes only, the UK 
levy that would be payable based on the closing 
2010 balance sheet, after taking into account 
announced changes to deposit protection 
schemes in 2011, is estimated at US$0.6bn. 
• Other taxes: other areas of financial sector 
taxation being considered by the authorities 
are a Financial Activities Tax (‘FAT’), a tax 
on profit and remuneration, and a Financial  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Risk > Challenges and uncertainties > Macro-prudential and regulatory // Credit risk > Credit risk management 
92
Transaction Tax (‘FTT’) applied to a specified 
range of financial transactions. An IMF report 
for the G20 in 2010 saw merit in an FAT but 
did not recommend an FTT as it was felt not to 
address the key issues within the G20 mandate 
and might have unintended economic and 
regulatory consequences. In its Seoul 2010 
communique the G20 did not promote any 
one approach for adoption. Both the European 
Commission and the UK Government are 
considering an FAT, which the former believes 
can work at EU level. The EU also sees merit in 
an FTT but, recognising the dependency on an 
international consensus, will continue to work 
within the G20 for its adoption.  
• The ‘Volcker Rule’: under the Dodd-Frank Act, 
banking organisations with operations in the US 
face limits on their ability to sponsor or invest in 
private equity or hedge funds and are prohibited 
from engaging in certain types of ‘proprietary 
trading’ in the US, subject to a number of 
exceptions allowing an entity significant leeway 
to engage in client-serving trading, such as 
market-making and underwriting, and risk-
mitigating hedging activities. The ultimate 
impact of these restrictions will depend on how 
US regulators implement them in rulemaking. 
• Derivatives and central counterparties 
regulation: as agreed by the G20, the authorities 
are seeking to reduce systemic risk and volatility 
relating to derivatives trading. In the US, the 
Dodd-Frank Act provides for an extensive 
regulatory framework for over the counter 
(‘OTC’) derivatives. In addition to the 
mandatory clearing, exchange trading and 
reporting of certain swaps and security-based 
swaps, it also requires the registration of swap 
dealers and major swap participants, making 
them subject to capital, margin, business 
conduct and record-keeping regulations. In 
September 2010, the EU Commission presented 
proposals, currently in negotiation, for all 
standardised OTC derivatives to be reported to 
trade repositories and centrally cleared by the 
end of 2012. The proposal disincentivises 
derivative contracts which are not eligible for 
central clearing by proposing higher capital 
requirements. Exemptions for foreign exchange 
swaps and forwards are currently being 
considered.  
• Markets in financial instruments: the European 
Commission is conducting a major Review of 
the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, 
potentially to extend its scope beyond equities to 
other asset classes including bonds, exchange-
traded funds and other equity-like and non-
equity instruments, and to promote their trading 
on exchanges and other markets that will be 
subject to regulation. It also proposes giving 
additional power to regulators to ban trading in 
products that are eligible to be cleared but for 
which no clearing solution is currently available. 
• The UK Independent Commission on Banking:
this Commission was established to examine 
issues of banking activity and competition, 
including the potential impact on financial 
markets of a number of options to separate the 
retail and wholesale activities of universal 
banks. Responses to the opening consultation 
have been published and the Commission 
intends to publish an interim report in April 
2011, with further consultation prior to a final 
report in September 2011. The UK Government 
is not bound to adopt the Commission’s 
recommendations. 
• Recovery and resolution plans: such plans are 
considered a key element in improving the 
ability of regulators to rescue (or ‘resolve’) 
firms when they get into difficulties without 
putting taxpayer monies at risk. Studies and 
pilots have been initiated by various official 
bodies on the resolution of financial firms and 
the international coordination of such exercises; 
the UK authorities have been at the forefront of 
work to develop approaches to this subject. The 
EU has consulted on a new framework for crisis 
management, including so-called ‘bail-in’ 
creditor write-down resolution. Legislative 
proposals are expected mid-2011. In the US, 
the Dodd-Frank Act established the Orderly 
Liquidation Authority which will ultimately 
provide a bank-like receivership process for 
large financial companies; resolution plans will 
be required of large financial institutions and 
rules for ‘early remediation’ will be 
forthcoming. There is currently no consistent 
approach and a number of key areas need to be 
addressed, including an international legal 
framework for addressing competing creditor 
claims and the application of collateral. 
Restructuring of regulatory bodies 
In addition to the significant volume of new 
regulation emanating from the Basel Committee and 
others, the landscape of financial sector regulation 
itself in a number of major Western countries is 
undergoing significant change, presenting its own 
challenges to the industry and its implementation of 
proposed reforms.  93
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
• In the EU, new authorities for segments of the 
financial services sector took up their powers 
with effect from 1 January 2011: the European 
Banking Authority, the European Securities 
Markets Authority and the European Insurance 
and Occupational Pension Authority. In 
addition, a European Systemic Risk Board will 
consider emerging macro-prudential risks. 
• In the UK, the Financial Services Authority’s 
(‘FSA’) prudential supervisory responsibilities 
will be transferred in 2012 to a Bank of England 
agency, the Prudential Regulatory Authority, 
while the Financial Conduct Authority will act 
as a single regulator of conduct of business for 
both retail and wholesale firms. 
• In the US, the Dodd-Frank Act re-assigns 
responsibilities of existing agencies, demising 
the Office of Thrift Supervision and creating 
others, including a Financial Stability Oversight 
Council to address systemic matters and a 
Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
Implementation risks 
The extensive programme of regulatory change 
carries significant implementation risks for 
authorities and industry participants alike, including: 
• Disparities in implementation: many official 
measures are proposals in development and 
negotiation, and have yet to be enacted into 
regional and national legislation. These 
processes could result in differing, fragmented 
and overlapping implementation around the 
world, leading to risks of regulatory arbitrage, a 
far from level competitive playing-field and 
increased compliance costs, especially for large, 
global financial institutions such as HSBC. 
• Timetable and market expectations: while the 
Basel Committee has announced the timetable 
for its core proposals in Basel III, it remains 
uncertain how these and other measures will 
play out in practice, for instance with regard to 
differences in approach between Basel III and 
the Dodd-Frank Act in the US. Meanwhile, 
market expectations will exert pressure on 
institutions to assess and effect compliance well 
in advance of official timetables. 
• Wider economic impact and unforeseen 
consequences: while the conclusions of official 
and industry studies have diverged, the 
measures proposed will clearly impact on 
financial and economic activity in ways that 
cannot yet be clearly foreseen. For example, 
higher capital requirements may seriously 
constrain the availability of funds for lending to 
support economic recovery.  
Credit Risk 
Credit risk management 
(Audited) 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer 
or counterparty fails to meet a payment obligation 
under a contract. It arises principally from direct 
lending, trade finance and leasing business, but also 
from off-balance sheet products such as counterparty 
risk guarantees and credit derivatives, and from our 
holdings of debt securities. Of the risks in which we 
engage, credit risk generates the largest regulatory 
capital requirement. 
Principal objectives of our credit risk management  
• to maintain across HSBC a strong culture of responsible 
lending and a robust risk policy and control framework;  
• to both partner and challenge our businesses in defining, 
implementing and continually re-evaluating our risk appetite 
under actual and scenario conditions; and  
• to ensure there is independent, expert scrutiny of credit 
risks, their costs and their mitigation. 
The Credit Risk department fulfils the role of an 
independent credit control unit as part of the Global 
Risk function in our Group Management Office 
(‘GMO’). Credit approval authorities are delegated 
by the Board to the most senior Chief Executive 
Officers, who receive commensurate authorities 
from their own boards. In each major subsidiary, a 
Chief Risk Officer reports to the local Chief 
Executive Officer on credit-related issues, while 
maintaining a direct functional reporting line to the 
Group Chief Risk Officer in GMO. 
Credit quality 
(Audited) 
Our credit risk rating systems and processes 
differentiate exposures in order to highlight those 
with greater risk factors and higher potential severity 
of loss. In the case of individually significant 
accounts, risk ratings are reviewed regularly and any 
amendments are implemented promptly. Within our 
retail businesses, risk is assessed and managed using 
a wide range of risk and pricing models to generate 
portfolio data. 
Our risk rating system facilitates the internal 
ratings-based (‘IRB’) approach under Basel II 
adopted by the Group to support calculation of our 
minimum credit regulatory capital requirement. 
For further details, see ‘Credit quality of financial 
instruments’ on page 114.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Special attention is paid to problem exposures 
in order to accelerate remedial action. Where 
appropriate, our operating companies use specialist 
units to provide customers with support in order to 
help them avoid default wherever possible.
The high-level oversight and management of credit risk 
provided globally by the Credit Risk function within GMO 
• to formulate Group credit policy. Compliance, subject to 
approved dispensations, is mandatory for all operating 
companies which must develop local credit policies 
consistent with Group policies;  
• to guide operating companies on our appetite for credit risk 
exposure to specified market sectors, activities and banking 
products and controlling exposures to certain higher-risk 
sectors;
• to undertake an independent review and objective 
assessment of risk. Global Risk assesses all commercial 
non-bank credit facilities and exposures over designated 
limits, prior to the facilities being committed to customers 
or transactions being undertaken; 
• to monitor the performance and management of portfolios 
across the Group; 
• to control exposure to sovereign entities, banks and other 
financial institutions, as well as debt securities which are not 
held solely for the purpose of trading; 
• to set our policy on large credit exposures, ensuring that 
concentrations of exposure by counterparty, sector or 
geography do not become excessive in relation to our 
capital base, and remain within internal and regulatory 
limits; 
• to control our cross-border exposures (see page 102); 
• to maintain and develop our risk rating framework and 
systems. The Group Chief Risk Officer chairs the Credit 
Risk Analytics Oversight Committee, which reports to the 
Risk Management Meeting and oversees risk rating model 
governance for both wholesale and retail business;  
• to report on retail portfolio performance, high risk 
portfolios, risk concentrations, country limits and cross-
border exposures, large impaired accounts, impairment 
allowances and stress testing results and recommendations 
to the Risk Management Meeting, the Group Risk 
Committee and the Board; and 
• to act on behalf of HSBC Holdings as the primary interface, 
for credit-related issues, with the Bank of England, the FSA, 
local regulators, rating agencies, analysts and counterparts 
in major banks and non-bank financial institutions.
Group and regional Credit Review and Risk 
Identification teams regularly review exposures and 
processes in order to provide an independent, 
rigorous assessment of credit risk across the HSBC 
Group, reinforce secondary risk management 
controls and share best practice. Internal audit, as a 
tertiary control function, focuses on risks with a 
global perspective and on the design and 
effectiveness of primary and secondary controls, 
carrying out oversight audits via sampling of 
global/regional control frameworks, themed audits of 
key or emerging risks and project audits to assess 
major change initiatives.  
Impairment assessment 
(Audited) 
It is HSBC’s policy that each operating company 
creates allowances for impaired loans promptly and 
consistently. 
Impairment allowances may be assessed and 
created either for individually significant accounts 
or, on a collective basis, for groups of individually 
significant accounts for which no evidence of 
impairment has been individually identified or for 
high-volume groups of homogeneous loans that are 
not considered individually significant. 
When impairment losses occur, we reduce the 
carrying amount of loans and advances through the 
use of an allowance account. When impairment of 
available-for-sale financial assets and held-to-
maturity financial investments occurs, we reduce 
the carrying amount of the asset directly. For further 
details, see ‘Critical accounting policies’ on page 33.
Write-off of loans and advances 
Loans are normally written off, either partially or in 
full, when there is no realistic prospect of further 
recovery. For secured loans, write-off generally 
occurs after receipt of any proceeds from the 
realisation of security. Write-off may occur earlier 
when the net realisable value of any collateral has 
been determined and there is no reasonable 
expectation of further recovery. 
In HSBC Finance, the carrying amounts of 
residential mortgage and second lien loans in excess 
of net realisable value are written off at or before the 
time foreclosure is completed or settlement is 
reached with the borrower. If there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery, and foreclosure is pursued, 
the loan is normally written off no later than the end 
of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days 
contractually past due. 
Unsecured personal facilities, including credit 
cards, are generally written off at between 150 and 
210 days past due, the standard period being the end 
of the month in which the account becomes 180 days 
contractually delinquent. Write-off periods may be 
extended, generally to no more than 360 days past 
due but in very exceptional circumstances exceeding 
that figure, in a few countries where local regulation 
or legislation constrain earlier write-off, or where the 
realisation of collateral for secured real estate 
lending extends to this time.  
In the event of bankruptcy or analogous 
proceedings, write-off may occur earlier than at the  95
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
periods stated above. Collections procedures may 
continue after write-off. 
Cross-border exposures 
We assess the vulnerability of countries to foreign 
currency payment restrictions, including economic 
and political factors, when considering impairment 
allowances on cross-border exposures. Impairment 
allowances are assessed in respect of all qualifying 
exposures within vulnerable countries unless these 
exposures and the inherent risks are: 
• performing, trade-related and of less than one 
year’s maturity;  
• mitigated by acceptable security cover which is, 
other than in exceptional cases, held outside the 
country concerned;  
• in the form of securities held for trading 
purposes for which a liquid and active market 
exists, and which are measured at fair value 
daily; and 
• performing facilities with a principal (excluding 
security) of US$1m or below and/or with 
maturity dates shorter than three months. 
Credit exposure 
Maximum exposure to credit risk 
(Audited) 
Our credit exposure is spread across a broad range of 
asset classes, including derivatives, trading assets, 
loans and advances to customers, loans and advances 
to banks and financial investments. In 2010, 
exposure to credit risk remained diversified across 
classes. However, the balance changed compared 
with the end of 2009, reflecting growth in loans 
and advances to both customers and banks, and a 
reduction in trading assets due to the deconsolidation 
of the Constant Net Asset Value funds. 
Residential mortgage lending continued to 
represent a significant portion of our overall credit 
exposure. In 2010, the credit quality of our mortgage 
portfolios generally improved, reflecting economic 
conditions and a stabilisation of unemployment and 
house prices in most of our key markets. Despite 
some improvement, economic and housing market 
conditions remain difficult across the US and we 
remain focused on running off the residual balances 
in our Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services 
portfolio. In the UK, we grew our residential 
mortgage lending exposure as a result of successful 
promotional campaigns and competitive pricing. The 
consistent application of conservative underwriting 
criteria ensured the credit quality of our residential 
mortgage exposure in the UK remained satisfactory 
and well secured. Our exposure to the Hong Kong 
residential mortgage market also grew during 2010; 
we continued to lend conservatively with an average 
loan-to-value ratio of 55% on new mortgage sales.

The following table presents the maximum 
exposure to credit risk from balance sheet and off-
balance sheet financial instruments, before taking 
account of any collateral held or other credit 
enhancements (unless such credit enhancements meet 
accounting offsetting requirements). For financial 
assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum 
exposure to credit risk equals their carrying amount; 
for financial guarantees and similar contracts 
granted, it is the maximum amount that we would 
have to pay if the guarantees were called upon. For 
loan commitments and other credit-related 
commitments that are irrevocable over the life of the 
respective facilities, it is generally the full amount of 
the committed facilities.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Collateral and other credit enhancements 
(Audited) 
Collateral held against financial instruments 
presented in the above table is described in more 
detail below.
Loans and advances  
Although collateral can be an important mitigant of 
credit risk, it is our policy to lend on the basis of the 
customer’s capacity to repay rather than to rely on 
the value of security offered. Depending on the 
customer’s standing and the type of product, 
facilities may be provided unsecured. 
We employ the following principal collateral 
types: 
• in the personal sector, mortgages over 
residential properties; 
• in the commercial and industrial sector, charges 
over business assets such as premises, stock and 
debtors;
• in the commercial real estate sector, charges 
over the properties being financed; and 
• in the financial sector, charges over financial 
instruments such as cash, debt securities and 
equities in support of trading facilities. 
In addition, credit derivatives and securitisation 
structures are used to hedge or transfer credit risk 
within our loan portfolio. 
The loans and advances offset adjustment in the 
table above primarily relates to customer loans and 
deposits, and balances arising from repo and reverse 
repo transactions. The offset relates to balances 
where there is a legally enforceable right of offset 
in the event of counterparty default, and where, 
as a result, there is a net exposure for credit risk 
management purposes. However, as there is no 
intention to settle these balances on a net basis under 
normal circumstances, they do not qualify for net 
presentation for accounting purposes.  97
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
We do not disclose the fair value of collateral 
held as security or other credit enhancements on 
loans and advances past due but not impaired, or on 
individually assessed impaired loans and advances, 
as it is not practicable to do so. 
Derivatives
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association 
(‘ISDA’) Master Agreement is our preferred 
agreement for documenting derivatives activity. It 
provides the contractual framework within which 
dealing activity across a full range of OTC products 
is conducted, and contractually binds both parties to 
apply close-out netting across all outstanding 
transactions covered by an agreement if either party 
defaults or another pre-agreed termination event 
occurs. It is common, and our preferred practice, for 
the parties to execute a Credit Support Annex 
(‘CSA’) in conjunction with the ISDA Master 
Agreement. Under a CSA, collateral is passed 
between the parties to mitigate the counterparty risk 
inherent in outstanding positions. The majority of 
our CSAs are with financial institutional clients. 
The derivative offset amount in the above table 
relates to exposures where the counterparty has an 
offsetting derivative exposure with HSBC, a master 
netting arrangement is in place and the credit risk 
exposure is managed on a net basis, or the position is 
specifically collateralised, normally in the form of 
cash. At 31 December 2010, the total amount of such 
offsets was US$197.5bn (2009: US$189.6bn), of 
which US$178.3bn (2009: US$168.5bn) were offsets 
under a master netting arrangement, US$19.0bn 
(2009: US$21.0bn) were collateral received in cash 
and US$0.2bn (2009: US$0.1bn) were other 
collateral. These amounts do not qualify for net 
presentation for accounting purposes, as settlement 
may not actually be made on a net basis. 
Treasury, other eligible bills and debt securities  
Debt securities, treasury and other eligible bills are 
generally unsecured except for asset-backed 
securities (‘ABS’) and similar instruments, which 
are secured by pools of financial assets.
Items in the course of collection from other banks 
Settlement risk arises in any situation where a 
payment in cash, securities or equities is made in the 
expectation of a corresponding receipt of cash, 
securities or equities. Daily settlement limits are 
established for counterparties to cover the aggregate 
of our transactions with each one on any single day. 
We substantially mitigate settlement risk on 
many transactions, particularly those involving 
securities and equities, by settling through assured 
payment systems or on a delivery-versus-payment 
basis. 
Concentration of exposure
(Audited) 
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number 
of counterparties or exposures have comparable 
economic characteristics, or such counterparties are 
engaged in similar activities or operate in the same 
geographical areas or industry sectors, so that their 
collective ability to meet contractual obligations is 
uniformly affected by changes in economic, political 
or other conditions. We use a number of controls 
and measures to minimise undue concentration of 
exposure in our portfolios across industry, country 
and customer groups. These include portfolio and 
counterparty limits, approval and review controls, 
and stress testing. 
Wrong-way risk is an aggravated form of 
concentration risk and arises when there is a strong 
correlation between the counterparty’s probability 
of default and the mark-to-market value of the 
underlying transaction. We use a range of procedures 
to monitor and control wrong-way risk, including 
requiring entities to obtain prior approval before 
undertaking wrong-way risk transactions outside 
pre-agreed guidelines.

Debt securities, treasury and other eligible bills 
(Unaudited) 
HSBC’s holdings of corporate debt, ABS and other 
securities were spread across a wide range of issuers 
and geographical regions, with 25% invested in 
securities issued by banks and other financial 
institutions. A more detailed analysis of financial 
investments is set out in Note 21 on the Financial 
Statements and an analysis by credit quality is 
provided on page 114. 
At 31 December 2010, our insurance businesses 
held diversified portfolios of debt and equity 
securities designated at fair value (2010: US$28bn; 
2009: US$25bn) and debt securities classified as 
financial investments (2010: US$38bn; 2009: 
US$35bn). A more detailed analysis of securities 
held by the insurance businesses is set out on

Derivatives  
(Unaudited) 
Derivative assets at 31 December 2010 were 
US$261bn, a rise of 4% from 31 December 2009. 
Our single largest exposure was to interest rate 
derivatives, and this balance increased in 2010 
reflecting downward shifts in yield curves, partly 
offset by higher netting from increased trading with 
clearing houses. The notional value of outstanding 
contracts also rose, reflecting an increase in the 
number of open transactions compared with 2009. In 
addition our exposure to exchange rate derivatives 
rose as a result of increased volatility. 
Loans and advances 
(Unaudited) 
On a reported basis, gross loans and advances to 
customers (excluding the financial sector) at 
31 December 2010 increased by US$52bn or 6% 
from 31 December 2009. On a constant currency 
basis the increase was 7%. The rise was primarily 
due to growth in Asia, mainly in trade-related 
lending and, to a lesser extent, our commercial real 
estate and personal lending portfolios, as the region 
prospered.

Reported basis
The following commentary is on a constant 
currency basis: 
Personal lending was US$425bn, a decline of 
2% compared with the end of 2009 as growth in 
residential mortgage lending was more than offset 
by lower other personal lending balances. Personal 
lending represented 43% of our total lending to 
customers. At US$269bn, residential mortgage 
lending constituted the Group’s largest concentration 
in a single exposure type. In 2010, residential 
mortgage lending increased by 4%, reflecting strong 
growth in new mortgage sales in Hong Kong and the 
UK. This was partly offset by a 12% decline in the 
US, mainly due to the continued run-off of our 
Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services 
portfolios.
Corporate and commercial lending was 46% 
of gross lending to customers at 31 December 
2010, comprising our largest lending category. 
Commercial, industrial and international trade 
represented the largest portion of this category and 
this increased by 23% in the year, reflecting the 
growth in trade activity, particularly in Asia. 
Commercial real estate lending, which represented 
7% of total gross lending to customers, increased by 
5% due to strong growth in Hong Kong. 
In the financial category, our largest exposure 
was to non-bank financial institutions; this largely 
comprised secured lending on trading accounts, 
mainly repo facilities. 
Loans and advances to banks were widely 
distributed across major institutions in 2010 and 
increased by 16% as placements with central 
and commercial banks in Europe, Asia and Latin 
America rose. 
The following tables analyse loans by industry 
sector and by the location of the principal operations 
of the lending subsidiary or, in the case of the 
operations of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking 
Corporation, HSBC Bank, HSBC Bank Middle East 
and HSBC Bank USA, by the location of the lending 
branch. 99

Country distribution of outstandings and 
cross-border exposures 
(Unaudited)
We control the risk associated with cross-border 
lending through a centralised structure of internal 
country limits. Exposures to individual countries and 
cross-border exposure in the aggregate are kept 
under continual review. 
The following table summarises the aggregate 
of in-country foreign currency and cross-border 
outstandings by type of borrower to countries which 
individually represent in excess of 0.75% of our total 
assets. The classification is based on the country of 
residence of the borrower but also recognises the 
transfer of country risk in respect of third-party 
guarantees, eligible collateral held and residence of 
the head office when the borrower is a branch. In 
accordance with the Bank of England Country 
Exposure Report (Form CE) guidelines, outstandings 
comprise loans and advances (excluding settlement 
accounts), amounts receivable under finance leases, 
acceptances, commercial bills, certificates of deposit 
(‘CD’s) and debt and equity securities (net of short 
positions), and exclude accrued interest and 
intra-HSBC exposures.  103

Areas of special interest 
Wholesale lending 
(Unaudited) 
Wholesale lending covers the range of credit 
facilities granted to sovereign borrowers, banks, 
non-bank financial institutions and corporate 
entities. Our wholesale portfolios are well 
diversified across geographical and industry 
sectors, with certain exposures subject to specific 
portfolio controls. Overall credit quality improved 
during 2010, as economies generally demonstrated 
signs of recovery. 
Exposures to countries in the eurozone 
(Unaudited) 
Intervention by governments to stabilise and re-
capitalise banks and other financial intermediaries 
during the financial crisis helped to reduce the 
possibility of a systemic threat to financial markets 
by transferring risk from the private sector to 
sovereign bodies. In 2010, this contributed to 
the creation of large fiscal imbalances in some 
industrialised economies and as a result, market 
concerns about sovereign credit risk in these 
countries intensified. Credit spreads for the affected 
sovereign and bank credit markets remained 
volatile during most of 2010. Risk aversion 
resurfaced, and the assumption of higher sovereign 
credit risk premia in private securities prices 
triggered portfolio reallocation to safer assets and a 
tightening of market liquidity. Initial concerns over 
liquidity and funding spread to doubts about 
solvency in a number of cases. The table below 
summarises our exposures to governments and 
central banks of selected eurozone countries, and 
near/quasi government agencies and banks 
domiciled in those countries. An analysis of loans 
and advances to customers by significant countries 
is provided on page 101.  
Our exposure to eurozone countries under 
pressure in 2010 was US$25.4bn. 
Sovereign debt 
As a result of the disruption in global financial 
markets, the eurozone experienced a severe 
recession, followed by a sovereign debt crisis in 
some member countries, where the high level of 
government deficits, banking system problems, 
fiscal imbalances and low or declining GDP growth 
increased their perceived vulnerability to a future 
downturn. Various financial and political stresses 
forced Greece and Ireland to seek a bailout by the 
ECB and the International Monetary Fund (‘IMF’) 
in May and November 2010, respectively, and 
contagion risk to peripheral countries, notably Italy, 
Portugal and Spain persisted. Belgium was also  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

under pressure, but for its specific political situation. 
Rating agencies downgraded the debt of a number 
of eurozone countries during 2010 and put some 
on review for possible downgrades. While the 
ECB continues to provide broad access to liquidity 
support for eurozone sovereign borrowers and banks, 
the availability of longer-term fiscal support from 
the EU for sovereigns is less certain and may lead 
to debt restructuring and increased private sector 
participation.
The eurozone as a whole retained substantial 
economic and financial strength despite the stresses 
from the financial crisis. However, concerns 
remained over the refinancing risks for sovereign 
borrowers and banks posed by the problems with 
market liquidity and the uncertainty surrounding 
support arrangements in the longer term. Eurozone 
policymakers have created two major facilities to 
counter short-term financing problems, the European 
Financial Stability Facility and the European 
Financial Stability Mechanism. This has been 
viewed as a positive development by the market and 
rating agencies, though implementation awaits 
disclosure of further details by the policymakers. We 
expect the ECB and eurozone countries will focus in 
2011 on resolving intra-eurozone imbalances, 
rebuilding public finances, improving fiscal 
discipline, strengthening the banking system and 
managing cross-border risk. 
We have closely managed our exposure to 
sovereign debt during 2010. At 31 December 2010, 
our exposure to the sovereign debt of Belgium, 
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain was 
US$8.4bn and the overall quality of the portfolio was 
strong with most in-country and cross-border limits 
extended to countries with high-grade internal credit 
risk ratings. We regularly update our assessment of 
higher risk countries and adjust our risk appetite to 
reflect such changes.  105

European banks 
In May 2010, an FSB review indicated that European 
banks would have to make additional loan impairment 
charges of up to US$143bn in 2011. Following the 
publication of this report, bond spreads on both 
European and US banks widened. The size of the 
financial sector’s exposure to sovereign debt and 
doubts about economic conditions in parts of the 
eurozone raised fresh concerns about banks’ credit 
ratings. In addition, uncertainty over liquidity, 
solvency, funding, changing regulation, capital 
requirements and taxation, and speculation over the 
stability of the euro, continued to cloud the future for 
European banking. 
The banking sector in the eurozone remains 
under stress, mainly as a consequence of 
governments having to finance large budget deficits, 
troubles in property markets and weak credit growth. 
The Ireland bailout was a direct consequence of the 
failure of the Irish banking sector, largely driven by 
the domestic property price crash. Worries about the 
size and quality of eurozone banks’ exposure to 
weaker eurozone countries are entwined with 
concerns about their ability to fund themselves. 
European banks share nearly three quarters of the 
public and private sector debt in Belgium, Greece, 
Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The regional and 
local banks in the eurozone are considered more 
vulnerable than well-diversified global banks. 
During 2010, we were subject to the Committee 
of European Banking Supervisors (now the European 
Banking Authority) coordinated stress test of 91 EU 
financial institutions. Banks were required to meet a 
6% minimum tier 1 target under stress. We passed the 
test satisfactorily, with a post-stress tier 1 ratio of 
10.2% placing us in the top quartile of the institutions 
tested. Further stress testing is due to take place in 
2011.
We expect that the pace of reforms outlined 
by various policymakers will gather speed in 2011, 
most notably the Basel III proposals. These regulations 
will require banks to hold more capital and a higher 
quality of capital and implement new liquidity rules, 
and are likely to result in a rise in the cost of funding 
and put pressure on credit pricing. 
We continue to closely monitor and manage 
eurozone bank exposures, and are cautious in lending 
to this sector. We regularly update our assessment of 
higher-risk eurozone banks and adjust our risk appetite 
accordingly. We also, where possible, seek to play a 
positive role in maintaining credit and liquidity supply. 
Middle East and North Africa 
In 2009, Dubai World requested a standstill agreement 
with creditors in respect of the indebtedness of certain 
Dubai World group companies. The market disruption 
that ensued cut would-be borrowers off from the 
capital markets, although continued restructuring 
efforts throughout 2010 saw the return of significant 
positive sentiment from investors. As one of the long-
term bankers to Dubai World and the various entities 
related to the Government of Dubai, the Group has 
worked closely during 2010 to address the prevailing 
issues. In October 2010, Dubai World obtained an 
agreement to restructure US$25bn of its debt subject 
to final documentation expected to be signed in the 
first half of 2011. The arrangement extends loan 
maturities for five to eight years at discounted rates, 
allowing Dubai World time to sell off its non-core 
assets while focusing on its core earnings. The 
Group’s exposure to Dubai is primarily spread across 
operating companies within the emirate. 
Political developments in the region are being 
monitored closely and action taken to mitigate their 
impact. It is too early to foresee how events may 
unfold; hitherto, our business in the region has for 
the most part operated without serious disruption. In 
the medium term, economic growth in the region 
may be adversely affected, with wider implications 
if the prices of oil, food and commodities rise 
significantly. 
Commercial real estate 
Our exposure in the commercial real estate sectors is 
concentrated in the UK, North America and Hong 
Kong. While there were some positive signs of 
recovery in markets in the UK and the US, in part 
supported by the low levels of interest rates, the slow 
speed of the recovery meant that financing and re-
financing activity in the sector remained subdued. In 
Hong Kong, the economy recovered robustly and the 
market was relatively buoyant in 2010, characterised 
by strong demand and continuing credit appetite.  
On a constant currency basis, the aggregate of 
our commercial real estate and other property-related 
lending of US$107bn at 31 December 2010 was 7% 
higher than at 31 December 2009 and represented 
11% of total loans and advances to customers. The 
increase in exposure was largely in Hong Kong, 
offset by a reduction in North America. In 2010, 
credit quality across this sector generally showed 
signs of stabilising but remained under stress in 
certain markets.  
Across our portfolios, credit risk is mitigated by 
long-standing and conservative policies on asset  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

origination which focus on relationships with long-
term customers and limited initial leverage. We also 
set and monitor sector risk appetite limits at Group 
and regional levels to detect and prevent higher risk 
concentrations. While individual regions differ in 
their approach, typically origination loan to value 
ratios would be less than 65% across the Group. 
Personal lending  
(Unaudited)
We provide a broad range of secured and unsecured 
personal lending products to meet customer needs. 
Given the diverse nature of the markets in which 
we operate, the range is not standard across 
all countries but is tailored to meet the demands 
of individual markets while using appropriate 
distribution channels and, wherever possible, global 
IT platforms. 
Personal lending includes advances to customers 
for asset purchases, such as residential property and 
motor vehicles, where the loans are typically secured 
by the assets being acquired. We also offer loans 
secured on existing assets, such as first and second 
liens on residential property; unsecured lending 
products such as overdrafts, credit cards and payroll 
loans; and debt consolidation loans which may be 
secured or unsecured. 
In 2010, credit quality in our personal lending 
portfolios improved, reflecting a recovery of 
economic conditions in most markets. Delinquency 
levels and loan impairment charges declined, 
particularly in those countries which had previously 
been most affected by rising unemployment and 
house price depreciation.  
The commentary that follows is on an 
underlying basis. 
At 31 December 2010, total personal lending 
was US$425bn, a decline of 2% from 31 December 
2009 as the reduction in our US run-off portfolios 
continued, partly offset by notable growth in Hong 
Kong and the UK. Within our PFS business, total 
loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions of US$11.3bn were 44% lower than in 
2009, and were concentrated in North America 
(US$8.2bn) and, to a lesser extent, Europe 
(US$1.2bn) and Latin America (US$1.2bn). 
In the UK, total personal lending was 
US$129bn, an increase of 4% compared with the end 
of 2009. The increase was due to growth in mortgage 
lending as a result of the enhancement of our product 
offerings, successful marketing and competitive 
pricing (UK mortgage lending is discussed in greater 
detail on page 108). This was partly offset by an 8% 
fall in other personal lending balances, reflecting a 
reduction in unsecured lending products as we 
tightened our underwriting criteria and some 
consumers reduced their indebtedness. 
Total personal lending balances in the US at 
31 December 2010 were US$109bn, a decrease of 
19% compared with the end of 2009, reflecting the 
continued reduction in balances in our consumer 
finance run-off portfolios and lower balances in our 
Card and Retail Services business.  
US residential mortgage lending balances fell by 
12% to US$58bn, driven by the decisions taken in 
2007 to close the Mortgage Services business and in 
March 2009 to close all Consumer Lending branches 
and run off the residual consumer finance balances. 
US mortgage lending is discussed in greater detail on 
page 108. 
In PFS, total loan impairment charges and 
other credit risk provisions were 44% down 
on 2009. 
Other personal lending balances in the US were 
US$52bn at 31 December 2010, 25% lower than at 
the end of 2009. Credit card balances declined by 
14% reflecting a reduction in active customer 
accounts and an increased focus by our customers 
on reducing outstanding credit card debt.  
In March we sold US$1.0bn of vehicle finance 
loans. This was followed in August by the sale of the 
residual vehicle finance loans (US$4.3bn) to the 
same purchaser. 
In Hong Kong, total personal lending grew by 
20% to US$57bn as a result of strong growth in 
residential mortgage lending. In the Rest of Asia-
Pacific region, personal lending also grew strongly 
across many countries, notably Australia, Singapore 
and Malaysia, through successful marketing. This 
growth was partly offset by a managed reduction in 
unsecured personal lending balances in India. 
In Latin America, total personal lending was 
broadly flat at US$22bn as moderate growth in 
residential mortgage lending, particularly in Brazil, 
was more than offset by a decline in other personal 
lending. The latter reflected falls in credit card 
lending in Mexico and other higher-risk portfolios in 
Mexico and Brazil as we continued to reduce higher-
risk portfolios in the region and tighten our 
underwriting criteria.

Mortgage lending 
We offer a wide range of mortgage products 
designed to meet customer needs, including capital 
repayment mortgages subject to fixed or variable 
interest rates and products designed to meet demand 
for housing loans with more flexible payment 
structures. We underwrite both first lien residential 
mortgages and loans secured on second lien 
mortgages. 
Interest-only mortgages are those for which 
customers make regular payments of interest during 
the life of the loan and repay the principal from the 
sale of their home or alternative sources of funds. 
Typically, with introductory interest-only mortgages, 
the interest-only element is for a fixed term at the 
start of the loan, after which principal repayments 
commence. 
Affordability mortgages include all products 
where the customers’ monthly payments are set at  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

a low initial rate, either variable or fixed, before 
resetting to a higher rate once the introductory period 
is over. Offset mortgages are products linked to a 
current or savings account, where interest earned is 
used to repay mortgage debt.
UK mortgage lending 
On a constant currency basis, total mortgage lending 
in the UK, comprising residential and second lien 
lending, increased by 7% to US$104bn at 
31 December 2010. Growth was achieved largely 
through the enhancement of our product offerings, 
successful marketing and competitive pricing. 
Nonetheless, mortgage lending was constrained by 
the decline in re-mortgage activity due to the low 
interest rate environment and consumer concerns 
over future employment and higher interest rates. 
Our UK mortgage portfolio remained of high 
quality, consisting primarily of lending to owner-
occupiers. We restricted lending to purchase 
residential property for the purpose of rental and 
almost all new business was originated through our 
own salesforce, with the self-certification of income 
not permitted. The majority of mortgage lending was 
to existing customers holding current or savings 
accounts with HSBC; this facilitated and 
strengthened the underwriting process. 
Loan impairment charges and delinquency 
levels in our UK mortgage book declined despite 
unemployment remaining high, mainly due to 
improving economic conditions and low interest 
rates, which helped make mortgages more affordable 
for customers. Our continuing enhancements in 
credit underwriting, credit policies and collection 
processes contributed to the reduction in 
delinquencies. 
The percentage of loans that were 30 days or 
more delinquent declined from 1.6% at 31 December 
2009 to 1.4% in 2010 in the HSBC Bank mortgage 
portfolio and remained at less than 1.0% in the First 
Direct portfolio. 
In 2010, the average loan-to-value ratio for 
new business in the UK was 54%, an increase of a 
single percentage point on the previous year. 
Interest-only mortgage balances increased 
by 4% to US$45bn compared with 2009. The 
majority of these mortgages were offset mortgages 
at First Direct for which delinquency rates remained 
at very low levels. 
US mortgage lending 
US mortgage lending balances, comprising 
residential and second lien lending, were US$67bn at 
31 December 2010, a decline of 14% compared with 
the end of 2009. 
Mortgage lending in HSBC Finance fell by 17% 
to US$51bn with declines in both the Consumer 
Lending and Mortgage Services portfolios from 
their planned run-off. See table on page 110 for a 
breakdown of mortgage lending in HSBC Finance. 
Mortgage lending in the UK rose by 7% to 
US$104bn, while in the US balances 
declined by 14% to US$67bn. 
Mortgage lending balances in HSBC Bank USA 
remained broadly unchanged at US$16bn. We 
continue to sell the majority of new origination to 
the secondary markets as a means of managing our 
interest rate risk and improving structural liquidity. 
This reduction was partly offset by an increase in 
originations to Premier customers with whom we 
already held a banking relationship. At 31 December 
2010, approximately 32% of the HSBC Bank USA 
mortgage portfolio were fixed rate loans and 77% 
were first lien. 
During 2010, state and federal officials 
announced investigations into the procedures 
followed by mortgage servicing companies and 
banks, including HSBC Finance and its affiliates, 
in relation to foreclosures. This included a joint 
examination by the Federal Reserve and the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency. Following the 
examination, our examiners issued supervisory 
letters noting deficiencies in our processing, 
preparation and signing of affidavits and other 
documents supporting foreclosures, and in the 
governance of and resources devoted to our 
foreclosure process. We have suspended foreclosures 
pending correction of the weaknesses. Management 
is reviewing all foreclosures which have not yet been 
completed, and will correct deficient documentation 
and refile documents where required. 
As a result of the investigations, we expect that 
the scrutiny of documents will increase, and in some 
states additional verification of information may be 
required. If these trends continue after we reinstitute 
foreclosure, there could be additional delays in the 
process.
A discussion of credit trends in the US mortgage 
lending portfolio and the steps taken to mitigate risk 
is provided in ‘US personal lending – credit quality’ 
on page 110.

Credit quality
During 2010, economic conditions in the US 
generally improved, although the pace of 
improvement continued to be slow.  
In the first half of 2010, house prices stabilised 
in many markets and began to recover in others, as 
the first time homebuyer tax credit and continued 
low interest rates favourably affected the housing 
market. However, in the second half of the year, 
house prices declined in many markets as the 
homebuyer tax credit ended and foreclosure levels 
rose. 
Unemployment rates, which have been a major 
factor in the deterioration of credit quality, were 
9.4% in December 2010, a decrease of 60 basis 
points since December 2009. Unemployment rates in 
18 states were at or above the US national average 
and unemployment rates in 5 states were at or above 
11%, including California and Florida, where more 
than 5% of HSBC Finance’s total loan balances are 
based.
Ongoing improvement in the US economy will 
be dependent on a sustained recovery in the housing 
market and unemployment rates, as well as the 
continuation of low interest rates. Renewed 
weakening in these factors and in consumer 
confidence may adversely affect consumer payment 
patterns and credit quality.

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Mortgage lending 
In 2010, we reduced our non-prime mortgage 
exposure as balances continued to run-off in our 
Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services portfolios 
in HSBC Finance. At 31 December 2010, residential 
mortgage lending balances were US$58bn, a decline 
of 12% compared with the end of 2009.  
In both our Consumer Lending and Mortgage 
Services mortgage portfolios, two months or more 
delinquent balances declined as balances ran-off and 
economic conditions improved. In addition, written-
off balances were replaced with lower levels of new 
delinquency volumes as the portfolios continue to 
season. First lien two months or more delinquent 
balances in our Consumer Lending portfolio declined 
from US$5.4bn at 31 December 2009 to US$4.9bn at 
31 December 2010 and, in our Mortgage Services 
portfolio, from US$3.1bn at 31 December 2009 to 
US$2.8bn at 31 December 2010. In each case, lending 
balances liquidated at a faster pace than delinquency. 
As a result, two months or more delinquency rates on 
first lien loans in our Consumer Lending portfolio 
increased from 15.4% at 31 December 2009 to 16.2%, 
while in our Mortgage Services portfolio, two months 
or more delinquency rates increased from 16.5% to 
18.0%.
At HSBC Bank USA, we continued to sell the 
majority of new mortgage loan originations to the 
secondary markets. These decreases were partly offset 
by increases to the portfolio from new lending to our 
Premier relationship customers. Two months or more 
delinquency rates decreased from 8.6% to 7.9% at 
31 December 2010, while delinquent balances 
remained flat at US$1.0bn. 
Second lien mortgage loans have a risk profile 
characterised by higher loan-to-value ratios because, 
in the majority of cases, the loans were taken out to 
complete the refinancing or purchase of properties. 
Loss experience on default of second lien loans has 
typically approached 100% of the amount owed, as 
any equity in the property is initially applied to the 
first lien loan. In the Mortgage Services second lien 
portfolio, outstanding balances declined by 26% to 
US$2.3bn and two months or more delinquency rates 
decreased to 10.8% at 31 December 2010. In the 
Consumer Lending second lien portfolio, outstanding 
balances declined by 28% to US$3.3bn, and two 
months or more delinquency rates decreased to 12.7% 
at 31 December 2010.  
At HSBC Bank USA, second lien balances 
declined by 10% to US$3.7bn, and two months or 
more delinquency rates increased from 4.0% at 
31 December 2009 to 4.8% at 31 December 2010 due 
to the effects of high unemployment levels. 
Stated-income mortgages are underwritten on the 
basis of borrowers’ representations of annual income 
and are not verified by supporting documents and, as 
a result, represent a higher than average level of risk. 
Stated income balances in HSBC Finance declined 
from US$3.9bn to US$2.9bn as the portfolio 
continued to run off. Two months or more 
delinquency rates increased to 24.0% at 31 December 
2010. In HSBC Bank USA, stated-income balances 
were unchanged at US$2.1bn while delinquency rates 
decreased from 11.1% at 31 December 2009 to 10.6% 
at 31 December 2010. 
At 31 December 2010, HSBC Finance had 
US$7.6bn of affordability mortgages, a decline 
of 24% compared with 31 December 2009, as the 
portfolio continued to run off. At HSBC Bank USA, 
affordability mortgage balances of US$10.9bn at 
31 December 2010 compared with US$11.1bn at 
31 December 2009. 
Real estate markets in the majority of the US 
have been and will continue to be, affected by 
stagnation or declines in property values. As a result, 
loan-to-value ratios for our real estate secured loans 
have generally deteriorated since origination. Loans 
with a loan-to-value of 100% or more have 
historically had a greater likelihood of becoming 
delinquent. At 31 December 2010 loans in negative 
equity were US$14bn, compared with US$19bn at the 
end of 2009. 
At HSBC Finance, the number of foreclosed
properties at 31 December 2010 increased compared 
with the end of 2009. The rise reflected the 
improvement in the processing of foreclosures as 
backlogs and action taken by local governments and 
certain states had lengthened proceedings in previous 
years. The average loss on sale of foreclosed 
properties decreased compared with 2009 though the 
average loss increased in the second half of 2010, 
as house prices in many markets showed signs of 
deterioration due to a rise in the number of foreclosed 
properties and the expiration of the homebuyer tax 
credit. We continued to assist customers in 
restructuring their debts to avoid foreclosure, including 
by modifying their loans when it was decided that they 
could be serviced on revised terms. For more details 
on the investigation into US foreclosure practices, see 
page 83. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Credit cards 
In our credit card and private label portfolios two 
months or more delinquency balances declined 
markedly, reflecting actions taken to improve credit 
quality, and our customer payment rates benefitted 
from an increased focus by consumers on reducing 
outstanding credit card debt. Two months or 
more delinquent balances in our credit card portfolio 
declined from US$1.8bn to US$1.0bn, while in 
percentage terms they declined from 7.4% at 
31 December 2009 to 4.7% at 31 December 2010. 
In the private label cards portfolio, two months or 
more delinquent balances declined from US$622m 
to US$404m while in percentage terms delinquency 
decreased from 4.1% at 31 December 2009 to 3.0% 
at 31 December 2010. 
Motor vehicle finance 
In 2010, we sold our vehicle finance loan portfolio 
and vehicle finance servicing operations. See 
page 106 for details. 
Other personal lending 
In the US unsecured lending portfolio, two months 
or more delinquency rates declined as balances 
continued to run off, economic conditions generally 
improved, and actions taken previously to tighten 
underwriting and reduce risk in this portfolio 
continued to have a favourable effect on credit 
quality.

Forbearance strategies and renegotiated 
loans
(Audited)
A range of forbearance strategies are employed in 
order to improve the management of customer 
relationships, maximise collection opportunities and, 
if possible, avoid foreclosure or repossession. Our 
policies and practices are based on criteria which, in 
the judgement of local management, indicate that 
repayment is likely to continue.  
Forbearance arrangements include extended 
payment terms, a reduction in interest or principal 
repayments, approved external debt management 
plans, the deferral of foreclosures, other 
modifications, and loan restructures. These 
management policies and practices typically provide 
the customer with terms and conditions that are more 
favourable than those provided initially. Such 
arrangements could include cases where an account 
is brought up-to-date without full repayment of all 
the arrears.
Our most common forbearance arrangements 
are loan restructures applied to real estate loans 
within consumer finance portfolios in the US. Our 
credit risk management policy sets out restrictions 
on the number and frequency of restructures, the 
minimum period an account must have been opened 
before any restructure can be considered, and the 
number of qualifying payments that must be 
received before an account may be considered 
restructured and up-to-date. The application of this 
policy varies according to the nature of the market, 
the product and the management of customer 
relationships through the occurrence of exceptional 
events.
Loans that are subject to restructuring may only 
be classified as restructured and up-to-date once a 
specified number and/or amount of qualifying 
payments have been received. These qualifying 
payments are set at a level appropriate to the nature 
of the loan and the customer’s ability to make the 
repayment going forward. Typically the receipt of 
two or more qualifying payments is required within 
a certain period, generally 60 days (in the case of 
HSBC Finance, in certain circumstances, for 
example where debt has been restructured in 
bankruptcy proceedings, fewer or no payments may 
be required). Loans that have been restructured and 
would otherwise have been past due or impaired are 
classified as renegotiated. 
Renegotiated loans are segregated from other 
parts of the loan portfolio for collective impairment 
assessment, to reflect the higher rates of losses often 
encountered in this segment of the portfolio. When 
empirical evidence indicates an increased propensity 
to default and higher losses on such accounts, the use 
of roll rate methodology ensures these factors are 
taken into account when calculating impairment 
allowances. The carrying amount of loans that 
have been classified as renegotiated retain this 
classification until maturity or derecognition. Interest 
is recorded on renegotiated loans on the basis of new 
contractual terms following renegotiation.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Renegotiated loans totalled US$35bn at 
31 December 2010 (2009: US$39bn). The largest 
concentration was in the US and amounted to 
US$28bn (2009: US$33bn) or 82% (2009: 86%) of 
our total renegotiated loans, substantially all of 
which was held by HSBC Finance.  
HSBC Finance loan modifications and re-ageing  
(Unaudited)
HSBC Finance continued to refine its customer 
account management policies and practices, including 
account modification and re-age programmes. 
Modification occurs when the terms of a loan are 
modified either temporarily or permanently. 
Modification may also lead to a re-ageing of the 
account. In 2010, HSBC Finance modified 
42,500 loans with an aggregate balance of US$6.0bn 
in Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services through 
the foreclosure avoidance and account modification 
programmes. 
At 31 December 2010, the total balance 
outstanding on HSBC Finance real estate secured 
accounts which have been re-aged or modified was 
US$26.7bn, compared with US$30.2bn at the end of 
2009. US$10.6bn relates to loans that had been 
re-aged without modification to the terms (2009: 
US$11.1bn), and US$13.9bn relates to loans whose 
terms have been modified and have been re-aged 
(2009: US$15.7bn). These amounts are included in 
the renegotiated loans balance disclosed above. In 
addition, US$2.2bn of loans have been modified but 
not re-aged (2009: US$3.4bn) and as such do not 
meet the definition of a renegotiated loan as the 
impairment or past-due status of the loans did not 
change on modification. At 31 December 2010, 
62% of modified or re-aged real estate loans 
remained up-to-date or past due less than 30 days 
(2009: 61%) and 26% were two or more months 
delinquent (2009: 26%). 
Collateral and other credit enhancements 
obtained
(Audited)
We obtained assets by taking possession of collateral 
held as security, or calling upon other credit 
enhancements, as follows:

We make repossessed properties available for 
sale in an orderly fashion, with the proceeds used to 
reduce or repay the outstanding indebtedness. If 
excess funds arise after the debt has been repaid, 
they are made available either to repay other secured 
lenders with lower priority or are returned to the 
customer. We do not generally occupy repossessed 
properties for our business use.
Credit quality of financial instruments  
(Audited)
The five credit quality classifications defined below 
each encompass a range of more granular internal 
credit rating grades assigned to wholesale and retail 
lending business, as well as the external ratings 
attributed by external agencies to debt securities. 
There is no direct correlation between the internal 
and external ratings at a granular level, except to 
the extent each falls within a single quality 
classification.

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Quality classification definitions 
• ‘Strong’: exposures demonstrate a strong capacity to meet 
financial commitments, with negligible or low probability of 
default and/or low levels of expected loss. Retail accounts 
operate within product parameters and only exceptionally 
show any period of delinquency. 
• ‘Good’: exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate 
a good capacity to meet financial commitments, with low 
default risk. Retail accounts typically show only short periods 
of delinquency, with any losses expected to be minimal 
following the adoption of recovery processes. 
• ‘Satisfactory’: exposures require closer monitoring and 
demonstrate an average to fair capacity to meet financial  
 commitments, with moderate default risk. Retail accounts 
 typically show only short periods of delinquency, with any 
 losses expected to be minor following the adoption of recovery 
 processes. 
• ‘Sub-standard’: exposures require varying degrees of special 
attention and default risk is of greater concern. Retail portfolio 
segments show longer delinquency periods of generally up to 
90 days past due and/or expected losses are higher due to a 
reduced ability to mitigate these through security realisation or 
other recovery processes.
• ‘Impaired’: exposures have been assessed, individually or 
collectively, as impaired. 
The Customer Risk Rating (‘CRR’) 10-grade scale 
above summarises a more granular underlying 
23-grade scale (2009: 22-grade scale) of obligor 
probability of default (‘PD’). The 23-grade scale was 
introduced in September 2010 following the 
harmonisation of PDs for three asset classes (banks, 
sovereigns and corporates) into one scale which 
required an additional PD band. All distinct HSBC 
customers are rated using the 10 or 23-grade scale, 
depending on the degree of sophistication of the 
Basel II approach adopted for the exposure. 
The Expected Loss (‘EL’) 10-grade scale for 
retail business summarises a more granular 
underlying EL scale for these customer segments; 
this combines obligor and facility/product risk 
factors in a composite measure.  
For debt securities and certain other financial 
instruments, external ratings have been aligned to the 
five quality classifications. The ratings of Standard 
and Poor’s are cited, with those of other agencies 
being treated equivalently. Debt securities with 
short-term issue ratings are reported against the 
long-term rating of the issuer of those securities. If 
major rating agencies have different ratings for the 
same debt securities, a prudent rating selection is 
made in line with regulatory requirements.  
Additional credit quality information in respect 
of our consolidated holdings of ABSs is provided on 
pages 134 and 135. 
For the purpose of the following disclosure, 
retail loans which are past due up to 89 days and are 
not otherwise classified as EL9 or EL10, are not 
disclosed within the EL grade to which they relate, 
but are separately classified as past due but not 
impaired. 
Financial instruments by credit quality 
2010 compared with 2009 
Financial instruments on which credit quality has 
been assessed increased by 4% to US$2,297bn due 
to strong growth in lending, mainly in Asia. 
At December 2010, US$1,550bn or 67% was 
classified as ‘strong’ in line with the end of 2009, 
reflecting the continued actions by management to 
mitigate the Group’s exposure to credit risk. The 
proportion of financial instruments classified as 
‘good’ and ‘satisfactory’ were broadly unchanged at 
16% and 12% respectively. The proportion of ‘sub-
standard’ financial instruments was 2%. 
Loans and advances on which credit quality has 
been assessed increased by 8% to US$1,167bn, 
driven by growth in commercial and personal 
lending in Asia as generally economic conditions 
improved, while loans and advances to banks also 
rose. The growth was in balances classified as 
‘strong’ and ‘good’, while balances classified as 
‘sub-standard’ and ‘past due but not impaired’ 
declined.
Derivative assets on which credit quality has 
been assessed grew by 4% to US$261bn from 
31 December 2009, with growth in balances being 
classified as ‘strong’. The increase was mainly in 
interest rate derivatives, reflecting a downward shift 
in yield curves. 
At 31 December 2010, financial investments 
on which credit quality has been assessed increased 
by 9% compared with the end of 2009, to 
US$393bn. Substantially all this growth was in 
assets classified as ‘strong’, reflecting increased 
investment of excess liquidity into low-risk 
government issued or government guaranteed bonds. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Trading assets on which credit quality has been 
assessed decreased by 11%, with the decline being 
in assets rated as ‘strong’. This reflected the de-
consolidation of the Constant Net Asset Value funds.

Past due but not impaired gross financial 
instruments
(Audited) 
Examples of exposures past due but not impaired 
include overdue loans fully secured by cash 
collateral; mortgages that are individually assessed 
for impairment, and that are in arrears more than 
90 days, but where the value of collateral is 
sufficient to repay both the principal debt and 
all potential interest for at least one year; and 
short-term trade facilities past due more than 
90 days for technical reasons such as delays in 
documentation, but where there is no concern over 
the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

2010 compared with 2009 
(Unaudited) 
Loan impairment charges of US$13.5bn declined by 
46% on both a reported and an underlying basis 
compared with 2009. Reported impaired loans were 
US$28.3bn at 31 December 2010, a decrease of 8% 
on both bases. The following commentary is on a 
constant currency basis. 
New allowances for loan impairment charges 
were US$15.4bn, a decline of 42% compared with 
2009, while releases and recoveries of US$1.9bn 
were 23% higher. 
Impaired loans were 2.4% of total gross loans 
and advances at 31 December 2010, compared with 
2.8% at 31 December 2009. 
In Europe, new loan impairment allowances 
were US$3.2bn, 34% lower than in 2009, reflecting 
a more stable credit environment across many 
countries in the region. Individually assessed loan 
impairment allowances declined, mainly in the UK, 
reflecting an improvement in credit conditions. 
Significantly, impairment charges in 2009 against 
specific customers in the property sector did not 
recur. Collectively assessed loan impairment 
allowances also declined due to a fall in delinquency 
levels as our customers continued to benefit from 
the low interest rate environment and the general 
improvement in economic conditions. In our 
personal lending portfolios, new collectively 
assessed loan impairment allowances declined, 
reflecting lower levels of unsecured lending and 
tightened underwriting criteria. Impaired loans of 
US$10.7bn were 3% higher than at the end of 2009.  
In Europe, releases and recoveries increased 
by 32% to US$681m. 
In Hong Kong, new loan impairment 
allowances declined by 58% to US$230m and 
impaired loans fell by 21% from the end of 2009 
to US$665m. New loan impairment allowances 
declined in both the personal and commercial 
lending portfolios, reflecting the economic recovery 
and improvement in credit conditions in the territory 
and fewer customer downgrades, partly offset by an 
increase in lending balances. 
Releases and recoveries in Hong Kong were 
US$93m, 5% lower than in 2009. 
New loan impairment allowances in Rest of 
Asia-Pacific declined by 40% to US$700m. The 
decline reflected lower new collective impairment 
allowances in India due to improved delinquency 
rates and lower balances as certain unsecured 
portfolios and higher risk elements of the credit card 
portfolio were managed down. In addition, new 
individually assessed impairment allowances also 
declined, mainly in India, due to the non-recurrence 
of large impairments, notably on certain technology-
related exposures. These were partly offset by a 
significant loan impairment charge against a single 
customer. Impaired loans in the region increased by 
3% to US$1.3bn at the end of 2010. 
Releases and recoveries in the region rose by 
19% due to releases in the construction and software 
industries in India and higher recoveries of amounts 
previously written off, notably in Australia. 
In the Middle East, new loan impairment 
allowances were US$735m, 47% lower than in 2009. 
The decrease was largely due to a decline in new 
collectively assessed loan impairment allowances net 
of allowance releases against the personal and 
commercial lending portfolios as delinquency rates 
improved, with a decline in personal balances in line  127
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
with the managing down of our exposure to higher 
risk unsecured personal lending. The lower 
allowances also reflected an overall improvement in 
economic conditions across the region. There were 
also declines in new individually assessed loan 
impairment charges as new charges for 2010 were 
restricted to a small number of large corporate 
exposures. Impaired loans rose by 47% from 
31 December 2009 to US$2.5bn due to credit 
deterioration in a small number of specific 
exposures, and debt restructuring in the UAE. 
Releases and recoveries in the Middle East more 
than doubled from 2009 to US$112m due to the 
release of judgemental impairment allowances 
reflecting improved economic conditions during 
2010.
In North America, new loan impairment 
allowances declined markedly, reducing by 44% to 
US$8.7bn. In our HSBC Finance portfolios, lower 
new loan impairment allowances in Card and Retail 
Services reflected a reduction in lending balances 
and an improvement in delinquency rates. In our 
Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services 
portfolios, new loan impairment allowances also fell 
as the portfolio continued to run-off. In addition, 
total loss severities on foreclosed loans improved 
compared with 2009 reflecting the increase in the 
number of properties for which we accepted a deed-
in-lieu of foreclosure, or a short sale, both of which 
result in lower losses compared with loans which are 
subjected to a formal foreclosure process. 
In our corporate and commercial portfolios in 
North America, new loan impairment allowances 
declined, reflecting lower balances due to customer 
deleveraging and improved credit quality which, 
along with the improved economy, resulted in credit 
upgrades on certain accounts and fewer customer 
downgrades. 
In North America, impaired loans decreased 
by 19% from the end of 2009 to US$10.8bn, while 
releases and recoveries rose by 80% compared with 
2009 to US$378m. 
In Latin America, new loan impairment 
allowances declined by 42% to US$1.9bn, while 
impaired loans declined by 23% to US$2.4bn as 
economic conditions in the region improved. Lower 
new loan impairment allowances in the personal 
lending portfolios were due to lower credit card 
balances in Mexico as we repositioned the portfolio 
to target higher quality customers and, to a lesser 
extent, in Brazil, due to the managed reduction in 
consumer finance balances. In addition, in the 
commercial lending portfolios in Brazil lower new 
impairment allowances reflected an improvement 
in economic conditions. 
Releases and recoveries in Latin America 
declined by 21% from 2009 to US$331m.

other credit risk provisions by customer group, see

HSBC Holdings  
(Audited)
Credit risk in HSBC Holdings primarily arises from 
transactions with Group subsidiaries and from 
guarantees issued in support of obligations assumed 
by certain Group operations in the normal conduct of 
their business. 
These risks are reviewed and managed within 
regulatory and internal limits for exposures by our 
Global Risk function, which provides high-level 
centralised oversight and management of our credit 
risks worldwide. 
HSBC Holdings’ maximum exposure to credit 
risk at 31 December 2010 is shown below. Its 
financial assets principally represent claims on 
Group subsidiaries in Europe and North America. No 
collateral or other credit enhancements were held by 
HSBC Holdings in respect of its transactions with 
subsidiaries.

All of the derivative transactions are with HSBC 
undertakings which are banking counterparties 
(2009: 100%).  
The credit quality of the loans and advances to 
HSBC undertakings is assessed as strong/good, with 
100% of the exposure being neither past due nor 
impaired (2009: 100%). 
The credit ratings of the financial investments 
held by HSBC Holdings are within the Standard and 
Poor’s (‘S&P’) ratings range of A to BBB+ (2009: 
A+ to A–).
Securitisation exposures and other 
structured products 
(Audited) 
The financial impact of the recent market disruption 
is lessening with net write-downs to the income 
statement of nil (2009: US$1.9bn net write-downs) 
and a reduction in the available-for-sale ABSs 
reserve deficit by US$5.8bn to US$6.4bn. 
Following the dislocation in markets which 
began in 2007, there was a modest recovery in the 
risk appetite of investors in 2009. However, the first 
half of 2010 saw renewed uncertainty and concerns 
over sovereign credit risk. As a result, the prices of 
many assets perceived to be of higher risk fell. In 
addition, the widespread downgrading of securitised 
assets continued in the first half of 2010 as rating 
agencies changed their methodologies, reducing the 
appetite for securitised assets among institutions 
subject to the Basel II framework.  
Increased stability returned in the second half of 
2010 following the interventions of the EU and the 
International Monetary Fund. A modest increase in 
house prices in some areas and the continued low 
interest rate environment contributed to a rise in the 
price of some securitised assets. As a result, the 
levels of write-downs and losses on our holdings of 
structured assets remained modest. Unrealised losses 
in our available-for-sale reserve continued to reduce 
due to increases in fair value and the principal 
amortisation of ABSs as repayments were received 
at par. Expectations of cash losses on available-for-
sale ABSs remained consistent with our previous 
estimates.

activities involving ABSs and leveraged finance: 
• purchasing US mortgage loans with the 
intention of structuring and placing 
securitisations into the market; 
• trading in ABSs, including MBSs, in secondary 
markets;  
• holding MBSs and other ABSs in balance sheet 
management activities, with the intention of 
earning net interest income over the life of the 
securities;
• holding MBSs and other ABSs as part of 
investment portfolios, including securities 
investment conduits (‘SIC’s) and money market 
funds, as described in Note 43 on the Financial 
Statements, with the intention of earning net 
interest income and management fees; 
• holding MBSs or other ABSs in the trading 
portfolio hedged through credit derivative 
protection, typically purchased from monolines, 
with the intention of earning the spread 
differential over the life of the instruments; and 
• originating leveraged finance loans for the 
purposes of syndicating or selling them down in 
order to generate a trading profit or holding 
them in order to earn interest margin over their 
lives.
These activities are not a significant part of 
GB&M’s on-going business, and GB&M is not 
reliant on them for any material aspect of its 
business operations or profitability. The purchase 
and securitisation of US mortgage loans and the 
secondary trading of US MBSs, which was 
conducted in our US MBS business, was 
discontinued in 2007. 
Nature of HSBC’s exposures 
MBSs are securities that represent interests in groups 
of mortgages and provide investors with the right to 
receive cash from future mortgage payments 
(interest and/or principal). An MBS which 
references mortgages with different risk profiles is 
classified according to the highest risk class.  
CDOs are securities backed by a pool of bonds, 
loans or other assets such as ABSs. CDOs may 
include exposure to sub-prime or Alt-A mortgage 
assets where these are part of the underlying assets 
or reference assets. As there is often uncertainty 
surrounding the precise nature of the underlying 
collateral supporting CDOs, all CDOs supported by 
residential mortgage-related assets are classified as 
sub-prime. Our holdings of ABSs and CDOs and 
direct lending positions, and the categories of 
mortgage collateral and lending activity, are 
described below.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Categories of  
ABSs and CDOs Definition Classification 
Sub-prime Loans to customers who have limited credit histories, 
modest incomes or high debt-to-income ratios or have 
experienced credit problems caused by occasional 
delinquencies, prior charge-offs, bankruptcy or other 
credit-related actions. 
For US mortgages, standard US credit scores are 
primarily used to determine whether a loan is sub-
prime; for non-US mortgages, management judgement 
is used. 
US Home Equity Lines 
of Credit (‘HELoC’s) 
A form of revolving credit facility provided to 
customers, which is supported by a first or second lien 
charge over residential property. 
Holdings of HELoCs are classified as sub-prime. 
US Alt-A Lower risk loans than sub-prime, but they share higher 
risk characteristics than lending under fully conforming 
standard criteria. 
US credit scores and the completeness of 
documentation held (such as proof of income), are 
considered when determining whether an Alt-A 
classification is appropriate. Non sub-prime mortgages 
in the US are classified as Alt-A if they are not eligible 
for sale to the major US Government sponsored 
mortgage agencies. 
US Government agency 
and sponsored 
enterprises mortgage-
related assets 
Securities that are guaranteed by US Government 
agencies such as the Government National Mortgage 
Association (‘Ginnie Mae’), or by US Government 
sponsored entities including the Federal National 
Mortgage Association (‘Fannie Mae’) and the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (‘Freddie Mac’). 
Holdings of US Government agency and US 
Government sponsored enterprises’ mortgage-related 
assets are classified as prime exposures. 
UK non-conforming 
mortgages 
UK mortgages that do not meet normal lending criteria. 
Examples include mortgages where the expected level 
of documentation is not provided (such as income with 
self-certification), or where poor credit history 
increases risk and results in pricing at a higher than 
normal lending rate. 
UK non-conforming mortgages are treated as sub-
prime exposures. 
Other mortgages Residential mortgages, including prime mortgages, that 
do not meet any of the classifications described above.
Prime residential mortgage-related assets are included 
in this category. 
Our exposure to non-residential mortgage-
related ABSs and direct lending includes securities 
with collateral relating to: 
• commercial property mortgages; 
• leveraged finance loans; 
• student loans; and 
• other assets, such as securities with other 
receivable-related collateral.
ABSs classified as available for sale 
Our principal holdings of available-for-sale ABSs 
(see table below) are in GB&M through special 
purpose entities (‘SPE’s) which were established 
from the outset with the benefit of external investor 
first loss protection support, together with positions 
held directly and by Solitaire Funding Limited 
(‘Solitaire’), where we have first loss risk. 
The following table summarises our exposure to 
ABS’s classified as available for sale:

Securities investment conduits 
(Audited) 
The total carrying amount of ABSs held through 
SPEs in the above table represents holdings in 
which significant first loss protection is provided 
through capital notes issued by SICs, excluding 
Solitaire.
At each reporting date, we assess whether there 
is any objective evidence of impairment in the 
value of the ABSs held by SPEs. Impairment 
charges incurred on these assets are offset by a 
credit to the impairment line for the amount of the 
loss allocated to capital note holders. 
The economic first loss protection remaining at 
31 December 2010 amounted to US$2.2bn (2009: 
US$2.2bn). On an IFRSs accounting basis, the 
carrying value of the liability for the capital notes 
at 31 December 2010 amounted to US$0.3bn 
(2009: US$0.7bn). The impairment charge 
recognised during 2010 amounted to US$531m 
(2009: US$666m). 
At 31 December 2010, the available-for-sale 
reserve in respect of securities held by the SICs 
was a deficit of US$2.7bn (2009: US$5.2bn). 
Of this, US$2.3bn related to ABSs (2009: 
US$4.9bn).
Impairments recognised during 2010 from 
assets held directly or within Solitaire, in 
recognition of the first loss protection of US$1.2bn 
we provide through credit enhancement and from 
drawings against the liquidity facility we provide, 
were US$444m (2009: US$1.4bn). The reduction 
in impairment charges compared with 2009 was 
due to the stabilising of loss severities and 
delinquency roll rates which have resulted in lower 
losses in the underlying collateral pools. The level 
of impairment recognised in comparison with the 
deficit in the available-for-sale reserve was a 
reflection of the credit quality and seniority of the 
assets held. 
Sub-prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-
backed securities 
(Audited) 
The assets which are most sensitive to possible 
future impairment are sub-prime and Alt-A 
residential MBSs. Available-for-sale holdings 
in these higher risk categories where HSBC does 
not benefit from significant first loss protection 
amounted to US$3.8bn at 31 December 2010 
(2009: US$4.9bn). For these securities the 
cumulative fair value losses not recognised in the 
income statement at 31 December 2010 was 
US$1.6bn (2009: losses of US$3.2bn). Other 
holdings in these higher risk categories classified as 
available-for-sale are held in vehicles where third 
party first loss protection exists, as described in the 
section on securities investment conduits, above. 
During 2010, the credit ratings on certain ABSs 
held directly by HSBC, Solitaire and the SICs were 
downgraded. A downgrade of a security’s credit 
rating is not, of itself, evidence of impairment. 
Consequently, the actions of the rating agencies 
alone have no direct impact on the measurement 
of impairment losses. The impairment losses 
recognised on these securities at 31 December 2010 
are set out above. 
Impairment methodologies 
(Audited) 
The accounting policy for impairment and 
indicators of impairment is set out in Note 2j on the 
Financial Statements. 
For available-for-sale ABSs, to identify 
objective evidence of impairment, an industry 
standard valuation model is normally applied which 
uses data with reference to the underlying asset  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Risk > Credit risk > Securitisation exposures and other structured products 
132
pools and models their projected future cash flows. 
The estimated future cash flows of the securities 
are assessed at the specific financial asset level to 
determine whether any of them are unlikely to be 
recovered as a result of loss events occurring on or 
before the reporting date.
The principal assumptions and inputs to the 
models are typically the delinquency status of the 
underlying loans, the probability of delinquent 
loans progressing to default, the prepayment 
profiles of the underlying assets and the loss 
severity in the event of default. However, the 
models utilise other variables relevant to specific 
classes of collateral to forecast future defaults 
and recovery rates. Management uses externally 
available data and applies judgement when 
determining the appropriate assumptions in respect 
of these factors. HSBC uses a modelling approach 
which incorporates historically observed 
progression rates to default, to determine if the 
decline in aggregate projected cash flows from 
the underlying collateral will lead to a shortfall in 
contractual cash flows. In such cases the security 
is considered to be impaired. 
In respect of CDOs, expected future cash 
flows for the underlying collateral are assessed to 
determine whether there is likely to be a shortfall 
in the contractual cash flows of the CDO.  
When a security benefits from a contract 
provided by a monoline insurer that insures 
payments of principal and interest, the expected 
recovery on the contract is assessed in determining 
the total expected credit support available to the 
ABS.
Impairment and cash loss projections 
(Unaudited) 
At 31 December 2009, management undertook 
an analysis to estimate further potential 
impairments and expected cash losses on the 
available-for-sale ABS portfolio. This exercise 
comprised a shift of projections of future loss 
severities, default rates and prepayment rates. 
The results of the analysis indicated that further 
impairment charges of some US$1.1bn and 
expected cash losses of some US$450m could 
arise over the next two to three years. 
At 31 December 2010, management 
re-performed the stress test. After taking into 
account the cash losses experienced during 2010, 
the remaining cash loss projections of US$250m 
were consistent with those as at 31 December 2009. 
However, the impairment charge projections 
showed an additional charge of US$300m arising 
over the next two years in relation to the SICs, after 
taking into account the impairments recognised in 
2010, resulting in future impairment charges of 
US$950m, including the US$300m relating to the 
SICs. This additional charge reflects where the 
accounting impairments will exceed the carrying 
amount of the capital notes held by third parties.  
For the purposes of identifying impairment at 
the reporting date, the future projected cash flows 
reflect the effect of loss events that have occurred 
at or prior to the reporting date. For the purposes of 
performing stress tests to estimate potential future 
impairment charges, the projected future cash flows 
reflect additional assumptions about future loss 
events after the balance sheet date. 
This analysis makes assumptions in respect 
of the future behaviour of loss severities, default 
rates and prepayment rates. Movements in the 
parameters are not independent of each other. For 
example, increased default rates and increased loss 
severities, which would imply greater impairments, 
generally arise under economic conditions that give 
rise to reduced levels of prepayment, reducing the 
potential for impairment charges. Conversely, 
economic conditions which increase the rates of 
prepayment are generally associated with reduced 
default rates and decreased loss severities. 
At 31 December 2010, the incurred and 
projected impairment charges, measured in 
accordance with accounting requirements, 
significantly exceeded the expected cash losses on 
the securities. Over the lives of the available-for-
sale ABSs the cumulative impairment charges will 
converge towards the level of cash losses. In 
respect of the SICs, in particular, the capital notes 
held by third parties are expected to absorb the cash 
losses arising in the vehicles.   133

Analysis of exposures and significant

(Audited) 
Sub-prime residential mortgage-related assets 
Sub-prime residential mortage-related assets 
included US$3.1bn (2009: US$3.7bn) related to 
US-originated assets and US$1.1bn (2009: 
US$1.1bn) relating to UK non-conforming 
residential mortgage-related assets. Of the non-high 
grade assets held of US$1.7bn (2009: US$1.7bn), 
US$1.5bn (2009: US$1.6bn) related to US-
originated assets, reflecting the higher quality of 
the UK-originated assets. 
A modest increase in observable values of our 
sub-prime assets took place in 2010. Further net 
impairment of US$48m on assets classified as 
available for sale was recognised in 2010 (2009: 
US$559m) as losses were incurred under current 
accounting impairment rules. Our expectation of 
cash losses on the underlying assets did not increase 
from that at 31 December 2009. Of the above 
impairment, US$54m (2009: US$312m) occurred in 
the SICs and was borne by the capital note holders. 
US Alt-A residential mortgage-related assets 
During 2010, spreads on Alt-A mortgage-related 
assets tightened modestly from the levels seen in 
2009. Further impairments of US$884m (2009: 
US$1,372m) were recorded in respect of Alt-A 
mortgage-related assets as losses were incurred 
under the accounting rules described in the 
paragraph above, without reference to the amount 
of expected loss. Our expectation of losses in the 
underlying assets did not increase from that at 
31 December 2009. Of the impairment above, 
US$450m (2009: US$346m) occurred in the 
SICs and was borne by the capital note holders. 
The downgrade of our US Alt-A residential 
MBSs is reflected in the disclosure of fair value 
movements in the above tables as if the downgrade 
had taken effect on 1 January 2010. 
The following table shows the vintages of the 
collateral assets supporting our holdings of US 
sub-prime and Alt-A MBSs. Market prices for these 
instruments generally incorporate higher discounts 
for later vintages. The majority of our holdings of 
US sub-prime MBSs originated pre-2007; holdings 
of US Alt-A MBSs are more evenly distributed 
between pre-2007 vintages and those from 2007 
onwards.

US Government agency and sponsored 
enterprises mortgage-related assets 
During 2010, we increased our holdings of US 
Government agency and sponsored enterprises 
mortgage-related assets by US$8.3bn. 
Other residential mortgage-related assets 
The majority of our other residential 
mortgage-related assets were originated in the UK 
(2010: US$3.9bn; 2009: US$4.7bn). No impairments 
were recognised in respect of these UK originated 
assets in 2010 (2009: nil), reflecting credit support 
within the asset portfolio. 
Commercial property mortgage-related assets 
Of our total of US$10.5bn (2009: US$10.0bn) 
of commercial property mortgage-related assets, 
US$5.2bn related to US originated assets (2009: 
US$4.3bn). Spreads tightened on both US and non-
US commercial property mortgage-related assets 
during 2010. Impairments of US$5m (2009: 
US$88m) were recognised in 2010. 
Leveraged finance-related assets 
The majority of these assets related to US-originated 
exposures; 90% (2009: 94%) were high grade with 
no impairments recorded in the year (2009: nil).  137

Student loan-related assets 
Our holdings in student loan-related assets were 
US$5.5bn (2009: US$5.1bn). No impairments were 
recorded on student loan-related assets in 2010 
(2009: nil). 
Transactions with monoline insurers 
(Audited) 
HSBC’s exposure to derivative transactions 
entered into directly with monolines 
Our principal exposure to monolines is through a 
number of OTC derivative transactions, mainly 
credit default swaps (‘CDS’s). We entered into these 
CDSs primarily to purchase credit protection against 
securities held at the time within the trading 
portfolio.
During 2010, the notional value of derivative 
contracts with monolines and our overall credit 
exposure to monolines decreased as a number of 
transactions were commuted, others matured, and 
credit spreads narrowed. The table below sets out the 
fair value, essentially the replacement cost, of the 
remaining derivative transactions at 31 December 
2010, and hence the amount at risk if the CDS 
protection purchased were to be wholly ineffective 
because, for example, the monoline insurer was 
unable to meet its obligations. In order to further 
analyse that risk, the value of protection purchased 
is shown subdivided between those monolines 
that were rated by S&P at ‘BBB- or above’ at 
31 December 2010, and those that were ‘below 
BBB–’ (BBB– is the S&P cut-off for an investment 
grade classification). The ‘Credit risk adjustment’ 
column indicates the valuation adjustment taken 
against the net exposures, and reflects our best 
estimate of the likely loss of value on purchased 
protection arising from the deterioration in 
creditworthiness of the monolines. These valuation 
adjustments, which reflect a measure of the 
irrecoverability of the protection purchased, have 
been charged to the income statement. During 2010, 
the credit risk adjustment on derivative contracts 
with monolines decreased as a number of 
transactions commuted and others matured.

For footnotes, see page 174.  
The above table can be analysed as follows. 
HSBC has derivative transactions referenced to 
underlying securities with a notional value of 
US$7.5bn (2009: US$10.0bn), whose value at 
31 December 2010 indicated a potential claim 
against the protection purchased from the 
monolines of some US$1.5bn (2009: US$2.3bn). 
On the basis of a credit assessment of the 
monolines, a provision of US$519m has been taken 
(2009: US$1.0bn), leaving US$1.0bn exposed 
(2009: US$1.3bn), of which US$788m is 
recoverable from monolines rated investment grade 
at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$897m). The 
provisions taken imply in aggregate that 90 cents in 
the dollar will be recoverable from investment 
grade monolines and 33 cents in the dollar from 
non-investment grade monolines (2009: 90 cents 
and 31 cents, respectively). 
For the CDSs, market prices are generally not 
readily available. Therefore the CDSs are valued on 
the basis of market prices of the referenced 
securities.
The credit risk adjustment against monolines is 
determined by one of a number of methodologies, 
dependent upon the internal credit rating of the 
monoline. Our assignment of internal credit  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Risk > Credit risk > Securitisation exposures and other structured products 
138
ratings is based upon detailed credit analysis, and 
may differ from external ratings.  
Credit risk adjustments for monolines 
• For highly-rated monolines, the standard credit risk 
adjustment methodology (as described on page 312) applies, 
with the exception that the future exposure profile is 
deemed to be constant (equal to the current market value) 
over the weighted average life of the referenced security, 
and the credit risk adjustment cannot fall below 10% of the 
mark-to-market exposure.  
• In respect of monolines, where default has either occurred 
or there is a strong possibility of default in the near term, the 
adjustment is determined based on the estimated 
probabilities of various potential scenarios, and the 
estimated recovery in each case.  
• For other monoline exposures, the credit risk adjustment 
follows the methodology for highly-rated monolines, 
adjusted to include the probability of a claim arising in 
respect of the referenced security, and applies implied 
probabilities of default where the likelihood of a claim is 
believed to be high.  
As described above, HSBC’s monoline credit 
risk adjustment calculation utilises a range of 
approaches dependent upon the credit quality of 
the monoline. The net impact of utilising the 
methodology adopted for ‘highly-rated’ monolines 
across all monolines would be a reduction in credit 
risk adjustment of US$94m. The net impact of 
utilising a methodology based on credit default swap 
spreads would be an increase in credit risk 
adjustment of US$8m. 
At 31 December 2010, US$1.4bn (2009: 
US$2.6bn) notional value of securities referenced by 
monoline CDS transactions with a market value of 
US$1.0bn (2009: US$1.9bn) were held in the loans 
and receivables category, having been included in 
the reclassification of financial assets described in 
Note 18 on the Financial Statements. At the date of 
reclassification, the market value of the remaining 
assets was US$1.2bn. The reclassification resulted in 
an accounting asymmetry between the CDSs, which 
continue to be held at fair value through profit and 
loss, and the reclassified securities, which are 
accounted for on an amortised cost basis. If the 
reclassifications had not occurred, the impact on the 
income statement for 2010 would have been 
a decrease in profit of US$3m (2009: increase in 
profit of US$5m). This amount represents the 
difference between the increase in market value of 
the securities during 2010 and the accretion 
recognised under the amortised cost method in 2010. 
HSBC’s exposure to direct lending and 
irrevocable commitments to lend to monolines  
HSBC had no liquidity facilities to monolines at 
31 December 2010 (2009: minimal).  
HSBC’s exposure to debt securities which benefit 
from guarantees provided by monolines 
Within both the trading and available-for-sale 
portfolios, we hold bonds that are ‘wrapped’ with a 
credit enhancement from a monoline. As the 
bonds are traded explicitly with the benefit of this 
enhancement, any deterioration in the credit profile 
of the monoline is reflected in market prices and, 
therefore, in the carrying amount of these securities 
at 31 December 2010. For wrapped bonds held in 
our trading portfolio, the mark-to-market movement 
has been reflected through the income statement. For 
wrapped bonds held in the available-for-sale portfolio, 
the mark-to-market movement is reflected in equity 
unless there is objective evidence of impairment, in 
which case the impairment loss is reflected in the 
income statement. No wrapped bonds were included 
in the reclassification of financial assets described in 
Note 18 on the Financial Statements.  
HSBC’s exposure to Credit Derivative 
Product Companies  
(Audited) 
Credit Derivative Product Companies (‘CDPC’s) 
are independent companies that specialise in selling 
credit default protection on corporate exposures. 
OTC derivative exposure to CDPCs became a focus 
during the second half of 2008 as the spreads 
widened, but these exposures reduced during 2009 
as the spreads tightened again. At 31 December 
2010, HSBC had purchased from CDPCs credit 
protection with a notional value of US$4.9bn (2009: 
US$5.0bn) which had a fair value of US$0.2bn 
(2009: US$0.3bn), against which a credit risk 
adjustment (a provision) of US$0.1bn (2009: 
US$0.1bn) was held. At 31 December 2010, none of 
the exposure was to CDPCs with investment grade 
ratings (2009: 83%). The deterioration reflects rating 
downgrades and withdrawals during 2010. 
Leveraged finance transactions 
(Audited) 
Leveraged finance transactions include sub-
investment grade acquisition or event-driven 
financing. The following table shows our exposure 
to leveraged finance transactions arising from

We held leveraged finance commitments of 
US$5.1bn at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$6.5bn), 
of which US$4.6bn (2009: US$5.9bn) was funded.
As described in Note 18 on the Financial 
Statements, certain leveraged finance loans were 
reclassified from held for trading to loans and 
receivables. As a result, these loans are held at 
amortised cost subject to impairment and are not 
marked to market, and net gains of US$0.1bn (2009: 
net gains of US$1.2bn) were not taken to the income 
statement in 2010. 
At 31 December 2010, our principal exposures 
were to companies in two sectors: US$2.8bn to 
data processing (2009: US$3.8bn) and US$1.8bn 
to communications and infrastructure (2009: 
US$1.9bn). During 2010, 99% of the total fair value 
movement not recognised was against exposures in 
these two sectors (2009: 99%). 
Representations and warranties related to 
mortgage sales and securitisation activities 
(Audited) 
We have been involved in various activities related 
to the sale and securitisation of residential 
mortgages, which are not recognised on our balance 
sheet. These activities include: 
• the purchase of US$24bn of third party 
originated mortgages by HSBC Bank USA and 
securitisation of these by HSBC Securities 
(USA) Inc. (‘HSI’) between 2005 and 2007; 
• HSI acting as underwriter for third party 
issuance of private label MBSs with an original 
issuance value of US$37bn, most of which were 
sub-prime, as well as underwriting US$6bn of 
MBSs issued by HSBC Finance; and 
• the origination and sale by HSBC Bank USA of 
mortgage loans, primarily to government 
sponsored entities. 
In sales and securitisations of mortgage loans, 
various representations and warranties regarding the 
loans may be made to purchasers of the mortgage 
loans and MBSs. In respect of the purchase and 
securitisation of third party originated mortgages and 
the underwriting of third party MBSs, the obligation 
to repurchase loans in the event of a breach of 
loan level representations and warranties resides 
predominantly with the organisation that originated 
the loan. While certain of these originators are or 
may become financially impaired, and therefore, 
unable to fulfil their repurchase obligations, we do 
not believe we have significant exposure for 
repurchases on these loans.  
At 31 December 2010, a liability of US$262m 
was recognised in respect of various representations 
and warranties, relating to the origination and sale by 
HSBC Bank USA of mortgage loans, primarily to 
government sponsored entities (2009: US$66m). 
These relate to, among other things, the ownership of 
the loans, the validity of the liens, the loan selection 
and origination process, and the compliance to the 
origination criteria established by the agencies. In 
the event of a breach of our representations and 
warranties, HSBC Bank USA may be obliged to 
repurchase the loans with identified defects or to 
indemnify the buyers. The liability is estimated 
based on the level of outstanding repurchase 
demands, the level of outstanding requests for loan 
files and estimated future demands in respect of 
mortgages sold to date which are either two or 
more payments delinquent or expected to become 
delinquent at an estimated conversion rate. 
Repurchase demands of US$115m were outstanding 
at 2010 (2009: US$123m).   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Liquidity and funding  
(Audited)
HSBC expects its operating entities to 
manage liquidity and funding risk on a 
standalone basis employing a centrally 
imposed framework and limit structure 
which is adapted to variations in business 
mix and underlying markets. Our operating 
entities are required to maintain strong 
liquidity positions and to manage the 
liquidity profiles of their assets, liabilities 
and commitments with the objective of 
ensuring that their cash flows are balanced 
under various severe stress scenarios and 
that all their anticipated obligations can be 
met when due. The objective of our liquidity 
framework is to be very conservative and 
adaptable to changing business models, 
markets and regulation.  
The objective of our liquidity and funding 
management framework is to ensure that all 
foreseeable funding commitments can be met when 
due, and that access to the wholesale markets is 
co-ordinated and cost-effective. To this end, we 
maintain a diversified funding base comprising 
core retail and corporate customer deposits and 
institutional balances. We augment this with 
wholesale funding and portfolios of highly liquid 
assets diversified by currency and maturity which 
are held to enable us to respond quickly and 
smoothly to unforeseen liquidity requirements. 
We adapt our liquidity and funding risk 
management framework in response to changes 
in the mix of business that we undertake, and to 
changes in the nature of the markets in which 
we operate. We also seek to continuously evolve 
and strengthen our liquidity and funding risk 
management framework. As part of this process, 
we have refined the way in which we characterise 
core deposits. The characterisation takes into 
account the activities and operating environment in 
the entity originating the deposit, the nature of the 
customer and the size and pricing of the deposit. 
This exercise has resulted in a revised internal 
calculation of advances to core funding ratio 
(discussed more fully below), and comparatives have 
been restated accordingly. While total core deposits 
at the Group consolidated level have not changed 
materially, there have been some revisions to 
individual entities. 
We employ a number of measures to monitor 
liquidity risk. The emphasis on the ‘ratio of net 
liquid assets to customer deposits’, as reported in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009, has been reduced 
and a ‘stressed one month coverage ratio’, an 
extension of our projected cash flow scenario 
analysis, is now used as a simple and more useful 
metric to express liquidity risk. The bank also 
manages its intra-day liquidity positions so that it 
is able to meet payment and settlement obligations 
on a timely basis. Payment flows in real time gross 
settlement systems, expected peak payment flows 
and large time-critical payments are monitored 
during the day and the intra-day collateral position is 
managed so that there is liquidity available to meet 
payments. 
Policies and procedures 
(Audited) 
The management of liquidity and funding is 
primarily undertaken locally in our operating entities 
in compliance with practices and limits set by the 
Risk Management Meeting. These limits vary 
according to the depth and liquidity of the market in 
which the entities operate. It is our policy that each 
banking entity should be self-sufficient when 
funding its own operations. Exceptions are permitted 
for certain short-term treasury requirements and 
start-up operations or for branches which do not 
have access to local deposit markets. These entities 
are funded from our largest banking operations and 
within clearly defined internal and regulatory 
guidelines and limits. The limits place formal 
restrictions on the transfer of resources between our 
entities and reflect the broad range of currencies, 
markets and time zones within which we operate. 
Elements of our liquidity and funding management process 
• projecting cash flows by major currency under various 
stress scenarios and considering the level of liquid assets 
necessary in relation thereto; 
• monitoring balance sheet liquidity and advances to core 
funding ratios against internal and regulatory requirements; 
• maintaining a diverse range of funding sources with back-up 
facilities;
• managing the concentration and profile of debt maturities; 
• managing contingent liquidity commitment exposures 
within pre-determined caps; 
• maintaining debt financing plans; 
• monitoring depositor concentration in order to avoid undue 
reliance on large individual depositors and ensure a 
satisfactory overall funding mix; and 
• maintaining liquidity and funding contingency plans. These 
plans identify early indicators of stress conditions and 
describe actions to be taken in the event of difficulties 
arising from systemic or other crises, while minimising 
adverse long-term implications for the business.  141

Primary sources of funding 
(Audited)
Current accounts and savings deposits payable on 
demand or at short notice form a significant part of 
our funding, and we place considerable importance 
on maintaining their stability. For deposits, stability 
depends upon preserving depositor confidence in our 
capital strength and liquidity, and on competitive and 
transparent pricing.
We also access professional markets in order to 
provide funding for non-banking subsidiaries that do 
not accept deposits, to align asset and liability 
maturities and currencies and to maintain a presence 
in local money markets. Market disruption continued 
to have adverse effects on the liquidity and funding 
risk profile of the banking system in 2010. Despite 
these challenges, we have continued to have good 
access to debt capital markets. Group entities issued 
US$26bn of term debt securities in the public capital 
markets in 2010. 
In aggregate, our banking entities are liquidity 
providers to the interbank market, placing 
significantly more funds with other banks than they 
themselves borrow. Our main operating subsidiary 
that does not accept deposits is HSBC Finance, 
which is funded principally by taking term funding 
in the professional markets and securitising assets. 
At 31 December 2010, US$65bn (2009: US$82bn) 
of HSBC Finance’s liabilities were drawn from 
professional markets, utilising a range of products, 
maturities and currencies.

according to their contractual maturities. The 
undiscounted cash flows potentially payable under 
financial guarantees and similar contracts are 
classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be 
called.
Cash flows payable in respect of customer 
accounts are primarily contractually repayable on 
demand or at short notice. However, in practice, short-
term deposit balances remain stable as inflows and 
outflows broadly match and a significant portion of 
loan commitments expire without being drawn upon. 
The management of liquidity risk 
(Audited) 
We use a number of principal measures to manage 
liquidity risk, as described below. 
Advances to core funding ratio 
We emphasise the importance of core customer 
deposits as a source of funds to finance lending to 
customers, and discourage reliance on short-term 
professional funding. This is achieved by placing 
limits on banking entities which restrict their ability 
to increase loans and advances to customers without 
corresponding growth in their core customer deposits 
or long-term debt funding. This measure is referred 
to as the ‘advances to core funding’ ratio. Previously, 
we utilised the ‘advances to deposits’ ratio. 
Advances to core funding ratio limits are set 
by the Risk Management Meeting and monitored by 
Group Finance. The ratio expresses current loans and 
advances to customers as a percentage of the total of 
core customer deposits and term funding with a 
remaining term to maturity in excess of one year. 
Loans and advances to customers which are part of 
reverse repurchase arrangements, and where we 
receive securities which are deemed to be liquid, are 
excluded from the advances to core funding ratio.  
The three principal banking entities listed in the 
table below represented 62% of our total core 
deposits at 31 December 2010 (31 December 2009: 
63%). The table shows that loans and advances to 
customers in our principal banking entities are 
overwhelmingly financed by reliable and stable 
sources of funding. We would meet any unexpected 
net cash outflows by selling securities and accessing 
additional funding sources such as interbank or 
collateralised lending markets.

Stressed one month coverage ratio
The stressed one month coverage ratios tabulated 
above are derived from these scenario analyses, and 
express the stressed cash inflows as a percentage of 
stressed cash outflows over a one month time 
horizon. Our entities are required to target a ratio 
of 100% or greater. 
Projected cash flow scenario analysis 
We use a number of standard projected cash flow  143
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
scenarios designed to model combinations of both 
Group-specific and market-wide liquidity crises, in 
which the rate and timing of deposit withdrawals and 
drawdowns on committed lending facilities are 
varied, and the ability to access interbank funding 
and term debt markets and to generate funds from 
asset portfolios is restricted. The scenarios are 
modelled by all our banking entities and by HSBC 
Finance. The appropriateness of the assumptions 
under each scenario is regularly reviewed. In 
addition to our standard projected cash flow 
scenarios, individual entities are required to design 
their own scenarios to reflect specific local market 
conditions, products and funding bases. 
Limits for cumulative net cash flows under 
stress scenarios are set for each banking entity and 
for HSBC Finance. Both ratio and cash flow limits 
reflect the local market place, the diversity of 
funding sources available and the concentration risk 
from large depositors. Compliance with entity level 
limits is monitored centrally by Group Finance and 
reported regularly to the Risk Management Meeting. 
HSBC Finance 
As HSBC Finance is unable to accept standard 
retail customer deposits, it takes funding from the 
professional markets. HSBC Finance uses a range 
of measures to monitor funding risk, including 
projected cash flow scenario analysis and caps 
placed on the amount of unsecured term funding that 
can mature in any rolling three-month and rolling 
12-month periods. HSBC Finance also maintains 
access to committed sources of secured funding and 
has in place committed backstop lines for short-term 
refinancing commercial paper (‘CP’) programmes. A 
CP programme is a short-term, unsecured funding 
tool used to manage day to day cash flow needs. In 
agreement with the rating agencies, issuance under 
this programme will not exceed 100% of committed 
bank backstop lines. 
The need for HSBC Finance to refinance 
maturing term funding is mitigated by the continued 
run-down of its balance sheet.

Contingent liquidity risk 
(Audited) 
In the normal course of business, we provide 
customers with committed facilities, including 
committed backstop lines to conduit vehicles 
sponsored by HSBC and standby facilities to 
corporate customers. These facilities increase our 
funding requirements when customers choose to 
raise drawdown levels over and above their normal 
utilisation rates. The liquidity risk consequences of 
increased levels of drawdown are analysed in the 
form of projected cash flows under different stress 
scenarios. The Risk Management Meeting also sets 
limits for non-cancellable contingent funding 
commitments by Group entity after due 
consideration of each entity’s ability to fund them. 
The limits are split according to the borrower, the 
liquidity of the underlying assets and the size of the 
committed line.

HSBC Holdings
(Audited)
HSBC Holdings’ primary sources of cash are 
dividends received from subsidiaries, interest on and 
repayment of intra-group loans and interest earned 
on its own liquid funds. HSBC Holdings also raises 
ancillary funds in the debt capital markets through 
subordinated and senior debt issuance. Cash is 
primarily used for the provision of capital to 
subsidiaries, interest payments to debt holders 
and dividend payments to shareholders.  
HSBC Holdings is also subject to contingent 
liquidity risk by virtue of loan and other credit-
related commitments and guarantees and similar 
contracts issued. Such commitments and guarantees 
are only issued after due consideration of HSBC  
Holdings’ ability to finance the commitments and 
guarantees and the likelihood of the need arising.  
HSBC Holdings actively manages the cash 
flows from its subsidiaries to optimise the amount of 
cash held at the holding company level. The ability 
of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies 
to HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things, 
their respective regulatory capital requirements, 
statutory reserves, and financial and operating 
performance. The wide range of our activities means 
that HSBC Holdings is not dependent on a single 
source of profits to fund its dividend payments to 
shareholders. During 2010, HSBC Holdings 
continued to have full access to debt capital markets 
at market rates and issued US$5.0bn of capital 
instruments (2009: US$5.3bn).

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Market risk  
(Audited) 
Market risk is the risk that movements in market 
factors, including foreign exchange rates and 
commodity prices, interest rates, credit spreads and 
equity prices, will reduce our income or the value of 
our portfolios. 
We separate exposures to market risk into 
trading and non-trading portfolios. Trading portfolios 
include positions arising from market-making, 
position-taking and others designated as marked 
to market. 
Non-trading portfolios include positions that 
primarily arise from the interest rate management 
of our retail and commercial banking assets and 
liabilities, financial investments designated as 
available for sale and held to maturity, and exposures 
arising from our insurance operations.  
Market risk arising in our insurance businesses 
is discussed in ‘Risk management of insurance 
operations’ on pages 155 to 171. 
Monitoring and limiting market risk 
exposure 
(Audited) 
Our objective is to manage and control market risk 
exposures in order to optimise return on risk while 
maintaining a market profile consistent with our 
status as one of the world’s largest banking and 
financial services organisations. 
The management of market risk is principally 
undertaken in Global Markets using risk limits 
approved by the GMB. Limits are set for portfolios, 
products and risk types, with market liquidity being 
a primary factor in determining the level of limits 
set. Group Risk, an independent unit within GMO, is 
responsible for our market risk management policies 
and measurement techniques. Each major operating 
entity has an independent market risk management 
and control function which is responsible for 
measuring market risk exposures in accordance with 
the policies defined by Group Risk, and monitoring 
and reporting these exposures against the prescribed 
limits on a daily basis. 
Each operating entity is required to assess the 
market risks arising on each product in its business 
and to transfer them to either its local Global 
Markets unit for management, or to separate books 
managed under the supervision of the local Asset and 
Liability Management Committee (‘ALCO’). Our 
aim is to ensure that all market risks are consolidated 
within operations that have the necessary skills, 
tools, management and governance to manage them 
professionally. In certain cases where the market 
risks cannot be fully transferred, we use simulation 
modelling to identify the impact of varying scenarios 
on valuations and net interest income. 
We employ a range of tools to monitor and limit 
market risk exposures. These include sensitivity 
analysis, value at risk (‘V AR’) and stress testing.  
Sensitivity analysis 
(Unaudited) 
We use sensitivity measures to monitor the market 
risk positions within each risk type, for example, the 
present value of a basis point movement in interest 
rates for interest rate risk. Sensitivity limits are set 
for portfolios, products and risk types, with the depth 
of the market being one of the principal factors in 
determining the level of limits set. 
Value at risk  
(Audited)
V AR is a technique that estimates the potential losses 
on risk positions as a result of movements in market 
rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to 
a given level of confidence.  
The V AR models we use are based 
predominantly on historical simulation. These 
models derive plausible future scenarios from past 
series of recorded market rates and prices, taking 
into account inter-relationships between different 
markets and rates such as interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates. The models also incorporate the 
effect of option features on the underlying 
exposures.
Our historical simulation models assess 
potential market movements with reference to data 
from the past two years and calculate V AR to a 99% 
confidence level and for a one-day holding period. 
Although a valuable guide to risk, VAR should always be 
viewed in the context of its limitations:  
• the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future 
events may not encompass all potential events, particularly 
those which are extreme in nature; 
• the use of a one-day holding period assumes that all 
positions can be liquidated or the risk offset in one day. This 
may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of 
severe illiquidity, when a one-day holding period may be 
insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully; 
• the use of a 99% confidence level, by definition, does not 
take into account losses that might occur beyond this level 
of confidence;  
• VAR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at 
the close of business and therefore does not necessarily 
reflect intra-day exposures; and 
• VAR is unlikely to reflect loss potential on exposures that 
only arise under significant market moves.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Risk > Market risk > Sensitivity analysis / Trading and non-trading portfolios 
146
We routinely validate the accuracy of our V AR 
models by back-testing the actual daily profit and 
loss results, adjusted to remove non-modelled 
items such as fees and commissions, against the 
corresponding V AR numbers. Statistically, we would 
expect to see losses in excess of V AR only 1% of the 
time over a one-year period. The actual number of 
excesses over this period can therefore be used to 
gauge how well the models are performing.  
Stress testing 
(Audited) 
In recognition of V AR’s limitations, we augment it 
with stress testing to evaluate the potential impact on 
portfolio values of more extreme, although plausible, 
events or movements in a set of financial variables. 
The process is governed by the Stress Testing 
Review Group forum which, in conjunction with 
regional risk managers, determines the scenarios to 
be applied at portfolio and consolidated levels, as 
follows:
• sensitivity scenarios consider the impact of any 
single risk factor or set of factors that are 
unlikely to be captured within the V AR models, 
such as the break of a currency peg;  
• technical scenarios consider the largest move in 
each risk factor, without consideration of any 
underlying market correlation; 
• hypothetical scenarios consider potential macro 
economic events, for example, a global flu 
pandemic; and 
• historical scenarios incorporate historical 
observations of market movements during 
previous periods of stress which would not be 
captured within V AR. 
Stress testing results provide senior management 
with an assessment of the financial effect such 
events would have on our profit.

11 days in the same period ended 31 December 
2009. The most frequent result was daily revenue of 
between US$30m and US$40m with 41 occurrences, 
compared with between US$30m and US$40m and 
between US$40m and US$50m with 29 occurrences 
each in 2009.
On 9 May 2010, the International Monetary 
Fund and the 16 member states of the euro area 
announced stabilisation measures for the eurozone. 
The period prior to this announcement was volatile, 
leading to a number of negative revenue days. The 
maximum daily revenue of US$450m arose on 
10 May 2010 which in large part reflected a recovery 
of these negative revenues days.

Risk measurement and control 
Our control of market risk in the trading portfolios is 
based on a policy of restricting individual operations 
to trading within a list of permissible instruments 
authorised for each site by Group Risk, of enforcing 
rigorous new product approval procedures, and of 
restricting trading in the more complex derivative 
products only to offices with appropriate levels of 
product expertise and robust control systems.  
The V AR for trading intent activity within 
Global Markets at 31 December 2010 was 
US$80.8m (2009: US$95.1m). This is analysed

The V AR for overall trading intent activity as 
at 31 December 2010 was lower than at the end of 
2009, because of reduced volatility in various asset 
classes. However, the wider band in V AR observed 
in 2010 was driven by an increase in client-led 
transactions and reduced portfolio diversification 
benefit, which resulted in occasionally higher V AR 
utilisation, as reflected in the above summary 
statistics. 
Credit spread risk 
(Audited) 
The risk associated with movements in credit 
spreads is primarily managed through sensitivity 
limits, stress testing and V AR for those portfolios 
on which it is calculated. 
At 31 December 2010, the Group credit spread 
V AR was US$41.9m (2009: US$72.7m). The 
decrease arose from the effect of volatile credit 
spread scenarios rolling off from the V AR 
calculation. 
Credit spread risk also arises on credit derivative 
transactions entered into by Global Banking in 
order to manage the risk concentrations within our 
corporate loan portfolio and so enhance capital 
efficiency. The mark-to-market of these transactions 
is reflected in the income statement. At 31 December 
2010, the credit V AR on the credit derivatives 
transactions entered into by Global Banking was 
US$12.3m (2009: US$13.8m). 
Gap risk 
Even for transactions that are structured to render 
the risk to HSBC negligible under a wide range of 
market conditions or events, there exists a remote 
possibility that a significant gap event could lead 
to loss. A gap event could arise from a significant 
change in market price with no accompanying 
trading opportunity, with the result that the threshold 
is breached beyond which the risk profile changes 
from no risk to full exposure to the underlying 
structure. Such movements may occur, for example, 
when, in reaction to an adverse event or unexpected 
news announcement, the market for a specific 
investment becomes illiquid, making hedging 
impossible. 
Given their characteristics, these transactions 
make little or no contribution to V AR or to 
traditional market risk sensitivity measures. We 
capture their risks within our stress testing scenarios 
and monitor gap risk on an ongoing basis. We 
regularly consider the probability of gap loss, and 
fair value adjustments are booked against this risk. 
We did not incur any material gap loss in respect of 
such transactions in 2010. 
Non-trading portfolios
(Audited)
Risk measurement and control 
The principal objective of market risk management 
of non-trading portfolios is to optimise net interest 
income. Interest rate risk in non-trading portfolios 
arises principally from mismatches between the 
future yield on assets and their funding cost, as a 
result of interest rate changes. Analysis of this risk 
is complicated by having to make assumptions on 
embedded optionality within certain product areas 
such as the incidence of mortgage prepayments, 
and from behavioural assumptions regarding 
the economic duration of liabilities which are 
contractually repayable on demand such as current 
accounts. 
Our control of market risk in the non-trading 
portfolios is based on transferring the risks to the 
books managed by Global Markets or the local 
ALCO. The net exposure is typically managed 
through the use of interest rate swaps within agreed 
limits. The V AR for these portfolios is included 
within the Group V AR (see ‘Value at risk of the 
trading and non-trading portfolios’ on page 146).  
Credit spread risk 
The risk associated with movements in credit 
spreads is primarily managed through sensitivity 
limits, stress testing, and V AR for those portfolios 
where V AR is calculated. We have introduced credit 
spread as a separate risk type within our V AR 
models on a global basis. The V AR shows the effect 
on income from a one-day movement in credit 
spreads over a two-year period, calculated to a 99% 
confidence interval. 
At 31 December 2010, the sensitivity of equity 
capital to the effect of movements in credit spreads, 
based on credit spread VAR, on our available-
for-sale debt securities was US$264m (2009: 
US$535m). After including the gross exposure for 
the SICs consolidated within our balance sheet, this 
exposure rose to US$299m (2009: US$549m). This 
sensitivity is calculated before taking into account 
losses which would have been absorbed by the 
capital note holders. At 31 December 2010, the 
capital note holders can absorb the first US$2.2bn 
(2009: US$2.2bn) of any losses incurred by the SICs 
before we incur any equity losses. 
The decrease in this sensitivity at 31 December 
2010 compared with 31 December 2009 can be 
explained by the effect of lower volatility in credit 
spread scenarios observed during 2010. 149

The fair value of the constituents of equity

fluctuate considerably. A 10% reduction in their 
value at 31 December 2010 would have reduced our 
equity by US$0.8bn (2009: US$0.9bn). For details of 
the impairment incurred on available-for-sale equity 
securities, see ‘Securitisation exposures and other 
structured products’ on page 128. 
Structural foreign exchange exposures  
(Unaudited) 
Structural foreign exchange exposures represent 
net investments in subsidiaries, branches and 
associates, the functional currencies of which are 
currencies other than the US dollar. An entity’s 
functional currency is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates. 
Exchange differences on structural exposures 
are recognised in other comprehensive income. We 
use the US dollar as our presentation currency in our 
consolidated financial statements because the US 
dollar and currencies linked to it form the major 
currency bloc in which we transact and fund our 
business. Our consolidated balance sheet is, 
therefore, affected by exchange differences between 
the US dollar and all the non-US dollar functional 
currencies of underlying subsidiaries. 
We hedge structural foreign exchange exposures 
only in limited circumstances. Our structural foreign 
exchange exposures are managed with the primary 
objective of ensuring, where practical, that our 
consolidated capital ratios and the capital ratios of 
individual banking subsidiaries are largely protected 
from the effect of changes in exchange rates. This 
is usually achieved by ensuring that, for each 
subsidiary bank, the ratio of structural exposures in a 
given currency to risk-weighted assets denominated 
in that currency is broadly equal to the capital ratio 
of the subsidiary in question. 
We may also transact hedges where a currency 
in which we have structural exposures is considered 
to be significantly overvalued and it is possible 
in practice to transact a hedge. Any hedging is 
undertaken using forward foreign exchange contracts 
which are accounted for under IFRSs as hedges of 
a net investment in a foreign operation, or by 
financing with borrowings in the same currencies 
as the functional currencies involved. No forward 
foreign exchange hedges were in place during 2010 
in respect of our consolidated Group structural 
foreign exchange position. 
For details of structural foreign exchange 
exposures see Note 36 on the Financial Statements. 
Sensitivity of net interest income 
(Unaudited) 
A principal element of our management of market 
risk in non-trading portfolios is monitoring the 
sensitivity of projected net interest income under 
varying interest rate scenarios (simulation 
modelling). We aim to mitigate the effect of 
prospective interest rate movements which could 
reduce future net interest income, while balancing 
the cost of such hedging activities on the current net 
revenue stream. 
For simulation modelling, our businesses use a 
combination of scenarios relevant to them and their 
local markets and standard scenarios which are 
required throughout HSBC. The standard scenarios 
are consolidated to illustrate the combined pro forma 
effect on our consolidated portfolio valuations and 
net interest income. 
The table below sets out the effect on future 
net interest income of incremental 25 basis points 
parallel falls or rises in all yield curves worldwide at 
the beginning of each quarter during the 12 months 
from 1 January 2011.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Assuming no management actions, a sequence of 
such rises would increase planned net interest 
income for 2011 by US$882m (2010: US$695m), 
while a sequence of such falls would decrease 
planned net interest income by US$1,525m 
(2010: US$1,563m). These figures incorporate the 
effect of any option features in the underlying 
exposures.

For footnote, see page 174.
The interest rate sensitivities set out in the 
table above are illustrative only and are based on 
simplified scenarios. 
The figures represent the effect of the pro forma 
movements in net interest income based on the 
projected yield curve scenarios and our current 
interest rate risk profile. This effect, however, does 
not incorporate actions that would be taken by 
Balance Sheet Management within Global Markets 
or in the business units to mitigate the impact of 
this interest rate risk; in reality, Balance Sheet 
Management seeks proactively to change the interest 
rate risk profile to minimise losses and optimise net 
revenues. The projections above also assume that 
interest rates of all maturities move by the same 
amount and, therefore, do not reflect the potential 
effect on net interest income of some rates changing 
while others remain unchanged. In addition, the 
projections take account of the effect on net interest 
income of anticipated differences in changes 
between interbank interest rates and interest rates 
linked to other bases (such as Central Bank rates or 
product rates over which the entity has discretion in 
terms of the timing and extent of rate changes). The 
projections make other simplifying assumptions too, 
including that all positions run to maturity. 
Projecting the movement in net interest income 
from prospective changes in interest rates is a 
complex interaction of structural and managed 
exposures. Our exposure to the effect of movements 
in interest rates on our net interest income arises in 
two main areas, core deposit franchises and Balance 
Sheet Management: 
• core deposit franchises are exposed to changes 
in the cost of deposits raised and spreads on 
wholesale funds. The net interest income benefit 
of core deposits increases as interest rates rise 
and decreases as interest rates fall. This risk 
is asymmetrical in a very low interest rate 
environment, however, as there is limited room 
to lower deposit pricing in the event of interest 
rate reductions; and 
• residual interest rate risk is managed within 
Balance Sheet Management, under our policy of 
transferring interest rate risk to Balance Sheet 
Management to be managed within defined 
limits and with flexibility as to the instruments 
used.
The table above reflects the fact that our deposit 
taking businesses will generally benefit from rising 
rates which will be partially offset by increased 
funding costs in Balance Sheet Management given 
our simplifying assumption of unchanged Balance 
Sheet Management positioning. Additionally, the 
benefit to deposit taking businesses of rising rates is 
also offset by the increased funding cost of trading 
assets, which is recorded in ‘Net interest income’ 
and therefore captured in the above table, whereas 
the income from such assets is recorded in ‘Net 
trading income’.   151
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
The main drivers of the year on year changes in 
the sensitivity of the Group’s net interest income to 
the change in rates shown in the table were lower 
implied yield curves, changes in Balance Sheet 
Management positioning, and changed expectations 
for deposit pricing for some currencies in a rising 
rate environment. 
We monitor the sensitivity of reported reserves 
to interest rate movements on a monthly basis by 
assessing the expected reduction in valuation of 
available-for-sale portfolios and cash flow hedges 
due to parallel movements of plus or minus 
100 basis points in all yield curves. The table below 
describes the sensitivity of our reported reserves to 
these movements at the end of 2010 and 2009 and

The sensitivities are illustrative only and are 
based on simplified scenarios. The table shows the 
potential sensitivity of reserves to valuation changes 
in available-for-sale portfolios and from cash flow 
hedges following the pro forma movements in 
interest rates. These particular exposures form only 
a part of our overall interest rate exposures. The 
accounting treatment under IFRSs of our remaining 
interest rate exposures, while economically largely 
offsetting the exposures shown in the above table, 
does not require revaluation movements to go to 
reserves.  
The year-on-year increase in sensitivity of 
reserves is due to an increase in government bonds 
held in Balance Sheet Management, which are 
accounted for on an available-for-sale basis. 
Defined benefit pension schemes 
(Audited) 
Market risk arises within our defined benefit pension 
schemes to the extent that the obligations of the 
schemes are not fully matched by assets 
with determinable cash flows. Pension scheme 
obligations fluctuate with changes in long-term 
interest rates, inflation, salary levels and the 
longevity of scheme members. Pension scheme 
assets include equities and debt securities, the cash 
flows of which change as equity prices and interest  
rates vary. There is a risk that market movements in 
equity prices and interest rates could result in asset 
values which, taken together with regular ongoing 
contributions, are insufficient over time to cover the 
level of projected obligations and these, in turn, 
could increase with a rise in inflation and members 
living longer. Management, together with the 
trustees who act on behalf of the pension scheme 
beneficiaries, assess these risks using reports 
prepared by independent external actuaries, take 
action and, where appropriate, adjust investment 
strategies and contribution levels accordingly.

HSBC Holdings 
(Audited)
As a financial services holding company, HSBC 
Holdings has limited market risk activity. Its 
activities predominantly involve maintaining 
sufficient capital resources to support the Group’s 
diverse activities; allocating these capital resources 
across our businesses; earning dividend and interest 
income on its investments in our businesses; 
providing dividend payments to HSBC Holdings’ 
equity shareholders and interest payments to 
providers of debt capital; and maintaining a supply 
of short-term cash resources. It does not take 
proprietary trading positions. 
The main market risks to which HSBC Holdings 
is exposed are interest rate risk and foreign currency 
risk. Exposure to these risks arises from short-term 
cash balances, funding positions held, loans to 
subsidiaries, investments in long-term financial 
assets and financial liabilities including debt capital 
issued. The objective of HSBC Holdings’ market 
risk management strategy is to reduce exposure to 
these risks and minimise volatility in economic 
income, cash flows and distributable reserves. 
Market risk for HSBC Holdings is monitored by the 
Holdings ALCO (formerly the Structural Positions 
Review Group). 
HSBC Holdings has entered into a number of 
cross-currency swaps to manage the market risk 
arising on certain long-term debt capital issues for 
which hedge accounting has not been applied. 
Changes in the market values of these swaps are 
recognised directly in the income statement. HSBC 
Holdings expects that these swaps will be held to 
final maturity with the accumulated changes in 
market value consequently trending to zero. 
Certain loans to subsidiaries of a capital nature 
that are not denominated in the functional currency 
of either the provider or the recipient are accounted 
for as financial assets. Changes in the carrying 
amount of these assets due to exchange differences 
are taken directly to the income statement. These 
loans, and the associated foreign exchange exposures, 
are eliminated on a Group consolidated basis. 
The principal tools used in the management of 
market risk are the projected sensitivity of HSBC 
Holdings’ net interest income to future changes in 
yield curves and interest rate gap re-pricing tables 
for interest rate risk, and V AR for foreign exchange 
rate risk. 
Sensitivity of net interest income

HSBC Holdings monitors net interest income 
sensitivity over a 5-year time horizon reflecting 
the longer-term perspective on interest rate risk 
management appropriate to a financial services 
holding company. The table below sets out the effect

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
The interest rate sensitivities tabulated above 
are illustrative only and are based on simplified 
scenarios. The figures represent the effect of pro 
forma movements in net interest income based on our 
projected yield curve scenarios, HSBC Holdings’ 
current interest rate risk profile and assumed changes 
to that profile during the next five years. Changes to 
assumptions concerning the risk profile over the next 
five years can have a significant impact on the net 
interest income sensitivity for that period. The figures 
do not take into account the effect of actions that could 
be taken to mitigate this interest rate risk, however. 
Interest repricing gap table 
The interest rate risk on the fixed-rate securities 
issued by HSBC Holdings is not included within the 
Group VAR but is managed on a repricing gap basis. 
The interest rate repricing gap table below analyses 
the full term structure of interest rate mismatches 
within HSBC Holdings’ balance sheet. The year-on-
year movement in the repricing gap was mainly due 
to the refinancing of maturing interest bearing 
capital liabilities with perpetual fixed rate issues.

The foreign exchange risk largely arises from 
loans to subsidiaries of a capital nature that are not 
denominated in the functional currency of either the 
provider or the recipient and which are accounted 
for as financial assets. Changes in the carrying 
amount of these loans due to foreign exchange rate 
differences are taken directly to HSBC Holdings’ 
income statement. These loans, and the associated 
foreign exchange exposures, are eliminated on a 
Group consolidated basis. 
Operational risk 
(Unaudited) 
Operational risk is relevant to every aspect of our 
business and covers a wide spectrum of issues. 
Losses arising through fraud, unauthorised activities, 
errors, omission, inefficiency, systems failure or 
from external events all fall within the definition of 
operational risk. 
The objective of our operational risk 
management is to manage and control operational 
risk in a cost effective manner within targeted levels 
of operational risk consistent with our risk appetite, 
as defined by the GMB. 
A formal governance structure provides 
oversight over the management of operational risk. 
A Global Operational Risk and Control Committee, 
which reports to the Risk Management Meeting, 
meets at least quarterly to discuss key risk issues and 
review the effective implementation of our 
operational risk management framework. 
In each of our subsidiaries, business managers 
are responsible for maintaining an acceptable level 
of internal control, commensurate with the scale and 
nature of operations. They are responsible for 
identifying and assessing risks, designing controls 
and monitoring the effectiveness of these controls. 
The operational risk management framework helps 
managers to fulfil these responsibilities by defining a 
standard risk assessment methodology and providing 
a tool for the systematic reporting of operational loss 
data.
A centralised database is used to record the 
results of the operational risk management process. 
Operational risk self-assessments are input and 
maintained by business units. To ensure that 
operational risk losses are consistently reported and 
monitored at Group level, all Group companies are 
required to report individual losses when the net loss 
is expected to exceed US$10,000. 
Further details of our approach to Operational 
Risk Management can be found in Pillar 3 
Disclosures 2010 which is published as a separate 
document on www.hsbc.com.  
Legal risk 
(Unaudited)
Each operating company is required to implement 
procedures to manage legal risk that conform to our 
standards. Legal risk falls within the definition of 
operational risk and includes contractual risk, 
dispute risk, legislative risk and non-contractual 
rights risk. 
• Contractual risk is the risk that the rights and/or 
obligations of an HSBC company within a 
contractual relationship are defective. 
• Dispute risk consists of the risks that an HSBC 
company is subject to when it is involved in or 
managing a potential or actual dispute. 
• Legislative risk is the risk that an HSBC 
company fails to adhere to the laws of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates.  
• Non-contractual rights risk is the risk that an 
HSBC company’s assets are not properly owned 
or are infringed by others, or an HSBC company 
infringes another party’s rights. 
We have a global legal function to assist 
management in controlling legal risk. The function 
provides legal advice and support in managing 
claims against our companies, as well as in respect 
of non-routine debt recoveries or other litigation 
against third parties.  
The GMO Legal department oversees the global 
legal function and is headed by the Group General 
Counsel. There are legal departments in 58 of the 
countries in which we operate. There are also 
regional legal functions in each of Europe, North 
America, Latin America, the Middle East, and 
Asia-Pacific headed by Regional General Counsels. 
Our operating companies must notify the 
appropriate legal department immediately any 
litigation is either threatened or commenced against 
HSBC or an employee. Any claims which exceed 
US$1.5m or equivalent must be advised to the  155
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
appropriate regional legal department and the 
regional legal department must immediately advise 
the GMO Legal department if any such claim 
exceeds US$5m. The appropriate regional legal 
department must also be immediately advised (and 
must in turn immediately advise the GMO Legal 
department) of any action by a regulatory authority, 
where the proceedings are criminal, or where the 
claim might materially affect our reputation. Insofar 
as matters relate to GB&M or GPB, notification 
should also be made to GB&M Legal in London. 
All such matters are then reported to the Risk 
Management Meeting in a monthly paper.  
In addition, our operating companies are
required to submit semi-annual returns detailing 
outstanding claims where the claim (or group of 
similar claims) exceeds US$10m, where the action is 
by a regulatory authority, where the proceedings are 
criminal, where the claim might materially affect our 
reputation, or, where the GMO Legal department has 
requested returns be completed for a particular 
claim. These returns are used for reporting to 
the Risk Management Meeting, the Group Audit 
Committee and the Board, and disclosure in the 
Annual Report and Accounts and Interim Report,
if appropriate. 
Compliance risk 
(Unaudited) 
Compliance risk falls within the definition of 
operational risk. All Group companies are required 
to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, 
codes, rules, regulations and standards of good 
market practice. These rules, regulations, other 
standards and Group policies include those relating 
to anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing 
and sanctions compliance. 
The Group Compliance function supports line 
management in ensuring that there are adequate 
policies and procedures, and is responsible for 
maintaining adequate resources to mitigate 
compliance risk. The GMO Compliance department 
oversees the global compliance function and is 
headed by the Head of Group Compliance who in 
turn reports to the Group Chief Risk Officer. There 
are compliance teams in all of the countries where 
we operate. These compliance teams are principally 
overseen by Regional Compliance Officers located 
in Europe, North America, Latin America, the 
Middle East and Asia-Pacific. 
Group Compliance policies and procedures 
require the prompt identification and escalation 
to GMO Compliance of all actual or suspected 
breaches of any law, rule, regulation, Group policy 
or other relevant requirement. These escalation 
procedures are supplemented by a requirement for 
the submission of compliance certificates at the half-
year and year-end by all Group companies detailing 
any known breaches as above. The contents of these 
escalation and certification processes are used for 
reporting to the Risk Management Meeting, the 
Group Risk Committee and the Board and disclosure 
in the Annual Report and Accounts and Interim
Report, if appropriate. 
Group security and fraud risk 
(Unaudited) 
Security and fraud risk issues are managed at Group 
level by Group Security and Fraud Risk. This unit, 
which has responsibility for physical risk, fraud, 
information and contingency risk, and security and 
business intelligence, is fully integrated within 
the central GMO Risk function. This enables 
management to identify and mitigate the effect of 
the permutations of these and other non-financial 
risks on our business lines across the jurisdictions 
in which we operate. 
Risk management of insurance 
operations
(Audited) 
We operate a bancassurance model which provides 
insurance products for customers with whom we 
have a banking relationship. Insurance products are 
sold to all customer groups, mainly utilising retail 
branches, the internet and phone centres. PFS 
customers attract the majority of sales and comprise 
the majority of policyholders. 
Many of these insurance products are 
manufactured by our subsidiaries. This allows us to 
retain the risks and rewards associated with writing 
insurance contracts as both the underwriting profit 
and the commission paid by the manufacturer to the 
bank distribution channel are kept within the Group. 
Where we consider it operationally more 
effective, third parties are engaged to manufacture 
insurance products for sale through our banking 
network. We work with a limited number of market-
leading partners to provide the products. These 
arrangements earn us a commission. 
Our bancassurance business operates in all six 
of our geographical regions with over 30 legal 
entities, the majority of which are subsidiaries of 
banking legal entities, manufacturing insurance 
products.
The insurance contracts we sell primarily relate 
to core underlying banking activities, such as savings 
and investment products, and credit life products.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Our manufacturing business concentrates on 
personal lines, e.g. contracts written for individuals. 
This focus on the higher volume, lower individual 
value personal lines contributes to diversifying risk. 
Overview of insurance products 
(Audited) 
The main contracts we manufacture are listed below: 
Life insurance business 
• Life insurance contracts with discretionary 
participation features (‘DPF’);  
• credit life insurance business; 
• annuities;
• term assurance and critical illness policies;
• linked life insurance; 
• investment contracts with DPF; 
• unit-linked investment contracts; and 
• other investment contracts (including pension 
contracts written in Hong Kong). 
Non-life insurance business 
Non-life insurance contracts include motor, fire and 
other damage to property, accident and health, 
repayment protection and commercial insurance. 
Credit non-life insurance is concentrated in 
North America and Europe, and is originated in 
conjunction with the provision of loans. Following 
a decision taken to close the Consumer Lending 
network in the US, insurance products written in 
conjunction with this business are being run off.  
In December 2007, we decided to stop selling 
payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) products in the 
UK and a phased withdrawal was completed across 
the HSBC, first direct and M&S Money brands 
during 2008. HFC ceased selling single premium PPI 
in 2008 and sales of regular premium PPI will 
reduce as HFC exits its remaining retail 
relationships. HSBC continues to distribute its UK 
short-term income protection (‘STIP’) product. In 
January 2009, the Competition Commission (‘CC’) 
published its report into the PPI market in which it 
stipulated that STIP products will also be subject to 
their remedies when sold in conjunction with or as a 
result of a referral following the sale of a loan or 
similar credit product. We have undertaken an 
analysis of the required changes to the STIP product 
and its sales processes resulting from the CC’s 
remedies. Following an appeal to the Competition 
Appeal Tribunal, the CC had to reconsider whether a 
ban on firms selling PPI at the point of sale of the 
credit product was an appropriate and justified 
remedy for the deficiencies it identified in the PPI  
market. On 14 October 2010, the CC confirmed that 
it intended to proceed with a point of sale ban. It is 
anticipated that the Order implementing the CC’s 
remedies will be made in late March or early April, 
and that the point of sale ban will then come into 
effect 12 months after the date of the Order. 
Nature and extent of risks 
(Audited) 
The majority of the risk in our insurance business 
derives from manufacturing activities and can be 
categorised as insurance risk and financial risks. The 
following sections describe how these risks are 
managed. Financial risks include market risk, credit 
risk and liquidity risk. The assets of insurance 
manufacturing subsidiaries are included within the 
consolidated credit risk disclosures on pages 93 
to 128, although separate disclosures in respect of 
insurance manufacturing subsidiaries are provided 
below. The consolidated liquidity risk and market 
risk disclosures focus on banking entities and 
disclosures specific to the insurance manufacturing 
subsidiaries are provided in the sections below. 
Operational risk is covered by the Group’s overall 
operational risk management process. 
The insurance manufacturers set their own 
control procedures in addition to complying with 
guidelines issued by the Group Insurance Head 
Office. The control framework for monitoring risk 
includes the Group Insurance Risk Committee, 
which oversees the status of the significant risk 
categories in the insurance operations. Five sub-
committees of this Committee focus on products 
and pricing, market and liquidity risk, credit risk, 
operational risk and insurance risk, respectively. 
Similar risk committees exist at regional and entity 
levels. Any issues requiring escalation from the 
Group Insurance Risk Committee would be reported 
to the GMB via the Risk Management Meeting. 
In addition, local ALCOs and Risk Management 
Committees monitor certain risk exposures, mainly 
for life business where the duration and cash flow 
matching of insurance assets and liabilities are 
reviewed.
All insurance products, whether manufactured 
internally or by a third party, are subjected to a 
product approval process. Approval is provided 
by the Regional Insurance Head Office or Group 
Insurance Head Office depending on the type of 
product and its risk profile. The approval process 
is formalised through the Product and Pricing 
Committee, which comprise the heads of the relevant 
risk functions within insurance.  157
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Insurance risk 
(Audited) 
Insurance risk is the risk, other than financial risk, 
of loss transferred from the holder of the insurance 
contract to the issuer (HSBC). The principal 
insurance risk we face is that, over time, the cost of 
acquiring and administering a contract, claims and 
benefits may exceed the aggregate amount of 
premiums received and investment income. 
The cost of claims and benefits can be 
influenced by many factors, including mortality and 
morbidity experience, lapse and surrender rates and, 
if the policy has a savings element, the performance 
of the assets held to support the liabilities. 
Life and non-life business insurance risks are 
controlled by high-level policies and procedures set 
centrally, taking into account where appropriate 
local market conditions and regulatory requirements. 
Formal underwriting, reinsurance and claims-
handling procedures designed to ensure compliance 
with regulations are applied, supplemented with 
stress testing. 
As well as exercising underwriting controls, we 
use reinsurance as a means of mitigating exposure 
to insurance risk, in particular to aggregations of 
catastrophe risk. When we manage our exposure 
to insurance risk through the use of third-party 
reinsurers, the associated revenue and manufacturing 
profit is ceded to them. Although reinsurance 
provides a means of managing insurance risk, such 
contracts expose us to credit risk, the risk of default 
by the reinsurer (see page 165). 
The following tables analyse our insurance risk 
exposures by geographical region and by type of 
business.

Our most significant life insurance products are 
investment contracts with DPF issued in France, 
insurance contracts with DPF issued in Hong Kong 
and unit-linked contracts issued in Hong Kong, Latin 
America and the UK. 
The principal drivers of our insurance risk are 
described below. The liabilities for long-term 
contracts are set by reference to a range of 
assumptions around these drivers. These typically 
reflect the issuers’ own experiences. The type and 
quantum of insurance risk arising from life insurance 
depends on the type of business, and varies 
considerably. 
• mortality and morbidity: the main contracts 
which generate exposure to these risks are term 
assurance, whole life products, critical illness  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Risk > Risk management of insurance operations > Insurance risk 
158
and income protection contracts and annuities. 
The risks are monitored on a regular basis, 
and are primarily mitigated by underwriting 
controls and reinsurance and by retaining the 
ability in certain cases to amend premiums in 
the light of experience; 
• lapses and surrenders: the risks associated with 
this are generally mitigated by product design, 
the application of surrender charges and 
management actions, for example, managing the 
level of bonus payments to policyholders. A 
detailed persistency analysis at a product level 
is carried out at least on an annual basis; and  
• expense risk is mitigated by pricing, for 
example, retaining the ability in certain cases to 
amend premiums and/or policyholder charges 
based on experience, and cost management 
discipline. 
Economic assumptions, such as investment 
returns and interest rates, are usually based on 
observable market data. Clearly, liabilities are 
affected by changes in assumptions (see ‘Sensitivity 
of HSBC’s insurance subsidiaries to risk factors’ on 
page 165 and ‘Sensitivity analysis’ on page 171).

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
(Audited) 
Our motor business is written predominantly in 
Latin America. The run-off of the UK motor book 
continued in 2010. Accident and health is written in 
all regions but mainly in Hong Kong. We write fire 
and other damage to property contracts in all major 
markets, most significantly in Europe. Credit non-
life insurance, which is originated in conjunction 
with the provision of loans, is concentrated in the 
US and Europe. 
The main risks associated with non-life business 
are:
• underwriting: the risk that premiums are not 
appropriate for the cover provided; and 
• claims experience: the risk that claims exceed 
expectations. 
We manage these risks through pricing (for 
example, imposing restrictions and deductibles in the 
policy terms and conditions), product design, risk 
selection, claims handling, investment strategy and 
reinsurance policy. The majority of our non-life 
insurance contracts are renewable annually, 
providing added flexibility to the underwriting 
terms and conditions.

Financial risks  
(Audited) 
Our insurance businesses are exposed to a range of 
financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and 
liquidity risk. Market risk includes interest rate risk, 
equity risk and foreign exchange risk. The nature 
and management of these risks is described below.  
Manufacturing subsidiaries are exposed to 
financial risks when, for example, the proceeds 
from financial assets are not sufficient to fund the 
obligations arising from non-linked insurance and 
investment contracts. In many jurisdictions, local 
regulatory requirements prescribe the type, quality 
and concentration of assets that these subsidiaries 
must maintain to meet insurance liabilities. These 
requirements complement Group-wide policies. 
The following table analyses the assets held 
in our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries at 
31 December 2010 by type of contract, and provides 
a view of the exposure to financial risk. For linked 
contracts, which pay benefits to policyholders which 
are determined by reference to the value of the 
investments supporting the policies, we typically 
designate assets at fair value; for non-linked 
contracts, the classification of the assets is driven 
by the nature of the underlying contract.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Approximately 65.1% of financial assets were 
invested in debt securities at 31 December 2010 
(2009: 64.4%) with 22.9% (2009: 22.2%) invested 
in equity securities.  
In life linked insurance, premium income less 
charges levied is invested in a portfolio of assets. We 
manage the financial risks of this product on behalf 
of the policyholders by holding appropriate assets in 
segregated funds or portfolios to which the liabilities 
are linked. These assets represented 23.9% of the 
total financial assets of our insurance manufacturing 
subsidiaries at the end of 2010 (2009: 22.4%). 
Market risk 
(Audited)
Market risk arises when mismatches occur between 
product liabilities and the investment assets which 
back them. For example, mismatches between asset 
and liability yields and maturities give rise to interest 
rate risk. 
Description of market risk 
(Audited) 
The main features of products manufactured by our 
insurance manufacturing subsidiaries which generate 
market risk, and the market risk to which these   163
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
features expose the subsidiaries, are discussed 
below.
Long-term insurance or investment products 
may incorporate benefits that are guaranteed. The 
table below shows, in respect of each category of 
guarantee, the total liabilities to policyholders 
established for guaranteed products manufactured by 
our insurance subsidiaries. The table also shows the 
range of investment returns (net of operating costs) 
on the assets supporting these products and the 
implied investment returns that would enable the 
business to meet the guarantees. 
Categories of guaranteed benefits 
• annuities in payment;  
• deferred/immediate annuities: these consist of two phases –
the savings and investing phase and the retirement income 
phase;
• annual return: the annual return is guaranteed to be no lower 
than a specified rate. This may be the return credited to the 
policyholder every year, or the average annual return 
credited to the policyholder over the life of the policy, 
which may occur on the maturity date or the surrender date 
of the contract; and 
• capital: policyholders are guaranteed to receive no less than 
the premiums paid plus declared bonuses less expenses.

Interest rate risk arises to the extent that yields 
on the assets are lower than the investment returns 
implied by the guarantees payable to policyholders 
by insurance manufacturing subsidiaries. When this 
happens, we may discontinue products.  
The proceeds from insurance and investment 
products with DPF are primarily invested in bonds 
with a proportion allocated to other asset classes in 
order to provide customers with the potential for 
enhanced returns. Subsidiaries with portfolios of 
such products are exposed to the risk of falls in 
market prices which cannot be fully reflected in the 
discretionary bonuses. An increase in market 
volatility could also result in an increase in the value 
of the guarantee to the policyholder. 
Long-term insurance and investment products 
typically permit the policyholder to surrender the 
policy or let it lapse at any time. When the surrender 
value is not linked to the value realised from the sale 
of the associated supporting assets, the subsidiary is 
exposed to market risk. In particular, when customers 
seek to surrender their policies when asset values are 
falling, assets may have to be sold at a loss to fund 
redemptions. 
A subsidiary holding a portfolio of long-term 
insurance and investment products, especially with 
DPF, may attempt to reduce exposure to its local 
market by investing in assets in countries other 
than that in which it is based. These assets may 
be denominated in currencies other than the 
subsidiary’s local currency. It is often not cost 
effective for the subsidiary to hedge the foreign 
exchange exposure associated with these assets, and 
this exposes it to the risk that its local currency will 
strengthen against the currency of the related assets. 
For unit-linked contracts, market risk is 
substantially borne by the policyholder, but we 
typically remain exposed to market risk as the 
market value of the linked assets influences the fees 
we earn for managing them. 
Asset and liability matching 
It may not always be possible to achieve a complete 
matching of asset and liability durations, partly 
because there is uncertainty over policyholder 
behaviour, which introduces uncertainty over the 
receipt of all future premiums and the timing of 
claims, and partly because the duration of liabilities 
may exceed the duration of the longest available 
dated fixed interest investments.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Risk > Risk management of insurance operations > Financial risks > Market risk / Credit risk 
164
We use models to assess the effect of a range of 
future scenarios on the values of financial assets and 
associated liabilities, and ALCOs employ the 
outcomes in determining how the assets and 
liabilities should be matched. The scenarios include 
stresses applied to factors which affect insurance 
risk such as mortality and lapse rates. Of particular 
importance is matching the expected pattern of cash 
inflows with the benefits payable on the underlying 
contracts, which can extend for many years. 
Our current portfolio of assets includes debt 
securities issued at a time when yields were higher 
than those observed in the current market. As a 
result, yields on extant holdings of debt securities 
exceed those which may be obtained on current 
issues. We reduced short-term bonus rates paid to 
policyholders on certain participating contracts to 
manage the immediate strain on the business. Should 
interest rates and yield curves remain low for 
prolonged periods, further such steps may be needed. 
How market risk is managed 
(Audited) 
All our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries have 
market risk mandates which specify the investment 
instruments in which they are permitted to invest and 
the maximum quantum of market risk which they are 
permitted to retain. They manage market risk by 
using some or all of the techniques listed below, 
depending on the nature of the contracts they write. 
Techniques for managing market risk 
• for products with DPF, adjusting bonus rates to manage the 
liabilities to policyholders. The effect is that a significant 
portion of the market risk is borne by the policyholder; 
• as far as possible, matching assets to liabilities; 
• using derivatives to a limited extent; 
• for new products with investment guarantees, considering 
the cost when determining the level of premiums or the 
price structure;  
• periodically reviewing products identified as higher risk, 
which contain investment guarantees and embedded 
optionality features linked to savings and investment 
products; 
• including features designed to mitigate market risk in new 
products, such as charging surrender penalties to recoup 
losses incurred when policyholders surrender their policies; 
and
• exiting, to the extent possible, investment portfolios whose 
risk is considered unacceptable. 
In the product approval process, the risks 
embedded in new products are identified and 
assessed. When, for example, options and guarantees 
are embedded in new products, the due diligence 
process ensures that complete and appropriate risk 
management procedures are in place. For all but the 
simplest of guaranteed benefits the assessment is 
undertaken by Group Insurance Head Office.  
Management reviews certain exposures more 
frequently when markets are more volatile to ensure 
that any matters arising are dealt with in a timely 
fashion.
How the exposure to market risk is measured 
(Audited)
Our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries monitor 
exposures against mandated limits regularly and 
report them to Group Insurance Head Office. 
Exposures are aggregated and reported on a 
quarterly basis to senior risk management forums in 
the Group, including the Group Insurance Market 
and Liquidity Risk Committee, Group Insurance 
Risk Committee and the Group Stress Test Review 
Group.
Standard measures for quantifying market risks 
• for interest rate risk, the sensitivities of the net present 
values of asset and expected liability cash flows, in total and 
by currency, to a one basis point parallel shift in the 
discount curves used to calculate the net present values; 
• for equity price risk, the total market value of equity 
holdings and the market value of equity holdings by region 
and country; and 
• for foreign exchange risk, the total net short foreign 
exchange position and the net foreign exchange positions by 
currency. 
The standard measures are relatively 
straightforward to calculate and aggregate, but they 
have limitations. The most significant one is that a 
parallel shift in yield curves of one basis point does 
not capture the non-linear relationships between the 
values of certain assets and liabilities and interest 
rates. Non-linearity arises, for example, from 
investment guarantees and product features which 
enable policyholders to surrender their policies. We 
bear the shortfall if the yields on investments held to 
support contracts with guaranteed benefits are less 
than the investment returns implied by the 
guaranteed benefits.  
We recognise these limitations and augment our 
standard measures with stress tests which examine 
the effect of a range of market rate scenarios on the 
aggregate annual profits and total equity of our 
insurance manufacturing subsidiaries, after taking 
into consideration tax and accounting treatments 
where material and relevant. The results of these 
tests are reported to Group Insurance Head Office 
and risk committees every quarter. 
The following table illustrates the effects of 
various interest rate, equity price, foreign exchange 
rate and credit spread scenarios on our profit for the 
year and total equity of our insurance manufacturing

Where appropriate, we include the impact of the 
stress on the PVIF in the results of the stress tests. 
The relationship between the values of certain assets 
and liabilities and the risk factors may be non-linear 
and, therefore, the results disclosed cannot be 
extrapolated to measure sensitivities to different 
levels of stress. The sensitivities are stated before 
allowance for the effect of management actions 
which may mitigate changes in market rates, and for 
any factors such as policyholder behaviour that may 
change in response to changes in market risk. 
Credit risk 
(Audited) 
Description of credit risk 
Credit risk can give rise to losses through default 
and can lead to volatility in our income statement 
and balance sheet figures through movements in 
credit spreads, principally on the US$43.3bn (2009: 
US$40.5bn) non-linked bond portfolio.  
As tabulated above, the sensitivity of the net 
profit after tax of our insurance subsidiaries to the 
effects of increases in credit spreads is a fall of 
US$31m (2009: US$36m fall). This is small because 
51.4% of the financial assets held by our insurance 
subsidiaries are classified as either held to maturity 
or available for sale, and consequently any changes 
in the fair value of these financial investments, 
absent impairment, would have no impact on the 
profit after tax. We calculate the sensitivity using 
simplified assumptions based on a one-day 
movement in credit spreads over a two-year period. 
A confidence level of 99%, consistent with our 
Group V AR, is applied. While credit spreads have 
generally widened from the levels observed at the 
end of 2009, the volatility experienced during 2010 
was lower than that seen in 2009, leading to a 
reduction in our sensitivity to credit spread 
movements. 
We used to sell certain unit-linked life insurance 
contracts which were reinsured with a third-party 
counterparty, who also underwrote market return 
guarantees. We are exposed to credit risk to the 
extent that the counterparty is unable to meet the 
terms of the guaranteed benefits. The cost to us of 
market return guarantees increases when interest 
rates fall, equity markets fall or market volatility 
increases. In addition, when determined by reference 
to a discounted cash flow model in which the 
discount rate is based on current interest rates, 
guarantee costs increase in a falling interest rate 
environment. The sale of these contracts ceased in 
2008, reflecting our adjusted risk appetite. 
How credit risk is managed 
Our exposure to credit risk products is included in 
the tables showing exposures to life and non-life 
insurance risk on pages 157 to 159. Our insurance 
manufacturing subsidiaries are responsible for the 
credit risk, quality and performance of their 
investment portfolios. Our assessment of the 
creditworthiness of issuers and counterparties is 
based primarily upon internationally recognised 
credit ratings and other publicly available 
information.  
Investment credit exposures are monitored 
against limits by our local insurance manufacturing 
subsidiaries, and are aggregated and reported to 
Group Credit Risk, the Group Insurance Credit Risk 
Meeting and the Group Insurance Risk Committee. 
Stress testing is performed by Group Insurance Head 
Office on the investment credit exposures using 
credit spread sensitivities and default probabilities. 
The stresses are reported to the Group Insurance 
Risk Committee. 
We use a number of tools to manage and 
monitor credit risk. These include an Early Warning 
Report and a watch list of investments with current 
credit concerns which are circulated fortnightly to  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Credit quality 
(Audited)
The following table presents an analysis of treasury 
bills, other eligible bills and debt securities within 
our insurance business by measures of credit quality. 
The five credit quality classifications are defined 
on page 114. Only assets supporting non-linked 
liabilities are included in the table as financial 
risk on assets supporting linked liabilities is 
predominantly borne by the policyholder. 90.5% 
(2009: 90.9%) of the assets included in the table 
are invested in investments rated as ‘Strong’.

Liquidity risk 
(Audited)
Description of liquidity risk 
It is an inherent characteristic of almost all insurance 
contracts that there is uncertainty over the amount of 
claims liabilities that may arise and the timing of 
their settlement, and this creates liquidity risk. 
There are three aspects to liquidity risk. The 
first arises in normal market conditions and is 
referred to as funding liquidity risk; specifically, the 
capacity to raise sufficient cash when needed to meet 
payment obligations. Secondly, market liquidity risk 
arises when the size of a particular holding may be 
so large that a sale cannot be completed around the 
market price. Finally, standby liquidity risk refers to 
the capacity to meet payment terms in abnormal 
conditions. 
How liquidity risk is managed 
Our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries primarily 
fund cash outflows arising from claim liabilities 
from the following sources of cash inflows: 
• premiums from new business, policy renewals 
and recurring premium products; 
• interest and dividends on investments and 
principal repayments of maturing debt 
investments; 
• cash resources; and 
• the sale of investments. 
They manage liquidity risk by utilising some or 
all of the following techniques: 
• matching cash inflows with expected cash 
outflows using specific cash flow projections or 
more general asset and liability matching 
techniques such as duration matching; 
• maintaining sufficient cash resources; 
• investing in good credit-quality investments 
with deep and liquid markets to the degree to 
which they exist; 
• monitoring investment concentrations and 
restricting them where appropriate, for example, 
by debt issues or issuers; and 
• establishing committed contingency borrowing 
facilities.
Each of these techniques contributes to 
mitigating the three types of liquidity risk described 
above.
Every quarter, our insurance manufacturing 
subsidiaries are required to complete and submit 
liquidity risk reports to Group Insurance Head Office 
for collation and review by the Group Insurance 
Market and Liquidity Risk Meeting. Liquidity risk 
is assessed in these reports by measuring changes 
in expected cumulative net cash flows under a 
series of stress scenarios designed to determine the 
effect of reducing expected available liquidity and 
accelerating cash outflows. This is achieved, for 
example, by assuming new business or renewals are  169

lower, and surrenders or lapses are greater, than 
expected. 
The following tables show the expected 
undiscounted cash flows for insurance contract 
liabilities and the remaining contractual maturity of 
investment contract liabilities at 31 December 2010. 
A significant proportion of our non-life insurance 
business is viewed as short-term, with the settlement 
of liabilities expected to occur within one year of the 
period of risk. There is a greater spread of expected 
maturities for the life business where, in a large 
proportion of cases, the liquidity risk is borne in 
conjunction with policyholders (wholly in the case 
of unit-linked business).  
The profile of the expected maturity of the 
insurance contracts as at 31 December 2010 
remained comparable with 2009.

Present value of in-force long-term 
insurance business  
(Audited)
Our life insurance business is accounted for using 
the embedded value approach which, inter alia,
provides a comprehensive risk and valuation 
framework. The present value of our in-force long-
term (‘PVIF’) asset at 31 December 2010 was 
US$3.4bn (2009: US$2.8bn), representing the 
present value of the shareholders’ interest in the 
profits expected to emerge from the book of in-force 
policies at that date.

The calculation of the PVIF is based upon 
assumptions that take into account risk and 
uncertainty. To project these cash flows, a variety of 
assumptions regarding future experience is made by 
each insurance operation which reflects local market 
conditions and management’s judgement of local 
future trends. Some of the Group’s insurance 
operations incorporate risk margins separately in the 
projection assumptions for each product, while 
others incorporate risk margins into the overall 
discount rate. Both factors are reflected in the wide 
range of risk discount rates applied. 
Economic assumptions 
(Audited)
The following table shows the effect on the PVIF of 
reasonably possible changes in the main economic 
assumptions, namely the risk-free and risk discount 
rates, across all insurance manufacturing 
subsidiaries. 
Due to certain characteristics of the contracts, 
the relationships may be non-linear and the results 
of the stress-testing should not be extrapolated to 
higher levels of stress. In calculating the various 
scenarios, all assumptions are held stable except 
when testing the effect of the shift in the risk-free 
rate, when resultant changes to investment returns, 
risk discount rates and bonus rates are also 
incorporated. The sensitivities shown are before 
actions that could be taken by management to 
mitigate effects and before resultant changes in 
policyholder behaviour.   171

Non-economic assumptions 
(Audited) 
We determine the policyholder liabilities and PVIF 
by reference to non-economic assumptions which 
include, for non-life manufacturers, claims costs and 
expense rates and, for life manufacturers, mortality 
and/or morbidity, lapse rates and expense rates. The 
table below shows the sensitivity of profit for 2010 
and total equity at 31 December 2010 to reasonably 
possible changes in these non-economic assumptions 
at that date across all our insurance manufacturing 
subsidiaries, with comparatives for 2009. 
The cost of claims is a risk associated with non-
life insurance business. An increase in claims costs 
would have a negative effect on profit. Our main 
exposures to this scenario are in the UK, Hong 
Kong, Latin America and Bermuda. 
Mortality and morbidity risk is typically 
associated with life insurance contracts. The effect 
on profit of an increase in mortality or morbidity 
depends on the type of business being written. Our 
largest exposures to mortality and morbidity risk 
exist in France, Hong Kong, the UK and the US. 
Sensitivity to lapse rates depends on the type of 
contracts being written. For insurance contracts, 
claims are funded by premiums received and income 
earned on the investment portfolio supporting the 
liabilities. For a portfolio of term assurance, an 
increase in lapse rates typically has a negative effect 
on profit due to the loss of future premium income 
on the lapsed policies. France, Hong Kong, the UK 
and the US are where we are most sensitive to a 
change in lapse rates. 
Expense rate risk is the exposure to a change in 
expense rates. To the extent that increased expenses 
cannot be passed on to policyholders, an increase in 
expense rates will have a negative impact on our 
profits.

Other material risks 
Reputational risk 
(Unaudited) 
The safeguarding of our reputation is of 
paramount importance to our continued 
prosperity and is the responsibility of every 
member of staff. 
We regularly review our policies and procedures for 
safeguarding against reputational and operational 
risks. This is an evolutionary process which takes 
account of relevant developments and industry 
guidance such as The Association of British 
Insurers’ guidance on best practice when responding 
to environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) 
risks. 
We have always aspired to the highest standards 
of conduct and, as a matter of routine, take account 
of reputational risks to our business. Reputational 
risks can arise from a wide variety of causes, 
including ESG issues and operational risk events. As 
a banking group, our good reputation depends upon 
the way in which we conduct our business, but it can 
also be affected by the way in which clients, to 
whom we provide financial services, conduct 
themselves. The training of Directors on 
appointment includes reputational matters. 
Group functions with responsibility for activities 
that attract reputational risk are represented at the 
Group Reputational Risk Committee (‘GRRC’), 
which is chaired by the Group Chairman. The 
primary role of the GRRC is to consider areas and 
activities presenting significant reputational risk and, 
where appropriate, to make recommendations to the 
Risk Management Meeting and the GMB for policy 
or procedural changes to mitigate such risk. 
Reputational Risk Committees have been established 
in each of the Group’s regions. These committees 
are required to ensure that reputational risks are 
considered at a regional as well as Group level. 
Minutes from the regional committees are tabled at 
GRRC. 
Standards on all major aspects of business 
are set for HSBC and for individual subsidiaries, 
businesses and functions. Reputational risks, 
including ESG matters, are considered and assessed 
by the Board, the GMB, the Risk Management 
Meeting, subsidiary company boards, Board 
committees and senior management during the 
formulation of policy and the establishment of our 
standards. These policies, which form an integral 
part of the internal control system (see page 202), are 
communicated through manuals and statements of 
policy and are promulgated through internal 
communications and training. The policies cover 
ESG issues and set out operational procedures in 
all areas of reputational risk, including money 
laundering deterrence, counter-terrorist financing, 
environmental impact, anti-corruption measures and 
employee relations. The policy manuals address risk 
issues in detail and co-operation between GMO 
departments and businesses is required to ensure a 
strong adherence to our risk management system and 
our sustainability practices.
Pension risk 
(Unaudited)
We operate a number of pension plans throughout 
the world, as described in Note 7 on the Financial 
Statements. Some of them are defined benefit plans, 
of which the largest is the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension 
Scheme (‘the principal plan’).  
In order to fund the benefits associated with 
these plans, sponsoring Group companies (and, 
in some instances, employees) make regular 
contributions in accordance with advice from 
actuaries and in consultation with the scheme’s 
trustees (where relevant). The defined benefit plans 
invest these contributions in a range of investments 
designed to meet their long-term liabilities. 
The level of these contributions has a direct 
impact on HSBC’s cash flow and would normally 
be set to ensure that there are sufficient funds to 
meet the cost of the accruing benefits for the future 
service of active members. However, higher 
contributions will be required when plan assets are 
considered insufficient to cover the existing pension 
liabilities as a deficit exists. Contribution rates are 
typically revised annually or triennially, depending 
on the plan. The agreed contributions to the principal 
plan are revised triennially. 
A deficit in a defined benefit plan may arise from a 
number of factors, including
• investments delivering a return below that required to 
provide the projected plan benefits. This could arise, for 
example, when there is a fall in the market value of equities, 
or when increases in long-term interest rates cause a fall in 
the value of fixed income securities held; 
• the prevailing economic environment leading to corporate 
failures, thus triggering write-downs in asset values (both 
equity and debt); 
• a change in either interest rates or inflation which causes an 
increase in the value of the scheme liabilities; and 
• scheme members living longer than expected (known as 
longevity risk). 
A plan’s investment strategy is determined after 
taking into consideration the market risk inherent in 
the investments and its consequential impact on 
potential future contributions. The long-term  173
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
investment objectives of both HSBC and, where 
relevant and appropriate, the trustees are:  
• to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the 
liabilities of the plans over the long-term; and 
• to maximise returns consistent with an 
acceptable level of risk so as to control the 
long-term costs of the defined benefit plans. 
In pursuit of these long-term objectives, a 
benchmark is established for the allocation of the 
defined benefit plan assets between asset classes. 
In addition, each permitted asset class has its own 
benchmarks, such as stock market or property 
valuation indices and, where relevant, desired levels 
of out-performance. The benchmarks are reviewed 
at least triennially within 18 months of the date at 
which an actuarial valuation is made, or more 
frequently if required by local legislation or 
circumstances. The process generally involves an 
extensive asset and liability review. 
Ultimate responsibility for investment strategy 
rests with either the trustees or, in certain 
circumstances, a Management Committee. The 
degree of independence of the trustees from HSBC 
varies in different jurisdictions. For example, the 
principal plan, which accounts for approximately 
70% of the obligations of our defined benefit 
pension plans, is overseen by a corporate trustee who 
regularly monitors the market risks inherent in the 
scheme. 
The principal plan holds a diversified portfolio 
of investments to meet future cash flow liabilities 
arising from accrued benefits as they fall due to be 
paid. The trustee of the principal plan is required to 
produce a written Statement of Investment Principles 
which governs decision-making about how 
investments are made.

In 2006, HSBC and the trustee of the principal 
plan agreed to change the investment strategy in 
order to reduce the investment risk. The target asset 
allocations for this strategy at that time and as 
revised in 2010 are shown above. The strategy is to 
hold the majority of assets in bonds, with the 
remainder in a more diverse range of investments, 
and includes a commitment to undertake a 
programme of swap arrangements (see Note 45 on 
the Financial Statements) by which the principal 
plan makes LIBOR-related interest payments in 
exchange for the receipt of cash flows which are 
based on projected future benefit payments to be 
made from the principal plan. 
Sustainability risk 
(Unaudited) 
Assessing the environmental and social 
impacts of providing finance to our 
customers has been firmly embedded into 
our overall risk management processes.
Sustainability risks arise from the provision of 
financial services to companies or projects which run 
counter to the needs of sustainable development; in 
effect this risk arises when the environmental and 
social effects outweigh economic benefits. Within 
GMO, a separate function, Group Corporate 
Sustainability, is mandated to manage these risks 
globally working through local offices as 
appropriate. Sustainability Risk Managers have 
regional or national responsibilities for advising on 
and managing environmental and social risks. 
Group Corporate Sustainability’s risk 
management responsibilities include: 
• formulating sustainability risk policies. This 
includes oversight of our sustainability risk 
standards, management of the Equator 
Principles for project finance lending, and 
sector-based sustainability policies covering 
those sectors with high environmental or social 
impacts (forestry, freshwater infrastructure, 
chemicals, energy, mining and metals, and 
defence-related lending); undertaking an 
independent review of transactions where 
sustainability risks are assessed to be high, and 
supporting our operating companies to assess 
similar risks of a lower magnitude; 
• building and implementing systems-based 
processes to ensure consistent application of 
policies, reduce the costs of sustainability risk 
reviews and capture management information to 
measure and report on the effect of our lending 
and investment activities on sustainable 
development; and 
• providing training and capacity building within 
our operating companies to ensure sustainability 
risks are identified and mitigated consistently to 
either our own standards, international standards 
or local regulations, whichever is higher. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Residual value risk 
(Unaudited) 
A significant part of a lessor’s return from operating 
leases is dependent upon its management of residual 
value risk. This arises from operating lease 
transactions to the extent that the values recovered 
from disposing of leased assets or re-letting them at 
the end of the lease terms (the ‘residual values’) 
differ from those projected at the inception of the 
leases. 
The sale of our rail finance business ‘Eversholt 
Rail Group’ during the year has significantly 
reduced our exposure to residual value risk.  
Footnotes to Risk 
Credit risk 
  1 The amount of the loan commitments reflects, where relevant, the expected level of take-up of pre-approved loan offers made by 
mailshots to personal customers. In addition to those amounts, there is a further maximum possible exposure to credit risk of 
US$220.2bn (2009: US$62.3bn), reflecting the full take-up of such irrevocable loan commitments. The take-up of such offers is 
generally at modest levels. 
  2 A change in the write-off period in North America during 2009 resulted in an acceleration of write-offs which reduced residential
mortgages by US$1.9bn, other personal loans by US$1.3bn and total personal lending by US$3.3bn, with a corresponding reduction in
impairment allowances. There was no significant effect on net loans and advances or loan impairment charges. 
  3 Residential mortgages include Hong Kong Government Home Ownership Scheme loans of US$3.5bn at 31 December 2010 
(2009: US$3.5bn). Where disclosed, earlier comparatives were 2008: US$3.9bn; 2007: US$3.9bn; 2006: US$4.1bn. 
  4 Other personal loans and advances include second lien mortgages and other property-related lending. 
  5 Other commercial loans and advances include advances in respect of agriculture, transport, energy and utilities. 
  6 Included within ‘Total gross loans and advances to customers’ (‘TGLAC’) is credit card lending of US$62bn (2009: US$68bn). 
Where disclosed, earlier comparatives were 2008: US$75bn; 2007: US$83bn; 2006: US$75bn. 
  7 The above numbers for North America include a reclassification within the corporate and commercial lending category to reflect a 
more accurate presentation of lending in the region. 
  8 The impairment allowances on loans and advances to banks relate to the geographical regions, Europe, Middle East and North 
America.
  9 These balances were between 0.75% and 1% of total assets. All other balances were above 1%. 
10 We do not have material retail exposures in any of the eurozone countries listed in this table.  
11 Includes balances at central banks. Lending to banks comprises non-trading loans and advances to banks including reverse repurchase
transactions. 
12 Derivative assets net of collateral and derivative liabilities for which a legally enforceable right of offset exists.  
13 Includes residential mortgages of HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Finance. 
14 Comprising Hong Kong, Rest of Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Latin America. 
15 Negative equity arises when the value of the property used to secure a loan is below the balance outstanding on the loan, generally
based on values at the balance sheet date. 
16 Loan-to-value ratios are generally based on values at the balance sheet date. 
17 HSBC Finance lending is shown on a management basis and includes loans transferred to HSBC USA Inc. which are managed by 
HSBC Finance. 
18 Interest-only (affordability mortgages) are loans which are classified as ‘interest only’ for initial period before reverting to repayment. 
As a consequence, in the table ‘Mortgage lending products’ on page 109 these balances are included in the category ‘Affordability
mortgages, including ARMs’. 
19 Stated income lending forms a subset of total mortgage services lending across all categories. 
20 By states which individually account for 5% or more of HSBC Finance’s US customer loan portfolio.  
21 The average loss on sale of foreclosed properties is calculated as cash proceeds after deducting selling costs, commissions and other 
ancillary costs, minus the book value of the property when it was moved to assets held for sale, divided by the book value of the
property when it was moved to assets held for sale. 
22 The average total loss on foreclosed properties sold includes both the loss on sale (see footnote 21) and the cumulative write-downs
recognised on the loans up to and upon classification as assets held for sale. This average total loss on foreclosed properties is 
expressed as a percentage of the book value of the property prior to its transfer to assets held for sale. 
23 Percentages are expressed as a function of the relevant loans and receivables balance. 
24 At 31 December 2010 and 2009, real estate secured delinquency included US$4.2bn and US$3.3bn, respectively, of loans that we 
carried at the lower of cost on net realisable value. 
25 We observe the disclosure convention that, in addition to those classified as EL9 to EL10, retail accounts classified EL1 to EL8 that are 
delinquent by 90 days or more are considered impaired, unless individually they have been assessed as not impaired (see page 118, 
‘Past due but not impaired financial instruments’). 
26 The EL percentage is derived through a combination of PD and LGD, and may exceed 100% in circumstances where the LGD is above 
100% reflecting the cost of recoveries. 
27 Impairment allowances are not reported for financial instruments whereby the carrying amount is reduced directly for impairment and 
not through the use of an allowance account. 
28 Impairment is not measured for assets held in trading portfolios or designated at fair value as assets in such portfolios are managed 
according to movements in fair value, and the fair value movement is taken directly to the income statement. Consequently, we report
all such balances under ‘Neither past due nor impaired’. 
29 Loans and advances to customers includes asset-backed securities that have been externally rated as strong (2010: US$4.1bn; 2009: 
US$5.7bn), good (2010: US$627m; 2009: US$881m), satisfactory (2010: US$452m; 2009: US$311m), sub-standard (2010: US$669m; 
2009: US$468m) and impaired (2010: US$29m; 2009: US$460m). 
30 Impaired loans and advances are those classified as CRR 9, CRR 10, EL 9 or EL 10 and all retail loans 90 days or more past due,
unless individually they have been assessed as not impaired (see page 118, ‘Past due but not impaired financial instruments’).  175
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
31 Collectively assessed loans and advances comprise homogeneous groups of loans that are not considered individually significant, and 
loans subject to individual assessment where no impairment has been identified on an individual basis, but on which a collective
impairment allowance has been calculated to reflect losses which have been incurred but not yet identified. 
32 Collectively assessed loans and advances not impaired are those classified as CRR1 to CRR8 and EL1 to EL8 but excluding retail loans
90 days past due. 
33 Net of repo transactions, settlement accounts and stock borrowings. 
34 As a percentage of loans and advances to banks and loans and advances to customers, as applicable. 
35 Includes movement in impairment allowances against banks. 
36 See table below ‘Net loan impairment charge to the income statement by geographical region’. 
37 Collectively assessed impairment allowances are allocated to geographical segments based on the location of the office booking the
allowances or provisions. Consequently, the collectively assessed impairment allowances booked in Hong Kong may cover assets 
booked in branches located outside Hong Kong, principally in Rest of Asia-Pacific, as well as those booked in Hong Kong. 
38 Total includes holdings of ABSs issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. 
39 ‘Directly held’ includes assets held by Solitaire where we provide first loss protection and assets held directly by the Group.
40 Impairment charges allocated to capital note holders represent impairments where losses would be borne by external third-party 
investors in the structures. 
41 Mortgage-backed securities (‘MBS’s), asset-backed securities (‘ABS’s) and collateralised debt obligations (‘CDO’s). 
42 High grade assets rated AA or AAA. 
43 Gains or losses on the net principal exposure (footnote 49) recognised in the income statement as a result of changes in the fair value of 
the asset. 
44 Fair value gains and losses on the net principal exposure (footnote 49) recognised in other comprehensive income as a result of the 
changes in the fair value of available-for-sale assets. 
45 Realised fair value gains and losses on the net principal exposure (footnote 49) recognised in the income statement as a result of the 
disposal of assets or the receipt of cash flows from assets.
46 Reclassified from equity on impairment, disposal or payment. This includes impairment losses recognised in the income statement in 
respect of the net principal exposure (footnote 49) of available-for-sale assets. Payments are the contractual cash flows received on the 
assets.
47 The gross principal is the redemption amount on maturity or, in the case of an amortising instrument, the sum of the future redemption
amounts through the residual life of the security. 
48 A credit default swap (‘CDS’) gross protection is the gross principal of the underlying instrument that is protected by CDSs. 
49 Net principal exposure is the gross principal amount of assets that are not protected by CDSs. It includes assets that benefit from 
monoline protection, except where this protection is purchased with a CDS. 
50 Carrying amount of the net principal exposure. 
51 Net exposure after legal netting and any other relevant credit mitigation prior to deduction of the credit risk adjustment. 
52 Cumulative fair value adjustment recorded against exposures to OTC derivative counterparties to reflect their creditworthiness.
53 Funded exposures represent the loan amount advanced to the customer, less any fair value write-downs, net of fees held on deposit. 
Unfunded exposures represent the contractually committed loan facility amount not yet drawn down by the customer, less any fair value 
write-downs, net of fees held on deposit. 
Liquidity and funding 
54 2009 comparative data have been re-presented in line with the classification used in 2010. This resulted in an increase in the ‘On 
demand’ time band of US$273,078m for ‘Loan and other credit-related commitments’ and US$10,450m for ‘Financial guarantees and 
similar contracts’. There was an equivalent reduction across the other time bands. 
55 Figures provided for HSBC Bank plc and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation incorporate all overseas branches. 
Subsidiaries of these entities are not included unless there is unrestricted transferability of liquidity between the subsidiaries and the 
parent.
56 This comprises our other main banking subsidiaries and, as such, includes businesses spread across a range of locations, in many of 
which we may require a higher ratio of net liquid assets to customer liabilities to reflect local market conditions. 
57 Unused committed sources of secured funding for which eligible assets were held. 
58 Client-originated asset exposures relate to consolidated multi-seller conduits (see page 363). These vehicles provide funding to our 
customers by issuing debt secured by a diversified pool of customer-originated assets. 
59 HSBC-managed asset exposures relate to consolidated securities investment conduits, primarily Solitaire and Mazarin (see page 362). 
These vehicles issue debt secured by ABSs which are managed by HSBC. Of the total contingent liquidity risk under this category,
US$8.1bn was already funded on-balance sheet at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$7.6bn) leaving a net contingent exposure of 
US$17.5bn (2009: US$21.5bn).  
60 Other conduit exposures relate to third-party sponsored conduits (see page 364).

63 The structural foreign exchange risk is monitored using sensitivity analysis (see page 351). The reporting of commodity risk is
consolidated with foreign exchange risk and is not applicable to non-trading portfolios.
64 The interest rate risk on the fixed-rate securities issued by HSBC Holdings is not included in the Group VAR. The management of this 
risk is described on page 149. 
65 Credit spread sensitivity is reported separately for insurance operations (see page 165).
66 The standard deviation measures the variation of daily revenues about the mean value of those revenues.
67 The effect of any month-end adjustments, not attributable to a specific daily market move, is spread evenly over the days in the month in 
question. 
68 Trading intent portfolios include positions arising from market-making and position taking.  
69 Trading credit spread VAR was previously reported in the Group trading credit VAR. See page 148.

71 Investments in private equity are primarily made through managed funds that are subject to limits on the amount of investment.
Potential new commitments are subject to risk appraisal to ensure that industry and geographical concentrations remain within 
acceptable levels for the portfolio as a whole. Regular reviews are performed to substantiate the valuation of the investments within the 
portfolio.
72 Investments held to facilitate ongoing business include holdings in government-sponsored enterprises and local stock exchanges.
73 Instead of assuming that all interest rates move together, HSBC groups its interest rate exposures into currency blocs whose rates are 
considered likely to move together.
Risk management of insurance operations 
74 HSBC has no insurance manufacturing subsidiaries in the Middle East. 
75 Insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features (‘DPF’) can give policyholders the contractual 
right to receive, as a supplement to their guaranteed benefits, additional benefits that may be a significant portion of the total
contractual benefits, but whose amount and timing are determined by HSBC. These additional benefits are contractually based on the 
performance of a specified pool of contracts or assets, or the profit of the company issuing the contracts.  
76 Although investment contracts with DPF are financial investments, HSBC continues to account for them as insurance contracts as
permitted by IFRS 4.

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Capital
Capital management 
(Audited)
Our approach to capital management is driven by our 
strategic and organisational requirements, taking into 
account the regulatory, economic and commercial 
environment in which we operate. 
It is our objective to maintain a strong capital 
base to support the development of our business and 
to meet regulatory capital requirements at all times. 
To achieve this, our policy is to hold capital in a 
range of different forms and from diverse sources, 
and all capital raising is agreed with major 
subsidiaries as part of their individual and the 
Group’s overall capital management processes.  
Our policy is underpinned by a capital 
management framework, which enables us to 
manage our capital in a consistent and aligned 
manner. The framework, which is approved by the 
GMB, incorporates a number of different capital 
measures including market capitalisation, invested 
capital, economic capital and regulatory capital. 
Capital measures 
• market capitalisation is the stock market value of the 
company;  
• invested capital is the equity capital invested in HSBC by 
our shareholders; 
• economic capital is the internally calculated capital 
requirement which we deem necessary to support the risks 
to which we are exposed at a confidence level consistent 
with a target credit rating of AA; and 
• regulatory capital is the capital which we are required to 
hold in accordance with the rules established by the FSA for 
the consolidated Group and by our local regulators for 
individual Group companies. 
The following risks managed through the capital 
management framework have been identified as 
material: credit, market, operational, interest rate risk 
in the banking book, pension fund, insurance and 
residual risks.  
We incorporate stress testing in the capital 
management framework, and it is important in 
understanding the sensitivities of the core 
assumptions in our capital plans to the adverse effect 
of extreme, but plausible, events. Stress testing 
allows us to formulate our response, including risk 
mitigation actions, in advance of conditions starting 
to exhibit the stress scenarios identified. The actual 
market stresses which occurred throughout the 
financial system during recent years have been used  
to inform our capital planning process and further 
develop the stress scenarios we employ. 
In addition to our internal stress tests, others are 
carried out, both at the request of regulators and by 
the regulators themselves using their prescribed 
assumptions. We take into account the results of all 
such regulatory stress testing when undertaking our 
internal capital management assessment. 
The responsibility for global capital allocation 
principles and decisions rests with the GMB. 
Through our structured internal governance 
processes, we maintain discipline over our 
investment and capital allocation decisions and seek 
to ensure that returns on investment are adequate 
after taking account of capital costs. Our strategy is 
to allocate capital to businesses on the basis of their 
economic profit generation, regulatory and economic 
capital requirements and cost of capital. 
Our capital management process is articulated in 
the annual Group capital plan which is approved by 
the Board. The plan is drawn up with the objective 
of maintaining both an appropriate amount of capital 
and an optimal mix between the different 
components of capital. HSBC Holdings and its major 
subsidiaries raise non-equity tier 1 capital and 
subordinated debt in accordance with our guidelines 
on market and investor concentration, cost, market 
conditions, timing, effect on composition and 
maturity profile. Each of the subsidiaries manages its 
own capital to support its planned business growth 
and meet its local regulatory requirements within the 
context of the approved annual Group capital plan. 
In accordance with our capital management 
framework, capital generated by subsidiaries in 
excess of planned requirements is returned to HSBC 
Holdings, normally by way of dividends.  
HSBC Holdings is the primary provider of 
capital to its subsidiaries and these investments are 
substantially funded by HSBC Holdings’ own capital 
issuance and profit retention. As part of its capital 
management process, HSBC Holdings seeks to 
maintain a prudent balance between the composition 
of its capital and that of its investment in 
subsidiaries.  
The tier 1 ratio (unaudited) increased to 12.1% 
at 31 December 2010 (2009: 10.8%). It is our belief 
that this enhanced ratio is appropriate in light of our 
current evolution of the regulatory framework.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Capital measurement and allocation 
(Unaudited) 
The FSA supervises HSBC on a consolidated basis 
and therefore receives information on the capital 
adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the 
Group as a whole. Individual banking subsidiaries 
are directly regulated by their local banking 
supervisors, who set and monitor their capital 
adequacy requirements.  
We calculate capital at a Group level using the 
Basel II framework of the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision. However, local regulators are 
at different stages of implementation and local 
reporting may still be on a Basel I basis, notably in 
the US. In most jurisdictions, non-banking financial 
subsidiaries are also subject to the supervision and 
capital requirements of local regulatory authorities.  
Basel II is structured around three ‘pillars’: 
minimum capital requirements, supervisory review 
process and market discipline. The Capital 
Requirements Directive (‘CRD’) implemented 
Basel II in the EU and the FSA then gave effect 
to the CRD by including the latter’s requirements 
in its own rulebooks. 
Regulatory capital 
Our capital is divided into two tiers:  
• tier 1 capital is divided into core tier 1 and other 
tier 1 capital. Core tier 1 capital comprises 
shareholders’ equity and related non-controlling 
interests. The book values of goodwill and 
intangible assets are deducted from core tier 1 
capital and other regulatory adjustments are 
made for items reflected in shareholders’ equity 
which are treated differently for the purposes of 
capital adequacy. Qualifying capital instruments 
such as non-cumulative perpetual preference 
shares and hybrid capital securities are included 
in other tier 1 capital; and 
• tier 2 capital comprises qualifying subordinated 
loan capital, related non-controlling interests, 
allowable collective impairment allowances and 
unrealised gains arising on the fair valuation of 
equity instruments held as available for sale. 
Tier 2 capital also includes reserves arising from 
the revaluation of properties. 
To ensure the overall quality of the capital base, 
the FSA’s rules set limits on the amount of hybrid 
capital instruments that can be included in tier 1 
capital relative to core tier 1 capital, and also limits 
overall tier 2 capital to no more than tier 1 capital. 
Regulatory and accounting consolidations 
The basis of consolidation for financial accounting purposes 
is described on page 251 and differs from that used for 
regulatory purposes. Investments in banking associates are 
equity accounted in the financial accounting consolidation, 
whereas their exposures are proportionally consolidated for 
regulatory purposes. Subsidiaries and associates engaged in 
insurance and non-financial activities are excluded from the 
regulatory consolidation and are deducted from regulatory 
capital. The regulatory consolidation does not include SPEs 
where significant risk has been transferred to third parties. 
Exposures to these SPEs are risk-weighted as securitisation 
positions for regulatory purposes. 
Pillar 1 capital requirements 
Pillar 1 covers the capital resources requirements for 
credit risk, market risk and operational risk. Credit 
risk includes counterparty credit risk and 
securitisation requirements. These requirements are 
expressed in terms of risk-weighted assets (‘RWA’s). 
Credit risk capital requirements 
Basel II applies three approaches of increasing 
sophistication to the calculation of pillar 1 credit 
risk capital requirements. The most basic, the 
standardised approach, requires banks to use external 
credit ratings to determine the risk weightings 
applied to rated counterparties and group other 
counterparties into broad categories and apply 
standardised risk weightings to these categories. 
The next level, the internal ratings-based (‘IRB’) 
foundation approach, allows banks to calculate their 
credit risk capital requirements on the basis of their 
internal assessment of the probability that a 
counterparty will default (‘PD’), but subjects their 
quantified estimates of exposure at default (‘EAD’) 
and loss given default (‘LGD’) to standard 
supervisory parameters. Finally, the IRB advanced 
approach allows banks to use their own internal 
assessment in both determining PD and quantifying 
EAD and LGD. 
The capital resources requirement, which is 
intended to cover unexpected losses, is derived from 
a formula specified in the regulatory rules, which 
incorporates these factors and other variables such as 
maturity and correlation. Expected losses under the 
IRB approaches are calculated by multiplying PD by 
EAD and LGD. Expected losses are deducted from 
capital to the extent that they exceed accounting 
impairment allowances.  
For credit risk, with the FSA’s approval, we 
have adopted the IRB advanced approach for the 
majority of our business, with the remainder on 
either IRB foundation or standardised approaches.  179
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
For consolidated group reporting, the FSA’s 
rules permit the use of other regulators’ standardised 
approaches where they are considered equivalent. 
The use of other regulators’ IRB approaches is 
subject to the agreement of the FSA. Under our 
Basel II rollout plans, a number of our Group 
companies and portfolios are in transition to 
advanced IRB approaches. At December 2010, 
portfolios in much of Europe, Hong Kong, Rest of 
Asia-Pacific and North America were on advanced 
IRB approaches. Others remain on the standardised 
or foundation approaches under Basel II, pending 
definition of local regulations or model approval, or 
under exemptions from IRB treatment.  
Counterparty credit risk 
Counterparty credit risk arises for OTC derivatives 
and securities financing transactions. It is calculated 
in both the trading and non-trading books and is the 
risk that the counterparty to a transaction may 
default before completing the satisfactory settlement 
of the transaction. Three approaches to calculating 
counterparty credit risk and determining exposure 
values are defined by Basel II: standardised, mark-
to-market and internal model method. These 
exposure values are used to determine capital 
requirements under one of the credit risk approaches: 
standardised, IRB foundation and IRB advanced. 
We use the mark-to-market and internal model 
method approaches for counterparty credit risk. Our 
longer-term aim is to migrate more positions from 
the mark-to-market to the internal model method 
approach.
Securitisation 
Basel II specifies two methods for calculating credit 
risk requirements for securitisation positions in the 
non-trading book, being the standardised and IRB 
approaches. Both approaches rely on the mapping 
of rating agency credit ratings to risk weights, 
which range between 7% and 1,250%. Positions 
that would otherwise be weighted at 1,250% are 
deducted from capital.  
Within the IRB approach, we use the Ratings 
Based Method for the majority of our non-trading 
book securitisation positions, and the Internal 
Assessment Approach for unrated liquidity facilities 
and programme-wide enhancements for asset-backed 
securitisations. We use the IRB approach for the 
majority of our non-trading book securitisation 
positions, while those in the trading book are treated 
like other market risk positions. 
Market risk capital requirement 
The market risk capital requirement is measured, 
with FSA permission, using VAR models, or the 
standard rules prescribed by the FSA. 
We use both VAR and standard rules 
approaches for market risk. Our aim is to migrate 
more positions from standard rules to VAR. 
Operational risk capital requirement 
Basel II includes a capital requirement for 
operational risk, again utilising three levels of 
sophistication. The capital required under the basic 
indicator approach is a simple percentage of gross 
revenues, whereas under the standardised approach 
it is one of three different percentages of gross 
revenues allocated to each of eight defined business 
lines. Both these approaches use an average of the 
last three financial years’ revenues. Finally, the 
advanced measurement approach uses banks’ own 
statistical analysis and modelling of operational risk 
data to determine capital requirements. 
We have adopted the standardised approach 
in determining our operational risk capital 
requirements. 
Pillar 2 capital requirements 
The second pillar of Basel II (Supervisory Review 
and Evaluation Process) involves both firms and 
regulators taking a view on whether a firm should 
hold additional capital against risks not covered in 
pillar 1. Part of the pillar 2 process is the Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process which is the 
firm’s self assessment of the levels of capital that 
it needs to hold. The pillar 2 process culminates in 
the FSA providing firms with Individual Capital 
Guidance (‘ICG’). The ICG is set as a capital 
resources requirement higher than that required 
under pillar 1. In 2011, this will be supplemented 
by an additional Capital Planning Buffer, set by 
the FSA, to cover capital demand should economic 
conditions worsen considerably against the current 
outlook.
Pillar 3 disclosure requirements 
Pillar 3 of Basel II is related to market discipline and 
aims to make firms more transparent by requiring 
them to publish specific, prescribed details of their 
risks, capital and risk management under the Basel II 
framework. Our pillar 3 disclosures for the year 
ended 31 December 2010 are published as a separate 
document on the Group Investor Relations website.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Movement in tier 1 capital 
(Audited) 
HSBC complied with the FSA’s capital adequacy 
requirements throughout 2010 and 2009. Profits 
attributable to shareholders of the parent company 
increased capital by US$13.2bn, offset by net 
dividends of US$3.8bn after taking account of shares 
issued in lieu of dividends. Hybrid capital securities 
issued, net of redemptions, increased tier 1 capital by 
US$2.4bn.
Movement in risk-weighted assets
(Unaudited) 
RWAs decreased by US$30.1bn or 2.7% in 2010. 
Of this reduction, US$12.8bn was due to credit risk, 
reflecting decreases in North America and Europe 
offset by increases in Asia and Latin America. There 
has been a decline in some North American retail 
portfolio exposures as a result of run off. However, 
the deterioration in the US economy and housing 
market in recent years has resulted in increases in the 
average risk weighting applicable to those portfolios 
as we progressively captured the effects of these 
events within the various Basel II model parameters. 
Market risk RWAs decreased by US$13.2bn, 
primarily due to reduced market volatility and 
continuing exposure management.  
Future developments 
(Unaudited) 
The regulation and supervision of financial 
institutions continues to undergo significant 
change in response to the global financial crisis. 
In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued 
final rules in two documents: A global regulatory 
framework for more resilient banks and banking 
systems and International framework for liquidity 
risk measurement, standards and monitoring, which 
together are commonly referred to as ‘Basel III’. The 
new minimum capital requirements will be phased 
in from 1 January 2013, with full implementation 
required by 1 January 2019. The minimum common  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Capital > Future developments // Governance > Corporate Governance Report / Directors 
182
equity tier 1 requirement of 4.5% and additional 
capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% will 
be phased in sequentially from 1 January 2013, 
becoming fully effective on 1 January 2019. Any 
additional countercyclical capital buffer requirements 
will also be phased in, starting in 2016, in parallel 
with the capital conservation buffer to a maximum 
level of 2.5% effective on 1 January 2019, although 
individual jurisdictions may choose to implement 
larger countercyclical capital buffers. The leverage 
ratio will be subject to a supervisory monitoring 
period, which commenced on 1 January 2011, and a 
parallel run period which will run from 1 January 
2013 until 1 January 2017. Further calibration of the 
leverage ratio will be carried out in the first half of 
2017, with a view to migrating to a pillar 1 
requirement from 1 January 2018. The Basel 
Committee has increased the capital requirements 
for the trading book and complex securitisation 
exposures which are due to be implemented on 
31 December 2011. They will continue to conduct 
the fundamental review of the trading book, which 
is targeted for completion by the end of 2011. In 
addition to the reforms discussed above, institutions 
designated as G-SIFIs may be subjected to additional 
requirements, which have yet to be proposed by 
regulators. The Basel Committee will provide the 
approach to defining G-SIFIs by the end of 2011. 
On 13 January 2011, the Basel Committee issued 
further minimum requirements to ensure that all 
classes of capital instruments fully absorb losses 
at the point of non-viability before taxpayers are 
exposed to loss. Instruments issued on or after 
1 January 2013 may only be included in regulatory 
capital if the new requirements are met. The capital 
treatment of securities issued prior to this date will 
be phased out over a 10-year period commencing 
1 January 2013.  
Impact of Basel III 
(Unaudited) 
In order to provide some insight into the possible 
effects of the new Basel III rules on HSBC, we have 
estimated the pro forma common equity tier 1 ratio 
of the Group on the basis of our interpretation of 
those rules, as they would apply at 1 January 2019, 
but based on the position at 31 December 2010.  
We have estimated that the application of the full 
Basel III rules on a pro forma basis would result in a 
common equity tier 1 ratio which is lower than the 
Basel II core tier 1 ratio by some 250–300 basis 
points. However, as the new rules will be phased in 
between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2019, their 
impact will be gradual over that period. This 
estimate does not, however, take account of any 
future retained earnings, nor any management 
actions to reduce RWAs. The Basel III changes 
relate to increased capital deductions, new regulatory 
adjustments and increases in RWAs. The majority of 
the increase in RWAs relates to Basel III changes 
which are scheduled to come into effect on 1 January 
2013, in particular to changes to counterparty credit 
risk capital charges and amounts for securitisation 
positions that were previously deducted from capital 
that will now be risk-weighted instead. Other 
increases in RWAs will begin to be phased in from 
1 January 2014, including the majority of the 
unconsolidated investments that were previously 
deducted from capital. The remainder of the RWA 
increase arises from increases in trading book capital 
requirements which take effect on 31 December 
2011, primarily relating to changes in market risk.  
The estimated impact of Basel III is subject to 
change as regulators develop their requirements 
around the practical application and interpretation of 
the new rules, in particular the counterparty credit 
risk capital charge. Further uncertainty remains 
regarding any capital requirements which may be 
imposed on the Group over the period to 1 January 
2019 in respect of the countercyclical capital buffer 
and any additional regulatory requirements for 
G-SIFIs. Under the Basel III rules as they will apply 
from 1 January 2019, we believe that ultimately the 
level for the common equity tier 1 ratio of the Group 
may lie in the range 9.5% to 10.5%. This exceeds the 
minimum requirement for common equity tier 1 
capital plus the capital conservation buffer. HSBC 
has a strong track record of capital generation and 
actively manages its RWAs. Before these new 
rules come into force, we will take appropriate 
management action over the implementation period 
to 1 January 2019 to reduce the quantum of increase 
in RWAs that would have occurred if the new rules 
had been in effect at 31 December 2010. 
Footnotes to Capital 
1 Includes externally verified profits for the year to 31 December 2010. 
2 Mainly comprises unrealised losses on available-for-sale debt securities within special purpose entities which are excluded from the 
regulatory consolidation. 
3 Under FSA rules, unrealised gains/losses on debt securities net of tax must be excluded from capital resources. 
4 Under FSA rules, the defined benefit liability may be substituted with the additional funding that will be paid into the relevant schemes 
over the following five year period. 
5 Mainly comprise investments in insurance entities. 
6 Under FSA rules, collective impairment allowances on loan portfolios on the standardised approach are included in tier 2 capital. 
7 Rights issue excludes US$493m of losses arising on derivative contracts and certain fees, which are recognised in the income statement. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Board of Directors 
The Board 
The purpose of HSBC’s management structures, 
headed by the Board of Directors of HSBC Holdings 
(the ‘Board’) and led by the Group Chairman, is to 
deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. The 
Board sets the strategy for the Group and approves 
the risk appetite, capital and operating plans 
presented by management for the achievement of the 
strategic objectives it has set. This ensures the 
efficient application of our resources for the 
achievement of these objectives. Implementation of 
the strategy set by the Board is delegated to the 
Group Management Board (‘GMB’) led by the 
Group Chief Executive. 
HSBC Holdings has a unitary Board. The 
authority of each Director is exercised in Board 
meetings where the Board acts collectively. At 
28 February 2011, the Board comprises the Group 
Chairman, Group Chief Executive, three other 
executive Directors and 12 non-executive Directors. 
Their names and brief biographical particulars are 
listed on pages 183 to 187. The Group Chairman, 
Group Chief Executive and three other executive 
Directors are employees. Non-executive Directors 
are not HSBC employees and do not participate in 
the daily business management of HSBC; they bring 
an external perspective, constructively challenge and 
help develop proposals on strategy, scrutinise the 
performance of management in meeting agreed goals 
and objectives and monitor the reporting of 
performance. The non-executive Directors bring 
experience from a number of industries and business 
sectors, including the leadership of large complex 
multinational enterprises. The roles of non-executive 
Directors as members of Board committees are 
described on pages 194 to 198 and on pages 201 
and 202. 
The Board has determined that the time 
commitment expected of non-executive Directors to 
be not less than 24 days per annum and not less than 
30 days per annum in total for non-executive 
Directors appointed to the Group Audit Committee, 
Group Risk Committee or Remuneration Committee 
and for the Deputy Chairman and senior independent 
non-executive director. The time commitment of 
each non-executive Director is set out in the 
Director’s letter of appointment.  
The terms and conditions of appointment of 
non-executive Directors are available for inspection 
at 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ and will be 
made available for 15 minutes before the Annual 
General Meeting and during the Meeting itself. 
The Board is responsible for managing the 
business of HSBC Holdings and, in doing so, may 
exercise its powers, subject to any relevant laws and 
regulations and to the Articles of Association. In 
particular, the Board may exercise all the powers of 
the Company to borrow money and to mortgage or 
charge all or any part of the undertaking, property or 
assets (present or future) of HSBC Holdings and 
may also exercise any of the powers conferred on it

The Board is able to delegate and confer on certain 
Directors holding executive office any of its powers, 
authorities and discretions (including the power to

locality and delegate and confer on any local or 
divisional board, manager or agent so appointed any 
of its powers, authorities and discretions (including

persons to be the agent of HSBC Holdings and may 
delegate to any such person or persons any of its 
powers, authorities and discretions (including the 
power to sub-delegate) for such time and on such 
terms as it thinks fit. 
The Board delegates the management and day-
to-day running of HSBC to the GMB but retains to 
itself approval of certain matters including operating 
plans, risk appetite and performance targets, 
procedures for monitoring and controlling of 
operations, the authority or the delegation of 
authority to approve credit, market risk limits,

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
The roles of Group Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive are separate and held by experienced 
full-time Directors.  
D J Flint succeeded S K Green (who on 
22 November 2010 became Lord Green of 
Hurstpierpoint and is referred to in this document as 
Lord Green) as Group Chairman on 3 December 
2010. S T Gulliver succeeded M F Geoghegan as 
Group Chief Executive on 1 January 2011. 
The appointment of D J Flint, made by a 
unanimous decision of the Board, was the 
culmination of a comprehensive succession process 
begun in the first half of the year under the 
leadership of the senior independent non-executive 
Director. When considering the choice of Group 
Chairman, the Nomination Committee, assisted by 
an external consultant, took a number of factors into 
account, including the need to contribute to the 
unprecedented regulatory and public policy debate 
on the future shape of the banking industry and, in 
particular, systemically important financial 
institutions operating globally with a universal 
banking model; the full-time demands of this 
engagement; the personal standing to represent 
HSBC at the highest levels; a deep understanding 
and experience of international financial services; 
and extensive experience of Board governance and 
stakeholder engagement. The Nomination 
Committee came to the unanimous conclusion that 
D J Flint was the best person for the position, 
meeting all the core criteria and having led our 
regulatory engagement at Board level through 2010. 
S T Gulliver has worked for us throughout his 
career serving across Asia, in Europe and in the 
Middle East. The Board considers S T Gulliver 
ideally qualified for the role of Group Chief 
Executive. He has built and managed a global 
business in 68 countries and has a deep knowledge 
of and strong reputation in Asia where he worked for 
over 20 years. S T Gulliver has been responsible for 
managing complex risks for many years and 
shepherded and enhanced the Group’s liquidity 
through the economic crisis. He also has had 
responsibility for all of HSBC’s operations in the 
UK, Europe and the Middle East. As Group Chief 
Executive, S T Gulliver’s principal office is located 
in Hong Kong. 
Sir Simon Robertson became Deputy Chairman 
with effect from 1 December 2010. As Deputy 
Chairman his role is to deputise for the Group 
Chairman at meetings of the Board or shareholders 
and to support the Group Chairman in his role.  
The Board believed strongly that these 
appointments, which were made by unanimous 
decision, are in HSBC’s best interests. There is a 
clear division of responsibilities at the head of the 
Company between the running of the Board and the 
executive responsibility for running HSBC’s 
business. The Group Chairman’s responsibilities 
include, in addition to the leadership of the Board 
and ensuring its effectiveness, the development of 
relationships with governments, regulators and 
investors; leading the Group’s interactions on 
matters of public policy and regulatory reform with 
regard to the banking and financial services industry; 
maintaining corporate reputation and character; and 
performance management of the Group Chief 
Executive. Subject to the Group Chief Executive’s 
recommendation, the Group Chairman approves risk, 
capital allocation and capital investment decisions 
within authorities delegated by the Board.  
The Group Chief Executive has responsibility 
for developing, and delivering performance against, 
business plans. He is responsible for developing 
Group strategy in agreement with the Group 
Chairman and for recommendation to the Board. As 
chairman of the GMB, the Group Chief Executive is 
responsible for driving performance within strategic 
goals and commercial objectives agreed by the 
Board.
Board balance and independence of 
Directors 
The Board includes a strong presence of both 
executive and non-executive Directors and no 
individual or small group can dominate its decision 
making. The size of the Board is appropriate given 
the complexity and geographical spread of our 
business and the significant time demands placed on 
the non-executive Directors, particularly those who 
serve as members of Board committees. 
The Nomination Committee regularly reviews 
the structure, size and composition necessary 
(including the skills, knowledge and experience 
required of Directors) to address and challenge 
adequately key risks and decisions that confront, or 
may confront, the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board with regard to any 
changes. The Nomination Committee maintains a 
forward-looking schedule of potential candidates as 
Directors that takes into account the needs and 
developments of the Group’s businesses and the 
anticipated retirement dates of existing Directors.  
Sir Simon Robertson’s role as the senior 
independent non-executive Director is to act as an 
intermediary for other non-executive Directors when  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Governance (continued) 
Board of Directors > The Board 
192
necessary, to lead the non-executive Directors in the 
oversight of the Group Chairman and to ensure there 
is a clear division of responsibility between the 
Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive. 
The Board considers all of the non-executive 
Directors to be independent in character and 
judgement. The Board has determined S A Catz, 
L M L Cha, M K T Cheung, J D Coombe, 
R A Fairhead, J W J Hughes-Hallett, 
W S H Laidlaw, J R Lomax, G Morgan, 
N R N Murthy, Sir Simon Robertson, J L Thornton 
and Sir Brian Williamson to be independent. When 
determining independence the Board considers that 
calculation of the length of service of a non-
executive Director begins on the date of his or her 
first election by shareholders as a Director of HSBC 
Holdings. Given the complexity and geographical 
spread of our business, the experience of previous 
service on a subsidiary company board can be a 
considerable benefit and does not detract from 
a Director’s independence. In reaching its 
determination of each non-executive Director’s 
independence the Board has concluded that there are 
no relationships or circumstances which are likely to 
affect a Director’s judgement and any relationships 
or circumstances which could appear to do so were 
considered not to be material. 
In accordance with the Rules Governing the 
Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong 
Kong Limited, each non-executive Director 
determined by the Board to be independent has 
provided an annual confirmation of his or her 
independence to HSBC Holdings. 
Information, induction and ongoing 
development
The Board regularly reviews reports on progress 
against financial objectives, business developments 
and investor and external relations and receives 
reports from the chairmen of Board committees and 
from the Group Chief Executive. The Board receives 
regular reports and presentations on strategy and 
developments in the customer groups, global 
businesses and principal geographical areas. Regular 
reports are also provided to the Board, the Group 
Audit Committee, the Group Risk Committee and 
the Risk Management Meeting of the GMB on credit 
exposures and the loan portfolio, asset, liability and 
risk management, liquidity, litigation and finance, 
compliance and reputational issues. The agenda and 
supporting papers are distributed in advance of all 
Board and committee meetings to allow time for 
appropriate review and to facilitate full discussion at 
the meetings. All Directors have full and timely 
access to all relevant information and may take 
independent professional advice if necessary.  
The Directors have free and open contact with 
management at all levels. Group Managing Directors 
and Group General Managers meet informally with 
Directors after Board meetings. Board offsite visits 
are made each year to enable Directors to see at first 
hand the business operations in local environments 
and to meet management, employees and customers. 
Full, formal and tailored induction programmes, 
with particular emphasis on the systems of risk 
management and internal controls, are arranged by 
the Group Company Secretary for newly appointed 
Directors. The programmes consist of a series of 
meetings with other Directors and senior executives 
to enable new Directors to receive information and 
familiarise themselves with our strategy, risk 
appetite, operations and internal controls. As part of 
the induction process the Group Company Secretary 
will coordinate the production of a development 
programme based on the individual Director’s needs. 
Directors receive comprehensive guidance on the 
duties and liabilities of a Director of HSBC Holdings 
before appointment and opportunities to update and 
develop their skills and knowledge, through 
externally run seminars and briefings by senior 
executives, throughout their directorship.  
Induction programmes are also arranged for 
newly appointed members of committees and 
appropriate training is provided on an ongoing basis. 
A personalised approach to training and 
development of Directors is applied. Development 
plans and records of development activities are 
maintained by the Group Company Secretary for 
annual review by the Group Chairman with the 
Director concerned. The Group Company Secretary 
coordinates the delivery of any training required. 
Focused in-house development programmes to 
enhance business awareness are arranged in 
conjunction with scheduled Board Meetings. 
Directors have access online to internal training and 
development resources. 
Non-executive Directors have an open invitation 
to attend meetings of the GMB to further enhance 
their understanding and awareness of our businesses 
and the senior leadership team. 
Performance evaluation 
In November 2010, Oliver Wyman was 
commissioned to review and report on the 
effectiveness of the Board and its principal 
committees with a particular focus on risk 
management and governance responsibilities. Oliver  193
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Wyman’s report was prepared following interviews 
with Directors and senior members of management 
and a review of relevant documents. Factors assessed 
during Oliver Wyman’s review included experience 
and skills of individual Directors, breadth and mix of 
skills and expertise across the Board and its 
committees, decision making processes, group 
culture and dynamics and interaction between the 
Board and the executive.  
The Oliver Wyman report concluded that the 
Board operates effectively with a number of 
important strengths. The report identified some areas 
where effectiveness could be enhanced.  
The report was used by the Board in its annual 
evaluation of its own performance and the 
performance of its committees and individual 
Directors. The Board will monitor implementation of 
actions to address issues arising from its 2010 
performance evaluation. All actions arising from the 
Board’s 2009 performance evaluation have been 
implemented. 
It is the intention of the Board to continue to 
undertake an evaluation of its performance and that 
of its committees and individual Directors annually, 
with external input to the process at least every third 
year.  
Formal evaluation of the individual performance 
of each Director is undertaken annually by the 
Chairman using the findings of the performance 
evaluation process undertaken by the Board. The 
Group Chairman has confirmed that all of the non-
executive Directors continue to perform effectively 
and to demonstrate commitment to their roles.  
The non-executive Directors, led by the senior 
independent non-executive Director, are responsible 
for the evaluation of the performance of the Group 
Chairman.  
Oliver Wyman has provided and continues to 
provide strategic consultancy services to the Group. 
Appointment, retirement and re-election of 
Directors 
The Board may at any time appoint any person who 
is willing to act as a Director, either to fill a vacancy 
or as an addition to the existing Board, but the total 
number of Directors shall not exceed twenty-five. 
Any Director so appointed by the Board shall retire 
at the Annual General Meeting following his or her 
appointment and shall be eligible for re-election but 
is not taken into account in determining the number 
of Directors who are to retire by rotation at such 
meeting. The Board may appoint any Director to 
hold any employment or executive office and may 
revoke or terminate any such appointment. 
Shareholders may, by ordinary resolution, appoint a 
person as a Director or remove any Director before 
the expiration of his period of office. On the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee and 
in compliance with provision B.7.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which replaces the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance for 
financial years beginning on or after 29 June 2010, 
the Board has decided that all of the Directors should 
be subject to annual re-election by shareholders. 
Accordingly, all of the Directors will retire at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and with the 
exception of V H C Cheng, who is to retire, offer 
themselves for re-election. All the executive 
Directors are employed on rolling contracts which 
require 12 months’ notice to be given by either party. 
None of the non-executive Directors has a service 
contract with HSBC. 
Brief biographical particulars of all Directors 
are given on pages 183 to 187. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Board ensures all Directors develop an 
understanding of the views of major shareholders. 
Non-executive Directors are invited to attend analyst 
presentations and other meetings with institutional 
investors and their representative bodies. Directors 
also meet representatives of institutional 
shareholders annually to discuss corporate 
governance matters.  
All executive Directors and other senior 
executives hold regular meetings with institutional 
investors and report to the Board on those meetings. 
Our corporate brokers give bi-annual presentations 
to the Board on market views and investor relations. 
The Board receives a regular Investor Relations 
activity report which provides feedback from 
institutional shareholders and brokers, analysts’ 
forecasts, information from research reports and 
share price performance data.  
During 2010, Sir Simon Robertson, Deputy 
Chairman and senior independent non-executive 
Director, J L Thornton and other non-executive 
Directors met and corresponded with institutional 
investors and their representatives to discuss 
strategy, remuneration policy, succession and 
governance. As senior independent non-executive 
Director, Sir Simon Robertson is available 
to shareholders should they have concerns which 
contact through the normal channels of Group 
Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director or other executives has failed to resolve or 
for which such contact would be inappropriate. He HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

may be contacted through the Group Company 
Secretary at 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ.
Conflicts of interest, indemnification of 
Directors, relevant audit information and 
contracts of significance 
The Board has authority to approve Directors’ 
conflicts and potential conflicts of interest and 
has adopted a policy and procedures for the 
determination of terms of authorisation for such 
situations. The Board’s powers to authorise conflicts 
are operating effectively and the procedures are 
being followed. A review of situational conflicts 
which have been authorised from time to time and 
the terms of those authorisations is undertaken by the 
Board annually.
Our Articles of Association provide that 
Directors are entitled to be indemnified out of the 
assets of HSBC Holdings against claims from third 
parties in respect of certain liabilities arising in 
connection with the performance of their functions 
pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. Such indemnity provisions have been in place 
during the financial year but have not been utilised 
by the Directors.  
Each person who is a Director at the date of 
approval of this report confirms that so far as he or 
she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the auditor is unaware and the Director has 
taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information. This confirmation is given pursuant to 
section 418 of the Companies Act 2006 and should 
be interpreted in accordance therewith and subject to 
the provisions thereof. 
None of the Directors had, during the year or at 
the end of the year, a material interest, directly or 
indirectly, in any contract of significance with any 
HSBC company. 
Corporate governance codes  
We are committed to high standards of corporate 
governance. We have complied throughout the year 
with the applicable code provisions of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council, save for code provision 
A.2.2 as D J Flint, who had previously served as 
Chief Financial Officer, Executive Director, Risk 
and Regulation, did not meet the independence 
criteria of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance when he was appointed Group 
Chairman on 3 December 2010. The Board’s 
explanation of its decision to appoint D J Flint is set 
out on page 191. We have complied throughout the 
year with all applicable code provisions of the Code 
on Corporate Governance Practices in Appendix 14 
to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on 
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance is 
available at www.frc.org.uk and the Code on 
Corporate Governance Practices is available at 
www.hkex.com.hk. 
The Board has adopted a code of conduct for 
transactions in HSBC Group securities by Directors. 
The code of conduct complies with The Model Code 
in the Listing Rules of the FSA and with The Model 
Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of 
Listed Issuers (‘Hong Kong Model Code’) set out in 
the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The 
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, save that 
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited has 
granted certain waivers from strict compliance with 
the Hong Kong Model Code. The waivers granted 
by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited 
primarily take into account accepted practices in the 
UK, particularly in respect of employee share plans. 
Following a specific enquiry, each Director has 
confirmed he or she has complied with the code of 
conduct for transactions in HSBC Group securities 
throughout the year.  
Board committees 
The Board has appointed a number of committees 
consisting of certain Directors, Group Managing 
Directors and, in the case of the Corporate 
Sustainability Committee, certain co-opted non-
director members. Information in relation to the 
principal committees is set out below:  
Group Management Board 
The GMB, an executive management committee, 
meets frequently and operates as a general 
management committee under the direct authority 
of the Board. The objective of the GMB is to 
maintain a reporting and control structure whereby 
all of our line operations are accountable to 
individual members of the GMB who report to the 
Group Chief Executive who in turn reports to the 
Group Chairman. The Board has set objectives and 
measures for the GMB. These align senior 
executives’ objectives and measures with the 
strategy and operating plans throughout HSBC.  
The members of the GMB are S T Gulliver 
(Chairman), A A Flockhart and I J Mackay, who are 
executive Directors, and A Almeida, E Alonso, 
S Assaf, N S K Booker, A M Keir, M M Moses,  195
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
B Robertson, P A Thurston and P T S Wong, all of 
whom are Group Managing Directors.  
The GMB exercises the powers, authorities and 
discretions of the Board in so far as they concern the 
management and day-to-day running of HSBC 
Holdings. Matters reserved for approval by the 
Board are described on page 189. 
The Group Chief Executive reports to each 
meeting of the Board on the activities of the GMB.  
Group Audit Committee 
The Report of the Group Audit Committee is set out 
below.
Role and membership of the Group Audit 
Committee
The Group Audit Committee (‘GAC’), whose 
members are all independent non-executive 
Directors, is responsible for advising the Board on 
the effectiveness of our systems of internal controls 
and compliance in relation to financial matters and 
on meeting financial reporting obligations. The 
GAC also has responsibilities in relation to risk 
governance and oversight and internal controls. 
The members of the Committee throughout 
2010 were J D Coombe (Chairman), R A Fairhead 
and J R Lomax. On 1 March 2010, M K T Cheung 
was appointed a member of the Committee in 
succession to J W J Hughes-Hallett. On 30 July 
2010, J D Coombe was appointed chairman of the 
Committee in succession to R A Fairhead who 
remains a member of the Committee.  
Appointments to the Committee are made for 
periods of up to three years, extendable by no more 
than two additional three-year periods, so long as 
members continue to be independent.  
The Board has determined that M K T Cheung, 
J D Coombe, R A Fairhead and J R Lomax are 
independent according to SEC criteria and may be 
regarded as audit committee financial experts for the 
purposes of section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
and have recent and relevant financial experience.  
The terms of reference of the Committee, 
which are reviewed annually, are available at 
www.hsbc.com/boardcommittees.  
To ensure consistency of scope and approach by 
subsidiary company audit committees, the GAC has 
established core terms of reference to guide 
subsidiary companies when adopting terms of 
reference for their audit committees. The 
Committee’s endorsement is required for any 
proposed changes to subsidiary audit committee 
terms of reference and for appointments to such 
committees. The chairmen of our principal 
subsidiary audit committees attended a forum in 
November 2010 led by the chairman of the GAC to 
ensure a common understanding and approach to the 
way in which subsidiary audit committees operate 
throughout the Group; understand and share the key 
issues we face as an organisation and as audit 
committee members; and discuss current market 
conditions and the lessons to be learned from the 
financial crisis. 
Historically the GAC has provided non-
executive oversight of risk as well as financial 
reporting. The Group Risk Committee (‘GRC’) 
was established in February 2010 to focus on risk 
governance and to provide an increasingly forward-
looking view of risks and their mitigation. The GAC 
currently has certain responsibilities in relation to 
risk governance and oversight of internal controls in 
order to comply with the Hong Kong and UK 
Corporate Governance Codes. 
There is therefore currently a degree of overlap 
between the responsibilities of the GAC and the 
GRC in relation to risk matters. For example, a 
review of the effectiveness of our systems of risk 
management and internal controls was undertaken by 
the GAC and by the GRC. Each of the committees is 
reviewing its terms of reference with the aim of 
minimising the overlap.  
The governance structure for the oversight of 
our financial reporting and governance is set out 
below: HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Committee’s activities 
The Committee held six meetings in 2010 – see 
page 190 for details of Directors’ attendance at these 
meetings. Following each meeting the Committee 
reports to the Board on its activities.  
The Committee undertook the following 
activities in the discharge of its responsibilities: 
• the Committee satisfied itself that the system of 
internal control and compliance over financial 
reporting was effective through regular reports 
from the Group Finance Director, the Group 
Chief Accounting Officer, and the Group Head 
of Internal Audit; presentations from other 
functional and business heads on the financial 
control framework; review of minutes of 
meetings of the GMB, the GRC, Risk 
Management Meetings, the Group Reputational 
Risk Committee and the Disclosure Committee; 
reports on US compliance; and through the 
processes described in more detail on page 202 
in relation to internal controls. The Committee 
also reviewed the adequacy of resources,

Some of the activities of the GRC described on 
page 200 were carried out by the GAC prior to the 
establishment of the GRC in February 2010. Since 
February 2010 some of those activities are carried 
out by the GRC and the GAC. The description of 
these activities is not repeated in the list above.  
Arrangements relating to the external 
auditor
The Committee has recommended to the Board that 
KPMG Audit Plc be reappointed auditor at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
An analysis of the remuneration paid in respect 
of audit and non-audit services provided by KPMG 
Audit Plc and its affiliates (‘KPMG’) for each of the 
past three years is disclosed in Note 8 on the 
Financial Statements.  
The Board has approved, on the 
recommendation of the Committee, a policy for the 
employment by us of former employees of KPMG 
and an annual report is received by the Committee 
on such former employees who are employed by us 
and the number of such former employees who are 
employed by us in senior positions. This report 
enables the Committee to consider whether there has 
been any impairment, or appearance of impairment, 
of the auditor’s judgement or independence in 
respect of the audit.  
The policies for the pre-approval of specific 
services that may be provided by the principal 
auditor are kept under review by the Committee and 
amended as necessary to meet the dual objectives of 
ensuring that we benefit in a cost effective manner 
from the cumulative knowledge and experience of 
our auditor, while also ensuring that our auditor 
maintains the necessary degree of independence and 
objectivity. These pre-approval policies apply to all 
services where any HSBC company pays for the 
service, or is a beneficiary or addressee of the 
service and has selected or influenced the choice of 
KPMG. All services provided by KPMG during 2010 
were pre-approved by the Committee or were 
entered into under pre-approval policies established 
by the Committee.  
The pre-approved services relate to regulatory 
reviews, agreed-upon procedures reports, other types 
of attestation reports, the provision of advice and 
other non-audit services allowed under SEC 
independence rules. They fall into the categories of 
audit services, audit-related services, tax services 
and other services. 
Group Risk Committee 
The Report of the Group Risk Committee is set out 
below.
Role and membership of the Group Risk 
Committee
The GRC, whose members are all independent non-
executive Directors, is responsible for advising the 
Board on material risk matters and providing non-
executive oversight of risk. The Committee was 
established in February 2010 following publication 
of the final recommendations of Sir David Walker’s 
Review of Corporate Governance in UK Banks and 
other Financial Industry Entities, to focus on risk 
governance and to provide an increasingly forward-
looking view of risks and their mitigation.  
Historically the GAC has provided non-
executive oversight of risk as well as financial 
reporting. As noted in the section headed ‘Group 
Audit Committee’ above there is currently a degree 
of overlap between responsibilities of the GAC and 
the GRC in relation to risk governance and oversight 
matters and internal controls. Each committee is 
reviewing its terms of reference with the aim of 
minimising the overlap.  
The members of the GRC are R A Fairhead 
(Chairman), J D Coombe, J W J Hughes-Hallett 
and J R Lomax. 
The Committee's terms of reference, which are 
reviewed annually, are available at 
www.hsbc.com/boardcommittees.  
To ensure consistency of scope and approach by 
subsidiary company committees, the GRC has 
established core terms of reference to guide 
subsidiary companies when adopting terms of 
reference for their risk committees (or their audit 
committees if those committees are also responsible 
for risk oversight). The Committee’s endorsement is 
required for any proposed changes to the terms of 
reference of any subsidiary committee relating to 
risk oversight and for appointments to such 
committees.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Governance (continued) 
Board committees > Group Risk Committee  
198
The chairmen of committees of principal 
subsidiaries with responsibility for oversight of risk 
attended the forum referred to on page 195. One of 
the purposes of the forum was to ensure a common 
understanding and approach to the way in which 
subsidiary committees operate in relation to risk 
oversight throughout the Group; to understand and 
share the key risk issues we face as an organisation 
and the issues faced by members of committees 
responsible for oversight of risk; and to discuss the 
lessons to be learned from the financial crisis. 
Risk governance 
All of HSBC’s activities involve, to varying degrees, 
the measurement, evaluation, acceptance and 
management of risk or combinations of risks. The 
Board, advised by the Committee, ensures that the 
Group has a strong risk governance culture which 
shapes the Group’s risk strategy. The Board and the 
Committee ensure that a strong risk management 
framework is maintained, via the continuous 
monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated 
evaluation of risks and their interactions. 
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the 
Group’s risk governance structure and monitoring 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems. The Committee 
monitors top and emerging risks and reviews the 
outcome of internal and external stress tests. 
In carrying out its responsibilities the 
Committee is closely supported by the Group Chief 
Risk Officer, who ensures that top and emerging 
risks are reported to and considered by the 
Committee. The Committee receives regular 
presentations from the Group Head of Internal Audit 
and other business, function and risk heads on risks 
within their respective areas of responsibility and 
regular reports from the Risk Management Meeting 
of the GMB, which is the executive body responsible 
for overseeing risk. 
The governance structure for the management of 
risk at HSBC is set out below. Appropriate 
governance arrangements are in place in regional 
and operating subsidiaries. 
Authority Membership Responsibilities 
The Board Executive and non-executive Directors • Approves risk appetite, plans and performance targets for 
the Group 
• Appoints senior risk officers 
• Delegates authorities for risk management 
The GRC Independent non-executive Directors • Advises the Board on: 
– risk appetite, tolerance and strategy; 
– stress testing; 
– systems of risk management, internal control and 
compliance used to identify, measure, monitor, control 
and report risks; 
– the alignment of the Board’s risk appetite with strategy 
and reward; and 
– the maintenance and development of a supportive 
culture in relation to the management of risk.

Risk appetite 
Risk appetite is central to HSBC’s management of 
risk. The Board, advised by the GRC, approves the 
Group’s risk appetite which describes the types and 
levels of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in 
executing our strategy. Our risk appetite is 
underpinned by the following core characteristics:  199
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Risk appetite: core characteristics 
• Strong balance sheet 
• Strong brand 
• Healthy capital position 
• Conservative liquidity management 
• Risk must be commensurate with returns 
• Robust Group structure of separate legal entities  
• The customer group and global product mix should produce sustainable long term earnings growth 
• Risk diversification 
The GRC monitors the Group’s risk appetite and 
satisfies itself that executive management has taken 
account of the future macroeconomic and financial 
environment in identifying top and emerging risks. 
From the core characteristics of the Group’s risk 
appetite (see table above), our strategic and 
operational objectives are determined which are 
consistent with the Group’s risk appetite. These 
objectives are summarised in the table below:
Strategic and operational objectives 
Earnings 
  1. Generate sustainable economic profit commensurate with the risks taken 
  2. Maintain capital in excess of regulatory requirements and a long term debt rating of AA 
  3. Maintain a strong tier 1 ratio comprising a high proportion of core tier 1 
  4. Maintain a well diversified funding structure with a particular focus on advances to core funding ratios  
Capital and liquidity 
  5. Off balance sheet vehicles should not be material in size relative to the total balance sheet 
Impairments and 
expected losses 
  6. Manage impairments and expected losses within the Group’s tolerance 
  7. Manage all risk categories within the risk appetite 
  8. Harness benefits from business diversification to generate non-volatile and sustainable earnings 
Risk category and 
diversification 
  9. Compete for business with international customers where market connectivity is critical; businesses with 
local customers where we have local scale, and products where global scale is critical to effectiveness 
Scenario and stress 
testing
10. Use robust and appropriate scenario stress testing to assess the potential impact on the Group’s capital 
adequacy and strategic plans 
Top and emerging risks 
Identifying and monitoring top and emerging risks is 
integral to HSBC’s approach to risk management. 
We define a ‘top risk’ as being a current, visible risk 
which has the potential to have a material impact on 
our financial results, reputation or the sustainability 
of our long-term business model. An ‘emerging risk’ 
is one which has large unknown components which, 
if they were to crystallise, could have material 
impact on our long-term strategy. 
Current top and emerging risks are viewed as 
falling under four broad categories: challenges to 
business operations; challenges to governance and 
internal control; macro-economic and geo-political; 
and macro-prudential and regulatory. These are 
summarised below: 
Categories / definitions Top and emerging risks
Challenges to our business operations  
• Challenges to our operating model in an economic downturn (in developed 
economies) and rapid growth (in emerging markets) 
• Internet crime and fraud 
Challenges to our governance and internal control 
systems 
• Operational complexity associated with high levels of change 
• Information security risk 
Macro-economic and geo-political risk 
• Potential emerging markets asset bubble 
• Increased geo-political risk in the Middle East, with possible contagion 
Macro-prudential and regulatory risks to our business 
model 
• Regulatory change impacting business model and Group profitability 
• Regulatory requirements affecting conduct of business   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Governance (continued) 
Board committees > Group Risk Committee / Remuneration Committee / Nomination Committee

Stress testing 
HSBC’s scenario analysis and stress testing 
programme is central to the identification and 
monitoring of top and emerging risks. It highlights 
the vulnerabilities of our business and capital plans 
to the adverse effects of extreme but plausible 
events. The GRC reviews the outcome of the stress 
tests performed. 
There are three main classifications of scenario 
and stress tests: regulatory scenarios; Group level 
business scenarios; and local business scenarios. The 
GRC uses the outcome of the programme to assess 
the potential impact of the relevant scenarios on the 
demand for regulatory capital compared with its 
supply. Management develops action plans to 
mitigate the risks identified. The extent to which 
those action plans are implemented depends on 
management’s evaluation of the risks and their 
potential consequences, taking into account HSBC’s 
risk appetite. 
Committee activities  
The Committee held four meetings in 2010 – see 
page 190 for details of Directors’ attendance. 
Following each meeting the Committee reports to 
the Board on its activities. 
John Trueman, a non-executive director of 
HSBC Bank plc and chairman of its risk and audit 
committees has been invited by the Committee to 
attend its meetings. His experience of risk related 
matters in the financial services industry is valued by 
the Committee.  
The GRC undertook the following key activities 
in the discharge of its responsibilities:
• the Committee provided oversight of executive 
risk management through regular reports from 
the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Risk 
Management Meeting of the GMB; review of 
minutes of meetings of the GMB, the Risk 
Management Meeting, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Group Reputational Risk 
Committee; reports from the Group General 
Counsel on substantial litigation; a report from 
the Remuneration Committee on risk related 
matters; and updates on the Swiss data theft 
referred to on page 83. The Group Finance 
Director and the Group Chief Accounting 
Officer regularly attended committee meetings 
and other senior financial, risk, internal audit, 
legal and compliance executives attended as 
appropriate;
• the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of 
internal controls through a cycle of 
presentations from the Group Chief Risk Officer 
and other business and functional heads on the 
risk control framework; reports from the Group 
Head of Internal Audit on the internal audit 
process and weaknesses identified in internal 
controls and reports of the external auditor and 
regulators relating to the internal control system; 
updates from the Group Head of Compliance; 
and reports from the Group General Counsel 
and other senior executives on US compliance 
matters. The Committee undertook an annual 
review of the effectiveness of HSBC’s system of 
internal control, which is described on page 202. 
The Committee had regular dialogue with the 
external auditor and the Group Head of Internal 
Audit, with opportunities at each meeting for 
dialogue to take place without management 
present;
• the Committee considered the Group’s risk 
appetite and the alignment of strategy with risk 
appetite through reviewing the Group’s risk 
appetite statement and reports on liquidity and 
capital management; receiving reports from the 
Chief Risk Officer; and considering the 
outcomes of the scenario and stress testing 
programme; 
• the Committee considered the alignment of 
reward structures with the Group’s risk appetite 
through a report from the Group Head of HR on 
procedures to be used when determining an 
individual’s variable pay award for the 2010 
performance period. These procedures include 
making assessments of the profitability of the 
business area in which an individual works and 
the performance of that business area when 
compared to the approved risk appetite in 
respect of that business. The performance of the 
individual is also assessed taking into account 
the extent to which that individual has adhered 
to the Group’s policies and procedures for risk 
related matters and has achieved specified 
performance targets or objectives (such as a 
revenue or profit target). These procedures were 
considered by the Remuneration Committee in 
early 2011. An update was also provided on a 
review of variable pay plans throughout the 
Group;
• in monitoring top and emerging risks the 
Committee satisfied itself that it understood 
and took into account the views of senior 
management; reviewed minutes of executive 
committee meetings including meetings of the 
GMB, the Risk Management Meeting and 
Group Reputational Risk Committee; received 
reports from the Group Chief Risk Officer and  201
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
the Group Head of Compliance as well as other 
members of senior management on 
developments in the Group’s business; and 
received regular presentations on global market 
risk and liquidity and the impact of the 
tightening of liquidity in the money markets;  
• the Committee considered risk issues relating to 
a proposed strategic acquisition and discussed a 
report from the Group Head of Mergers and 
Acquisitions and other members of senior 
management involved in the proposed 
acquisition; and  
• the Committee undertook a review of its terms 
of reference and its effectiveness.  
External advice on US-related compliance 
matters was provided to the GRC by US law firm 
Cahill Gordon & Reindel and by Promontory 
Financial Group, US financial consultants.  
Some of the activities referred to above were 
carried out by the GAC prior to the establishment of 
the GRC in February 2010. Since February 2010 
some of those activities are carried out by the GRC 
and the GAC. 
Remuneration Committee 
The role of the Remuneration Committee and its 
membership are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 222. 
Nomination Committee 
Role and membership of the Nomination 
Committee
The Nomination Committee is responsible for 
leading the process for Board appointments and for 
identifying and nominating, for approval by the 
Board, candidates for appointment to the Board. 
Before recommending an appointment to the Board, 
the Committee evaluates the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board and, in the 
light of this, and taking into account the needs of the 
Group’s businesses, identifies the role and 
capabilities required for a particular appointment. 
Candidates are considered on merit against these 
criteria. Care is taken to ensure that appointees have 
enough time to devote to us. Prospective Directors 
are asked to identify any significant other 
commitments and confirm they have sufficient time 
to discharge what is expected of them.  
The members of the Nomination Committee 
throughout 2010 were Sir Brian Williamson, 
R A Fairhead, Sir Simon Robertson and 
J W J Hughes-Hallett, all independent non-executive 
Directors. Lord Green succeeded Sir Brian 
Williamson as chairman of the Nomination 
Committee on 26 February 2010 and served until 
his retirement on 3 December 2010 when he was 
succeeded by D J Flint, upon his appointment as 
Group Chairman. Lord Green did not chair any 
meeting of the Nomination Committee when it was 
dealing with the appointment of the successor to 
the chairmanship. The selection process for Lord 
Green’s successor as Group Chairman, was led by 
the senior independent non-executive Director.  
The terms of reference of the Committee, 
which are reviewed annually, are available at 
www.hsbc.com/boardcommittees.  
The appointments of D J Flint as Group 
Chairman, S T Gulliver as Group Chief Executive 
and I J Mackay as an executive Director were made 
on the advice and recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee. An external consultancy 
was used in connection with the appointments. 
Committee activities 
The Committee held three meetings in 2010 – see 
page 190 for details of Directors’ attendance at these 
meetings. Following each meeting the Committee 
reports to the Board on its activities. 
The Committee undertook the following key 
activities in the discharge of its responsibilities:
• under the chairmanship of the senior 
independent non-executive Director, the 
Committee led the succession process for 
the Group Chairman and the Group Chief 
Executive. The process is described on 
page 191; 
• the Committee leads the process for Board 
appointments, with the support of external 
consultants as appropriate, and has satisfied 
itself that appropriate plans are in place for 
orderly succession to the Board reflecting an 
appropriate balance of skills and experience 
on the Board;
• the Committee maintains a forward-looking 
schedule of potential candidates for appointment 
to the Board that takes into account the needs 
and developments of the Group’s businesses and 
the anticipated retirement dates of current 
Directors. On the recommendation of the 
Committee, the Board has appointed L M L Cha 
as a non-executive Director with effect from 
1 March 2011; 
• the Committee monitored the size, structure and 
composition of the Board through consideration  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

of the skills, knowledge and experience required 
of the Board and the skills, knowledge and 
experience of the current Directors. The 
Committee reviewed the time commitment 
required from non-executive Directors taking 
into account the recommendations of Sir David 
Walker’s review of corporate governance
relating to board and board committee matters 
and made appropriate recommendations to the 
Board. The Committee considered the 
re-election of Directors at the annual general 
meeting and on the recommendation of the 
Committee, the Board has decided that all 
Directors should be subject to re-election by 
shareholders in 2011;  
• the Committee provided oversight of other 
matters relating to directors including 
considering a proposed appointment of a 
Director to an external body and discussing and 
providing guidance on FSA interactions; and 
• the Committee undertook a review of its terms 
of reference. The effectiveness of the 
Committee was reviewed as part of the Board’s 
performance evaluation.  
Corporate Sustainability Committee 
The role of the Corporate Sustainability Committee 
and its membership are set out on page 213. 
Internal control 
The Directors are responsible for internal control 
in HSBC and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
Procedures have been designed for safeguarding 
assets against unauthorised use or disposition; for 
maintaining proper accounting records; and for the 
reliability and usefulness of financial information 
used within the business or for publication. Such 
procedures are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement, 
errors, losses or fraud. The procedures also enable 
HSBC Holdings to discharge its obligations under 
the Handbook of Rules and Guidance issued by the 
FSA, HSBC’s lead regulator. 
The key procedures that the Directors have 
established are designed to provide effective internal 
control within HSBC and accord with the Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council. Such procedures 
for the ongoing identification, evaluation and 
management of the significant risks faced by HSBC 
have been in place throughout the year and up to 
28 February 2011, the date of approval of the Annual
Report and Accounts 2010. In the case of companies 
acquired during the year, the internal controls in 
place are being reviewed against HSBC’s 
benchmarks and integrated into HSBC’s processes. 
Key internal control procedures include the 
following:
• authority to operate the various subsidiaries and 
responsibilities for financial performance 
against plans and for capital expenditure are 
delegated to their respective chief executive 
officers within limits set by the Board. 
Delegation of authority from the Board to 
individuals requires those individuals to 
maintain a clear and appropriate apportionment 
of significant responsibilities and to oversee the 
establishment and maintenance of systems of 
control appropriate to the business. The 
appointment of executives to the most senior 
positions within HSBC requires the approval of 
the Board;
• functional, operating, financial reporting and 
certain management reporting standards are 
established by GMO management committees, 
for application across the whole of HSBC. 
These are supplemented by operating standards 
set by functional and local management as 
required for the type of business and 
geographical location of each subsidiary; 
• systems and procedures are in place in HSBC to 
identify, control and report on the major risks 
including credit, market, liquidity and 
operational risk (including accounting, tax, 
legal, compliance, fiduciary, information, 
physical security, business continuity, fraud, 
systems and people risk). Exposure to these 
risks is monitored by risk management 
committees, asset and liability committees and 
executive committees in subsidiaries and, for 
HSBC as a whole, by the GMB. A Risk 
Management Meeting of the GMB, chaired by 
the Group Chief Risk Officer, is held in each 
month (except August) to address asset, liability 
and risk management issues. The minutes of this 
meeting are submitted to the GAC, the GRC and 
the Board;
• the Global Operational Risk and Control 
Committee (‘GORCC’), which reports to 
the Risk Management Meeting of the GMB, 
meets at least quarterly to monitor HSBC’s 
operational risk profile and review the effective 
implementation of the Group’s operational risk 
management framework. The GORCC receives 
quarterly reports on the Group’s operational risk  203
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
profile, including top risks, control issues, 
internal and external operational loss events and 
key risk indicators. The GORCC communicates 
the lessons learned from operational events both 
within HSBC and in the wider industry; 
• a Disclosure Committee has been established to 
review material public disclosures made by 
HSBC Holdings for any material errors, 
misstatements or omissions. The membership of 
the Disclosure Committee, which is chaired by 
the Group Company Secretary, includes the 
heads of the Finance, Legal, Risk, Compliance, 
Corporate Communications, Investor Relations 
and Internal Audit functions and representatives 
from the principal regions, customer groups and 
global businesses. The integrity of disclosures is 
underpinned by structures and processes within 
the Finance and Risk functions that support 
expert and rigorous analytical review of 
financial reporting; 
• the group financial reporting process for 
preparing the consolidated Annual Report and 
Accounts 2010 is controlled using documented 
accounting policies and reporting formats, 
supported by a chart of accounts with detailed 
instructions and guidance on reporting 
requirements, issued by Group Finance to all 
reporting entities within the Group in advance of 
each reporting period end. The submission of 
financial information from each reporting entity 
to Group Finance is subject to certification by 
the responsible financial officer, and analytical 
review procedures at reporting entity and Group 
levels;
• processes are in place to identify new risks from 
changes in market conditions/practices or 
customer behaviours, which could expose 
HSBC to heightened risk of loss or reputational 
damage. During 2010, attention was focused on 
refinement and operation of the stress testing 
framework; the roll-out of enhanced 
counterparty risk aggregation, risk management 
information, portfolio and crisis management 
processes; the mitigation of information risks; 
enhancement of policies and practices relevant 
to the prevention of financial crimes; and 
changes in the regulation of and public policy 
towards the financial services industry. From 
January 2011, risk review and audit functions 
have increased their focus on global thematic 
risks;  
• periodic strategic plans are prepared for key 
customer groups, global product groups, support 
functions and certain geographies within the 
framework of the Group Strategic Plan. Rolling 
operating plans, informed by detailed analysis of 
risk appetite describing the types and quantum 
of risk that HSBC is prepared to take in 
executing its strategy, are prepared and adopted 
by all major HSBC operating companies and set 
out the key business initiatives and the likely 
financial effects of those initiatives; 
• governance arrangements are in place to provide 
oversight of, and advice to the Board on, 
material risk-related matters including assurance 
that risk analytical models are fit for purpose, 
used accordingly and complemented by both 
model-specific and enterprise-wide stress tests 
that evaluate the impact of severe yet plausible 
events and other unusual circumstances not fully 
captured by quantitative models; 
• centralised functional control is exercised over 
all IT developments and operations. Common 
systems are employed for similar business 
processes wherever practicable. Credit and 
market risks are measured and reported on in 
subsidiaries and aggregated for review of risk 
concentrations on a Group-wide basis; 
• functional management in GMO is responsible 
for setting policies, procedures and standards for 
the following risks: credit; market; liquidity; 
operations; IT; fraud; business continuity; 
security; information; insurance; accounting; 
tax; legal; regulatory compliance; fiduciary; 
human resources; reputational; sustainability; 
residual value; shariah and strategic risks. 
Authorities to enter into credit and market risk 
exposures are delegated with limits to line 
management of Group companies. The 
concurrence of GMO is required, however, to 
credit proposals with specified higher risk 
characteristics; 
• policies to guide subsidiary companies and 
management at all levels in the conduct of 
business to safeguard the Group’s reputation are 
established by the Board and the GMB, 
subsidiary company boards, Board committees 
and senior management. Reputational risks can 
arise from environmental, social or governance 
issues, or as a consequence of operational risk 
events. As a banking group, HSBC’s good 
reputation depends upon the way in which it 
conducts its business but it can also be affected 
by the way in which clients, to which it provides 
financial services, conduct their business or use 
financial products and services;

primarily the responsibility of business 
management. The Internal Audit function, 
which is centrally controlled, monitors the 
effectiveness of internal control structuresacross 
the whole of HSBC focusing on the areas of 
greatest risk to HSBC as determined by a risk-
based grading approach. The head of this 
function reports to the Group Chairman, the 
Group Chief Executive, the GRC and the GAC; 
and
• executive management is responsible for 
ensuring that recommendations made by the 
Internal Audit function are implemented within 
an appropriate and agreed timetable. 
Confirmation to this effect must be provided to 
Internal Audit. Executive management must also 
confirm annually as part of the Internal Audit 
process that offices under their control have 
taken, or are in the process of taking, the 
appropriate actions to deal with all significant 
recommendations made by external auditors in 
management letters or by regulators following 
regulatory inspections. 
Historically the GAC has provided oversight of 
internal controls and risk as well as oversight of 
financial reporting. Currently there is a degree of 
overlap between the responsibilities of the GAC and 
the GRC in relation to internal controls and risk 
governance. Each committee is reviewing its terms 
of reference with the aim of minimising the overlap.  
The GRC and the GAC have kept under review 
the effectiveness of this system of internal control 
and have reported regularly to the Board. The key 
processes used by the GRC and the GAC in carrying 
out their reviews include: regular business and 
operational risk assessments; regular reports from 
the heads of key risk functions including Internal 
Audit and Compliance; the production annually of 
reviews of the internal control framework applied at 
GMO and major operating subsidiary levels 
measured against HSBC benchmarks, which cover 
all internal controls, both financial and non-
financial; semi-annual confirmations from chief 
executives of principal subsidiary companies as to 
whether there have been any material losses, 
contingencies or uncertainties caused by weaknesses 
in internal controls; internal audit reports; external 
audit reports; prudential reviews; and regulatory 
reports. The GRC and the GAC keep under review a 
risk map of the status of key risk areas which impact 
the Group and considers whether the mitigating 
actions put in place are appropriate. In addition, 
when unexpected losses have arisen or when 
incidents have occurred which indicate gaps in the 
control framework or in adherence to Group policies, 
the GRC and the GAC review special reports, 
prepared at the instigation of management, which 
analyse the cause of the issue, the lessons learned 
and the actions proposed by management to address 
the issue.  
The Directors, through the GRC and the GAC, 
have conducted an annual review of the effectiveness 
of HSBC’s system of internal control covering all 
material controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management 
systems and the adequacy of resources, 
qualifications and experience of staff of the issuer’s 
accounting and financial reporting function, and 
their training programmes and budget. The review 
does not extend to material joint ventures or 
associates. The GRC and the GAC have received 
confirmation that executive management has taken 
or is taking the necessary actions to remedy any 
failings or weaknesses identified through the 
operation of HSBC’s framework of controls. 
Going concern basis 
The Financial Statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis, as the Directors are satisfied that the 
Group and parent company have the resources to 
continue in business for the foreseeable future. In 
making this assessment, the Directors have considered 
a wide range of information relating to present and 
future conditions, including future projections of 
profitability, cash flows and capital resources. Further 
information relevant to the assessment is provided 
elsewhere in this Report. In particular, HSBC’s 
principal activities, strategic direction and challenges 
and uncertainties are described in the Operating and 
Financial Review; a financial summary, including a 
review of the consolidated income statement and 
consolidated balance sheet, is provided in the 
Operating and Financial Review and HSBC’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing credit, 
liquidity and market risk, and its approach to capital 
management and allocation, are described in the Risk 
section.

There have been no other changes in the share 
and loan capital interests of the Directors from 
31 December 2010 to the date of this Report. Any 
subsequent changes up to the last practicable date 
before the publication of the Notice of Annual
General Meeting will be set out in the notes to that 
Notice.
At 31 December 2010, Directors and Senior 
Management (being members of the Group 
Management Board) held, in aggregate, beneficial 
interests in 13,152,010 HSBC Holdings ordinary 
shares (0.07% of the issued ordinary shares). 
At 31 December 2010, executive Directors and 
Senior Management held, in aggregate, options to 
subscribe for 602,019 of HSBC Holdings ordinary 
shares under the HSBC Holdings savings-related 
share option plans, HSBC Holdings Group Share 
Option Plan and HSBC Finance: 1996 Long-Term 
Executive Incentive Compensation Plan. These 
options are exercisable between 2011 and 2015 at 
prices ranging from £3.3116 to £7.9606 and 
US$11.8824 to US$18.6226 per ordinary share. 
Employees 
At 31 December 2010, HSBC employed 307,000 
full-time and part-time employees worldwide, 
compared with 302,000 at 31 December 2009 and 
325,000 at 31 December 2008. The main centres of 
employment were the UK with approximately 
52,000 employees, India 34,000, Hong Kong 30,000, 
the US 27,000, Brazil 24,000, Mexico 20,000, 
mainland China 16,000 and France 11,000. 
Engaged employees are an important enabler of 
a high-performance culture. We encourage managers 
to foster open and honest communication and 
promote active employee involvement in decision 
making. Employment issues and the financial and 
economic factors affecting HSBC’s performance are 
regularly shared with our employees. An employee 
engagement target was included in the 2010 
performance objectives of senior managers. 
In 2010, we conducted our fourth Group-wide 
Global People Survey, which achieved a 
participation rate of 90%. The survey gives 
employees the opportunity to provide systematic 
feedback on their experience of HSBC and 
involvement in identifying actions to improve their 
experience. While employee engagement fell 3 
percentage points from 71% in 2009 to 68% in 2010, 
this was 6 percentage points higher than the external 
global average and 3 percentage points above the 
financial services sector average.  
Key themes emerging from the 2010 survey 
included the strength of our corporate sustainability 
effort; those who participate in corporate 
sustainability initiatives exhibit higher levels of 
engagement. The view that we have a diverse and 
fair culture has become stronger. Perceptions of 
organisational strategy and vision, reputation and 
Group Values all remain above global industry best 
in class. In 2011, we aim to improve personal 
development and strengthen relationships between 
employees and their direct managers by increasing 
employee involvement, recognising individual 
contribution and demonstrating specific behaviours 
which exemplify our Group Values. 
Our approach to reward is meritocratic and 
market competitive, is underpinned by an ethical 
performance culture and aligns the interests of our 
employees and shareholders. See Employee share 
plans on page 207. 
We negotiate with recognised unions. The five 
highest concentrations of union membership are in 
Argentina, Brazil, mainland China, Malta and 
Mexico. It is HSBC’s policy to maintain well-
developed communications and consultation 
programmes with unions and there have been no 
material disruptions to our operations from labour 
disputes during the past five years. 
Our deep roots in many geographical regions 
and an international mindset inform our perspective 
on diversity: ethnicity, age and gender diversity are 
areas of strategic focus. We remain committed to 
meritocracy, which requires a diverse and inclusive 
culture where employees believe that their views are 
heard, their concerns are attended to and they work 
in an environment where bias, discrimination and 
harassment are not tolerated and where advancement 
is based on objectivity. Our inclusive culture helps 
us to respond to our increasingly diverse global 
customer base, while creating and retaining a secure 
supply of skilled and committed employees. 
In 2010, we increased executive management 
sponsorship and responsibility for the promotion of 
inclusive working practices. Oversight of related 
activities resides with the Group Diversity 
Committee, supported by local People / Diversity 
Committees. 
The role of our Group Values in daily operating 
practice has taken on increased significance in the 
context of the global financial crisis with changes to 
regulatory policy, investor confidence and society’s 
view of the role of banks. 207
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Our Group Values comprise being: open to 
different ideas and cultures; connected with our 
customers, community and each other; dependable 
and doing the right thing. We have strengthened our 
values-led culture by embedding our Group Values 
into the Group’s operating standards, training, 
development and employee induction, and through 
the personal sponsorship of senior executives. These 
initiatives will continue in 2011. 
The development of talented employees in both 
developed and emerging markets is essential to the 
future strength of our business. We have therefore 
implemented a systematic approach to identifying 
and deploying talented people across the 
organisation in order to ensure an appropriate supply 
of high calibre individuals with the necessary skills, 
diversity and experience for current and future senior 
management positions.  
In 2010, we improved both the quality of 
training and the access that all employees have to 
relevant programmes through globally consistent 
technology. Specific areas covered were risk, 
compliance, customer orientation and performance 
management. 
Employment of disabled persons 
We believe in providing equal opportunities for all 
employees. The employment of disabled persons is 
included in this commitment and the recruitment, 
training, career development and promotion of 
disabled persons is based on the aptitudes and 
abilities of the individual. Should employees 
become disabled during their employment with us, 
efforts are made to continue their employment and, 
if necessary, appropriate training is provided. 
Remuneration policy 
As the quality and commitment of its human capital 
is deemed fundamental to our success, the Board’s 
stated strategy is to attract, retain and motivate the 
very best people. This strategy is referenced to the 
overall business strategy and the commercial 
environment. 
In a business that is based on trust and 
relationships, our broad policy is to recruit those 
who are committed to making a long-term career 
with the organisation since trust and relationships are 
built over time. 
Remuneration is an important component in an 
individual’s decision about which organisation to 
join and to stay with but, in our experience, it is not 
the overriding one. We seek to attract people who 
wish to work for an organisation with strong and 
sound values, one which is meritocratic and 
competitive, and which offers challenging career 
development. In line with the overall principles 
applied to executive Directors by the Remuneration 
Committee described on page 222: 
• employees’ salaries are reviewed annually in 
the context of business performance, market 
practice and internal relativities. Allowances and 
benefits are largely determined by local market 
practice;
• employees participate in various variable pay 
arrangements. Discretionary variable pay is 
dependent on the achievement of objectives 
which derive from those determined at Group 
level. Since 2008, these objectives have 
typically been categorised in four segments – 
financial, customer, process and people. 
Financial and non-financial metrics are used to 
measure performance against the objectives, 
which include profitability, expense control, 
customer recommendation, employee 
engagement, adherence to our ethical standards, 
lending guidelines and internal controls and 
procedures. From 2010, we have used a risk 
appetite framework which describes the 
quantum and types of risks that we are prepared 
to take in executing our strategy. The risk 
appetite framework is approved by the Board of 
HSBC Holdings and helps to ensure effective 
risk management is emphasised to maintain a 
strong and secure operating platform, and that 
influences employee remuneration. Actual levels 
of variable pay depend on the performance of 
the Group, its constituent businesses and the 
individual, taking into account competitive 
market practice and relevant regulator 
requirements; and 
• to ensure that our interests and those of our 
employees are aligned with those of our 
shareholders, that our approach to risk 
management supports the interests of all 
stakeholders and that remuneration is consistent 
with effective risk management, we require 
a proportion of variable pay awards above 
certain thresholds to be deferred into awards 
of Restricted Shares. In addition, employees are 
encouraged to participate in our savings-related 
share option plans and local share ownership 
arrangements. 
Employee share plans 
To help align the interests of employees with those 
of shareholders, share options are granted under all-
employee share plans and discretionary awards of  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Report of the Directors: Governance (continued) 
Employees > Employee share plans / Subsidiary company share plans

Performance Shares and Restricted Shares are made 
under the HSBC Share Plan. The following are 
particulars of outstanding employee share options, 
including those held by employees working 
under employment contracts that are regarded as 
‘continuous contracts’ for the purposes of the Hong 
Kong Employment Ordinance. The options were 
granted at nil consideration. No options have been 
granted to substantial shareholders, suppliers of 
goods or services, or in excess of the individual limit 
for each share plan. No options were cancelled by 
HSBC during the period. A summary for each 
scheme of the total number of the options which 
were awarded, exercised or lapsed during 2010 is 
shown in the tables below. Further details required 
to be disclosed pursuant to Chapter 17 of the Rules 
Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock

All-employee share option plans 
All employees employed within the Group on the 
first working day of the year may be granted options 
to acquire HSBC Holdings ordinary shares under 
shareholder-approved all-employee share option 
plans. Options under the plans are usually 
exercisable after one, three or five years.  
The exercise of the options may be advanced to 
an earlier date in certain circumstances, for example 
on retirement, and may be extended in certain 
circumstances, for example on the death of a 
participant, the executors may exercise the option up 
to six months beyond the normal exercise period.

HSBC Finance 
Following the acquisition of HSBC Finance in 2003, 
all outstanding options and equity-based awards over 
HSBC Finance common shares were converted into 
rights to receive HSBC Holdings ordinary shares in 
the same ratio as the share exchange offer for the 
acquisition of HSBC Finance (2.675 HSBC 
Holdings ordinary shares for each HSBC Finance 
common share) and the exercise prices per share 
were adjusted accordingly. No further options will 
be granted under the plans.  
All outstanding options and other equity-based 
awards over HSBC Finance common shares granted 
before 14 November 2002, being the date the 
transaction was announced, vested on completion of 
the acquisition. Options granted after 14 November 
2002 are exercisable on their original terms, save 
that they were adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio. 
The following are details of options to acquire 
shares in HSBC Holdings. 
At 31 December 2010, the HSBC (Household) 
Employee Benefit Trust 2003 held 2,335,315 HSBC 
Holdings ordinary shares and 1,455 American 
Depositary Shares, each of which represents five 
HSBC Holdings ordinary shares, which may be used 
to satisfy the exercise of employee share options.

Bank payroll tax 
In December 2009, the governments of the UK and 
France introduced one-off taxes in respect of certain 
bonuses payable by banks and banking groups. In 
both countries the tax was levied at 50% on bonuses 
awarded during a certain period and over a threshold 
amount. The taxes are liabilities of the employer and 
are payable on awards of both cash and shares. The 
amount payable and paid in respect of the relevant 
tax was US$282m in the UK and US$42m in France. 
Corporate sustainability  
At HSBC, we recognise that environmental, social 
and economic issues can affect the Group’s long-
term success as a business. For us, corporate 
sustainability means achieving sustainable profit 
growth so that we can continue to reward 
shareholders and employees, build long-lasting 
relationships with customers and suppliers, pay taxes 
and duties in those countries where we operate, and 
invest in communities for future growth.  
Our continuing financial success depends, in 
part, on our ability to identify and address certain 
factors which present risks or opportunities for the 
business. These can affect our reputation, drive 
employee engagement, help manage the risks of 
lending, leverage savings through eco-efficiency and 
secure new revenue streams. They generally fall into 
one or more of the four broad areas discussed below. 
Business finance 
We aim to build long-term customer relationships 
around the world through the provision of a 
consistent and high-quality service and customer 
experience. We use the benefits of our scale, 
financial strength, geographical reach and strong 
brand value to achieve this. 
We aim to take advantage of the opportunities 
and manage the risks presented by emerging global 
trends by leading the development of sustainable 
business models to address them. We understand that 
the world is changing, with significant examples 
being increased longevity, a widening gap in the 
relative growth rates of emerging and mature 
economies and the need to move to a lower-carbon 
economy in order to mitigate some of the effects of 
climate change. Over the long term, we anticipate 
playing a leading role in shaping the market response 
to these challenges and we are among those financial 
institutions identifying how business can adapt in 
ways that bring both social and environmental 
benefits, while providing viable economic returns.  213
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Operational environmental management 
We focus our environmental initiatives primarily on 
addressing and responding to issues associated with 
climate change, including energy use, water and 
waste management. Climate change has the potential 
to materially affect our customers and, by extension, 
our long-term success, introducing new risks to 
business activity. However, it also has the potential 
to stimulate a new era of low carbon growth, 
innovation and development. In 2010, we continued 
to deepen our understanding of the likely effects 
that climate change and the responses to it will 
have upon our business and those of our customers. 
For example, the HSBC Climate Vulnerability 
Assessment, which maps risks for the G20 in 2020, 
maps the impact of climate change on food 
production, water availability and health. An 
understanding of the scale of the issues helps the 
Group – and our customers – to focus on how best 
to respond.
Community investment  
We have a long-standing commitment to the 
communities in which we operate. Many of our key 
markets are emerging economies. Our operations 
bring benefits to our host countries through tax 
contributions, and to local people and businesses 
through employment, training, purchasing and 
investment. Beyond our core business, we aim to 
encourage social and economic opportunity through 
community investment activities. 
Our focus is on education and the environment 
because we believe they are essential building blocks 
for the development of communities and are 
prerequisites for economic growth. Global education 
programmes such as Future First, JA More Than 
Money
TM
 and Eco-Schools focus on helping 
disadvantaged children, promoting financial literacy 
and environmental education and understanding. Our 
flagship environmental programme is the HSBC 
Climate Partnership, a US$100m commitment to 
working with The Climate Group, Earthwatch, 
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and WWF 
on tackling climate change. 
In 2010, we donated a total of US$108m to 
community investment projects (2009: US$100m). 
Employee issues 
‘Employee engagement’ describes employees’ 
emotional and intellectual commitment to their 
organisation and its success and is critical to the 
long-term ability of the Group to deliver the highest 
quality of financial services. Our annual Global 
People Survey shows that employees value our 
commitment to sustainable business practices and 
view us as being a leader in this regard. In 2010, 
81% of colleagues said they were satisfied with the 
actions HSBC is taking to embed sustainability (e.g. 
environmental and social issues) into the way we run 
our business.
Sustainability governance 
The Corporate Sustainability Committee, a 
committee of the Board, is responsible for advising 
the Board, committees of the Board and executive 
management on corporate sustainability policies, 
including environmental, social and ethical issues.  
The terms of reference of the Corporate 
Sustainability Committee, which are reviewed 
annually, are available at 
www.hsbc.com/boardcommittees.  
The members of the Committee during 2010 
were N R N Murthy, a non-executive Director 
(appointed Chairman on 28 May 2010), 
V H C Cheng, an executive Director (appointed 
28 May 2010), W K L Fung (retired 28 May 2010), 
Sir Mark Moody-Stuart (retired 28 May 2010) and 
G V I Davis, Lord May and Dame Mary Marsh, 
who are non-director members of the Committee. 
The Corporate Sustainability Committee held five 
meetings in 2010. The table on page 190 gives 
details of Directors’ attendance at these meetings. 
Following each meeting, the Committee reports to 
the Board on its activities. 
We report on progress in developing and 
implementing our sustainability strategy annually 
in the HSBC Sustainability Report, which is 
independently verified and prepared using the Global 
Reporting Initiative. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
verified the Group’s commitment to carbon 
neutrality and adherence to the Equator Principles. 
The HSBC Sustainability Report 2010 will be issued 
on 27 May 2011 and will be available at 
www.hsbc.com/sustainability. 
We have a Corporate Sustainability department 
within the Group Management Office and in each 
of our major regions and countries of operation. 
At an operational level, implementation of our 
sustainability policies is managed primarily by 
Group Corporate Sustainability, Group Human 
Resources, Group Risk and Group Compliance. 
Sustainability risk

Health and safety 
The maintenance of appropriate health and safety 
standards remains a key responsibility of all 
managers and we are committed to proactively 
managing all health and safety risks associated with 
our business. Our objectives are to identify, remove, 
reduce or control material risks of fires and of 
accidents or injuries to employees and visitors. 
Group standards, instructions and related 
policies and procedures are set by Group Corporate 
Real Estate. Implementation in-country is 
coordinated through Health, Safety and Fire 
Co-ordinators based in each country in which we 
operate. They may call upon regional and Group 
resources by way of support at any time.  
Group Security provides regular risk 
assessments in areas of increased risk to assist 
management in judging the level of terrorist threat. 
Regional security functions conduct regular security 
reviews to ensure measures to protect our staff, 
buildings, assets and information are appropriate 
for the level of threat. We remain committed to 
maintaining our preparedness and to ensuring the 
highest standards of health and safety wherever in 
the world we operate. 
Supplier payment policy 
We do not currently subscribe to any code or 
standard on payment practice. Our policy is to settle 
terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the 
terms of each transaction, to ensure that those 
suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment, 
and to abide by the terms of payment.  
It is our practice to organise payment to our 
suppliers through a central accounts payable function 
operated by our subsidiary, HSBC Bank. Included in 
the balance with HSBC Bank is the amount due to 
trade creditors which, at 31 December 2010, 
represented 27 days’ average daily purchases of 
goods and services received from such creditors, 
calculated in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006, as amended by Statutory Instrument 2008 
No. 410. 
Share capital 
Issued share capital 
The nominal value of our issued share capital paid 
up at 31 December 2010 was US$8,843,092,451 
divided into 17,686,155,902 ordinary shares of 
US$0.50 each, 1,450,000 non-cumulative preference 
shares of US$0.01 each and 1 non-cumulative 
preference share of £0.01. 
The percentage of the nominal value of our total 
issued share capital paid up at 31 December 2010 
represented by the ordinary shares of US$0.50 each, 
non-cumulative preference shares of US$0.01 each 
and the non-cumulative preference share of £0.01 
was approximately 99.9998, 0.0002, and 0%, 
respectively. 
Rights and obligations attaching to shares  
The rights and obligations attaching to each class of 
shares in our share capital are set out in our Articles 
of Association subject to certain rights and 
obligations that attach to each class of preference 
share as determined by the Board prior to allotment 
of the relevant preference shares. Set out below is a 
summary of the rights and obligations attaching to 
each class of shares with respect to voting, 
dividends, capital and, in the case of the preference 
shares, redemption.  
To be registered, a transfer of shares must be in 
relation to shares which are fully paid up and on 
which we have no lien and to one class of shares 
denominated in the same currency. The transfer must 
be in favour of a single transferee or no more than 
four joint transferees and it must be duly stamped (if 
required). The transfer must be delivered to our 
registered office or our Registrars accompanied by 
the certificate to which it relates or such other 
evidence that proves the title of the transferor. 
If a shareholder or any person appearing to be 
interested in our shares has been sent a notice under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (which 
confers upon public companies the power to require 
information from any person whom we know or 
have reasonable cause to believe to be interested in 
the shares) and has failed in relation to any shares 
(the ‘default shares’) to supply the information 
requested within the period set out in the notice, then 
the member, unless the Board otherwise determines, 
is not entitled to be present at or to vote the default 
shares at any general meeting or to exercise any 
other right conferred by being a shareholder. If the 
default shares represent at least 0.25% in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class, unless the 
Board otherwise determines, any dividend shall be 
withheld by the Company without interest, no 
election may be made for any scrip dividend 
alternative, and no transfer of any shares held by 
the member will be registered except in limited 
circumstances. 
Ordinary shares 
Subject to the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles 
of Association, we may, by ordinary resolution,  215
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
declare dividends to be paid to the holders of 
ordinary shares, though no dividend shall exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board. The Board may 
pay interim dividends as appears to the Board to be 
justified by the profits available for distribution. 
All dividends shall be apportioned and paid 
proportionately to the percentage of the nominal 
amount paid up on the shares during any portion 
or portions of the period in respect of which the 
dividend is paid, but if any share is issued on terms 
providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a 
particular date, it shall rank for dividend 
accordingly. Subject to the Articles of Association, 
the Board may, with the prior authority of an 
ordinary resolution passed by the shareholders and 
subject to such terms and conditions as the Board 
may determine, offer to any holders of ordinary 
shares the right to elect to receive ordinary shares of 
the same or a different currency, credited as fully 
paid, instead of cash in any currency in respect of 
the whole (or some part, to be determined by the 
Board) of any dividend specified by the ordinary 
resolution. At the 2007 Annual General Meeting 
shareholders gave authority to the Directors to 
determine to offer a scrip dividend alternative until 
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 
2012.
Preference shares 
There are three classes of preference shares in the 
share capital of HSBC Holdings, non-cumulative 
preference shares of US$0.01 each (the ‘Dollar 
Preference Shares’), non-cumulative preference 
shares of £0.01 each (the ‘Sterling Preference 
Shares’) and non-cumulative preference shares of 
€0.01 (the ‘Euro Preference Shares’). The Dollar 
Preference Shares in issue are Series A Dollar 
Preference Shares and the Sterling Preference Share 
in issue is a Series A Sterling Preference Share. 
There are no Euro Preference Shares in issue. 
Dollar Preference Shares 
Holders of the Dollar Preference Shares are only 
entitled to attend and vote at general meetings if any 
dividend payable on the relevant preference shares in 
respect of such period as the Board shall determine 
prior to allotment thereof is not paid in full or in such 
other circumstances, and upon and subject to such 
terms, as the Board may determine prior to allotment 
of the relevant preference shares. In the case of the 
Dollar Preference Shares in issue at 28 February 
2011 the relevant period determined by the Board is 
four consecutive dividend payment dates. Whenever 
holders of the Dollar Preference Shares are entitled 
to vote on a resolution at a general meeting, on a 
show of hands every such holder who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote and on a poll 
every such holder who is present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote per preference share held 
by him or her or such number of votes per share as 
the Board shall determine prior to allotment of such 
share. 
Subject to the Articles of Association, holders 
of the Dollar Preference Shares have the right to a 
non-cumulative preferential dividend at such rate, on 
such dates and on such other terms and conditions as 
may be determined by the Board prior to allotment 
thereof in priority to the payment of any dividend to 
the holders of ordinary shares and any other class of 
shares of HSBC Holdings in issue (other than (i) the 
other preference shares in issue and any other shares 
expressed to rank pari passu therewith as regards 
income; and (ii) any shares which by their terms 
rank in priority to the relevant preference shares as 
regards income). A dividend of US$62.00 per 
annum is payable on each Dollar Preference Share 
in issue at 28 February 2011. The dividend is paid at 
the rate of US$15.50 per quarter at the sole and 
absolute discretion of the Board.  
A dividend will not be declared or paid on the 
Dollar Preference Shares if payment of the dividend 
would cause HSBC Holdings not to meet the 
applicable capital adequacy requirements of the 
FSA or the profit of HSBC Holdings available for 
distribution as dividends is not sufficient to enable 
HSBC Holdings to pay in full both dividends on the 
relevant preference shares and dividends on any 
other shares that are scheduled to be paid on the 
same date and that have an equal right to dividends. 
Dividends will not be declared or paid on any class 
of shares of HSBC Holdings ranking lower in the 
right to dividends than the Dollar Preference Shares 
nor redeem nor purchase in any manner any of its 
other shares ranking equal with or lower than the 
Dollar Preference Shares unless it has paid in full, or 
set aside an amount to provide for payment in full, 
the dividends on the Dollar Preference Shares for 
the then-current dividend period. 
The Dollar Preference Shares carry no rights to 
participate in the profits or assets of HSBC Holdings 
other than as set out in the Articles of Association 
and subject to the Companies Act 2006, do not 
confer any right to participate in any offer or 
invitation by way of rights or otherwise to subscribe 
for additional shares in HSBC Holdings, do not 
confer any right of conversion and do not confer any 
right to participate in any issue of bonus shares or 
shares issued by way of capitalisation of reserves.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Subject to the relevant insolvency laws and the 
Articles of Association of HSBC Holdings, holders 
of the Dollar Preference Shares have the right in a 
winding up of HSBC Holdings to receive out of the 
assets of HSBC Holdings available for distribution 
to its shareholders, in priority to any payment to the
holders of the ordinary shares and any other class of 
shares of HSBC Holdings in issue (other than (i) the 
other relevant preference shares and any other shares

their terms rank in priority to the relevant preference

with or pursuant to the Articles of Association and 
the amount paid up or credited as paid up on the 
Dollar Preference Shares together with such

Dollar Preference Shares in issue at 28 February 
2011, the premium is US$9,999.99 per Dollar 
Preference Share. 
The Dollar Preference Shares may be redeemed 
in accordance with the Articles of Association and 
the terms on which Dollar Preference Shares were 
issued and allotted. In the case of the Dollar 
Preference Shares in issue at 28 February 2011, 
HSBC Holdings may redeem such shares in whole

the Dollar Preference Shares, save in respect of 
certain rights and obligations that attach to Sterling 
Preference Shares to be determined by the Board 
prior to allotment of the relevant preference shares 
and the timing and payment of proceeds from the 
redemption of each class of share. The one Sterling 
Preference Share in issue at 28 February 2011 
carries the same rights and obligations as the Dollar 
Preference Shares in issue at 28 February 2011 to 
the extent described in the section above save as 
follows:
1. the holder of the Sterling Preference Share is 
not entitled to attend or vote at general 
meetings;  
2. the Sterling Preference Share may be redeemed 
in whole on any date as may be determined by 
the Board; and 
3. the exceptions to the circumstances in which a 
dividend will not be declared or paid do not 
apply. 
A dividend of £0.04 per annum is payable on 
the Sterling Preference Share in issue at 28 February 
2011. The dividend is paid at the rate of £0.01 per 
quarter at the sole and absolute discretion of the 
Board.
Euro Preference Shares  
The Euro Preference Shares carry the same rights 
and obligations under the Articles of Association as 
the Dollar Preference Shares, save in respect of 
certain rights and obligations that attach to Euro 
Preference Shares which are to be determined by the 
Board prior to allotment of the relevant preference 
shares and the timing and payment of proceeds from 
the redemption of each class of share.

The principal purpose of HSBC’s remuneration 
strategy is to support and drive sustainable 
performance over the long-term. Remuneration 
should reward success towards this end, but it must 
also not reward failure and it must be properly 
aligned with risk which remains on the balance 
sheet.
HSBC strives to achieve this through a variety 
of ways which are detailed under ‘Overall principles’ 
on page 222. These include taking a rounded view 
of financial and non-financial performance in 
determining reward levels, considering affordability 
(including cost and quantity of capital and liquidity 
considerations), market competitiveness, delivering 
awards with high levels of deferral and making all 
such deferred awards subject to clawback. Such 
clawback is applied at the sole discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’).  
In our view these elements help to reinforce and 
reward the delivery of sustainable performance. 
2010 performance 
Key achievements 
The annual financial objectives that we set for 
ourselves for 2010 were achieved, although in some 
areas they were lower than the established long-term 
targets. In the Group’s 2010 performance, particular 
note was made of the following: 
• good growth in profit before tax on both an 
underlying and a reported basis compared with 
2009 and ahead of expectations at the start of 
2010. This was primarily driven by lower loan 
impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions with all regions and customer groups 
contributing;
• strong growth was achieved in emerging 
markets with loans and advances to customers 
and revenue increasing in key markets; 
• our capital ratios were above the target range, in 
part from the contribution of profit to capital but 
also from our ability to raise capital, as shown 
in the successful hybrid capital securities issue 
in the first half of the year; 
• we maintained a highly liquid balance sheet, 
with a ratio of customer advances to customer 
accounts of 78.1%; 
• we increased dividends for our shareholders, 
reflecting the profit-generating capability of the 
Group;
• return on average shareholders’ equity of 9.5% 
was below our target range; and 
• revenue declined and costs grew, resulting in 
an increase in the cost efficiency ratio from 
52.0% to 55.2%. The Group is working on 
bringing the ratio back to target levels while 
meeting the need to invest for future growth. 
Key non-financial achievements of the Group 
in 2010, which reflect the objectives set for senior 
management, are summarised below: 
• process objectives focused on efficiency and 
qualitative measures which affect financial 
performance and mitigate risk. The target we set 
for operational losses as a percentage of revenue 
was met; 
• progress in meeting customer recommendation 
and brand recognition targets was made in a 
challenging environment for retail and 
commercial banking. Brand health targets for 
PFS and Business Banking were met. Customer 
recommendation targets were met for the latter 
but not for PFS; and 
• regarding the Group’s employees, our 2010 
employee engagement score was below target 
and was less than our 2009 score. However, the 
2010 score exceeded the global average and 
the global financial sector norm for employee 
engagement in the year. The target for the ratio 
of revenue to staff costs was also met. 
In determining remuneration levels for 2010, the 
Committee, applying HSBC’s remuneration strategy 
and policy, remained mindful of the interests of the 
many stakeholders and the broader external context. 
This included taking into account the pay and  221
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
employment conditions of our employees compared 
to our Directors and senior executives. 
Management of risk 
The integration of risk management with reward 
commenced in 2008 when our Group Risk function 
became involved in the approval of relevant 
incentive plans. Subsequently, the concept of 
imputing the cost of capital in the determination of 
bonus funding was expanded across HSBC, starting 
with GB&M, and it now applies throughout the 
Group.
Since 2009, the Group Chief Risk Officer 
has provided advice to the Committee on the 
implications of the remuneration policy on risk and 
risk management. As outlined in ‘Overall principles’ 
on page 222, risk mitigation objectives are included 
in objectives. 
From 2010, we have used a risk appetite 
framework which describes the quantum and types 
of risk that we are prepared to take in executing our 
strategy. It shapes our integrated approach to 
business, risk and capital management and supports 
us in achieving our return on equity objectives. The 
risk appetite framework is agreed by the HSBC 
Holdings Board and cascaded across businesses 
and geographies. It provides an important input 
into the Committee’s deliberations with regard to 
remuneration. In addition, individual performance is 
also reviewed against key risk appetite targets for 
credit, market, operational and information and 
security risks to ensure that proposed individual 
remuneration is appropriate against these aspects.  
In February 2010, the Group Risk Committee 
was established, which advises the Board on risk 
appetite and also on aligning reward structures with 
risk appetite. The Group Risk Committee receives 
information on risk related aspects of reward 
structures to be proposed by the Committee. The 
Group Chief Risk Officer regularly reports to, and 
attends meetings of, the Group Risk Committee. 
Further information relating to our approach to 
risk management in general is set out on page 198. 
Regulation 
2010 has seen further significant change to the 
regulatory environment. Regrettably there is still a 
wide divergence in how regulations operate globally 
and this presents significant challenges to HSBC, 
which operates in 87 countries and territories 
worldwide. In order to deliver long-term 
sustainable performance, it is imperative we have 
market-competitive remuneration in order to attract, 
motivate and retain talented and committed 
employees.  
We work to ensure our remuneration policies 
are aligned with both new regulatory practices and 
the interests of shareholders and confirm that HSBC 
is fully compliant with the Financial Stability Board 
and the Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’) 
guidance and rules on remuneration. 
Senior management changes 
In September 2010, we announced that our Group 
Chairman, Lord Green, would retire from the Group 
on 3 December 2010 and that the Group Chief 
Executive and Chairman of The Hongkong and 
Shanghai Banking Corporation, M F Geoghegan, 
would step down as Group Chief Executive with 
effect from 31 December 2010 and provide advisory 
support to the Group until his retirement on 
31 March 2011. M F Geoghegan will then act as an 
external consultant up to 30 June 2011. Succession 
to these positions affecting the executive Directors is 
set out below.  
D J Flint was appointed Group Chairman with 
effect from 3 December 2010 and continues to be 
based in London.  
S T Gulliver was appointed Group Chief 
Executive and Chairman of The Hongkong and 
Shanghai Banking Corporation with effect from 
1 January 2011. In keeping with the policy 
established in September 2009, his principal office 
is located in Hong Kong. 
A A Flockhart was appointed Chairman, Europe, 
Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Commercial 
Banking and Chairman of HSBC Bank plc with 
effect from 1 January 2011. He has relocated from 
Hong Kong to London to take up this remit.  
I J Mackay was appointed an executive Director 
and the Group Finance Director with effect from 
3 December 2010. He has relocated from Hong 
Kong to London to take up this remit. 
2011 remuneration activities 
As announced in 2010, the Committee is considering 
how HSBC can continue to improve the alignment 
between shareholders and senior management with 
regard to incentivising long-term sustainable 
performance. The Committee is currently in the 
process of consulting with major shareholders on 
this subject. Any material changes to our approach 
which result from this consultation will be explained 
to shareholders in the Chairman’s letter 
accompanying the Notice of the Company’s 2011 
Annual General Meeting. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
Remuneration Committee – members and advisers / Overall principles / Executive Directors’ remuneration 
222
Remuneration Committee – 
members and advisers 
The Committee meets regularly to consider human 
resource issues relating to terms and conditions of 
employment, remuneration and retirement benefits. 
Within the authority delegated by the Board, the 
Committee is responsible for approving 
remuneration policy and in doing so takes into 
account the pay and conditions across our Group. 
This includes the terms of bonus plans, share plans, 
other long-term incentive plans and the individual 
remuneration packages of executive Directors and 
other senior Group employees, including all in 
positions of significant influence and those having 
an impact on our risk profile. No Directors are 
involved in deciding their own remuneration. 
The members of the Committee during 2010 
were J D Coombe, W S H Laidlaw, G Morgan and 
J L Thornton. Sir Mark Moody-Stuart retired as a 
Director of HSBC Holdings and ceased to be a 
member and chairman of the Committee on 28 May 
2010. J L Thornton was appointed chairman on 
28 May 2010. 
There were nine meetings of the Committee 
during 2010. The table on page 190 gives details of 
Directors’ attendance at these meetings. Following 
each meeting the Committee reports to the Board on 
its activities. The terms of reference of the 
Committee are available at 
www.hsbc.com/boardcommittees. 
The Committee received independent advice on 
executive remuneration issues from Deloitte LLP 
and remuneration data from Towers Watson. Each of 
these firms also provided other consulting services to 
various parts of the Group. Other consultants are 
used from time to time to advise on specific issues. 
Going forward, the Committee has agreed to use 
advisers only as and when required and that these 
would be separate from the Company’s advisers. 
During the year, the Group Chief Executive provided 
regular briefings to the Committee and the 
Committee received advice from the Group 
Managing Director, Human Resources, A Almeida, 
the Head of Group Performance and Reward, 
T Roberts and B Robertson, then the Group Chief 
Risk Officer. 
Overall principles 
Our global reward strategy provides a framework for 
the Committee to carry out its responsibilities during 
the year.  
HSBC reward strategy How achieved 
A rounded approach to 
measuring performance 
• We assess performance with reference to clear and relevant objectives set within a holistic balanced 
scorecard framework. Under this framework, objectives are set under four categories – financial, process 
(including risk mitigation), customer and people. Significant importance is given to the achievement of 
efficiency and risk objectives as well as financial objectives. Objectives relating to customer development 
and the productivity of our human capital are key to sustained financial performance and the development 
of the Group over the short and medium term. 
A focus on total 
remuneration with variable 
pay differentiated by 
performance 
• Reward is delivered through a combination of fixed and variable pay (salary, bonus, other long-term 
incentives). The variable pay element is differentiated by performance over both the short and long-term. 
The performance-related elements of pay comprise a material proportion of the total remuneration package 
for executive Directors, whilst maintaining an appropriate balance between fixed and variable elements. 
Remuneration is structured to provide an opportunity for market top quartile total remuneration for higher 
levels of market referenced performance.  
Aligning individual rewards  
with Group performance and 
shareholders 
• A significant proportion of variable pay is deferred into, predominantly, awards of HSBC Holdings 
Restricted Shares to align recipients to the future performance of the Group and to retain key talent. For 
Code Staff (as defined under FSA rules) 50% of deferred variable pay is delivered in the form of deferred 
cash.
• Executive Directors and other senior executives are subject to share ownership guidelines. 
Competitive and cost 
effective packages to attract 
and retain staff 
• A total remuneration package (salary, bonus, long-term incentives and other benefits) which is competitive 
in relation to comparable organisations in each of the markets in which we operate. 
Effective management of 
risk 
• Discretion is used in order to assess the extent to which performance has been achieved, rather than 
applying a formulaic approach which, by its nature, may encourage inappropriate risk taking. 
• Performance is assessed taking risk into account using a combination of quantitative and qualitative

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
Executive Directors’ remuneration 
224
In order to ensure that executive Directors’ 
remuneration packages are competitive, having 
regard to the market in which we compete for 
executive talent, the Committee considers market 
data from a defined remuneration comparator group. 
This group comprises of nine global financial 
services companies, namely Banco Santander, Bank 
of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, 
Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Standard 
Chartered and UBS. These companies were selected 
on the basis of their broadly similar business 
coverage, size and international scope, and are 
subject to annual review for continuing relevance. 
The positioning of total remuneration (salary, 
bonus and the expected value of long-term 
incentives) for the executive Directors depends on 
the performance of the Group and individual 
performance assessed against a combination of 
financial and non-financial objectives within an 
annual balanced scorecard. The annual objectives in 
themselves are derived from medium term strategic 
plans.
The above approach applies to all executive 
Directors with the exception of the Group Chairman, 
D J Flint who from 2011 will no longer receive 
annual bonus payments and is not expected to be 
granted awards of Performance Shares, and 
S T Gulliver, whose variable compensation 
arrangements for 2010 take into account wholesale 
banking market practice. With effect from 2011, 
S T Gulliver will be subject to the same 
arrangements as other executive Directors. 
Executive Directors’ 2010 emoluments and

The emoluments of the Group Chairman and 
executive Directors of HSBC Holdings for 2010,

7 The Bonus for 2010 comprises the deferred and non-deferred bonus, details of which are set out below and on page 223. 
Retirement of M F Geoghegan in 2011 
M F Geoghegan will continue to work under his 
existing compensation arrangements until his 
retirement on 31 March 2011; however he will not 
be eligible to receive any bonus in respect of 2011. 
M F Geoghegan will receive the sum of £1,027,500, 
and the Group will also make a pension contribution 
on his behalf equal to £401,250, in lieu of the remaining 
nine months notice period required to terminate the 
Service Agreement. Following his retirement, 
M F Geoghegan will provide consultancy to HSBC 
for a period of three months from 1 April 2011, at a 
consultancy fee of £200,000, which he intends to 
donate to charity. In accordance with our disclosure 
practices these sums will also be fully disclosed in 
the 2011 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Salary 
To reflect the significantly increased responsibilities 
and maintain and reinforce a collegiate executive 
team, the salaries for two executive Directors were 
adjusted from 1 February 2010, equalising the 
salaries of D J Flint, S T Gulliver and A A Flockhart. 
In addition, with effect from 2010 the employer 
pension contribution or executive allowance, in 
lieu of pension, for D J Flint, A A Flockhart and 
S T Gulliver were equalised at 50% of basic salary. 
On appointment as Group Chairman, the salary 
for D J Flint was increased to £1,500,000 with effect 
from 3 December 2010. 
On appointment as Group Chief Executive, the 
salary for S T Gulliver was increased to £1,250,000, 
with effect from 1 January 2011. 
On appointment as Chairman, Europe, Middle 
East, Africa, Latin America, Commercial Banking 
and Chairman of HSBC Bank plc, the salary for 
A A Flockhart was increased to £975,000, with 
effect from 1 January 2011. 
I J Mackay was appointed an executive Director 
on 3 December 2010 with a base salary of £700,000, 
and will receive an executive allowance of 50% in 
lieu of pension. 
No other salary increases are proposed for 
executive Directors. 
Annual bonus 
The awards made to executive Directors in respect 
of 2010 performance will be 60% deferred and 40% 
non-deferred (with the exception of S T Gulliver, 
whose arrangements are noted below). 50% of both 
the deferred and non-deferred components will be in 
the form of Restricted Shares issued under the HSBC 
Share Plan. The remaining 50% will be delivered as 
cash. The vesting policy as noted on page 223 under 
‘Executive Directors remuneration’ will apply to the 
deferred awards. 
S T Gulliver, at his request, will receive his 
2010 annual bonus 100% fully deferred in the form 
of Restricted Shares. This award will be subject to 
the same vesting policy for other executive 
Directors’ deferred awards. 
The award made to the former Group Chief 
Executive, M F Geoghegan, and the Group 
Chairman, D J Flint, in respect of his previous role 
as Chief Financial Officer, Executive Director, Risk 
and Regulation, reflects the overall achievements of 
the Group under the balanced scorecard and risk 
appetite framework. The 2010 results show an 
improved profit after tax and return on equity, 
although below our target range, and a strong core 
tier 1 capital position. Loan impairment charges 
as a percentage of total operating income reduced 
and the firm’s economic profit position improved, 
although it remained in an overall negative position. 
Operational losses for the Group were reduced from 
last year and notwithstanding the Group’s employee 
engagement score reduced year on year, it still 
maintained its position ahead of the industry norm. 
From 2011 and onwards D J Flint will no longer 
receive an annual bonus payment. 
The award made to the Group Chief Executive, 
S T Gulliver, reflects his overall strong achievements 
in his previous role as Chairman, Europe, Middle 
East and Global Businesses. Profit before tax for 
the businesses within his remit decreased slightly, 
however this was against challenging market  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
Executive Directors’ remuneration  
226
conditions. Operational losses for the year, however, 
also reduced substantially as well as there being a 
substantial decrease in loan impairment charges as a 
percentage of total operating income.  
The award made to V H C Cheng, Chairman of 
HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, reflects his 
performance in ensuring the continued strategic 
development in mainland China. 
The award made to A A Flockhart reflects 
his overall achievements in his previous role 
as Chairman, Personal and Commercial Banking and 
Insurance. Profit before tax increased and the return 
on equity increased in all areas from last year. 
Operational losses increased from last year, 
however, resulting in the cost efficiency across his 
remit to decrease. 
The award for I J Mackay, reflects his overall 
achievements in his previous role as Chief Financial 
Officer, Asia-Pacific.

6 Appointed a Director of HSBC Holdings on 3 December 2010. 
Performance Shares 
No awards of Performance Shares have been made 
since 2008. No awards are proposed to date. Awards 
may be considered later in 2011, subject to the 
conclusion of the current consultation with 
shareholders concerning a revised approach as 
referenced on page 221. 
The average actual vesting of Performance 
Share awards made in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 
(which were tested in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010) 
has been 26.88% of their face value. The awards 
granted in 2007 did not satisfy the EPS condition but 
did satisfy the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) 
condition and accordingly, 75.6% of the TSR 
element of the award (37.8% of the overall award) 
vested. The awards made in 2008 have not satisfied 
the earnings per share or economic profit measures. 
The extent to which the TSR part of the award will 
vest will be determined following the completion 
of the three year period on 25 March 2011.  
Description of performance conditions 
The performance measures for the long-term 
incentive awards of Performance Shares under the 
HSBC Share Plan remain as follows. 
The vesting of awards is based on three 
independent performance measures and an 
overriding ‘sustained improvement’ judgement by
the Committee. The three Group measures are 
relative TSR (40% of the award); economic profit 
(40%); and growth in EPS (20%). 
These measures provide a basis on which to 
measure our relative and absolute performance 
over the long-term taking into account an external 
measure of value creation, a measure of the extent to 
which the return on capital invested in HSBC is in 
excess of a benchmark return and a direct measure 
of the profits generated for shareholders.
Awards will not vest unless the Committee is 
satisfied that our financial performance has shown a 
sustained improvement in the period since the award 
date. In determining whether we have achieved 
such sustained improvement the Committee will 
take account of all relevant factors, in particular, 
comparisons against the TSR comparator group 
in areas such as revenue growth and mix, cost 
efficiency, credit performance, cash return on cash 
invested, dividends and TSR. 
The performance conditions are measured over 
a three year performance period and awards forfeited  227
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
to the extent that they have not been met. The 
performance measures and the targets described 
below apply to the last awards made in 2008. 
TSR award 
TSR is measured against a comparator group 
comprising the largest global banks in the world as 
well as other banks against which we compete for 
business at a regional and/or local level. These 
companies are: 
TSR comparator group 
AGEAS ICBC
Banco Bradesco Itau Unibanco 
Banco Santander JPMorgan Chase
Bank of America Lloyds Banking Group 
Bank of China National Australia Bank  
Barclays Royal Bank of Canada  
BBVA Royal Bank of Scotland  
BNP Paribas Société Générale  
Citigroup Standard Chartered  
Credit Suisse Group UBS
DBS Group UniCredito Italiano  
Deutsche Bank Wells Fargo  
During 2008, HBOS and Wachovia merged with 
other banks in the comparator group and in 2009 the 
remainder of the banking activities of Fortis were 
acquired by BNP Paribas, an existing member of the 
comparator group. For awards made in 2008, 
performance from the point of acquisition will track 
that of the acquirer. This approach retains the free 
float market capitalisation (‘FFMC’) weighting of 
the combined entities. The Committee determined 
that the comparator group remains large enough to 
be statistically valid and as such it was not necessary 
to introduce any replacement banks.  
To reflect the fact that the range of market 
capitalisations within the comparator group is very 
wide, a FFMC weighted method is used to calculate 
TSR performance. Under this approach, our out-
performance of the comparator group will be 
calculated by dividing the total FFMC of all of the 
companies that we have outperformed in terms of 
TSR by the total FFMC of all of the companies in 
the comparator group. The extent to which the TSR 
award vests is determined as follows: 
If HSBC’s TSR outperforms 
companies comprising 
Proportion of TSR Award 
vesting

75% of the total FFMC 100%
50% of the total FFMC 20%
< 50% of the total FFMC nil
1 Vesting will occur in a straight line between 20% and 100% 
where our performance falls between these incremental 
steps.
Economic profit award 
Economic profit (‘EP’) is calculated as the average 
annual difference between return on invested capital 
and our benchmark cost of capital and is expressed 
as a percentage. EP is a key measure of shareholder 
value creation as it rewards management 
progressively to the extent that the return on the 
capital invested in HSBC by its shareholders is in 
excess of a threshold return, which itself exceeds 
our benchmark cost of capital. 
For the awards made in 2008 the benchmark 
cost of capital was 10%. Return on invested capital 
is based on the profit attributable to shareholders. 
The extent to which the EP award vests is 
determined as follows: 
Average annual EP over  
three years 
Proportion of EP Award 
vesting
1
8% or above 100%
< 3% nil
1 Vesting will occur in a straight line between 0% and 100% 
where our performance falls between these incremental 
steps.
Earnings per share award 
Growth in EPS is measured on a point to point basis, 
by comparing EPS in the third financial year of the 
performance period with EPS in the financial year 
preceding that in which the award is made.  
EPS growth in Year 3 over  
the base EPS 
Proportion of EPS

16% 20%
< 16% nil
1 Vesting will occur in a straight line between 20% and 100% 
where our performance falls between these incremental 
steps.
If events occur which cause the Committee to 
consider that a performance condition has become 
unfair or impractical in either direction, the right is 
reserved to the Committee, if it considers it 
appropriate, to amend, relax or waive the condition. 
Awards will vest in full and immediately in 
cases of death. In the event of redundancy, 
retirement on grounds of injury or ill health and 
where a participant ceases to be employed by HSBC 
due to a company ceasing to be part of HSBC, 
awards will normally vest at the end of the vesting 
period on a time-apportioned basis to the extent that 
the performance conditions have been satisfied. In 
the event of a change of control, awards will 
normally vest immediately and on a time-
apportioned basis to the extent that the performance  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
Executive Directors’ remuneration / Non-executive Directors 
228
conditions have been satisfied. Awards will normally 
be forfeited if the participant is dismissed for cause 
or resigns from HSBC. In all circumstances the 
Committee retains discretion to ensure fair and 
reasonable treatment. 
Funding 
The dilution limits set out in the HSBC share 
plans comply with the Association of British 
Insurers’ guidelines. To date, all vesting awards of 
Performance Shares and Restricted Shares under the 
HSBC Share Plan have been satisfied by the transfer 
of existing shares. To create additional core tier 1 
capital and retain funds within HSBC, the Board has 
agreed that new shares may be issued to satisfy the 
vesting of awards of Restricted and Performance 
Shares that cannot be satisfied from shares already 
held by employee benefit trusts commencing in 
2011.

Pensions 
The normal retirement age for executive Directors 
is 65, with the exception of V H C Cheng, for whom 
no retirement age is specified in keeping with 
local legislation. The pension entitlements of the 
executive Directors for 2010 are set out on page 231. 
Share ownership guidelines  
To ensure appropriate alignment with our 
shareholders, we operate a formal share ownership 
policy, expressed as a number of shares, for 
executive Directors and the Group Managing 
Directors. The Committee considers that material 
share ownership by executives creates a community 
of interest between senior management and 
shareholders. 
Under the existing guidelines, the shareholding 
is expected to be achieved within five years of the 
executive’s appointment or three years from the date 
of approval of amendments to the HSBC Share Plan 
on 30 May 2008, whichever is the later. The 
executive Directors and Group Managing Directors 
are required to build and retain the following 
shareholdings:

3 Appointed Group Chief Executive on 1 January 2011. 
4 Appointed Group Finance Director on 3 December 2010. 
5 All of the Group Managing Directors exceed the expected 
holdings. 
The Committee monitors compliance with the 
share ownership guidelines annually. The Committee 
will have full discretion in determining any penalties 
in cases of non-compliance, which could include a 
reduction of future awards of long-term incentives 
and/or an increase in the proportion of the annual 
bonus that is deferred into shares.  
Service contracts 
Our policy is to employ executive Directors on one-
year rolling contracts although longer initial terms 
may be approved by the Committee if considered 
appropriate. The Committee will, consistent with 
the best interests of the Group, seek to minimise 
termination payments.  229

Other directorships 
Executive Directors, if so authorised by either the 
Nomination Committee or the Board, may accept 
appointments as non-executive Directors of suitable 
companies which are not part of HSBC. Approval 
will not be given for executive Directors to accept a 
non-executive directorship of more than one FTSE 
100 company nor the chairmanship of such a 
company. When considering a non-executive 
appointment, the Nomination Committee or Board 
will take into account the expected time commitment 
of such appointment. The time commitment for 
executive Directors’ external appointments will be 
reviewed as part of the annual Board review. Any 
remuneration receivable in respect of an external 
appointment is normally paid to HSBC, unless 
otherwise approved by the Committee. D J Flint has 
elected to donate his fees as a non-executive Director 
of BP p.l.c. to charity. Lord Green donated his fees 
from the Supervisory Board of BASF SE to charity.
Non-executive Directors 
Non-executive Directors are appointed for fixed 
terms not exceeding three years, subject to their 
re-election by shareholders at Annual General 
Meetings. Non-executive directors have no service 
contract and are not eligible to participate in our 
share plans. Current non-executive Directors’ terms 
of appointment will expire as follows:  
• in 2011, S A Catz, J D Coombe, J W J Hughes-
Hallett, W S H Laidlaw and N R N Murthy; 
• in 2012, M K T Cheung, J R Lomax, 
Sir Simon Robertson, J L Thornton and 
Sir Brian Williamson; and 
• in 2013, R A Fairhead and G Morgan. 
L M L Cha was appointed a non-executive 
Director with effect from 1 March 2011. Subject to 
her re-election by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2011, her term will expire in 
2014. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Fees 
Non-executive Directors’ fees are regularly reviewed 
and compared with other large international 
companies of comparable complexity. The current 
fee, which was approved by shareholders in 2006, 
is £65,000 per annum. Having considered 
comprehensive data it is clear that the current 
non-executive Directors’ fee is below the level paid 
in other major UK companies. The approval will 
therefore be sought at the Annual General Meeting in 
2011 for the fee for non-executive Directors to be 
increased to £95,000 per annum with effect from 
1 January 2011. A fee of £30,000 per annum is 
payable to the senior independent non-executive 
Director. In addition, non-executive Directors 
received the following fees for service on Board 
Committees:

The HSBC Holdings savings-related share option plans are all-employee share plans under which eligible HSBC employees may be 
granted options to acquire HSBC Holdings ordinary shares. Employees may make contributions of up to £250 (or equivalent) each month
over a period of one, three or five years which may be used on the first, third or fifth anniversary of the commencement of the relevant 
savings contract, at the employee’s election, to exercise the options. The plans help align the interests of employees with the creation of 
shareholder value and, as such, exercise of the options is not subject to any performance conditions. The options were awarded for nil 
consideration and are exercisable at a 20% discount to the average market value of the ordinary shares on the five business days
immediately preceding the invitation date. No options lapsed during the year. There are performance criteria conditional upon which the 
outstanding options are exercisable and there have been no variations to the terms and conditions since the awards were made. The market 
value per ordinary share at 31 December 2010 was £6.511. The highest and lowest market values per ordinary share during the year were 
£7.404 and £5.962. Market value is the mid-market price derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on the relevant date. 
Under the Securities and Futures Ordinance of Hong Kong, the options are categorised as unlisted physically settled equity derivatives.

On behalf of the Board  28 February 2011 
J L Thornton, Chairman of Remuneration Committee HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement 
234
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Auditor’s statement of their responsibilities 
set out in their report on pages 235 and 236, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective 
responsibilities of the Directors and of the Auditor in relation to the financial statements. The Directors are 
responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the consolidated financial statements of HSBC Holdings and its 
subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) and holding company financial statements for HSBC Holdings (the ‘parent company’) in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each 
financial year. The Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.  
The Group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to 
present fairly the financial position, the performance for that period and for IFRSs purposes the cash flows of the 
Group and the parent company; the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their 
achieving a fair presentation. In addition, in order to meet certain US requirements, HSBC is required to present its 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). 
Currently, there are no differences in application to HSBC between IFRSs endorsed by the EU and IFRSs issued by 
the IASB. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and  
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU. 
The Directors are required to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is not 
appropriate. Since the Directors are satisfied that the Group and parent company have the resources to continue in 
business for the foreseeable future, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the

1 Adjustment to bring changes between opening and closing balance sheet amounts to average rates. This is not done on a line-by-line
basis, as details cannot be determined without unreasonable expense. 
2 Share premium includes the deduction of US$1m in respect of issuance costs incurred during the year (2009: US$1m; 2008: US$3m).
3 Cumulative goodwill amounting to US$5,138m has been charged against reserves in respect of acquisitions of subsidiaries prior to 
1 January 1998, including US$3,469m charged against the merger reserve arising on the acquisition of HSBC Bank plc. The balance of 
US$1,669m has been charged against retained earnings. 
4 Retained earnings include 123,331,979 (US$1,799m) of own shares held within HSBC’s insurance business, retirement funds for the
benefit of policyholders or beneficiaries within employee trusts for the settlement of shares expected to be delivered under employee
share schemes or bonus plans, and the market-making activities in Global Markets (2009: 179,964,968 (US$2,572m); 2008: 
194,751,829 (US$3,094m)). 
5 Amounts transferred to the income statement in respect of cash flow hedges include US$605m (2009: US$502m; 2008: US$152m) taken
to ‘Net interest income’ and US$441m (2009: US$306m; 2008: US$1,602m) taken to ‘Net trading income’. 
6 Statutory share premium relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 (the ‘Act’) was taken in respect of the acquisition of HSBC 
Bank plc in 1992, HSBC France in 2000 and HSBC Finance Corporation in 2003 and the shares issued were recorded at their nominal
value only. In HSBC’s consolidated financial statements the fair value differences of US$8,290m in respect of HSBC France and 
US$12,768m in respect of HSBC Finance Corporation were recognised in the merger reserve. The merger reserve created on the 
acquisition of HSBC Finance Corporation subsequently became attached to HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited (‘HOHU’), 
following a number of intra-group reorganisations. At 31 December 2009, US$5,945m (2010: nil) was transferred from this reserve to 
retained earnings as a result of impairment in HSBC Holdings’ investment in HOHU. During 2009, pursuant to section 131 of the 
Companies Act 1985, statutory share premium relief was taken in respect of the rights issue and US$15,796m was recognised in the
merger reserve. The merger reserve includes the deduction of US$614m in respect of costs relating to the rights issue, of which
US$149m was subsequently transferred to the income statement. Of this US$149m, US$121m was a loss arising from accounting for the
agreement with the underwriters as a contingent forward contract. The merger reserve excludes the loss of US$344m on a forward 
foreign exchange contract associated with hedging the proceeds of the rights issue.  
7 During June 2010, HSBC Holdings issued US$3,800m of Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities, Series 2 (‘capital securities’), on 
which there were US$82m of external issuance costs and US$23m of intra-group issuance costs which are classified as equity under
IFRSs. In April 2008, HSBC Holdings issued US$2,200m of Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities, including US$67m of issuance
costs, which are classified as equity under IFRSs. 
8 Retained earnings include 39,814,107 (US$562m) of own shares held to fund employee share plans (2009: 38,446,053 (US$562m)).  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements 
1 – Basis of preparation 
250
1 Basis of preparation  
(a) Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
The consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and as endorsed by the EU. EU-endorsed IFRSs may differ 
from IFRSs as issued by the IASB if, at any point in time, new or amended IFRSs have not been endorsed by the 
EU. At 31 December 2010, there were no unendorsed standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2010 
affecting these consolidated and separate financial statements, and there was no difference between IFRSs 
endorsed by the EU and IFRSs issued by the IASB in terms of their application to HSBC. Accordingly, HSBC’s 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by 
the IASB. 
IFRSs comprise accounting standards issued by the IASB and its predecessor body as well as interpretations 
issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) and its predecessor body. 
During 2010, HSBC adopted the following major revisions and amendments to standards: 
HSBC adopted the revised IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (‘IFRS 3’) and amendments to IAS 27 
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (‘IAS 27’). The main changes under the standards are that: 
– acquisition-related costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they 
are incurred; 
– all consideration transferred, including contingent consideration, is recognised and measured at fair value at 
the acquisition date; 
– equity interests held prior to control being obtained are remeasured to fair value at the date of obtaining 
control, and any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement; 
– an option is available, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to measure any non-controlling (previously 
referred to as minority) interests in the entity acquired either at fair value, or at the non-controlling interests’ 
proportionate share of the net identifiable assets of the entity acquired; and 
– changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a change of control are treated 
as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity. 
In terms of their application to HSBC, the revised IFRS 3 and the amendments to IAS 27 apply prospectively to 
acquisitions and transactions taking place on or after 1 January 2010, and have had no significant effect on the 
consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings. 
During 2010, in addition to the above, HSBC adopted a number of interpretations and amendments to standards 
which had an insignificant effect on the consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial 
statements of HSBC Holdings.  
(b) Differences between IFRSs and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards
There are no significant differences between IFRSs and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards in terms of 
their application to HSBC and consequently there would be no significant differences had the financial 
statements been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The Notes on the 
Financial Statements, taken together with the Report of the Directors, include the aggregate of all disclosures 
necessary to satisfy IFRSs and Hong Kong reporting requirements. 
(c) Presentation of information
Disclosures under IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’ (‘IFRS 4’) and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ 
(‘IFRS 7’) concerning the nature and extent of risks relating to insurance contracts and financial instruments 
have been included in the audited sections of the ‘Report of the Directors: Risk’ on pages 86 to 176. 
Capital disclosures under IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (‘IAS 1’) have been included in the 
audited sections of ‘Report of the Directors: Capital’ on pages 177 to 182.  251
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Disclosures relating to HSBC’s securitisation activities and structured products have been included in the audited 
section of ‘Report of the Directors: Risk’ on pages 86 to 176. 
In accordance with HSBC’s policy to provide meaningful disclosures that help investors and other stakeholders 
understand the Group’s performance, financial position and changes thereto, the information provided in the 
Notes on the Financial Statements and the Report of the Directors goes beyond the minimum levels required by 
accounting standards, statutory and regulatory requirements and listing rules. In particular, HSBC has adopted 
the British Bankers’ Association Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure (‘the BBA Code’). The BBA Code 
aims to increase the quality and comparability of banks’ disclosures and sets out five disclosure principles 
together with supporting guidance. In line with the principles of the BBA Code, HSBC assesses good practice 
recommendations issued from time to time by relevant regulators and standard setters and will assess the 
applicability and relevance of such guidance, enhancing disclosures where appropriate.  
In publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, HSBC 
Holdings has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its 
individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these financial statements. 
HSBC’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars which is also HSBC Holdings’ functional 
currency. HSBC Holdings’ functional currency is the US dollar because the US dollar and currencies linked to 
it are the most significant currencies relevant to the underlying transactions, events and conditions of its 
subsidiaries, as well as representing a significant proportion of its funds generated from financing activities. 
HSBC uses the US dollar as its presentation currency in its consolidated financial statements because the US 
dollar and currencies linked to it form the major currency bloc in which HSBC transacts and funds its business.  
(d) Comparative information
As required by US public company reporting requirements, these consolidated financial statements include 
two years of comparative information for the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated statement of changes in equity 
and related Notes on the Financial Statements. 
(e) Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future conditions. 
The use of available information and the application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates; 
actual results in the future may differ from estimates upon which financial information is prepared. Management 
believes that HSBC’s critical accounting policies where judgement is necessarily applied are those which relate 
to impairment of loans and advances, goodwill impairment, the valuation of financial instruments, the 
impairment of available-for-sale financial assets and deferred tax assets (see ‘Critical Accounting Policies’ 
on pages 33 to 36, which form an integral part of these financial statements). 
Further information about key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation 
uncertainty, are set out in the Notes on the Financial Statements. 
(f) Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of HSBC comprise the financial statements of HSBC Holdings and its 
subsidiaries made up to 31 December, with the exception of the banking and insurance subsidiaries of HSBC 
Bank Argentina, whose financial statements are made up to 30 June annually to comply with local regulations. 
Accordingly, HSBC uses their audited interim financial statements, drawn up to 31 December annually. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that HSBC gains control. The acquisition method of accounting is 
used when subsidiaries are acquired by HSBC. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration, including contingent consideration, given at the date of exchange. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The acquired 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of non-
controlling interest and the fair value of HSBC’s previously held equity interest, if any, over the net of the 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The amount of non-controlling interest is 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)

252
net assets. In a business combination achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at the 
acquisition-date fair value with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the income statement. In the event that the 
amounts of net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of non-
controlling interest and the fair value of HSBC’s previously held equity interest, the difference is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are treated as 
transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity. 
Entities that are controlled by HSBC are consolidated until the date that control ceases. 
In the context of Special Purpose Entities (‘SPE’s), the following circumstances may indicate a relationship in 
which, in substance, HSBC controls and consequently consolidates an SPE: 
– the activities of the SPE are being conducted on behalf of HSBC according to its specific business needs so 
that HSBC obtains benefits from the SPE’s operation; 
– HSBC has the decision-making powers to obtain the majority of the benefits of the activities of the SPE or, 
by setting up an ‘autopilot’ mechanism, HSBC has delegated these decision-making powers; 
– HSBC has rights to obtain the majority of the benefits of the SPE and therefore may be exposed to risks 
incidental to the activities of the SPE; or 
– HSBC retains the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPE or its assets in order to 
obtain benefits from its activities. 
HSBC performs a re-assessment of consolidation whenever there is a change in the substance of the relationship 
between HSBC and an SPE. 
All intra-HSBC transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
The consolidated financial statements of HSBC also include the attributable share of the results and reserves of 
joint ventures and associates. These are based on financial statements made up to 31 December, with the 
exception of the Bank of Communications, Ping An Insurance and Industrial Bank which are included on the 
basis of financial statements made up for the twelve months to 30 September. These are equity accounted three 
months in arrears in order to meet the requirements of the Group’s reporting timetable. HSBC has taken into 
account the effect of significant transactions or events that occur between the period from 1 October to 
31 December that would have a material effect on its results. 
(g) Future accounting developments
At 31 December 2010, a number of standards and interpretations, and amendments thereto, had been issued by 
the IASB, which are not effective for HSBC’s consolidated financial statements or the separate financial 
statements of HSBC Holdings as at 31 December 2010. Those which are expected to have a significant effect on 
HSBC’s consolidated financial statements and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings are discussed 
below.
Standards and Interpretations issued by the IASB but not endorsed by the EU
In November 2009, the IASB issued IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (‘IFRS 9’) which introduced new 
requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. In October 2010, the IASB issued 
additions to IFRS 9 relating to financial liabilities. Together, these changes represent the first phase in the 
IASB’s planned replacement of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ (‘IAS 39’) 
with a less complex and improved standard for financial instruments.  
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted. 
IFRS 9 is required to be applied retrospectively. If the standard is adopted prior to 1 January 2012, an entity 
will be exempt from the requirement to restate prior period comparative information. IFRS 9 is subject to EU 
endorsement, the timing of which is uncertain. Accordingly, HSBC is unable to provide a date by which it plans 
to apply IFRS 9. 
The main changes to the requirements of IAS 39 are summarised below. 253
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
– All financial assets that are currently in the scope of IAS 39 will be classified as either amortised cost or fair 
value. The available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and loans and receivables categories will no longer exist. 
– Classification of financial assets is based on an entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and 
their contractual cash flow characteristics. Reclassifications between the two categories are prohibited unless 
there is a change in the entity’s business model.  
– A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if two criteria are met: i) the objective of the business model 
is to hold the financial asset for the collection of the contractual cash flows; and ii) the contractual cash 
flows of the instrument are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. All other 
financial assets are measured at fair value. Movements in the fair value of financial assets classified at fair 
value are recognised in profit or loss, except for equity investments where an entity takes the option to 
designate an equity instrument that is not held for trading at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
If this option is taken, all subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income 
with no recycling of gains or losses to the income statement. Dividend income would continue to be 
recognised in the income statement. 
– An entity is only permitted to designate a financial asset otherwise meeting the amortised cost criteria at fair 
value through profit or loss if doing so significantly reduces or eliminates an accounting mismatch. This 
designation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. 
– Financial assets which contain embedded derivatives are to be classified in their entirety either at fair value 
or amortised cost depending on whether the contracts as a whole meet the relevant criteria under IFRS 9. 
– Most of IAS 39’s requirements for financial liabilities are retained, including amortised cost accounting for 
most financial liabilities. The guidance on separation of embedded derivatives will continue to apply to host 
contracts that are financial liabilities. However, fair value changes attributable to changes in own credit risk 
for financial liabilities designated under the fair value option other than loan commitments and financial 
guarantee contracts are to be presented in the statement of other comprehensive income unless the treatment 
would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. These amounts are not subsequently 
reclassified to the income statement but may be transferred within equity.  
The second and third phases in the IASB’s project to replace IAS 39 will address the impairment of financial 
assets measured at amortised cost and hedge accounting. The IASB has indicated that it expects to finalise the 
replacement of IAS 39 by June 2011. In addition, the IASB is working with the US Financial Accounting 
Standards Board to reduce inconsistencies between US GAAP and IFRS in accounting for financial instruments. 
The impact of IFRS 9 may change as a consequence of further developments resulting from the IASB’s project 
to replace IAS 39. As a result, it is impracticable to quantify the impact of IFRS 9 as at the date of publication of 
these financial statements. 
2 Summary of significant accounting policies  
(a) Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense for all financial instruments except for those classified as held for trading or 
designated at fair value (other than debt securities issued by HSBC and derivatives managed in conjunction with 
such debt securities issued) are recognised in ‘Interest income’ and ‘Interest expense’ in the income statement 
using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a way of calculating the amortised cost of a 
financial asset or a financial liability (or groups of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the 
interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through 
the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of 
the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, HSBC estimates cash flows 
considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but excluding future credit losses. The calculation 
includes all amounts paid or received by HSBC that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial 
instrument, including transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.  
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows 
for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 
2 – Summary of significant accounting policies 
254
(b) Non-interest income
Fee income is earned from a diverse range of services provided by HSBC to its customers. Fee income is 
accounted for as follows:  
− income earned on the execution of a significant act is recognised as revenue when the act is completed (for 
example, fees arising from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of, a transaction for a third-party, 
such as an arrangement for the acquisition of shares or other securities); 
− income earned from the provision of services is recognised as revenue as the services are provided (for 
example, asset management, portfolio and other management advisory and service fees); and  
− income which forms an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument is recognised as 
an adjustment to the effective interest rate (for example, certain loan commitment fees) and recorded in 
‘Interest income’ (Note 2a). 
Net trading income comprises all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and 
financial liabilities held for trading, together with the related interest income, expense and dividends.
Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value includes all gains and losses from changes 
in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. Interest 
income and expense and dividend income arising on these financial instruments are also included, except for 
interest arising from debt securities issued, and derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt securities, 
which is recognised in ‘Interest expense’ (Note 2a). 
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is the ex-dividend date for 
listed equity securities, and usually the date when shareholders have approved the dividend for unlisted equity 
securities.
(c) Operating segments
HSBC’s operating segments are organised into six geographical regions; Europe, Hong Kong, Rest of Asia-
Pacific, Middle East, North America and Latin America. Due to the nature of the Group, HSBC’s chief operating 
decision-maker regularly reviews operating activity on a number of bases, including by geographical region, 
customer group and global business, and retail businesses by geographical region. HSBC’s operating segments 
were determined to be geographical regions because the chief operating decision-maker primarily uses 
information on geographical regions in order to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing 
performance. 
Measurement of segmental assets, liabilities, income and expenses is in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policies. Segmental income and expenses include transfers between segments and these transfers are conducted 
on arm’s length terms and conditions. Shared costs are included in segments on the basis of the actual recharges 
made. 
(d) Determination of fair value
All financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. In the normal course of business, the fair value of 
a financial instrument on initial recognition is the transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration 
given or received). In certain circumstances, however, the fair value will be based on other observable current 
market transactions in the same instrument, without modification or repackaging, or on a valuation technique 
whose variables include only data from observable markets, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities 
and currency rates. When such evidence exists, HSBC recognises a trading gain or loss on inception of the 
financial instrument, being the difference between the transaction price and the fair value. When unobservable 
market data have a significant impact on the valuation of financial instruments, the entire initial difference in fair 
value indicated by the valuation model from the transaction price is not recognised immediately in the income 
statement but is recognised over the life of the transaction on an appropriate basis, or when the inputs become 
observable, or the transaction matures or is closed out, or when HSBC enters into an offsetting transaction. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value are measured in 
accordance with HSBC’s valuation methodologies, which are described in Note 16.  255
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
(e) Reclassification of financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets (other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial 
recognition) may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category in the following 
circumstances:  
− financial assets that would have met the definition of loans and receivables at initial recognition (if the 
financial asset had not been required to be classified as held for trading) may be reclassified out of the fair 
value through profit or loss category if there is the intention and ability to hold the financial asset for the 
foreseeable future or until maturity; and  
− financial assets (except financial assets that would have met the definition of loans and receivables at initial 
recognition) may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category and into another 
category in rare circumstances. 
When a financial asset is reclassified as described in the above circumstances, the financial asset is reclassified at 
its fair value on the date of reclassification. Any gain or loss already recognised in the income statement is not 
reversed. The fair value of the financial asset on the date of reclassification becomes its new cost or amortised 
cost, as applicable.   
(f) Loans and advances to banks and customers
Loans and advances to banks and customers include loans and advances originated by HSBC which are not 
classified either as held for trading or designated at fair value. Loans and advances are recognised when cash is 
advanced to a borrower. They are derecognised when either the borrower repays its obligations, or the loans are 
sold or written off, or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. They are initially 
recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Where exposures are hedged by derivatives 
designated and qualifying as fair value hedges, the carrying value of the loans and advances so hedged includes a 
fair value adjustment for the hedged risk only. 
HSBC may commit to underwrite loans on fixed contractual terms for specified periods of time, where the 
drawdown of the loan is contingent upon certain future events outside the control of HSBC. Where the loan 
arising from the lending commitment is expected to be held for trading, the commitment to lend is recorded as a 
derivative and measured at fair value through profit or loss. On drawdown, the loan is classified as held for 
trading and measured at fair value through profit or loss. Where it is not HSBC’s intention to trade but hold the 
loan, a provision on the loan commitment is only recorded where it is probable that HSBC will incur a loss. This 
may occur, for example, where a loss of principal is probable or the interest rate charged on the loan is lower 
than the cost of funding. On inception of the loan, the loan to be held is recorded at its fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For certain transactions, such as 
leveraged finance and syndicated lending activities, the cash advanced is not necessarily the best evidence of the 
fair value of the loan. For these loans, where the initial fair value is lower than the cash amount advanced (for 
example, due to the rate of interest charged on the loan being below the market rate of interest), the write-down 
is charged to the income statement. The write-down will be recovered over the life of the loan, through the 
recognition of interest income using the effective interest method, unless the loan becomes impaired. The write-
down is recorded as a reduction to other operating income.
Financial assets which have been reclassified into the loans and receivables category are initially recorded at the 
fair value at the date of reclassification and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest rate determined at the date of reclassification.
(g) Impairment of loans and advances
Losses for impaired loans are recognised promptly when there is objective evidence that impairment of a loan or 
portfolio of loans has occurred. Impairment allowances are calculated on individual loans and on groups of loans 
assessed collectively. Impairment losses are recorded as charges to the income statement. The carrying amount 
of impaired loans on the balance sheet is reduced through the use of impairment allowance accounts. Losses 
expected from future events are not recognised.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 
2 – Summary of significant accounting policies 
256
Individually assessed loans and advances 
For all loans that are considered individually significant, HSBC assesses on a case-by-case basis at each balance 
sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a loan is impaired. The criteria used by HSBC to 
determine that there is such objective evidence include:  
– known cash flow difficulties experienced by the borrower; 
– past due contractual payments of either principal or interest;  
– breach of loan covenants or conditions; 
– the probability that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial realisation; and 
– a significant downgrading in credit rating by an external credit rating agency. 
For those loans where objective evidence of impairment exists, impairment losses are determined considering the 
following factors:
– HSBC’s aggregate exposure to the customer; 
– the viability of the customer’s business model and their capacity to trade successfully out of financial 
difficulties and generate sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations; 
– the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries; 
– the likely dividend available on liquidation or bankruptcy; 
– the extent of other creditors’ commitments ranking ahead of, or pari passu with, HSBC and the likelihood 
of other creditors continuing to support the company; 
– the complexity of determining the aggregate amount and ranking of all creditor claims and the extent to 
which legal and insurance uncertainties are evident;  
– the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants) and likelihood of successful repossession; 
– the likely deduction of any costs involved in recovery of amounts outstanding;  
– the ability of the borrower to obtain, and make payments in, the currency of the loan if not denominated in 
local currency; and 
– when available, the secondary market price of the debt. 
Impairment losses are calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows of a loan at its original effective 
interest rate and comparing the resultant present value with the loan’s current carrying amount. The impairment 
allowances on individually significant accounts are reviewed at least quarterly and more regularly when 
circumstances require. This normally encompasses re-assessment of the enforceability of any collateral held and 
the timing and amount of actual and anticipated receipts. Individually assessed impairment allowances are only 
released when there is reasonable and objective evidence of a reduction in the established loss estimate.  
Collectively assessed loans and advances 
Impairment is assessed on a collective basis in two circumstances: 
– to cover losses which have been incurred but have not yet been identified on loans subject to individual 
assessment; and 
– for homogeneous groups of loans that are not considered individually significant. 
Incurred but not yet identified impairment 
Individually assessed loans for which no evidence of loss has been specifically identified on an individual basis 
are grouped together according to their credit risk characteristics for the purpose of calculating an estimated 
collective loss. This reflects impairment losses that HSBC has incurred as a result of events occurring before 
the balance sheet date, which HSBC is not able to identify on an individual loan basis, and that can be reliably 
estimated. These losses will only be individually identified in the future. As soon as information becomes 
available which identifies losses on individual loans within the group, those loans are removed from the group 
and assessed on an individual basis for impairment.  257
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
The collective impairment allowance is determined after taking into account: 
– historical loss experience in portfolios of similar credit risk characteristics (for example, by industry sector, 
loan grade or product); 
– the estimated period between impairment occurring and the loss being identified and evidenced by the 
establishment of an appropriate allowance against the individual loan; and 
– management’s experienced judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that 
the actual level of inherent losses at the balance sheet date is likely to be greater or less than that suggested 
by historical experience. 
The period between a loss occurring and its identification is estimated by local management for each identified 
portfolio.
Homogeneous groups of loans and advances 
Statistical methods are used to determine impairment losses on a collective basis for homogeneous groups of 
loans that are not considered individually significant, because individual loan assessment is impracticable. 
Losses in these groups of loans are recorded on an individual basis when individual loans are written off, at 
which point they are removed from the group. Two alternative methods are used to calculate allowances on a 
collective basis: 
 When appropriate empirical information is available, HSBC utilises roll rate methodology. This 
methodology employs statistical analyses of historical data and experience of delinquency and default to 
estimate the amount of loans that will eventually be written off as a result of the events occurring before the 
balance sheet date which HSBC is not able to identify on an individual loan basis, and that can be reliably 
estimated. Under this methodology, loans are grouped into ranges according to the number of days past due 
and statistical analysis is used to estimate the likelihood that loans in each range will progress through the 
various stages of delinquency, and ultimately prove irrecoverable. Current economic conditions are also 
evaluated when calculating the appropriate level of allowance required to cover inherent loss. The estimated 
loss is the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the original 
effective interest rate of the portfolio, and the carrying amount of the portfolio. In certain highly developed 
markets, sophisticated models also take into account behavioural and account management trends as 
revealed in, for example, bankruptcy and rescheduling statistics.
 When the portfolio size is small or when information is insufficient or not reliable enough to adopt a roll rate 
methodology, HSBC adopts a basic formulaic approach based on historical loss rate experience. 
In normal circumstances, historical experience provides the most objective and relevant information from which 
to assess inherent loss within each portfolio, though sometimes it provides less relevant information about the 
inherent loss in a given portfolio at the balance sheet date, for example, when there have been changes in 
economic, regulatory or behavioural conditions which result in the most recent trends in portfolio risk factors 
being not fully reflected in the statistical models. In these circumstances, the risk factors are taken into account 
by adjusting the impairment allowances derived solely from historical loss experience. 
These additional portfolio risk factors may include recent loan portfolio growth and product mix, unemployment 
rates, bankruptcy trends, geographic concentrations, loan product features (such as the ability of borrowers to 
repay adjustable-rate loans where reset interest rates give rise to increases in interest charges), economic 
conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets and interest rates, portfolio seasoning, account 
management policies and practices, current levels of write-offs, changes in laws and regulations and other items 
which can affect customer payment patterns on outstanding loans, such as natural disasters. These risk factors, 
where relevant, are taken into account when calculating the appropriate level of impairment allowances by 
adjusting the impairment allowances derived solely from historical loss experience. 
Roll rates, loss rates and the expected timing of future recoveries are regularly benchmarked against actual 
outcomes to ensure they remain appropriate. 
Write-off of loans and advances 
Loans (and the related impairment allowance accounts) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when 
there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 
2 – Summary of significant accounting policies 
258
from the realisation of security. In circumstances where the net realisable value of any collateral has been 
determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write off may be earlier. 
Reversals of impairment 
If the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the excess is written back by reducing the loan 
impairment allowance account accordingly. The write-back is recognised in the income statement. 
Reclassified loans and advances 
Where financial assets have been reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category to the loans and 
receivables category, the effective interest rate determined at the date of reclassification is used to calculate any 
impairment losses.  
Following reclassification, where there is a subsequent increase in the estimates of future cash receipts as a result 
of increased recoverability of those cash receipts, the effect of that increase is recognised as an adjustment to the 
effective interest rate from the date of change in the estimate rather than as an adjustment to the carrying amount 
of the asset at the date of change in the estimate. 
Assets acquired in exchange for loans 
Non-financial assets acquired in exchange for loans as part of an orderly realisation are recorded as assets held 
for sale and reported in ‘Other assets’ if the carrying amounts of the assets are recovered principally through 
sale, the assets are available for sale in their present condition and their sale is highly probable. The asset 
acquired is recorded at the lower of its fair value less costs to sell and the carrying amount of the loan (net of 
impairment allowance) at the date of exchange. No depreciation is charged in respect of assets held for sale. Any 
subsequent write-down of the acquired asset to fair value less costs to sell is recognised in the income statement, 
in ‘Other operating income’. Any subsequent increase in the fair value less costs to sell, to the extent this does 
not exceed the cumulative write-down, is also recognised in ‘Other operating income’, together with any realised 
gains or losses on disposal. 
Renegotiated loans 
Loans subject to collective impairment assessment whose terms have been renegotiated are no longer considered 
past due, but are treated as up to date loans for measurement purposes once the minimum number of payments 
required under the new arrangements have been received. These renegotiated loans are segregated from other 
parts of the loan portfolio for the purposes of collective impairment assessment, to reflect their risk profile. 
Loans subject to individual impairment assessment, whose terms have been renegotiated, are subject to ongoing 
review to determine whether they remain impaired or should be considered past due. The carrying amount of 
loans that have been classified as renegotiated retain this classification until maturity or derecognition. Interest is 
recorded on renegotiated loans taking into account the new contractual terms following renegotiation. 
(h) Trading assets and trading liabilities
Treasury bills, debt securities, equity securities, loans, deposits, debt securities in issue, and short positions in 
securities are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of 
selling or repurchasing in the near term, or they form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that 
are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking. These 
financial assets or financial liabilities are recognised on trade date, when HSBC enters into contractual 
arrangements with counterparties to purchase or sell the financial instruments, and are normally derecognised 
when either sold (assets) or extinguished (liabilities). Measurement is initially at fair value, with transaction costs 
taken to the income statement. Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured, and gains and losses from changes 
therein are recognised in the income statement in ‘Net trading income’.   259
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
(i) Financial instruments designated at fair value
Financial instruments, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they meet one or more of 
the criteria set out below, and are so designated by management. HSBC may designate financial instruments at 
fair value when the designation: 
– eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise 
from measuring financial assets or financial liabilities, or recognising gains and losses on them, on different 
bases. Under this criterion, the main classes of financial instruments designated by HSBC are:  
Long-term debt issues. The interest payable on certain fixed rate long-term debt securities issued has been 
matched with the interest on ‘receive fixed/pay variable’ interest rate swaps as part of a documented interest 
rate risk management strategy. An accounting mismatch would arise if the debt securities issued were 
accounted for at amortised cost, because the related derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in 
the fair value recognised in the income statement. By designating the long-term debt at fair value, the 
movement in the fair value of the long-term debt will also be recognised in the income statement.  
Financial assets and financial liabilities under investment contracts. Liabilities to customers under 
linked contracts are determined based on the fair value of the assets held in the linked funds, with changes 
recognised in the income statement. If no designation was made for the assets relating to the customer 
liabilities they would be classified as available for sale and the changes in fair value would be recorded 
in other comprehensive income. These financial instruments are managed on a fair value basis and 
management information is also prepared on this basis. Designation at fair value of the financial assets 
and liabilities under investment contracts allows the changes in fair values to be recorded in the income 
statement and presented in the same line.  
– applies to groups of financial assets, financial liabilities or combinations thereof that are managed, and their 
performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or 
investment strategy, and where information about the groups of financial instruments is reported to 
management on that basis. Under this criterion, certain financial assets held to meet liabilities under 
insurance contracts are the main class of financial instrument so designated. HSBC has documented risk 
management and investment strategies designed to manage such assets at fair value, taking into 
consideration the relationship of assets to liabilities in a way that mitigates market risks. Reports are 
provided to management on the fair value of the assets. Fair value measurement is also consistent with the 
regulatory reporting requirements under the appropriate regulations for these insurance operations. 
– relates to financial instruments containing one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the 
cash flows resulting from those financial instruments, including certain debt issues and debt securities held. 
The fair value designation, once made, is irrevocable. Designated financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised when HSBC enters into the contractual provisions of the arrangements with counterparties, which 
is generally on trade date, and are normally derecognised when either sold (assets) or extinguished (liabilities). 
Measurement is initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken to the income statement. Subsequently, the 
fair values are remeasured, and gains and losses from changes therein are recognised in the income statement in 
‘Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value’.  
(j) Financial investments
Treasury bills, debt securities and equity securities intended to be held on a continuing basis, other than those 
designated at fair value, are classified as available for sale or held to maturity. Financial investments are 
recognised on trade date when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties to purchase 
securities, and are normally derecognised when either the securities are sold or the borrowers repay their 
obligations. 
(i) Available-for-sale financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus direct and incremental transaction 
costs. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in ‘Available-for-sale investments – fair value gains/(losses)’ until the financial 
assets are either sold or become impaired. When available-for-sale financial assets are sold, cumulative 
gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement 
as ‘Gains less losses from financial investments’.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 
2 – Summary of significant accounting policies 
260
Interest income is recognised on available-for-sale debt securities using the effective interest rate, calculated 
over the asset’s expected life. Premiums and/or discounts arising on the purchase of dated investment 
securities are included in the calculation of their effective interest rates. Dividends are recognised in the 
income statement when the right to receive payment has been established. 
At each balance sheet date an assessment is made of whether there is any objective evidence of impairment 
in the value of a financial asset. Impairment losses are recognised if, and only if, there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the 
financial asset that can be reliably estimated. 
If the available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, the difference between the financial asset’s acquisition 
cost (net of any principal repayments and amortisation) and the current fair value, less any previous 
impairment loss recognised in the income statement, is removed from other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses for available-for-sale debt securities are recognised within ‘Loan impairment charges and 
other credit risk provisions’ in the income statement and impairment losses for available-for-sale equity 
securities are recognised within ‘Gains less losses from financial investments’ in the income statement. The 
impairment methodologies for available-for-sale financial assets are set out in more detail below. 
– Available-for-sale debt securities. When assessing available-for-sale debt securities for objective 
evidence of impairment at the reporting date, HSBC considers all available evidence, including 
observable data or information about events specifically relating to the securities which may result in a 
shortfall in recovery of future cash flows. These events may include a significant financial difficulty of 
the issuer, a breach of contract such as a default, bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, or the 
disappearance of an active market for the debt security because of financial difficulties relating to the 
issuer. 
These types of specific event and other factors such as information about the issuers’ liquidity, business 
and financial risk exposures, levels of and trends in default for similar financial assets, national and 
local economic trends and conditions, and the fair value of collateral and guarantees may be considered 
individually, or in combination, to determine if there is objective evidence of impairment of a debt 
security. 
In addition, when assessing available-for-sale asset-backed securities (‘ABS’s) for objective evidence of 
impairment, HSBC considers the performance of underlying collateral and the extent and depth of 
market price declines. Changes in credit ratings are considered but a downgrade of a security’s credit 
rating is not, of itself, evidence of impairment. The primary indicators of potential impairment are 
considered to be adverse fair value movements and the disappearance of an active market for a security. 
ABS impairment methodologies are described in more detail in ‘Securitisation exposures and other 
structured products’ on page 128.
– Available-for-sale equity securities. Objective evidence of impairment for available-for sale equity 
securities may include specific information about the issuer as detailed above, but may also include 
information about significant changes in technology, markets, economics or the law that provides 
evidence that the cost of the equity securities may not be recovered.  
A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost is also objective evidence 
of impairment. In assessing whether it is significant, the decline in fair value is evaluated against the 
original cost of the asset at initial recognition. In assessing whether it is prolonged, the decline is 
evaluated against the period in which the fair value of the asset has been below its original cost at initial 
recognition.
Once an impairment loss has been recognised on an available-for-sale financial asset, the subsequent 
accounting treatment for changes in the fair value of that asset differs depending on the nature of the 
available-for-sale financial asset concerned: 
– for an available-for-sale debt security, a subsequent decline in the fair value of the instrument is 
recognised in the income statement when there is further objective evidence of impairment as a result 
of further decreases in the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. Where there is no further  261
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
objective evidence of impairment, the decline in the fair value of the financial asset is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. If the fair value of a debt security increases in a subsequent period, and 
the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in 
the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement to the extent of the 
increase in fair value;  
– for an available-for-sale equity security, all subsequent increases in the fair value of the instrument are 
treated as a revaluation and are recognised in other comprehensive income. Impairment losses 
recognised on the equity security are not reversed through the income statement. Subsequent decreases 
in the fair value of the available-for-sale equity security are recognised in the income statement, to the 
extent that further cumulative impairment losses have been incurred in relation to the acquisition cost of 
the equity security.  
(ii) Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and 
fixed maturities that HSBC positively intends, and is able, to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments 
are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses. 
(k) Sale and repurchase agreements (including stock lending and borrowing)
When securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined price (‘repos’), they 
remain on the balance sheet and a liability is recorded in respect of the consideration received. Securities 
purchased under commitments to sell (‘reverse repos’) are not recognised on the balance sheet and the 
consideration paid is recorded in ‘Loans and advances to banks’ or ‘Loans and advances to customers’ as 
appropriate. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and recognised over the 
life of the agreement. 
Securities lending and borrowing transactions are generally secured, with collateral taking the form of securities 
or cash advanced or received. The transfer of securities to counterparties under these agreements is not normally 
reflected on the balance sheet. Cash collateral advanced or received is recorded as an asset or a liability 
respectively. 
Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet. If they are sold on to third parties, an obligation to 
return the securities is recorded as a trading liability and measured at fair value, and any gains or losses are 
included in ‘Net trading income’. 
(l) Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivatives are recognised initially, and are subsequently remeasured, at fair value. Fair values of exchange-
traded derivatives are obtained from quoted market prices. Fair values of over-the-counter derivatives are 
obtained using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models.  
Derivatives may be embedded in other financial instruments, for example, a convertible bond with an embedded 
conversion option. Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics 
and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host contract; the terms of the embedded derivative 
would meet the definition of a stand-alone derivative if they were contained in a separate contract; and the 
combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value. These embedded derivatives are measured 
at fair value with changes therein recognised in the income statement. 
Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive, or as liabilities when their fair value is 
negative. Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are only offset if the transactions are 
with the same counterparty, a legal right of offset exists, and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on a net 
basis. 
The method of recognising fair value gains and losses depends on whether derivatives are held for trading or are 
designated as hedging instruments, and if the latter, the nature of the risks being hedged. All gains and losses 
from changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading are recognised in the income statement. When 
derivatives are designated as hedges, HSBC classifies them as either: (i) hedges of the change in fair value of 
recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (‘fair value hedges’); (ii) hedges of the variability in highly 
probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecast transaction (‘cash flow 
hedges’); or (iii) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (‘net investment hedges’). Hedge accounting  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 
2 – Summary of significant accounting policies 
262
is applied to derivatives designated as hedging instruments in a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge 
provided certain criteria are met. 
Hedge accounting 
At the inception of a hedging relationship, HSBC documents the relationship between the hedging instruments 
and the hedged items, its risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking the hedge. HSBC also 
requires a documented assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether or not the 
hedging instruments, primarily derivatives, that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting 
the changes attributable to the hedged risks in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Interest on 
designated qualifying hedges is included in ‘Net interest income’. 
Fair value hedge 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are 
recorded in the income statement, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or group 
thereof that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
If a hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment to the 
carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement based on a recalculated effective 
interest rate over the residual period to maturity, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case, 
it is released to the income statement immediately. 
Cash flow hedge 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income within ‘Cash flow hedges – fair value gains/(losses)’. Any 
gain or loss in fair value relating to an ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
The accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income 
statement in the periods in which the hedged item will affect profit or loss. However, when the forecast 
transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains 
and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
any cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity until the 
forecast transaction is eventually recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in other comprehensive income is 
immediately reclassified to the income statement. 
Net investment hedge 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. A gain 
or loss on the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income; a gain or 
loss on the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement on the disposal of the foreign 
operation.
Hedge effectiveness testing 
To qualify for hedge accounting, HSBC requires that at the inception of the hedge and throughout its life, each 
hedge must be expected to be highly effective (prospective effectiveness), and demonstrate actual effectiveness 
(retrospective effectiveness) on an ongoing basis. 
The documentation of each hedging relationship sets out how the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed. The 
method adopted by an entity to assess hedge effectiveness will depend on its risk management strategy. 
For prospective effectiveness, the hedging instrument must be expected to be highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is  263
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
designated. For actual effectiveness to be achieved, the changes in fair value or cash flows must offset each 
other in the range of 80% to 125%. 
Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement in ‘Net trading income’. 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
All gains and losses from changes in the fair values of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. These gains and losses are reported in ‘Net trading income’, 
except where derivatives are managed in conjunction with financial instruments designated at fair value (other 
than derivatives managed in conjunction with debt securities issued by the Group), in which case gains and 
losses are reported in ‘Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value’. The interest on 
derivatives managed in conjunction with debt securities issued by the Group which are designated at fair value 
is recognised in ‘Interest expense’. All other gains and losses on these derivatives are reported in ‘Net income 
from financial instruments designated at fair value’.  
(m) Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired; or 
when HSBC has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows of the financial assets, and either: 
– substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred; or  
– HSBC has neither retained nor transferred substantially all the risks and rewards, but has not retained 
control.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged, 
cancelled, or expires. 
(n) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there 
is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
(o) Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
HSBC classifies investments in entities which it controls as subsidiaries. Where HSBC is a party to a contractual 
arrangement whereby, together with one or more parties, it undertakes an economic activity that is subject to 
joint control, HSBC classifies its interest in the venture as a joint venture. HSBC classifies investments in 
entities over which it has significant influence, and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, as associates. 
For the purpose of determining this classification, control is considered to be the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
HSBC Holdings’ investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment losses. An impairment loss 
recognised in prior periods shall be reversed through the income statement if, and only if, there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. 
Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method. Under this 
method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter 
for the post-acquisition change in HSBC’s share of net assets. 
Profits on transactions between HSBC and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of 
HSBC’s interest in the respective associates or joint ventures. Losses are also eliminated to the extent of HSBC’s 
interest in the associates or joint ventures unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred.
(p) Goodwill and intangible assets
(i) Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, when the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held equity  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 
2 – Summary of significant accounting policies 
264
interest in the acquiree exceed the amounts of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. If they do 
not exceed the amounts of the identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired business, the difference is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill arises on the acquisition of interests in joint 
ventures and associates when the cost of investment exceeds HSBC’s share of the net fair value of the 
associate’s or joint venture’s identifiable assets and liabilities.  
Intangible assets are recognised separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual 
or other legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken 
at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Impairment testing 
is performed at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be 
impaired, by comparing the recoverable amount from a cash-generating unit with the carrying amount of its 
net assets, including attributable goodwill. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value 
less cost to sell, and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the expected future cash flows from 
a cash-generating unit. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is 
charged to the income statement. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in joint ventures and associates is included in ‘Interests in associates 
and joint ventures’ and is not tested separately for impairment. 
At the date of disposal of a business, attributable goodwill is included in HSBC’s share of net assets in the 
calculation of the gain or loss on disposal.  
(ii) Intangible assets include the present value of in-force long-term insurance business, computer software, 
trade names, mortgage servicing rights, customer lists, core deposit relationships, credit card customer 
relationships and merchant or other loan relationships. Computer software includes both purchased and 
internally generated software. The cost of internally generated software comprises all directly attributable 
costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the software to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management. Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immediately 
as incurred. 
Intangible assets are subject to impairment review if there are events or changes in circumstances that 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where:  
– intangible assets have an indefinite useful life, or are not yet ready for use, they are tested for 
impairment annually. This impairment test may be performed at any time during the year, provided it is 
performed at the same time every year. An intangible asset recognised during the current period is 
tested before the end of the current year; and 
– intangible assets have a finite useful life, except for the present value of in-force long-term insurance 
business, they are stated at cost less amortisation and accumulated impairment losses and are amortised 
over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful life is the lower of legal duration and expected useful 
life. The amortisation of mortgage servicing rights is included within ‘Net fee income’. 
For the accounting policy governing the present value of in-force long-term insurance business (see 
Note 2y). 
(iii) Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised, generally on a straight-line basis, over their useful 
lives as follows:
Trade names ........................................................................................................................... 10 years 
Mortgage servicing rights ...................................................................................................... generally between 5 and 12 years
Internally generated software ................................................................................................. between 3 and 5 years 
Purchased software ................................................................................................................. between 3 and 5 years 
Customer/merchant relationships ........................................................................................... between 3 and 10 years 
Other ....................................................................................................................................... generally 10 years  265
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
(q) Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings are stated at historical cost, or fair value at the date of transition to IFRSs (‘deemed cost’), 
less any impairment losses and depreciation calculated to write-off the assets over their estimated useful lives as 
follows:
– freehold land is not depreciated; 
– freehold buildings are depreciated at the greater of 2% per annum on a straight-line basis or over their 
remaining useful lives; and 
– leasehold buildings are depreciated over the shorter of their unexpired terms of the leases or their remaining 
useful lives. 
Equipment, fixtures and fittings (including equipment on operating leases where HSBC is the lessor) are stated 
at cost less any impairment losses and depreciation calculated on a straight-line basis to write-off the assets over 
their useful lives, which run to a maximum of 35 years but are generally between 5 years and 20 years. 
Property, plant and equipment is subject to an impairment review if there are events or changes in circumstances 
which indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
HSBC holds certain properties as investments to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both. Investment 
properties are included in the balance sheet at fair value with changes therein recognised in the income statement 
in the period of change. Fair values are determined by independent professional valuers who apply recognised 
valuation techniques. 
(r) Finance and operating leases
Agreements which transfer to counterparties substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of 
assets, but not necessarily legal title, are classified as finance leases. When HSBC is a lessor under finance leases 
the amounts due under the leases, after deduction of unearned charges, are included in ‘Loans and advances to 
banks’ or ‘Loans and advances to customers’, as appropriate. The finance income receivable is recognised in 
‘Net interest income’ over the periods of the leases so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment 
in the leases. 
When HSBC is a lessee under finance leases, the leased assets are capitalised and included in ‘Property, plant 
and equipment’ and the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in ‘Other liabilities’. A finance lease and 
its corresponding liability are recognised initially at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of 
the minimum lease payments. Finance charges payable are recognised in ‘Net interest income’ over the period of 
the lease based on the interest rate implicit in the lease so as to give a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. When acting as lessor, HSBC includes the assets subject to 
operating leases in ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and accounts for them accordingly. Impairment losses are 
recognised to the extent that residual values are not fully recoverable and the carrying value of the assets is 
thereby impaired. When HSBC is the lessee, leased assets are not recognised on the balance sheet. Rentals 
payable and receivable under operating leases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the periods of the 
leases and are included in ‘General and administrative expenses’ and ‘Other operating income’, respectively.  
(s) Income tax
Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it 
is recognised in the same statement in which the related item appears. 
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year, calculated using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous 
years. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when HSBC intends to settle on a net basis and the legal right 
to offset exists.  
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet and the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 
2 – Summary of significant accounting policies 
266
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the assets will be realised 
or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and when HSBC has a legal right to offset.  
Deferred tax relating to actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Deferred tax relating to share-based payment transactions is recognised directly in 
equity to the extent that the amount of the estimated future tax deduction exceeds the amount of the related 
cumulative remuneration expense. Deferred tax relating to fair value re-measurements of available-for-sale 
investments and cash flow hedging instruments which are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive 
income, is also charged or credited to other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognised in the income 
statement when the deferred fair value gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
(t) Pension and other post-employment benefits
HSBC operates a number of pension and other post-employment benefit plans throughout the world. These plans 
include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans and various other post-employment benefits such as 
post-employment healthcare. 
Payments to defined contribution plans and state-managed retirement benefit plans, where HSBC’s obligations 
under the plans are equivalent to a defined contribution plan, are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
The defined benefit pension costs and the present value of defined benefit obligations are calculated at the 
reporting date by the schemes’ actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The net charge to the income 
statement mainly comprises the current service cost, plus the unwinding of the discount rate on plan liabilities, 
less the expected return on plan assets, and is presented in operating expenses. Past service costs are charged 
immediately to the income statement to the extent that the benefits have vested, and are otherwise recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits vest. Actuarial gains and losses comprise 
experience adjustments (the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has 
actually occurred), as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 
The defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of defined benefit 
obligations adjusted for unrecognised past service costs and reduced by the fair value of plan assets. Any net 
defined benefit surplus is limited to unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds 
and reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
The cost of obligations arising from other post-employment defined benefit plans, such as defined benefit health-
care plans, are accounted for on the same basis as defined benefit pension plans. 
(u) Share-based payments
The cost of share-based payment arrangements with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of 
equity instruments on the date they are granted and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, with a corresponding credit to the ‘Share-based payment reserve’. The vesting period is the 
period during which all the specified vesting conditions of a share-based payment arrangement are to be 
satisfied. The fair value of equity instruments that are made available immediately, with no vesting period 
attached to the award, are expensed immediately. 
Fair value is determined by using appropriate valuation models, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the equity instruments were granted. Vesting conditions include service conditions and performance 
conditions; any other features of a share-based payment arrangement are non-vesting conditions. Market 
performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of 
equity instruments at the date of grant, so that an award is treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market 
performance condition or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided all other vesting conditions are satisfied.  
Vesting conditions, other than market performance conditions, are not taken into account in the initial estimate 
of the fair value at the grant date. They are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments  267
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
included in the measurement of the transaction, so that the amount recognised for services received as 
consideration for the equity instruments granted shall be based on the number of equity instruments that 
eventually vest. On a cumulative basis, no expense is recognised for equity instruments that do not vest because 
of a failure to satisfy non-market performance or service conditions.  
Where an award has been modified, as a minimum, the expense of the original award continues to be recognised 
as if it had not been modified. Where the effect of a modification is to increase the fair value of an award or 
increase the number of equity instruments, the incremental fair value of the award or incremental fair value of 
the extra equity instruments is recognised in addition to the expense of the original grant, measured at the date of 
modification, over the modified vesting period. 
A cancellation that occurs during the vesting period is treated as an acceleration of vesting, and recognised 
immediately for the amount that would otherwise have been recognised for services over the vesting period. 
Where HSBC Holdings enters into share-based payment arrangements involving employees of subsidiaries, 
the cost is recognised in ‘Investment in subsidiaries’ and credited to the ‘Share-based payment reserve’ over 
the vesting period. Where a subsidiary funds the share-based payment arrangement, ‘Investment in subsidiaries’ 
is reduced by the fair value of equity instruments. 
(v) Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of HSBC’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). HSBC’s consolidated 
financial statements are presented in US dollars which is also HSBC Holdings’ functional currency.  
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing on 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange 
differences are included in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the rate of exchange at the 
date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign currency are 
translated into the functional currency using the rate of exchange at the date the fair value was determined. Any 
exchange component of a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income if 
the gain or loss on the non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any exchange 
component of a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in the income statement if the gain or loss 
on the non-monetary item is recognised in the income statement. 
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets, including related goodwill where applicable, and liabilities of 
branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional currency is not US dollars, are translated 
into the Group’s presentation currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results of 
branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional currency is not US dollars are translated 
into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period. Exchange differences arising from the 
retranslation of opening foreign currency net assets, and exchange differences arising from retranslation of the 
result for the reporting period from the average rate to the exchange rate prevailing at the period end, are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. Exchange differences on a monetary item that is part of a net 
investment in a foreign operation are recognised in the income statement of the separate financial statements. 
In consolidated financial statements these exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, exchange differences relating thereto and previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement. 
(w) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a 
current legal or constructive obligation, which has arisen as a result of past events, and for which a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Contingent liabilities, which include certain guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security, are 
possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or 
non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of HSBC; or are present 
obligations that have arisen from past events but are not recognised because it is not probable that settlement will  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 
2 – Summary of significant accounting policies 
268
require the outflow of economic benefits, or because the amount of the obligations cannot be reliably measured. 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of 
settlement is remote.  
(x) Financial guarantee contracts
Liabilities under financial guarantee contracts which are not classified as insurance contracts are recorded 
initially at their fair value, which is generally the fee received or receivable. Subsequently, financial guarantee 
liabilities are measured at the higher of the initial fair value, less cumulative amortisation, and the best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the obligations. 
HSBC Holdings has issued financial guarantees and similar contracts to other Group entities. Where it has 
previously asserted explicitly that it regards such contracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting 
applicable to insurance contracts, HSBC may elect to account for guarantees as an insurance contract. This 
election is made on a contract by contract basis, but the election for each contract is irrevocable. Where these 
guarantees have been classified as insurance contracts, they are measured and recognised as insurance liabilities. 
(y) Insurance contracts
Through its insurance subsidiaries, HSBC issues contracts to customers that contain insurance risk, financial risk 
or a combination thereof. A contract under which HSBC accepts significant insurance risk from another party by 
agreeing to compensate that party on the occurrence of a specified uncertain future event, is classified as an 
insurance contract. An insurance contract may also transfer financial risk, but is accounted for as an insurance 
contract if the insurance risk is significant. 
While investment contracts with discretionary participation features are financial instruments, they continue to 
be treated as insurance contracts as permitted by IFRS 4. 
Insurance contracts are accounted for as follows:
Premiums
Gross insurance premiums for non-life insurance business are reported as income over the term of the insurance 
contracts based on the proportion of risks borne during the accounting period. The unearned premium (the 
proportion of the business underwritten in the accounting year relating to the period of risk after the balance 
sheet date) is calculated on a daily or monthly pro rata basis.  
Premiums for life insurance contracts are accounted for when receivable, except in unit-linked insurance 
contracts where premiums are accounted for when liabilities are established. 
Reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the direct insurance 
contracts to which they relate. 
Claims and reinsurance recoveries 
Gross insurance claims for non-life insurance contracts include paid claims and movements in outstanding 
claims liabilities. 
Gross insurance claims for life insurance contracts reflect the total cost of claims arising during the year, 
including claim handling costs and any policyholder bonuses allocated in anticipation of a bonus declaration. 
Claims arising during the year include maturities, surrenders and death claims. 
Maturity claims are recognised when due for payment. Surrenders are recognised when paid or at an earlier date 
on which, following notification, the policy ceases to be included within the calculation of the related insurance 
liabilities. Death claims are recognised when notified. 
Reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim. 
Liabilities under insurance contracts 
Outstanding claims liabilities for non-life insurance contracts are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all 
claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not, together with related claim- 269
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
handling costs and a reduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries. Liabilities for claims 
incurred but not reported are made on an estimated basis, using appropriate statistical techniques. 
Liabilities under non-linked life insurance contracts are calculated by each life insurance operation based on 
local actuarial principles. 
Liabilities under unit-linked life insurance contracts are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value 
which is calculated by reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices. 
A liability adequacy test is carried out on insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of the liabilities 
is sufficient in the light of current estimates of future cash flows. When performing the liability adequacy test, all 
contractual cash flows are discounted and compared with the carrying value of the liability. When a shortfall is 
identified it is charged immediately to the income statement. 
Present value of in-force long-term insurance business 
The value placed on insurance contracts that are classified as long-term insurance business or long-term 
investment contracts with discretionary participating features (‘DPF’) and are in force at the balance sheet date is 
recognised as an asset. The asset represents the present value of the equity holders’ interest in the profits 
expected to emerge from these contracts written at the balance sheet date. 
The present value of in-force long-term insurance business and long-term investment contracts with DPF, 
referred to as ‘PVIF’, is determined by discounting the equity holders’ interest in future profits expected to 
emerge from business currently in force using appropriate assumptions in assessing factors such as future 
mortality, lapse rates and levels of expenses and a risk discount rate that reflects the risk premium attributable to 
the respective contracts. The PVIF incorporates allowances for both non-market risk and the value of financial 
options and guarantees. The PVIF asset is presented gross of attributable tax in the balance sheet and movements 
in the PVIF asset are included in ‘Other operating income’ on a gross of tax basis. 
Future profit participation 
Where contracts provide discretionary profit participation benefits to policyholders, liabilities for these contracts 
include provisions for the future discretionary benefits to policyholders. These provisions reflect actual 
performance of the investment portfolio to date and management expectation on the future performance in 
connection with the assets backing the contracts, as well as other experience factors such as mortality, lapses 
and operational efficiency, where appropriate. This benefit may arise from the contractual terms, regulation, or 
past distribution policy. 
In the case of net unrealised investment gains on contracts whose discretionary benefits principally reflect the 
actual performance of the investment portfolio, the corresponding increase in the liabilities is recognised in 
either the income statement or other comprehensive income, following the treatment of the unrealised gains on 
the relevant assets. In the case of net unrealised losses, a deferred participating asset is recognised only to the 
extent that its recoverability is highly probable. Movements in the liabilities arising from realised gains and 
losses on relevant assets are recognised in the income statement.
Investment contracts 
Customer liabilities under linked and certain non-linked investment contracts and the corresponding financial 
assets are designated at fair value. Movements in fair value are recognised in ‘Net income from financial 
investments designated at fair value’. Premiums receivable and amounts withdrawn are accounted for as 
increases or decreases in the liability recorded in respect of investment contracts. 
Liabilities under linked investment contracts are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value which is 
calculated by reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices. 
Investment management fees receivable are recognised in the income statement over the period of the provision 
of the investment management services, in ‘Net fee income’. 
The incremental costs directly related to the acquisition of new investment contracts or renewing existing 
investment contracts are deferred and amortised over the period during which the investment management 
services are provided. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

2 – Summary of significant accounting policies / 3 – Net income from financial instruments at fair value 
270
(z) Debt securities issued and deposits by customers and banks
Financial liabilities are recognised when HSBC enters into the contractual provisions of the arrangements with 
counterparties, which is generally on trade date, and initially measured at fair value, which is normally the 
consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Subsequent measurement of 
financial liabilities, other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss and financial guarantees, is 
at amortised cost, using the effective interest method to amortise the difference between proceeds received, net 
of directly attributable transaction costs incurred, and the redemption amount over the expected life of the 
instrument. 
(aa) Share capital
Shares are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other financial assets. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of equity instruments are shown in equity as a deduction from 
the proceeds, net of tax.  
HSBC Holdings plc shares held by HSBC are recognised in equity as a deduction from retained earnings until 
they are cancelled. When such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration 
received is included in equity, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and related income 
tax effects. 
(ab) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in 
value. Such investments are normally those with less than three months’ maturity from the date of acquisition, 
and include cash and balances at central banks, treasury bills and other eligible bills, loans and advances to 
banks, items in the course of collection from or in transmission to other banks, and certificates of deposit. 
(ac) Rights issues
Rights issues to acquire a fixed number of the entity’s own equity instruments for a fixed amount of any 
currency are equity instruments if the entity offers the rights issues pro rata to all of its existing owners of the 
same class of its own non-derivative equity instruments. On initial recognition, these rights are recognised in 
shareholders’ equity and are not subsequently re-measured during the offer period. Following the exercise of 
the rights and the allotment of new shares, the cash proceeds of the rights issue are recognised in shareholders’ 
equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the rights issue are shown as a deduction from the proceeds, 
net of tax.  271

HSBC has been progressively offering all new employees membership of defined contribution plans.  
The majority of the Group’s defined benefit plans are funded plans. The assets of most of the larger plans are held in 
trusts or similar funds separate from HSBC. The plans are reviewed at least annually or in accordance with local 
practice and regulations by qualified actuaries. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit 
obligations and related current service costs vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the 
plans are situated. 
Pension plans in the UK 
The largest plan exists in the UK, where the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’) covers employees of 
HSBC Bank plc and certain other employees of HSBC. This comprises a funded defined benefit plan (‘the principal 
plan’), which is closed to new entrants, and a defined contribution plan which was established in July 1996 for new 
employees.  
The latest actuarial valuation of the principal plan was made as at 31 December 2008 by C G Singer, Fellow of the 
Institute of Actuaries, of Towers Watson Limited. At that date, the market value of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension 
Scheme’s assets was £10.6bn (US$15.5bn) (including assets relating to the defined benefit plan, the defined contribution 
plan and additional voluntary contributions). The market value of the plan assets represented 77% of the amount 
expected to be required, on the basis of the assumptions adopted, to provide the benefits accrued to members after 
allowing for expected future increases in earnings, and the resulting deficit amounted to £3.2bn (US$4.7bn). The 
method adopted for this investigation was the projected unit method.  
The expected cash flows from the principal plan were projected by reference to the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) swap 
break-even curve at 31 December 2008. Salary increases were assumed to be 0.5% per annum above RPI and 
inflationary pension increases, subject to a minimum of zero per cent and a maximum of 5% (maximum of 3% per 
annum in respect of service accrued since 1 July 2009), were assumed to be in line with RPI. The projected cash 
flows were discounted at the LIBOR swap curve at 31 December 2008 plus a margin for the expected return on the 
investment strategy of 190 basis points per annum. The mortality experience of the principal plan’s pensioners over 
the three year period since the previous valuation was analysed and, on the basis of this analysis, the mortality 
assumptions were set based on the SAPS S1 series of tables which best fit the pensioner experience. Allowance was 
made for future improvements to mortality rates in line with the medium cohort projections with a minimum 
improvement rate set at 1.75% for males and 1.25% for females. The benefits payable from the defined benefit plan 
are expected to be as shown in the chart below.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

The expected cash flows of the principal plan were projected by reference to the RPI swap curve in calculating the 
liability recognised. The Occupational Pensions (Revaluation) Order 2010 confirmed the UK Government's intention 
to move to using the Consumer Prices Index (‘CPI’) rather than RPI as the inflation measure for determining the 
minimum pension increases to be applied to the statutory index-linked features of retirement benefits. Historical 
annual CPI increases have generally been lower than annual RPI increases. The rules of the principal plan prescribe 
that annual increases will be in line with RPI for pensions in payment and statutory index-linked prior to retirement 
for deferred pensions. In respect of deferred pensioners, consistent with communications to scheme members, HSBC 
continued to use RPI in calculating the liability recognised as at 31 December 2010. Using CPI to value the schemes 
liabilities in respect of deferred pensioners would result in a reduction in the principal plan’s liabilities of 
approximately US$400m based on the financial and demographic assumptions as at 31 December 2010. 
As part of the 31 December 2008 valuation, calculations were also carried out as to the amount of assets that might be 
needed to meet the liabilities if the Scheme was discontinued and the members’ benefits bought out with an insurance 
company (although in practice this may not be possible for a plan of this size) or the Trustee continued to run the plan 
without the support of HSBC. The amount required under this approach is estimated to be £19.8bn (US$28.9bn) as at 
31 December 2008. In arriving at this estimation, a more prudent assumption about future mortality was made than 
for the assessment of the ongoing position and it was assumed that the Trustee would alter the investment strategy to 
be an appropriately matched portfolio of UK government bonds. An explicit allowance for expenses was also 
included.
Information on the investment strategy of the principal plan can be found on page 172. 
In February 2010, HSBC Bank plc agreed with the Trustee of the Scheme to reduce the deficit of the plan by meeting 
a schedule of future funding payments. On 17 June 2010, HSBC Bank plc agreed with the Trustee to accelerate the 
reduction of the deficit of the plan with a special contribution of £1,760m (US$2,638m) in 2010 followed by a 
revised payment schedule in the following years, as shown below:

rate effective as at 31 December 2010. 
HSBC considers that the contributions set out above, together with investment returns at an expected level of 
240 basis points above the LIBOR swap curve, would be sufficient to meet the deficit as at 31 December 2008 over 
the agreed period. At each subsequent actuarial valuation, HSBC has agreed with the Trustee that any shortfall in  277
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
investment returns relative to this expected level, subject to a maximum of 50 basis points per annum, will be 
eliminated by payment of equal cash instalments over the remaining years to the end of this recovery plan period. 
HSBC Bank plc also agreed to make ongoing contributions to the principal plan in respect of the accrual of benefits 
of defined benefit section members at the rate of 34% of pensionable salaries (less member contributions) payable 
from 1 April 2010 until the completion of the next actuarial valuation, due as at 31 December 2011. During 2009, 
HSBC paid contributions at the rate of 38% of pensionable salaries (less member contributions) and continued 
contributions at this rate until 31 March 2010.
On 1 July 2009, changes to the design of the defined benefit section of the principal plan were made. This included 
the introduction of employee contributions, optionality concerning future benefit accrual and, with effect from 
1 April 2010, an increased normal retirement age of 65 years. In addition, enhancements to the defined contribution 
section were also introduced.
Pension plans in Hong Kong 
In Hong Kong, the HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme covers employees of The 
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and certain other employees of HSBC. The scheme comprises a 
funded defined benefit scheme (which provides a lump sum on retirement but is now closed to new members) and a 
defined contribution scheme. The latter was established on 1 January 1999 for new employees. The latest actuarial 
valuation of the defined benefit scheme was made at 31 December 2009, and was performed by Estella Chiu, fellow 
of the Society of Actuaries of the United States of America, of HSBC Insurance (Asia) Limited, a subsidiary of 
HSBC Holdings. At that valuation date, the market value of the defined benefit scheme’s assets was US$1,088m. On 
an ongoing basis, the actuarial value of the scheme’s assets represented 105% of the actuarial present value of the 
benefits accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries, and the resulting surplus 
amounted to US$71m. On a wind-up basis, the scheme’s assets represented 107% of the members’ vested benefits, 
based on current salaries, and the resulting surplus amounted to US$89m. The attained age method has been adopted 
for the valuation and the major assumptions used in this valuation were a discount rate of 6% per annum and long-
term salary increases of 5% per annum. 
Pension plans in North America 
The HSBC North America (US) Retirement Income Plan covers all employees of HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance 
and other HSBC entities in the US who have reached the age of 21 and met the one year of service participation 
requirement. The Retirement Income Plan is a funded defined benefit plan which provides final average pay benefits 
to legacy participants and cash balance benefits to all other participants. All new employees participate in the cash 
balance section of the plan. In November 2009, the Board of Directors of HSBC North America Holdings, Inc. 
('HNAH') approved actions to cease all future benefit accruals for legacy participants under the final average pay 
formula components of the HSBC North America Retirement Income Plan with effect from 1 January 2011. Affected 
employees were informed of this decision in February 2010. As a result of these changes, HNAH recorded a one-time 
curtailment gain of US$144m. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the plan to determine compliance with US statutory funding requirements was 
made at 1 January 2010 by Jennifer Jakubowski, Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, Enrolled Actuary, member of the 
American Academy of Actuaries, of Mercer. At that date, the market value of the plan's assets was US$2,321m. The 
assets represented 85% of the benefits accrued to members as valued under the provisions of the Pension Protection 
Act of 2006 that was effective for the plan year beginning 1 January 2008. The resulting deficit amounted to 
US$400m. The method employed for this valuation was the traditional unit credit method and the discount rate was 
determined using a segment rate method as selected by HSBC under the relevant regulations, which resulted in an 
effective interest rate of 6.64% per annum. 
These determinations described above for actuarial funding valuation purposes are based on different methods and 
assumptions than those used for financial reporting purposes, and as a result should neither be compared nor related 
to other determinations included in these financial statements.  
The HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme, The HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme, and 
the HSBC North America (US) Retirement Income Plan cover 34% of HSBC’s employees and represent 82% of the 
Group’s present value of defined benefit obligations.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

HSBC healthcare benefits plans 
HSBC also provides post-employment healthcare benefits under plans in the UK, the US, Bermuda, Canada, Mexico 
and Brazil, the majority of which are unfunded. The majority of post-employment healthcare benefits plans are 
defined benefit plans and are accounted for in the same manner as defined benefit pension plans. The plans are 
reviewed at least annually or in accordance with local practice and regulations by qualified actuaries. The actuarial 
assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and related current service cost vary according to the 
economic conditions of the countries in which they are situated.

Plan assets of the Group’s pension schemes included US$57m (2009: US$62m) of equities and US$1m (2009: 
US$2m) of bonds issued by HSBC and US$1,592m (2009: US$1,925m) of other assets placed or transacted with 
HSBC. The fair value of plan assets included derivatives entered into with HSBC Bank plc by the HSBC Bank (UK) 
Pension Scheme with a positive fair value of US$2,173m at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$1,049m positive fair 
value) and US$77m positive fair value (2009: US$27m positive fair value) in respect of the HSBC International Staff 
Retirement Benefits Scheme. Further details of these swap arrangements are included in Note 45.  279
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
On 17 June 2010, HSBC Bank plc made a £1,760m (US$2,638m) special contribution to accelerate the reduction of 
the deficit of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme. On the same day the Scheme used the contribution to acquire 
debt securities with a fair value of £1,760m (US$2,638m) from HSBC in a transaction at an arm’s length value 
determined by the Scheme’s independent third-party advisors. The debt securities sold comprised supranational, 
agency and government-guaranteed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate subordinated debt and auction rate 
securities. The contribution together with net actuarial gains of US$321m helped achieve a reduction in the net 
liability of the scheme from US$3,822m at 31 December 2009 to US$622m at 31 December 2010. 
The special contributions of US$228m to other plans include an additional contribution of US$187m to the HSBC 
North America (US) Retirement Income Plan which was made to maintain a minimum funding level. 
The actual return on plan assets for the year ended 31 December 2010 was a positive return of US$3,695m (2009: 
positive US$2,276m).  
HSBC expects to make US$880m of contributions to defined benefit pension plans during 2011. Benefits expected to 
be paid from the plans to retirees over each of the next five years, and in aggregate for the five years thereafter, are as

1 Rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions (except for the UK). 
2 Rate of increase for pensions in the UK is for pensions in payment only, capped at 5%. Deferred pensions are projected to increase in 
line with the assumed inflation rate.
HSBC determines the discount rates to be applied to its obligations in consultation with the plans’ local actuaries, 
on the basis of current average yields of high quality (AA rated or equivalent) debt instruments, with maturities 
consistent with those of the defined benefit obligations. In countries where there is not a deep market in corporate 
bonds, government bond yields have been used. The yield curve has been extrapolated where the term of the 
liabilities is longer than the duration of available bonds and the discount rate used then takes into account the term 
of the liabilities and the shape of the yield curve. When determining the discount rate with reference to a bond index, 
an appropriate index for the specific region has been used.

1 The expected rates of return are used to measure the net defined benefit pension costs in each subsequent year, and weighted on the 
basis of the fair value of the plan assets. 
The expected return on plan assets represents the best estimate of long-term future asset returns, which takes into 
account historical market returns plus additional factors such as the current rate of inflation and interest rates. 
Actuarial assumption sensitivities 
The discount rate is sensitive to changes in market conditions arising during the reporting period. The mortality rates 
used are sensitive to experience from the plan member profile. The following table shows the effect of changes in 
these and the other key assumptions on the principal defined benefit pension plan:

Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)
9 – Share-based payments 
286
9 Share-based payments 
During 2010, US$813m was charged to the income statement in respect of share-based payment transactions settled 
in equity (2009: US$683m; 2008: US$819m). This expense, which was computed from the fair values of the share-
based payment transactions when contracted, arose under employee share awards made in accordance with HSBC’s 
reward structures. 
Calculation of fair values 
Fair values of share options/awards, measured at the date of grant of the option/award, are calculated using a Black-
Scholes model. When modelling options/awards with vesting dependent on HSBC’s Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) over a period, the TSR performance targets are incorporated into the model using Monte Carlo simulation. 
The expected life of options depends on the behaviour of option holders, which is incorporated into the option model 
on the basis of historical observable data. The fair values calculated are inherently subjective and uncertain due to the 
assumptions made and the limitations of the model used.

1 The risk-free rate was determined from the UK gilts yield curve for the UK Savings-Related Share Option Plans. A similar yield curve
was used for the International Savings-Related Share Option Plans.
2 Expected life is not a single input parameter but a function of various behavioural assumptions.
3 Expected volatility is estimated by considering both historic average share price volatility and implied volatility derived from traded 
options over HSBC shares of similar maturity to those of the employee options.
The expected US dollar denominated dividend yield was determined to be 4.5% per annum in line with consensus 
analyst forecasts (2009: 4.5%). Prior to 2009, HSBC adopted a dividend growth model and incorporated expected 
dividends into the valuation model for share options and awards. In 2008, the expected dividend growth was 
determined to be 7% for the first year and 8% thereafter.  
The HSBC Share Plan 
The HSBC Share Plan was approved at the 2005 Annual General Meeting and amendments were approved at the 
2008 Annual General Meeting. Under this plan, Performance Share awards, Restricted Share awards and share option 
awards may be made. The aim of the HSBC Share Plan is to align the interests of executives with the creation of 
shareholder value and recognise individual performance and potential. Awards are also made under this plan for 
recruitment and retention purposes. 
Performance Share awards 
Awards of Performance Shares are made to executive Directors and other senior executives after taking into account 
individual performance in the previous year. For awards made prior to 2008, each award is divided into two equal 
parts for testing attainment against pre-determined benchmarks. One half of the award is subject to a TSR measure, 
based on HSBC’s ranking against a comparator group of 28 major banks; the other half is subject to an earnings per 
share (‘EPS’) target. For each element of the award, shares are released to the employee on a sliding scale from 30%  287
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
to 100% of the award, depending on the scale of achievement against the benchmarks, providing that the minimum 
criteria for each performance measure have been met. 
For awards made during 2008 and prospectively, each award is divided into three parts for testing attainment 
against pre-determined benchmarks. 40% of the award is subject to a TSR measure, based on a free-float market 
capitalisation ranking method; 40% is subject to an economic profit measure, calculated as the average annual 
difference between return on invested capital and HSBC’s benchmark cost of capital; and 20% is subject to an EPS 
target. For the TSR and EPS elements of the awards, shares are released to the employee on a sliding scale from 20% 
to 100% of the award, depending on the scale of achievement against the benchmarks. For the economic profit 
element of the awards, shares are released to the employee on a sliding scale from zero to 100%, depending on the 
scale of achievement against the benchmark. In all cases, shares are only released when the minimum criteria for each 
performance measure has been met. The performance conditions are measured over a three year performance period 
and awards forfeited to the extent they have not been met. 
In addition to the performance conditions mentioned above, before an award can vest, the Remuneration Committee needs 
to be satisfied that the Group has shown a sustained improvement in the period since the award was made. In determining 
this, the Remuneration Committee will take account of all relevant factors, in particular, comparisons against the TSR 
comparator group in areas such as revenue growth and mix, cost efficiency, credit performance as measured by risk-
adjusted revenues, cash return on cash invested, dividend performance and TSR.

Nil-cost share options were granted to senior executives on the basis of their performance in the previous year. The 
share options were subject to the achievement of the same corporate performance conditions as the 2005 Performance 
Share awards. The options vested after three years in the same proportion as the 2005 Performance Shares but were 
only exercisable up to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. These options have now lapsed and there are 
currently no options with outstanding performance conditions. 
Share options were also awarded to a number of employees under the HSBC Share Plan rules. These options may 
vest after three years and are exercisable up to the tenth anniversary of the date of the grant, after which they lapse.

Savings-related share option plans 
Savings-related share option plans invite eligible employees to enter into savings contracts to save up to £250 per 
month (or its equivalent in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars or euros), with the option to use the savings to acquire 
shares. The aim of the plans is to align the interests of all employees with the creation of shareholder value. The 
options are exercisable within three months following the first anniversary of the commencement of a one-year 
savings contract or within six months following either the third or the fifth anniversaries of the commencement of 
three-year or five-year savings contracts, respectively. The exercise price is set at a 20% (2009: 20%) discount to the 
market value immediately preceding the date of invitation (except for the one-year options granted under the US sub-
plan where a 15% discount is applied).

after taking into account the employees’ performance in the previous year, their potential and retention requirements. 
Restricted shares were also awarded as part-deferral of annual bonuses or for recruitment purposes. Shares were 
awarded without corporate performance conditions and in most cases fully vest within three years from the date of 
award, providing the employees have remained continuously employed by HSBC for the period.

HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan 
The HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan was a long-term incentive plan under which certain HSBC employees 
between 2000 and 2005 were awarded share options. The aim of the plan was to align the interests of those higher 
performing employees with the creation of shareholder value. In most jurisdictions, this was achieved by setting 
certain TSR targets which would normally have to be attained in order for the awards to vest. Options were granted at 
market value and are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to 
vesting conditions. Options granted after May 2005 are made under the HSBC Share Plan.

The HSBC Holdings Executive Share Option Scheme was a long-term incentive plan under which certain senior 
HSBC employees were awarded share options before the adoption of the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan 
in 2000. The aim of the plan was to align the interests of those higher performing senior employees with the creation 
of shareholder value. This was achieved by setting certain TSR targets to be attained in order for the awards to vest. 
Options were granted at market value and were exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of 
grant, subject to vesting conditions. No awards have been made under this plan since 2000 and all options have now

HSBC France and subsidiary company plans 
Before its acquisition by HSBC in 2000, HSBC France and certain of its subsidiaries operated employee share option 
plans. Options over HSBC France shares granted between 1994 and 1999 vested upon announcement of HSBC’s 
agreement to acquire HSBC France and were therefore included in the valuation of HSBC France.
HSBC France granted 909,000 options in 2000 after the public announcement of the acquisition. The options vested 
on 1 January 2002. The HSBC France shares obtained on exercise of the options were exchangeable for HSBC 
Holdings ordinary shares of US$0.50. Options were granted at market value and are exercisable within ten years of 
the date of grant. Movements in options granted after the public announcement are shown below.

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
At 31 December 2009, the remaining contractual life for options outstanding was 0.3 years.
At the date of its acquisition, certain of HSBC France’s subsidiary companies also operated employee share option 
plans. On exercise of certain of these options, the subsidiary shares are exchanged for HSBC ordinary shares. The 
total number of HSBC ordinary shares exchanged under such arrangements in 2010 was 9,281 (2009: 70,257).  
HSBC Finance 
Upon acquisition, HSBC Finance share options previously granted were converted to share options over HSBC 
ordinary shares of US$0.50 each at a rate of 2.675 HSBC share options (the same ratio as the Exchange Offer for 
HSBC Finance) for each HSBC Finance share option. Options granted under HSBC Finance’s own share option 
schemes prior to the announcement of the acquisition by HSBC in November 2002 vested as options over HSBC 
shares upon acquisition by HSBC. Options granted after the announcement of the acquisition but prior to its 
completion on 28 March 2003 generally vest equally over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant.

1 The change in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008 gave rise to a blended tax rate for 2008 of 
28.5%. 
2 In August 2009, the UK Government enacted legislation that gains or losses on transactions designated to hedge foreign exchange
exposures connected to rights issues should be disregarded for tax purposes. 
3 Low income housing tax credits arise in the US and are designed to encourage the provision of rental housing for low income 
households. 
4 This relates to the transfer of HSBC Bank Canada, which was part of the sub-group headed by HSBC North America Holdings Inc, to
HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited. A taxable gain arises on this disposal but the crystallisation of deferred tax assets and 
utilisation of current year foreign tax credits meant that no tax was paid on this transfer. 
5 2009 and 2008 include the effect of previously unrecognised temporary differences principally related to the recognition of foreign tax 
credits and trading losses, respectively. 
On 22 June 2010, the UK Government announced its intention to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 
24%. It is proposed that the reduction will be phased in over a period of four years with a 1% decrease in the main 
corporation tax rate for each year starting on 1 April 2011. As at 31 December 2010, only the initial phase to reduce 
the main rate of UK corporation tax from 28% to 27% has been substantively enacted and therefore only this change 
has been reflected in the amounts recognised as at that date. However, it is not expected that the future proposed rate 
changes will have a significant effect on the net UK deferred tax asset recognised at 31 December 2010 of US$383m.

The amount of temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits excluding the US, for which no 
deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet is US$2,473m (2009: US$1,723m). Of this amount, US$2,366m 
(2009: US$1,608m) has no expiry date, US$107m (2009: US$115m) is scheduled to expire within 10 years (2009: 10 
years) and the remaining will expire after 10 years. The deferred tax asset unrecognised in respect of these items is 
US$601m (2009: US$491m), of which US$564m (2009: US$450m) has no expiry date, US$37m (2009: US$40m) is 
scheduled to expire within 10 years (2009: 10 years) and the remaining will expire after 10 years. 
In the US, the deferred tax asset unrecognised in respect of temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax 
credits was US$1,715m (2009: US$1,577m), of which US$70m (2009: US$52m) has no expiry date, US$908m 
(2009: US$932m) is scheduled to expire within 10 years (2009: 10 years) and the remaining will expire within 
20 years.  
The US deferred tax assets not recognised of US$1,715m (2009: US$1,577m) comprise unused state losses of 
US$694m (2009: US$854m), unused federal losses of US$43m (2009: nil), unused tax credits of US$908m (2009: 
US$716m) and other differences of US$70m (2009: US$7m). The gross temporary difference in respect of the 
unused state losses is US$12,486m (2009: US$15,517m), the unused federal losses are US$122m (2009: nil), the 
other differences are US$200m (2009: US$20m), while no gross equivalent is applied to the unused tax credits.
Deferred tax of US$89m (2009: US$94m) has been provided in respect of distributable reserves of associates that, on 
distribution, would attract withholding tax.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Group’s investments in subsidiaries and branches where remittance 
is not contemplated, and for those associates and interests in joint ventures where it has been determined that no 
additional tax will arise. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments where no 
deferred tax liability is recognised is nil (2009: nil; 2008: US$38,443m). Following the change in the UK tax 
treatment of dividends on 1 July 2009, no UK tax is expected to arise on distributions from group entities and no 
temporary difference exists except where withholding tax or other foreign tax could arise on the investments. No 
amount is disclosed for the unrecognised deferred tax or the 2010 and 2009 temporary differences associated with 
such investments, as it is impracticable to determine the amount of income taxes that would be payable when any 
temporary differences reverse. 
Of the total net deferred tax assets of US$7.0bn at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$8.6bn), US$4.0bn (2009: 
US$5.1bn) arose in respect of HSBC’s US operations where there has been a recent history of losses. Management’s 
analysis of the recognition of these deferred tax assets significantly discounts any future expected profits from the US 
operations and relies to a greater extent on capital support to the US operations from HSBC Holdings plc, including 
tax planning strategies implemented in relation to such support. Further to the implementation of this strategy, the 
transfer of HSBC Bank Canada, which was part of the sub-group headed by HSBC North America Holdings Inc., to 
HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited in an internal reorganisation on 31 January 2010, provided substantial 
support for the recoverability of the US deferred tax assets. The associated taxable gain arising in the US operations  295
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
reduced the deferred tax assets by US$1.2bn. US legislation enacted on 6 November 2009 allowed for an extended 
carryback period for certain federal tax net operating losses. This had the effect of crystallising deferred tax assets 
related to such losses at 31 December 2009 by approximately US$1.6bn. Currently, it has been determined that the 
US operations primary tax planning strategy, in combination with other tax planning strategies, provides support for 
the realisation of the net deferred tax assets recorded for the US operations. Such determination is based on HSBC’s 
business forecasts and assessments as to the most efficient and effective deployment of HSBC capital, most 
importantly including the length of time such capital will need to be maintained in the US for purposes of the tax 
planning strategy.  
The deferred tax assets relating to HSBC’s Brazil operation is US$0.9bn (2009: US$1.3bn) and the Mexican 
operation is US$0.7bn (2009: US$0.6bn). On the evidence available, including management projections of income 
and the state of the Brazilian and Mexican economies, there will be sufficient taxable income generated by the 
businesses to support these assets.

296
The Directors declared after the end of the year a fourth interim dividend in respect of the financial year ended 
31 December 2010 of US$0.12 per ordinary share, a distribution of approximately US$2,125m. The fourth interim 
dividend will be payable on 5 May 2011 to holders of record on 17 March 2011 on the Hong Kong Overseas Branch 
Register and 18 March 2011 on the Principal Register in the UK or the Bermuda Overseas Branch Register. No 
liability is recorded in the financial statements in respect of the fourth interim dividend for 2010. 
On 18 January 2011, HSBC paid a further coupon on the capital securities of US$0.508 per security, a distribution of 
US$44m. No liability is recorded in the balance sheet at 31 December 2010 in respect of this coupon payment. 
12 Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per ordinary share was calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the 
parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own shares held. Diluted 
earnings per ordinary share was calculated by dividing the basic earnings, which require no adjustment for the effects 
of dilutive potential ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own 
shares held, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.

13 Segmental analysis 
HSBC’s operating segments are organised into six geographical regions, Europe, Hong Kong, Rest of Asia-Pacific, 
Middle East, North America and Latin America. Due to the nature of the Group, HSBC’s chief operating decision-
maker regularly reviews operating activity on a number of bases, including by geographical region, customer group 
and global business and retail businesses by geographical region. The segmental analysis is presented on a 
geographical basis because, although information is reviewed on a number of bases, capital resources are allocated 
and performance is assessed primarily by geographical region. Also, the economic conditions of each geographical 
region are highly influential in determining the performance of the different businesses carried out in each region. As 
a result, provision of segmental information on a geographical basis provides the most meaningful basis from which  297
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
to assess performance. HSBC’s chief operating decision-maker is the Group Management Board which operates as a 
general management committee under the direct authority of the Board. 
Geographical information is classified by the location of the principal operations of the subsidiary or, for The 
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC Bank, HSBC Bank Middle East and HSBC Bank USA, by the 
location of the branch responsible for reporting the results or advancing the funds. 
Information provided to HSBC’s chief operating decision-maker to make decisions about allocating resources to, and 
assessing the performance of, operating segments is measured in accordance with IFRSs. The financial information 
shown below includes the effects of intra-HSBC transactions between operating segments which are conducted on an 
arm’s length basis and eliminated in a separate column. Shared costs are included in operating segments on the basis 
of the actual recharges made.

14 Analysis of financial assets and liabilities by measurement basis 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on an ongoing basis either at fair value or at amortised cost. The 
summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 describes how the classes of financial instruments are measured, 
and how income and expenses, including fair value gains and losses, are recognised. The following table analyses the 
carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities by category as defined in IAS 39 and by balance sheet heading.  304

The classification of financial instruments is determined in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 2. 
The use of assumptions and estimation in valuing financial instruments is described on page 34. 
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing 
parties in an arm’s length transaction.  
The following table sets out the financial instruments carried at fair value.

The reduction of Level 1 trading assets reflects the deconsolidation of CNAV funds which is discussed further on 
page 363. The increase in Level 1 available-for-sale instruments reflects increased investment in government and US 
agency securities. The rise in the size of Level 2 trading assets and liabilities reflects an increase in repo and reverse 
repo activity. 
There were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 in the period. 
Control framework 
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that they are either determined or validated by a 
function independent of the risk-taker.  309
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
For all financial instruments where fair values are determined by reference to externally quoted prices or observable 
pricing inputs to models, independent price determination or validation is utilised. In inactive markets, direct 
observation of a traded price may not be possible. In these circumstances, HSBC will source alternative market 
information to validate the financial instrument’s fair value, with greater weight given to information that is 
considered to be more relevant and reliable. The factors that are considered in this regard are, inter alia:
• the extent to which prices may be expected to represent genuine traded or tradeable prices; 
• the degree of similarity between financial instruments; 
• the degree of consistency between different sources; 
• the process followed by the pricing provider to derive the data; 
• the elapsed time between the date to which the market data relates and the balance sheet date; and 
• the manner in which the data was sourced.
For fair values determined using a valuation model, the control framework may include, as applicable, independent 
development or validation of (i) the logic within valuation models; (ii) the inputs to those models; (iii) any 
adjustments required outside the valuation models; and (iv) where possible, model outputs. Valuation models are 
subject to a process of due diligence and calibration before becoming operational and are calibrated against external 
market data on an ongoing basis. 
The fair value governance structure is as follows:

Determination of fair value
Fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy: 
• Level 1 – quoted market price: financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active 
markets. 
• Level 2 – valuation technique using observable inputs: financial instruments with quoted prices for similar 
instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and 
financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable. 
• Level 3 – valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: financial instruments valued using valuation 
techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable. 
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market. The fair values of financial instruments 
that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices for assets held and offer prices for liabilities issued. Where a 
financial instrument has a quoted price in an active market and it is part of a portfolio, the fair value of the portfolio is 
calculated as the product of the number of units and quoted price and no block discounts are applied. In the event that 
the market for a financial instrument is not active, a valuation technique is used.
The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, but is not restricted to, the consideration of factors such 
as the magnitude and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid/offer spreads. The 
bid/offer spread represents the difference in prices at which a market participant would be willing to buy compared 
with the price at which they would be willing to sell. In inactive markets, obtaining assurance that the transaction 
price provides evidence of fair value or determining the adjustments to transaction prices that are necessary to 
measure the fair value of the instrument requires additional work during the valuation process.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)
16 – Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value 
310
Valuation techniques incorporate assumptions about factors that other market participants would use in their 
valuations, including interest rate yield curves, exchange rates, volatilities, and prepayment and default rates. During 
the year, as a result of evolving market practice in the pricing of certain interest rate derivatives, HSBC has, for single 
currency swaps with collateralised counterparties and in significant major currencies, adopted a discounting curve 
that reflects the overnight interest rate (‘OIS discounting’). Previously, in line with market practice, discount curves 
did not reflect this overnight interest rate component but were based on a term LIBOR rate. The financial effect of 
this change was not significant. 
The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data. However, certain financial instruments are 
valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable, 
and for them, the derivation of fair value is more judgemental. An instrument in its entirety is classified as valued 
using significant unobservable inputs if, in the opinion of management, a significant proportion of the instrument’s 
carrying amount and/or inception profit (‘day 1 gain or loss’) is driven by unobservable inputs. ‘Unobservable’ in this 
context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an 
arm’s length transaction would be likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no data available at all upon 
which to base a determination of fair value (consensus pricing data may, for example, be used).  
In certain circumstances, primarily where debt is hedged with interest rate derivatives, HSBC records its own debt in 
issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific instrument concerned, if available. 
When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for 
which are either based upon quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument, or are estimated by comparison 
with quoted prices in an active market for similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of 
applying the credit spread which is appropriate to HSBC’s liabilities. The change in fair value of issued debt 
securities attributable to the Group’s own credit spread is computed as follows: for each security at each reporting 
date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar securities for the 
same issuer. Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using a LIBOR-based discount curve. The 
difference in the valuations is attributable to the Group’s own credit spread. This methodology is applied consistently 
across all securities. 
Structured notes issued and certain other hybrid instrument liabilities are included within trading liabilities and are 
measured at fair value. The credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which HSBC 
issues structured notes. These market spreads are smaller than credit spreads observed for plain vanilla debt or in the 
credit default swap markets. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by HSBC reverse over the contractual 
life of the debt, provided that the debt is not repaid at a premium or a discount. 
Fair value adjustments 
Fair value adjustments are adopted when HSBC considers that there are additional factors that would be considered 
by a market participant that are not incorporated within the valuation model. The magnitude of fair value adjustments 
depends upon many entity-specific factors, and therefore fair value adjustments may not be comparable across the 
banking industry. 
HSBC classifies fair value adjustments as either ‘risk-related’ or ‘model-related’. The majority of these adjustments 
relate to Global Banking and Markets. 
Movements in the level of fair value adjustments do not necessarily result in the recognition of profits or losses 
within the income statement. For example, as models are enhanced, fair value adjustments may no longer be required. 
Similarly, fair value adjustments will decrease when the related positions are unwound, but this may not result in 
profit or loss.  311

The most significant fair value adjustment movement related to the release of US$490m of credit risk adjustments 
held for monoline insurers of which US$336m resulted from commutations. The commutations did not result 
in a material gain or loss. The remainder of the decrease in the credit risk adjustment derived primarily from 
commutations or restructures with non-monoline counterparties and internal credit rating upgrades of certain 
counterparties.
Risk-related adjustments 
Bid-Offer
IAS 39 requires that portfolios are marked at bid or offer, as appropriate. Valuation models will typically generate 
mid market values. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the cost that would be incurred if substantially all residual net 
portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by disposing of or unwinding the actual 
position.
Uncertainty
Certain model inputs may be less readily determinable from market data, and/or the choice of model itself may be 
more subjective. In these circumstances, there exists a range of possible values that the financial instrument or market 
parameter may assume and an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the likelihood that in estimating the fair value 
of the financial instrument, market participants would adopt rather more conservative values for uncertain parameters 
and/or model assumptions than those used in the valuation model. 
Credit risk adjustment 
The credit risk adjustment is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect within fair value 
the possibility that the counterparty may default and HSBC may not receive the full market value of the transactions.  
Model-related adjustments 
Model limitation 
Models used for portfolio valuation purposes may be based upon a simplifying set of assumptions that do not capture 
all material market characteristics. Additionally, markets evolve, and models that were adequate in the past may 
require development to capture all material market characteristics in current market conditions. In these 
circumstances, model limitation adjustments are adopted. As model development progresses, model limitations are 
addressed within the valuation models and a model limitation adjustment is no longer needed. 
Inception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves) 
Inception profit adjustments are adopted where the fair value estimated by a valuation model is based on one or more 
significant unobservable inputs. The accounting for inception profit adjustments is discussed on page 254. An 
analysis of the movement in the deferred Day 1 P&L reserve is provided on page 324.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Credit risk adjustment methodology 
HSBC calculates a separate credit risk adjustment for each HSBC legal entity, and within each entity for each 
counterparty to which the entity has exposure. The calculation of the monoline credit risk adjustment and sensitivity 
to different assumptions is described on page 137. Of the total credit risk adjustment at 31 December 2010 of 
US$1,355m (2009: US$2,172m), US$836m (2009: US$1,163m) relates to the credit risk adjustment taken against 
non-monoline counterparties. The methodology for calculating the credit risk adjustment for non-monoline 
counterparties is described below. 
HSBC calculates the credit risk adjustment by applying the probability of default of the counterparty to the 
expected positive exposure to the counterparty, and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. 
The calculation is performed over the life of the potential exposure. 
The probability of default is based on HSBC’s internal credit rating for the counterparty, taking into account 
how credit ratings may deteriorate over the duration of the exposure through the use of historical rating transition 
matrices. For most products, to calculate the expected positive exposure to a counterparty, HSBC uses a simulation 
methodology to incorporate the range of potential exposures across the portfolio of transactions with the counterparty 
over the life of an instrument. The simulation methodology includes credit mitigants such as counterparty netting 
agreements and collateral agreements with the counterparty. A standard loss given default assumption of 60% is 
generally adopted. HSBC does not adjust derivative liabilities for HSBC’s own credit risk, such an adjustment is 
often referred to as a ‘debit valuation adjustment’. 
For certain types of exotic derivatives where the products are not currently supported by the simulation, or 
for derivative exposures in smaller trading locations where the simulation tool is not yet available, HSBC adopts 
alternative methodologies. These may involve mapping to the results for similar products from the simulation tool 
or where such a mapping approach is not appropriate, a simplified methodology is used, generally following the same 
principles as the simulation methodology. The calculation is applied at a trade level, with more limited recognition of 
credit mitigants such as netting or collateral agreements than used in the simulation methodology described 
previously. 
The methodologies do not, in general, account for ‘wrong-way risk’. Wrong-way risk arises where the 
underlying value of the derivative prior to any credit risk adjustment is positively correlated to the probability 
of default of the counterparty. Where there is significant wrong-way risk, a trade specific approach is applied to 
reflect the wrong-way risk within the valuation. 
HSBC includes all third party counterparties in the credit risk adjustment calculation and does not net credit risk 
adjustments across HSBC Group entities. During 2010, there were no material changes made by HSBC to the 
methodologies used to calculate the credit risk adjustment.

Private equity and strategic investments 
HSBC’s private equity and strategic investments are generally classified as available for sale and are not traded in 
active markets. In the absence of an active market, an investment’s fair value is estimated on the basis of an analysis 
of the investee’s financial position and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors, as well as by reference to 
market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market, or the price at which similar companies have 
changed ownership. 
Asset-backed securities 
Illiquidity and a lack of transparency in the market for ABSs have resulted in less observable data being available. 
While quoted market prices are generally used to determine the fair value of these securities, valuation models are 
used to substantiate the reliability of the limited market data available and to identify whether any adjustments to 
quoted market prices are required. For ABSs including residential MBSs, the valuation uses an industry standard 
model and the assumptions relating to prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity based on collateral type, and 
performance, as appropriate. The valuations output is benchmarked for consistency against observable data for 
securities of a similar nature.  
Loans, including leveraged finance and loans held for securitisation 
Loans held at fair value are valued from broker quotes and/or market data consensus providers when available. In the 
absence of an observable market, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These techniques include 
discounted cash flow models, which incorporate assumptions regarding an appropriate credit spread for the loan, 
derived from other market instruments issued by the same or comparable entities.  
Structured notes 
The fair value of structured notes valued using a valuation technique is derived from the fair value of the underlying 
debt security, and the fair value of the embedded derivative is determined as described in the paragraph below 
on derivatives. 
Derivatives
OTC (i.e. non-exchange traded) derivatives are valued using valuation models. Valuation models calculate the 
present value of expected future cash flows, based upon ‘no-arbitrage’ principles. For many vanilla derivative 
products, such as interest rate swaps and European options, the modelling approaches used are standard across the 
industry. For more complex derivative products, there may be some differences in market practice. Inputs to 
valuation models are determined from observable market data wherever possible, including prices available from 
exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market 
directly, but can be determined from observable prices via model calibration procedures or estimated from historical 
data or other sources. Examples of inputs that may be unobservable include volatility surfaces, in whole or in part, for 
less commonly traded option products, and correlations between market factors such as foreign exchange rates, 
interest rates and equity prices. The valuation of derivatives with monolines is discussed on page 137.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Available-for-sale securities: Greater pricing certainty of valuations in ABS markets (particularly MBS) has resulted 
in the transfer of assets out of Level 3 during 2010. Transfers into Level 3 were primarily related to strategic 
investments in Asia.  
Trading assets: Greater pricing certainty of valuations in ABS markets (particularly MBS) and certain corporate 
bonds has resulted in the transfer of assets out of Level 3 during 2010. Transfers into Level 3 were driven by certain 
other corporate bonds for which pricing certainty decreased. Sales relate to disposals of whole loans, municipal bonds 
and various ABSs. 
Derivative assets: Transfers out of Level 3 were driven by increased observability of longer-dated equity index 
volatility, particularly in Asian markets. Transfers in relate primarily to quanto structured credit transactions. 
Commutations of monoline derivatives and the narrowing of credit spreads have led to an overall reduction in the 
value of Level 3 assets. 
Trading liabilities: Transfers out of and in to Level 3 relate primarily to increased / decreased observability of 
structured notes with embedded equity derivatives. New issuances relate to structured notes particularly those with 
embedded equity derivatives issued in the US. 
Derivative liabilities: The increased observability in certain OTC equity derivative markets primarily in Asia led to 
transfers out of Level 3. Transfers in were driven by structured credit transactions.  
Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions to reasonably possible alternatives 
As discussed above, the fair value of financial instruments are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation 
techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions 
in the same instrument and are not based on observable market data. The following table shows the sensitivity of 
these fair values to reasonably possible alternative assumptions:

1 Derivatives, trading assets and trading liabilities are presented as one category to reflect the manner in which these financial
instruments are risk-managed. 
The decrease in the effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs in relation to derivatives, trading assets 
and trading liabilities during the year primarily reflected the decreased sensitivity to monoline credit risk 
adjustment assumptions as exposures have reduced. The decrease in the effect of changes in significant 
unobservable inputs for available-for-sale assets arose from increased pricing certainty in respect of ABSs.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result 
of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters using statistical techniques. When parameters are not amenable 
to statistical analysis, quantification of uncertainty is judgemental. 
When the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the above table 
reflects the most favourable or most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually. 
In respect of private equity investments, in many of the methodologies, the principal assumption is the valuation 
multiple to be applied to the main financial indicators. This may be determined with reference to multiples for 
comparable listed companies and includes discounts for marketability. 
For ABSs, the principal assumptions in the models are based on benchmark information about prepayment speeds, 
default rates, loss severities and the historical performance of the underlying assets.  
For leveraged finance, loans held for securitisation and derivatives with monolines the principal assumption concerns 
the appropriate value to be attributed to the counterparty credit risk. This requires estimation of exposure at default, 
probability of default and recovery in the event of default. For loan transactions, assessment of exposure at default is 
straightforward. For derivative transactions, a future exposure profile is generated on the basis of current market data. 
Probabilities of default and recovery levels are estimated using available evidence, which may include financial 
information, historical experience, CDS spreads and consensus recovery levels. 
For structured notes and other derivatives, principal assumptions concern the value to be attributed to future volatility 
of asset values and the future correlation between asset values. These principal assumptions include credit volatilities 
and correlations used in the valuation of structured credit derivatives (including leveraged credit derivatives). For 
such unobservable assumptions, estimates are based on available market data, which may include the use of a proxy 
method to derive a volatility or a correlation from comparable assets for which market data is more readily available, 
and/or an examination of historical levels.   317

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Valuation
The calculation of fair value incorporates HSBC’s estimate of the amount at which financial assets could be 
exchanged, or financial liabilities settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It 
does not reflect the economic benefits and costs that HSBC expects to flow from the instruments’ cash flows over 
their expected future lives. Other reporting entities may use different valuation methodologies and assumptions in 
determining fair values for which no observable market prices are available, so comparisons of fair values between 
entities may not be meaningful and users are advised to exercise caution when using this data. 
Loans and advances to banks and customers 
The fair value of loans and advances is based on observable market transactions, where available. In the absence of 
observable market transactions, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow models.  
Performing loans are grouped, as far as possible, into homogeneous pools segregated by maturity and interest rates 
and the contractual cash flows are generally discounted using HSBC’s estimate of the discount rate that a market 
participant would use in valuing instruments with similar maturity, re-pricing and credit risk characteristics.  
The fair value of a loan portfolio reflects both loan impairments at the balance sheet date and estimates of market 
participants’ expectations of credit losses over the life of the loans. For impaired loans, fair value is estimated by 
discounting the future cash flows over the time period they are expected to be recovered.  
Financial investments 
The fair values of listed financial investments are determined using bid market prices. The fair values of unlisted 
financial investments are determined using valuation techniques that take into consideration the prices and future 
earnings streams of equivalent quoted securities.  
Deposits by banks and customer accounts 
For the purpose of estimating fair value, deposits by banks and customer accounts are grouped by remaining 
contractual maturity. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for 
deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of a deposit repayable on demand is assumed to be the 
amount payable on demand at the balance sheet date.  
Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities 
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date where available, or by reference to 
quoted market prices for similar instruments. 
The fair values in this note are stated at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amounts which 
will actually be paid on the maturity or settlement dates of the instruments. In many cases, it would not be possible to 
realise immediately the estimated fair values given the size of the portfolios measured. Accordingly, these fair values 
do not represent the value of these financial instruments to HSBC as a going concern.

The methods used by HSBC Holdings to determine fair values of financial instruments for the purpose of 
measurement and disclosure are described above.

During the second half of 2008, HSBC reclassified US$15.3bn and US$2.6bn of financial assets from the held-for-
trading category to the loans and receivables and available-for-sale classifications, respectively, as permitted by the 
relevant amendment to IAS 39 and explained in Note 2(e) on the Financial Statements. No further reclassifications 
were undertaken by HSBC in 2010 and 2009.

increasing volumes of transactions, particularly interest rate derivatives and credit derivatives, were executed through 
clearing houses, where the settlement arrangements satisfied the IFRS netting criteria.

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, 
bonds, interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, commodities and equity or other indices. Derivatives enable 
users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to credit or market risks. HSBC makes markets in derivatives for its 
customers and uses derivatives to manage its exposure to credit and market risks. 
Derivatives are carried at fair value and shown in the balance sheet as separate totals of assets and liabilities. A 
description of how the fair value of derivatives is derived is set out on page 313. Derivative assets and liabilities on 
different transactions are only set off if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal right of set-off exists 
and the cash flows are intended to be settled on a net basis.
Use of derivatives 
HSBC transacts derivatives for three primary purposes: to create risk management solutions for clients, to manage the 
portfolio risks arising from client business and to manage and hedge HSBC’s own risks. Derivatives (except for 
derivatives which are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined in IAS 39) are held for trading. The held 
for trading classification includes two types of derivatives: those used in sales and trading activities, and those used 
for risk management purposes but which for various reasons do not meet the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting. 
The second category includes derivatives managed in conjunction with financial instruments designated at fair value. 
These activities are described more fully below. 
HSBC’s derivative activities give rise to significant open positions in portfolios of derivatives. These positions are 
managed constantly to ensure that they remain within acceptable risk levels, with matching deals being utilised to 
achieve this where necessary. When entering into derivative transactions, HSBC employs the same credit risk 
management procedures to assess and approve potential credit exposures that are used for traditional lending. 
Trading derivatives 
Most of HSBC’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring 
and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or 
expected risks. Trading activities in derivatives are entered into principally for the purpose of generating profits from 
short-term fluctuations in price or margin. Positions may be traded actively or be held over a period of time to benefit 
from expected changes in exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices or other market parameters. Trading includes 
market-making, positioning and arbitrage activities. Market-making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other 
market participants for the purpose of generating revenues based on spread and volume; positioning means managing 
market risk positions in the expectation of benefiting from favourable movements in prices, rates or indices; arbitrage 
involves identifying and profiting from price differentials between markets and products. 
As mentioned above, other derivatives classified as held for trading include non-qualifying hedging derivatives, 
ineffective hedging derivatives and the components of hedging derivatives that are excluded from assessing hedge 
effectiveness. Non-qualifying hedging derivatives are entered into for risk management purposes but do not meet the 
criteria for hedge accounting. These include derivatives managed in conjunction with financial instruments 
designated at fair value. 
Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives, including the contractual interest, that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are reported in ‘Net trading income’, except for derivatives managed in conjunction with 
financial instruments designated at fair value, where gains and losses are reported in ‘Net income from financial 
instruments designated at fair value’, together with the gains and losses on the economically hedged items. Where the 
derivatives are managed with debt securities in issue, the contractual interest is shown in ‘interest expense’ together 
with the interest payable on the issued debt. Substantially all of HSBC Holdings’ derivatives entered into with HSBC 
undertakings are managed in conjunction with financial liabilities designated at fair value. 
The notional contract amounts of derivatives held for trading purposes indicate the nominal value of transactions 
outstanding at the balance sheet date; they do not represent amounts at risk. The 27% increase in the notional 
amounts of HSBC’s derivative assets during 2010 was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open 
interest rate contracts, reflecting increased trading volumes in the period.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Credit derivatives 
HSBC trades credit derivatives through its principal dealing operations and acts as a principal counterparty to a broad 
range of users, structuring deals to produce risk management products for its customers, or making markets in certain 
products. Risk is typically controlled through entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts with other 
counterparties.
HSBC manages the credit risk arising on buying and selling credit derivative protection by including the related 
credit exposures within its overall credit limit structure for the relevant counterparty. Trading of credit derivatives 
is restricted to a small number of offices within the major centres which have the control infrastructure and market 
skills to manage effectively the credit risk inherent in the products.  
Credit derivatives are also deployed to a limited extent for the risk management of the Group’s loan portfolios.  
The notional contract amount of credit derivatives of US$1,065,218m (2009: US$1,237,055m) consisted of 
protection bought of US$530,235m (2009: US$614,690m) and protection sold of US$534,983m (2009: 
US$622,365m). 
The credit derivative business operates within the market risk management framework described on pages 145 to 154.

Hedging instruments  
HSBC uses derivatives (principally interest rate swaps) for hedging purposes in the management of its own asset and 
liability portfolios and structural positions. This enables HSBC to optimise the overall cost to the Group of accessing 
debt capital markets, and to mitigate the market risk which would otherwise arise from structural imbalances in the 
maturity and other profiles of its assets and liabilities.   325
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
The accounting treatment of hedge transactions varies according to the nature of the instrument hedged and the type 
of hedge transactions. Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges, cash 
flow hedges, or hedges in net investment of foreign operations. These are described under the relevant headings 
below.
The notional contract amounts of derivatives held for hedging purposes indicate the nominal value of transactions 
outstanding at the balance sheet date; they do not represent amounts at risk.

Fair value hedges 
HSBC’s fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair 
value of fixed-rate long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates. For qualifying fair 
value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk 
being hedged are recognised in the income statement. If the hedge relationship is terminated, the fair value 
adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortised to the income 
statement as a yield adjustment over the remainder of the hedging period.

The gains and losses on ineffective portions of fair value hedges are recognised immediately in ‘Net trading income’. 
Cash flow hedges
HSBC’s cash flow hedges consist principally of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against 
exposures to variability in future interest cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities which bear interest at 
variable rates or which are expected to be re-funded or reinvested in the future. The amounts and timing of future 
cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and 
liabilities on the basis of their contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and 
defaults. The aggregate principal balances and interest cash flows across all portfolios over time form the basis for 
identifying gains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of forecast 
transactions. Gains and losses are initially recognised in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in the cash 
flow hedging reserve, and are transferred to the income statement when the forecast cash flows affect the income 
statement.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

During the year to 31 December 2010 a loss of US$9m (2009: gain of US$90m; 2008: loss of US$40m) was 
recognised due to hedge ineffectiveness.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of certain consolidated net investments. Hedging is undertaken using 
forward foreign exchange contracts or by financing with currency borrowings.  
At 31 December 2010, the fair values of outstanding financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments 
in foreign operations were liabilities of US$34m (2009: US$28m) and notional contract values of US$644m (2009: 
US$566m). 
The ineffectiveness recognised in ‘Net trading income’ in the year ended 31 December 2010 that arose from hedges 
in foreign operations was nil (2009 and 2008: nil).

The maturity distributions of asset-backed securities are presented in the above table on the basis of contractual 
maturity dates. The weighted average yield for each range of maturities is calculated by dividing the annualised 
interest income for the year ended 31 December 2010 by the book amount of available-for-sale debt securities at that 
date. The yields do not include the effect of related derivatives. 
22 Transfers of financial assets not qualifying for derecognition 
HSBC enters into transactions in the normal course of business by which it transfers recognised financial assets 
directly to third parties or to SPEs. These transfers may give rise to the full or partial derecognition of the financial 
assets concerned. 
– Full derecognition occurs when HSBC transfers its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial 
assets, or retains the right but assumes an obligation to pass on the cash flows from the asset, and transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. The risks include credit, interest rate, currency, prepayment 
and other price risks.
– Partial derecognition occurs when HSBC sells or otherwise transfers financial assets in such a way that some but 
not substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred but control is retained. These financial 
assets are recognised on the balance sheet to the extent of HSBC’s continuing involvement.  
The majority of financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition are (i) debt securities held by counterparties as 
collateral under repurchase agreements or (ii) equity securities lent under securities lending agreements. The 
following table analyses the carrying amount of financial assets that did not qualify for derecognition and their 
associated financial liabilities:

A small proportion of financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition relate to loans, credit cards, debt securities 
and trade receivables that have been securitised under arrangements by which HSBC retains a continuing 
involvement in such transferred assets. Continuing involvement may entail retaining the rights to future cash flows 
arising from the assets after investors have received their contractual terms (for example, interest rate strips); 
providing subordinated interest; liquidity support; continuing to service the underlying asset; or entering into 
derivative transactions with the securitisation vehicles. As such, HSBC continues to be exposed to risks associated 
with these transactions.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

The rights and obligations that HSBC retains from its continuing involvement in securitisations are initially recorded 
as an allocation of the fair value of the financial asset between the part that is derecognised and the part that continues 
to be recognised on the date of transfer. The following analyses the carrying amount of financial assets to
the extent of HSBC’s continuing involvement that qualified for partial derecognition during the year, and their

was equity accounted from that date due to HSBC’s representation on the Board of Directors and involvement in the 
Technical Support and Assistance Agreement. In December 2007, as a result of a rights issue in which HSBC did not 
participate, HSBC’s equity interest was diluted to 14.44%. In September 2008, HSBC increased its equity interest to 
20%. HSBC’s equity interest has been subsequently diluted to below 20% due to the issue of shares by the associate 
to its own employees.

During 2010, there was no impairment of goodwill (2009: nil; 2008: US$10.6bn). 
Impairment testing 
Timing of impairment testing
HSBC’s impairment test in respect of goodwill allocated to each cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) is performed as at 
1 July each year. In line with the accounting policy set out in Note 2p, goodwill is also retested for impairment 
whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. There was no indication of impairment in the period 
to 31 December 2010 and therefore goodwill has not been retested since 1 July 2010. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the Group’s CGUs are based on customer groups and global business separated by geographical region. The 
CGUs represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Basis of the recoverable amount – value in use or fair value less costs to sell 
The recoverable amount of all CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated was equal to its value in use (‘VIU’) at 
each respective testing date for 2009 and 2010. 
For each significant CGU, the VIU is calculated by discounting management’s cash flow projections for the CGU. 
The discount rate used is based on the cost of capital HSBC allocates to investments in the countries within which the 
CGU operates. The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term 
perspective within the Group of the business units making up the CGUs. In 2010, for most CGUs, management’s 
cash flow projections until the end of 2011 were used. However, due to the current economic conditions in Personal 
Financial Services – Latin America, a 10-year cash flow projection was used to more accurately estimate the cash 
flows for the period.

24 – Goodwill and intangible assets 
334
At 1 July 2010, aggregate goodwill of US$4,674m (1 July 2009: US$4,475m) had been allocated to CGUs that were 
not considered individually significant. These CGUs do not carry on their balance sheets any significant intangible 
assets with indefinite useful lives, other than goodwill. 
Nominal long-term growth rate: external data that reflects the market’s assessment of GDP and inflation for the 
countries within which the CGU operates. The rates used for 2009 and 2010 are taken as an average of the last 
10 years. 
Discount rate: the discount rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of capital assigned to each CGU, 
which is derived using a Capital Asset Pricing Model (‘CAPM’). The CAPM depends on inputs reflecting a number 
of financial and economic variables including the risk-free rate in the country concerned and a premium to reflect the 
inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are based on the market’s assessment of the economic 
variables and management’s judgement. In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, 
management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM 
with cost of capital rates produced by external sources. HSBC uses externally-sourced cost of capital rates where, in 
management’s judgement, those rates reflect more accurately the current market and economic conditions. For 2010 
and 2009, internal costs of capital rates were consistent with externally-sourced rates.  
Management’s judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU: the cash flow projections for each CGU are 
based on plans approved by the Group Management Board. The key assumptions in addition to the discount rate and 
nominal long-term growth rate for each significant CGU are discussed below. 
Personal Financial Services – Europe and Commercial Banking – Europe: the assumptions included in the cash flow 
projections for Personal Financial Services – Europe and Commercial Banking – Europe reflect the economic 
environment and financial outlook of the European countries within these two segments. Key assumptions include the 
level of interest rates and the level and change in unemployment rates. While current economic conditions in Europe 
continue to be challenging, management’s cash flow projections are based primarily on these prevailing conditions. 
Risks include a double-dip recession in the UK and the continuation of base rates at their current low levels. Based on 
the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of the key 
assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of Personal Financial 
Services – Europe or Commercial Banking – Europe. 
Global Private Banking – Europe: the revenues in Global Private Banking – Europe are predominately generated 
through HSBC’s client relationships. The cash flow forecast reflects current economic conditions and key 
assumptions include the level of interest rates and client risk appetite. Further economic deterioration could result in a 
decrease in assets under management and a reduction in fee and trading income through increased client risk 
aversion. Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible 
change in any of the key assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of 
Global Private Banking – Europe. 
Global Banking and Markets – Europe: the cash flows generated by Global Banking and Markets – Europe are 
diversified and there is no one key assumption that drives the cash flow projection of this CGU. In line with other 
CGUs, Global Banking and Markets – Europe is sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment and the strength 
of economic recovery in Europe. One of the key factors which may impact the carrying value of this CGU is the level 
of impairment charges which may emerge in the future, particularly in respect of holdings of available-for-sale sub-
prime and Alt-A Residential MBSs. Based on management’s current assessment of the credit quality of these 
securities, which includes stressed scenarios for collateral defaults and house prices, and the level of credit support 
available, management determined that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions would not cause an 
impairment to be recognised in respect of Global Banking and Markets – Europe. 
Personal Financial Services – Latin America: the assumptions included in the cash flow projections for Personal 
Financial Services – Latin America reflect the economic environment and financial outlook of the countries within 
this segment, with Brazil and Mexico being two of the largest countries included within this segment. Key 
assumptions include the growth in lending and deposit volumes and the credit quality of the loan portfolios. Mexico 
and Central America in particular are sensitive to economic conditions in the US which could constrain demand. 
Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any 
of the key assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of Personal 
Financial Services – Latin America.  335

Investment properties are valued on an open market value basis as at 31 December each year by independent 
professional valuers who have recent experience in the location and type of properties. Investment properties in Hong 
Kong, the Macau Special Administrative Region and mainland China, which represent more than 35% by value of 
HSBC’s investment properties subject to revaluation, were valued by an independent valuer who is a member of the 
Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors and who has recent experience in the locations and categories of the investment 
properties.
Included within ‘Other operating income’ was rental income of US$26m (2009: US$81m; 2008: US$23m) earned by 
HSBC on its investment properties. Direct operating expenses of US$3m (2009: US$2m; 2008: US$2m) incurred in 
respect of the investment properties during the year were recognised in ‘General and administrative expenses’. Direct 
operating expenses arising in respect of investment properties that did not generate rental income during 2010 
amounted to nil (2009 and 2008: nil).
At 31 December 2010, HSBC had no contractual obligations to purchase, construct, develop, maintain or enhance 
investment properties (2009: nil).  
HSBC Holdings had no investment properties at 31 December 2010 or 2009.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
All the above subsidiaries are included in the HSBC consolidated financial statements. 
Details of all HSBC subsidiaries will be annexed to the next Annual Return of HSBC Holdings filed with the UK 
Registrar of Companies. 
All the above make their financial statements up to 31 December except for HSBC Bank Argentina S.A., whose 
financial statements are made up to 30 June annually. 
The principal countries of operation are the same as the countries of incorporation except for HSBC Bank Middle 
East Limited which operates mainly in the Middle East and HSBC Life (International) Limited which operates 
mainly in Hong Kong. 
Subsidiaries which experience significant restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to HSBC in the form of cash 
dividends or to repay loans and advances
During 2010 and 2009, none of the Group’s subsidiaries experienced significant restrictions on paying dividends or 
repaying loans and advances. 
Subsidiaries excluding SPEs where HSBC owns less than 50% of the voting rights 
At 31 December 2009, HSBC consolidated HSBC Private Equity Fund 3 (‘HPEF3’) but only had a 38.8% interest in 
its equity capital. HSBC had control under IAS 27 because it was the investment adviser/manager of the fund and had 
a significant equity interest. 
On 30 November 2010, the Group completed the sale of an 80.1% interest in HSBC Private Equity (Asia) Limited 
(‘HPEA’) to HPEA’s management. As a result, the Group no longer controls HPEF3. The Group previously 
consolidated HPEF 3 by virtue of its control over HPEA, which in turn controlled HPEF3. Upon deconsolidation, the 
group retains its 38.8% interest in HPEF3 as an available for sale investment. HPEF3 has been renamed The 
Headland Private Equity Fund 3 Limited. 
SPEs consolidated by HSBC where HSBC owns less than 50% of the voting rights

US$10.6bn. For further details, see ‘Special purpose entities’ on page 361. 
In each of the above cases, HSBC has less than 50% of the voting rights, but consolidates because it has the majority 
of risks and rewards of ownership of the SPE, or the substance of the relationship with the SPE is such that its 
activities are conducted on behalf of HSBC according to its specific business needs so that HSBC obtains benefit 
from the SPE’s operation. The consolidation of SPEs sponsored by HSBC is discussed on page 251. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

1 Includes movement in liabilities relating to discretionary profit participation benefits due to policyholders arising from net unrealised
investment gains recognised in other comprehensive income.  
2 Includes amounts arising under reinsurance agreements. 
The increase in liabilities to policyholders represents the aggregate of all events giving rise to additional liabilities to 
policyholders in the year. The key factors contributing to the movement in liabilities to policyholders include death 
claims, surrenders, lapses, liabilities to policyholders created at the initial inception of the policies, the declaration of 
bonuses and other amounts attributable to policyholders.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Subordinated loan capital is repayable at par on maturity, but some is repayable prior to maturity at the option of the 
borrower, generally subject to prior notification to the Financial Services Authority and, where relevant, the consent 
of the local banking regulator, and in certain cases at a premium over par. Interest rates on the floating rate loan 
capital are related to interbank offered rates. On the remaining subordinated loan capital, interest is payable at fixed 
rates of up to 10.176%.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

  4 On 15 February 2011, HSBC gave notice to holders of its €800m callable subordinated floating rate notes 2016 and its €600m 4.25% 
callable subordinated notes 2016 that it will call and redeem the notes at par on 29 March 2011 and 18 March 2011, respectively.
  5 The distributions on the trust preferred securities change in November 2015 to three-month dollar LIBOR plus 1.926%. 
  6 The interest rate on the 4.75% callable subordinated notes 2020 changes in September 2015 to three-month sterling LIBOR plus 
0.82%. 
  7 The interest margin on the callable subordinated floating rate notes 2020 increases by 0.5% from September 2015. 
  8 The interest rate on the callable subordinated variable coupon notes 2017 is fixed at 5.75% until June 2012. Thereafter, the rate per 
annum is the sum of the gross redemption yield of the then prevailing five-year UK gilt plus 1.70%.   
  9 The interest rate on the 5.00% callable subordinated notes 2023 changes in March 2018 to become the rate per annum which is the

Footnotes 4 to 13 relate to notes that are repayable at the option of the borrower on the date of the change of the interest rate, and at 
subsequent interest rate reset dates and interest payment dates in some cases, subject to prior notification to the Financial Services 
Authority and, where relevant, the consent of the local banking regulator. 
Step-up perpetual preferred securities 
(a) Guaranteed by HSBC Holdings 
The six issues of non-cumulative step-up perpetual preferred securities (footnote 2) were made by Jersey limited 
partnerships and are guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, by HSBC Holdings. The proceeds of the issues were 
on-lent to HSBC Holdings by the limited partnerships by issue of subordinated notes. The preferred securities 
qualify as tier 1 hybrid capital for HSBC. The preferred securities, together with the guarantee, are intended to 
provide investors with rights to income and capital distributions and distributions upon liquidation of HSBC 
Holdings that are equivalent to the rights that they would have had if they had purchased non-cumulative 
perpetual preference shares of HSBC Holdings. 
The preferred securities are perpetual, but redeemable in 2014, 2013, 2016, 2030, 2012 and 2015, respectively, 
at the option of the general partner of the limited partnerships. If not redeemed, the distributions payable step-up 
and become floating rate or, for the sterling issue, for each successive five-year period the sum of the then five-
year benchmark UK gilt plus a margin. There are limitations on the payment of distributions if prohibited under 
UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a payment would cause a breach of HSBC’s capital adequacy 
requirements, or if HSBC Holdings has insufficient distributable reserves (as defined). 
HSBC Holdings has covenanted that if it is prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions on 
the preferred securities in full, it will not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of its ordinary shares, or 
effect repurchase or redemption of its ordinary shares, until after a distribution has been paid in full. 
If (i) HSBC’s total capital ratio falls below the regulatory minimum ratio required, or (ii) the Directors expect 
that, in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Holdings, the former will occur in the near term, 
then the preferred securities will be substituted by preference shares of HSBC Holdings having economic terms 
which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the preferred securities and the guarantee taken together.
(b) Guaranteed by HSBC Bank 
The two issues of non-cumulative step-up perpetual preferred securities (footnote 3) were made by Jersey limited 
partnerships and are guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, by HSBC Bank. The proceeds of the issues were on-
lent to HSBC Bank by the limited partnerships by issue of subordinated notes. The preferred securities qualify as 
tier 1 hybrid capital for HSBC and for HSBC Bank on a solo and consolidated basis and, together with the 
guarantee, are intended to provide investors with rights to income and capital distributions and distributions upon 
liquidation of HSBC Bank that are equivalent to the rights they would have had if they had purchased non-
cumulative perpetual preference shares of HSBC Bank. 
The two issues of preferred securities are perpetual, but redeemable in 2031 and 2020, respectively, at the option 
of the general partner of the limited partnerships. If not redeemed, the distributions payable step-up and become 
floating rate. The same limitations on the payment of distributions apply to HSBC Bank as to HSBC Holdings,  349
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
as described above. HSBC Bank has provided a similar covenant to that provided by HSBC Holdings, also as 
described above. 
If (i) any of the two issues of preferred securities are outstanding in November 2048 or April 2049, respectively, 
or (ii) the total capital ratio of HSBC Bank on a solo and consolidated basis falls below the regulatory minimum 
ratio required, or (iii) in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Bank, the Directors expect (ii) to 
occur in the near term, then the preferred securities will be substituted by preference shares of HSBC Bank 
having economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the preferred securities and the 
guarantee taken together.

Dividends on the HSBC Holdings non-cumulative dollar preference shares (‘Dollar Preference Shares’) in issue are 
paid quarterly at the sole and absolute discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will not declare a 
dividend on the Dollar Preference Shares in issue if payment of the dividend would cause HSBC Holdings not to 
meet the applicable capital adequacy requirements of the FSA or the profit of HSBC Holdings available for 
distribution as dividends is not sufficient to enable HSBC Holdings to pay in full both dividends on the Dollar 
Preference Shares in issue and dividends on any other shares that are scheduled to be paid on the same date and that 
have an equal right to dividends. HSBC Holdings may not declare or pay dividends on any class of its shares ranking 
lower in the right to dividends than the Dollar Preference Shares in issue nor redeem nor purchase in any manner any 
of its other shares ranking equal with or lower than the Dollar Preference Shares in issue unless it has paid in full, or 
set aside an amount to provide for payment in full, the dividends on the Dollar Preference Shares in issue for the 
then-current dividend period. The Dollar Preference Shares in issue carry no rights to conversion into ordinary shares 
of HSBC Holdings. Holders of the Dollar Preference Shares in issue will only be entitled to attend and vote at general 
meetings of shareholders of HSBC Holdings if the dividend payable on the Dollar Preference Shares in issue has not 
been paid in full for four consecutive dividend payment dates. In such circumstances, holders of the Dollar 
Preference Shares in issue will be entitled to vote on all matters put to general meetings until such time as HSBC 
Holdings has paid a full dividend on the Dollar Preference Shares in issue. HSBC Holdings may redeem the Dollar 
Preference Shares in issue in whole at any time on or after 16 December 2010, subject to prior notification to the 
FSA.
HSBC Holdings non-cumulative preference shares of £0.01 each

HSBC Holdings non-voting deferred shares 
301,500 non-voting deferred shares of £1 each were in issue throughout 2009 and up to 29 December 2010 and were 
held by a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. As part of a technical internal capital reorganisation necessitated by the 
amended EU Capital Requirements Directive 2, which applied to HSBC Holdings from 31 December 2010, all of the 
non-voting deferred shares of £1 each were cancelled.
Other equity instruments 
On 9 April 2008, HSBC Holdings issued, in bearer form, 88m 8.125% Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities 
(‘Capital Securities’), each with a par value of US$25 and with an aggregate nominal value of US$2,200m. The

issued to support the development of and to strengthen further HSBC’s capital base. Coupon payments on the Capital 
Securities are paid quarterly in arrears from 15 July 2008 and may be deferred at the discretion of HSBC Holdings. 
The Capital Securities have no fixed maturity and are redeemable at HSBC’s option on or after 15 April 2013 at their 
principal amounts together with any accrued, unpaid and deferred coupon payments. While any coupon payments are 
unpaid or deferred, HSBC Holdings will not declare, pay dividends or make distributions or similar periodic 
payments in respect of, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities of lower or equal rank. At the 
Company’s discretion, and subject to certain conditions being satisfied, the Capital Securities may be exchanged on

rank pari passu with the dollar and sterling preference shares in issue. The preference shares will be issued at a 
nominal value of US$0.01 per share and a premium of US$24.99 per share, with both such amounts being subscribed 
and fully paid.

deferred at the discretion of HSBC Holdings. The Capital Securities, Series 2 have no fixed maturity and are 
redeemable at HSBC’s option on or after 15 December 2015 at their principal amounts together with any accrued, 
unpaid and deferred coupon payments. At the Company’s discretion, and subject to certain conditions being satisfied,

to be issued by HSBC Holdings and which would rank pari passu with the dollar and sterling preference shares in 
issue. The preference shares will be issued at a nominal value of US$0.01 per share and a premium of US$24.99 per 
share, with both such amounts being subscribed and fully paid.

both financial and non-financial guarantees and commitments to extend credit. Contingent liabilities arising from 
legal proceedings and regulatory matters against the Group are disclosed in Note 44. Nominal principal amounts 
represent the amounts at risk should contracts be fully drawn upon and clients default. The amount of the loan 
commitments shown above reflects, where relevant, the expected level of take-up of pre-approved loan offers made 
by mailshots to personal customers. As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire 
without being drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not representative of future liquidity 
requirements.  
Guarantees
HSBC provides guarantees and similar undertakings on behalf of both third-party customers and other entities within 
the HSBC Group. These guarantees are generally provided in the normal course of HSBC’s banking business. The 
principal types of guarantees provided, and the maximum potential amount of future payments which HSBC could be

1 Financial guarantees are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss incurred
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
2 Other direct credit substitutes include re-insurance letters of credit and trade-related letters of credit issued without provision for the 
issuing entity to retain title to the underlying shipment.
3 Performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and other transaction-related guarantees are undertakings by which the
obligation on HSBC to make payment depends on the outcome of a future event.  359
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
The amounts disclosed in the above table are nominal principal amounts and reflect HSBC’s maximum exposure 
under a large number of individual guarantee undertakings. The risks and exposures arising from guarantees are 
captured and managed in accordance with HSBC’s overall credit risk management policies and procedures. 
Approximately half of the above guarantees have a term of less than one year. Guarantees with terms of more than 
one year are subject to HSBC’s annual credit review process. 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (‘FSCS’) has provided compensation to consumers following the 
collapse of a number of deposit takers. The compensation paid out to consumers is currently funded through loans 
from the Bank of England and HM Treasury. The bank could be liable to pay a proportion of the outstanding 
borrowings that the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury which at 31 March 2010 stood at approximately £20bn 
(US$30bn). Currently, the levy paid by the bank represents its share of the interest on these borrowings. The accrual 
at 31 December 2010 was US$133m in respect of the 2010/11 and 2011/12 levy years (2009: US$182m in respect of 
the 2009/10 and 2010/11 levy years). 
The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapses cannot currently be estimated reliably as it is 
dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS and changes in the 
interest rate, the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.  
Commitments
In addition to the commitments disclosed on page 358, at 31 December 2010, HSBC had US$1,071m (2009: 
US$1,359m) of capital commitments contracted but not provided for and US$287m (2009: US$227m) of capital 
commitments authorised but not contracted for. 
Associates
HSBC’s share of associates’ contingent liabilities amounted to US$25,640m at 31 December 2010 (2009: 
US$19,770m). No matters arose where HSBC was severally liable.

under non-cancellable subleases at the balance sheet date. 
In 2010, US$888m (2009: US$1,100m; 2008: US$861m) was charged to ‘General and administrative expenses’ in 
respect of lease and sublease agreements, of which US$869m (2009: US$833m; 2008: US$635m) related to 
minimum lease payments, US$18m (2009: US$16m; 2008: US$22m) to contingent rents, and US$1m (2009: 
US$251m; 2008: US$204m) to sublease payments. 
The contingent rent represents escalation payments made to landlords for operating, tax and other escalation expenses.
Finance lease receivables 
HSBC leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance leases, including transport assets (such as aircraft), 
property and general plant and machinery. At the end of lease terms, assets may be sold to third parties or leased for 
further terms. Lessees may participate in any sales proceeds achieved. Lease rentals arising during the lease terms 
will either be fixed in quantum or be varied to reflect changes in, for example, tax or interest rates. Rentals are 
calculated to recover the cost of assets less their residual value, and earn finance income.

43 Special purpose entities 
HSBC enters into certain transactions with customers in the ordinary course of business which involve the 
establishment of special purpose entities (‘SPE’s) to facilitate or secure customer transactions. 
HSBC structures that utilise SPEs are authorised centrally when they are established to ensure appropriate purpose 
and governance. The activities of SPEs administered by HSBC are closely monitored by senior management.  
SPEs are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 1f.

HSBC’s maximum exposure to SPEs 
The following table shows the total assets of the various types of SPEs and the amount of funding provided by HSBC 
to these SPEs. The table also shows HSBC’s maximum exposure to the SPEs and, within that exposure, the liquidity 
and credit enhancements provided by HSBC. The maximum exposures to SPEs represent HSBC’s maximum possible 
risk exposure that could occur as a result of the Group’s arrangements and commitments to SPEs. The maximum 
amounts are contingent in nature, and may arise as a result of drawdowns under liquidity facilities, where these have 
been provided, and any other funding commitments, or as a result of any loss protection provided by HSBC to the 
SPEs. The conditions under which such exposure might arise differ depending on the nature of each SPE and 
HSBC’s involvement with it.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Conduits 
HSBC sponsors and manages two types of conduits: securities investment conduits (‘SIC’s) and multi-seller conduits. 
Securities investment conduits
Solitaire, HSBC’s principal SIC, purchases highly rated asset-backed securities (‘ABS’s) to facilitate tailored 
investment opportunities. At 31 December 2010, Solitaire held US$11.7bn of ABSs (2009: US$11.7bn). These are 
included within the disclosures of ABS ‘held through consolidated SPEs’ on page 133. HSBC’s other SICs, Mazarin, 
Barion and Malachite, evolved from the restructuring of HSBC’s sponsored structured investment vehicles (‘SIV’s) 
in 2008. 
Solitaire
Commercial Paper (‘CP’) issued by Solitaire benefits from a 100% liquidity facility provided by HSBC. 
At 31 December 2010, US$7.6bn of Solitaire’s assets were funded by the draw-down of the liquidity facility (2009: 
US$7.6bn). HSBC is exposed to credit losses on the drawn amounts. 
HSBC’s maximum exposure represents the risk that HSBC may be required to fund the vehicle in the event the CP is 
redeemed without reinvestment from third parties. At 31 December 2010 this amounted to US$16.8bn (31 December 
2009: US$18.4bn). 
Mazarin 
HSBC is exposed to the par value of Mazarin’s assets through the provision of a liquidity facility equal to the lesser 
of the amortised cost of issued senior debt and the amortised cost of non-defaulted assets. At 31 December 2010 this 
amounted to US$11.6bn (2009: US$13.6bn). First loss protection is provided through the capital notes issued by 
Mazarin, which are substantially all held by third parties.  363
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
At 31 December 2010, HSBC held 1.3% of Mazarin’s capital notes (2009: 1.3%) which have a par value of US$17m 
(2009: US$17m) and a carrying amount of US$0.6m (2009: US$0.6m). 
Barion and Malachite
HSBC’s primary exposure to these SICs is represented by the amortised cost of the debt required to support the non-
cash assets of the vehicles. At 31 December 2010 this amounted to US$9.4bn (2009: US$10.5bn). First loss 
protection is provided through the capital notes issued by these vehicles, which are substantially all held by third 
parties.
At 31 December 2010, HSBC held 3.7% of the capital notes issued by these vehicles (2009: 3.8%) which have a par 
value of US$35m (2009: US$37m) and a carrying amount of US$2m (2009: US$2m). 
Multi-seller conduits
These vehicles were established for the purpose of providing access to flexible market-based sources of finance for 
HSBC’s clients. 
HSBC’s maximum exposure is equal to the transaction-specific liquidity facilities offered to the multi-seller conduits. 
First loss protection is provided by the originator of the assets, and not by HSBC, through transaction-specific credit 
enhancements. A layer of secondary loss protection is provided by HSBC in the form of programme-wide 
enhancement facilities. 
The following table sets out the weighted average life of the asset portfolios for the above mentioned conduits.

Securitisations
HSBC uses SPEs to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated in order to diversify its sources of 
funding for asset origination and for capital efficiency purposes. The loans and advances are transferred by HSBC to 
the SPEs for cash, and the SPEs issue debt securities to investors to fund the cash purchases. 
HSBC’s maximum exposure is the aggregate of any holdings of notes issued by these vehicles and the reserve 
account positions intended to provide credit support under certain pre-defined circumstances to senior note holders. 
In addition, HSBC uses SPEs to mitigate the capital absorbed by some of the customer loans and advances it has 
originated. Credit derivatives are used to transfer the credit risk associated with these customer loans and advances to 
an SPE, using securitisations commonly known as synthetic securitisations by which the SPE writes credit default 
swap protection to HSBC. The SPE is funded by the issuance of notes with the cash held as collateral against the 
credit default protection. From a UK regulatory perspective, the credit protection issued by the SPE in respect of the 
customer loans allows the risk weight of the loans to be replaced by the risk weight of the collateral in the SPE and as 
a result mitigates the capital absorbed by the customer loans. Any notes issued by the SPE and held by HSBC attract 
the appropriate risk weight under the relevant regulatory regime. These SPEs are consolidated when HSBC is 
exposed to the majority of risks and rewards of ownership. 
Money market funds 
HSBC has established and manages a number of money market funds which provide customers with tailored 
investment opportunities within narrow and well-defined objectives. 
The majority of these money market funds are Constant Net Asset Value funds (‘CNAV’), which invest in shorter-dated 
and highly-rated money market securities with the objective of providing investors with a highly liquid and secure 
investment. In September 2008 during the financial crisis, HSBC consolidated certain of its CNAV funds as a result of a 
number of actions taken to maintain their AAA rating and mitigate the risks of forced sales of liquid assets to meet potential 
redemptions. Since consolidation of the CNAV funds, HSBC has not provided any additional support to the funds and  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)
43 – Special purpose entities / 44 – Legal proceedings, investigations and regulatory matters 
364
letters of indemnity provided in 2008 have all expired. At all times the funds continued to be governed by their 
prospectuses.
In December 2010, management determined that it would not provide similar support in the future in the light of changes in 
the application of banking regulations. As a result, any presumption of ongoing support caused by past actions is no longer 
valid and it is not appropriate to continue to consolidate the CNAV funds. 
The effect of deconsolidating the CNAV funds on HSBC’s balance sheet was to derecognise US$44.4bn of assets and 
US$43.9bn of liabilities. The deconsolidation of the CNAV funds did not have a material impact on HSBC’s consolidated 
income statement for the year ended 31 December 2010.  
HSBC’s maximum exposure to the CNAV funds is represented by HSBC’s investment in the units of the funds which 
at 31 December 2010 amounted to US$0.5bn (2009: US$1.0bn). Investments in units of the funds are included within 
‘Trading assets’. Prior to deconsolidation, the interest income from the CNAV funds and the expense payable to third-party 
holders of units in the funds were presented within ‘Net interest income on trading activities’. 
HSBC’s maximum exposure to money market funds is represented by HSBC’s investment in the units of each fund, which 
at 31 December 2010 amounted to US$1.1bn (2009: US$1.8bn). 
Non-money market investment funds 
HSBC has established a large number of non-money market investment funds to enable customers to invest in a range 
of assets, typically equities and debt securities. 
HSBC’s maximum exposure to non-money market investment funds is represented by its investment in the units of 
each fund which at 31 December 2010 amounted to US$8.6bn (2009: US$6.8bn). 
Other
HSBC also establishes SPEs in the normal course of business for a number of purposes, for example, structured credit 
transactions for customers, to provide finance to public and private sector infrastructure projects, and for asset and 
structured finance transactions. 
In certain transactions HSBC is exposed to risk often referred to as gap risk. Gap risk typically arises in transactions 
where the aggregate potential claims against the SPE by HSBC pursuant to one or more derivatives could be greater 
than the value of the collateral held by the SPE and securing such derivatives. HSBC often mitigates such gap risk by 
incorporating in the SPE transaction features which allow for deleveraging, a managed liquidation of the portfolio, or 
other mechanisms including trade restructuring or unwinding the trade. Following the inclusion of such risk reduction 
mechanisms, HSBC has, in certain circumstances, retained all or a portion of the underlying exposure in the 
transaction. In these circumstances, HSBC assesses whether the exposure retained causes a requirement under IFRSs 
to consolidate the SPE. When this retained exposure represents ABSs, it has been included in ‘Nature of HSBC’s 
exposures’ on page 129. 
Third-party sponsored SPEs 
Through standby liquidity facility commitments, HSBC has exposure to third-party sponsored SIVs, conduits and 
securitisations under normal banking arrangements on standard market terms. These exposures are not considered 
significant to HSBC’s operations.
Additional off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments 
Additional off-balance sheet commitments such as financial guarantees, letters of credit and commitments to lend are 
disclosed in Note 41. 
Leveraged finance transactions 
Loan commitments in respect of leveraged finance transactions are accounted for as derivatives where it is HSBC’s 
intention to sell the loan after origination. Further information is provided on pages 138 and 139. 365
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
44 Legal proceedings, investigations and regulatory matters
HSBC is party to legal proceedings, investigations and regulatory matters in a number of jurisdictions including the 
UK, Hong Kong and the US arising out of its normal business operations. Apart from the matters described below, 
HSBC considers that none of these matters is material, either individually or in the aggregate. HSBC recognises a 
provision for a liability in relation to these matters when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle an obligation which has arisen as a result of past events, and for which a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. While the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain, management 
believes that, based on the information available to it, appropriate provisions have been made in respect of legal 
proceedings, investigations and regulatory matters as at 31 December 2010 (see note 33, Provisions).  
Securities litigation
As a result of an August 2002 restatement of previously reported consolidated financial statements and other 
corporate events, including the 2002 settlement with 46 State Attorneys General relating to real estate lending 
practices, Household International (now HSBC Finance) and certain former officers were named as defendants in a 
class action law suit, Jaffe v Household International Inc, et al No 2. C 5893 (N.D.Ill, filed 19 August 2002). The 
complaint asserted claims under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on behalf of all persons who acquired and 
disposed of Household International common stock between 30 July 1999 and 11 October 2002. The claims alleged 
that the defendants knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements of material fact relating to 
Household’s Consumer Lending operations, including collections, sales and lending practices, some of which 
ultimately led to the 2002 State settlement agreement, and facts relating to accounting practices evidenced by the 
restatement. Following a jury trial concluded in April 2009, which was decided partly in favour of the plaintiffs, the 
Court issued a ruling on 22 November 2010, within the second phase of the case to determine actual damages, that 
claim forms should be mailed to class members, and also set out a method for calculating damages for class members 
who filed claims. At subsequent hearings the Court has allowed HSBC Finance to take limited discovery on the issue 
of whether investors relied on the ‘misleading statements’ at the time they made their investments and also reserved 
on the issue of whether HSBC Finance would ultimately be entitled to a jury trial on the issue of reliance. 
Despite the jury verdict and the 22 November 2010 ruling, HSBC continues to believe that it has meritorious 
defences, and intends to seek an appeal of the Court’s rulings. Lead Plaintiffs, in Court filings, have estimated that 
damages could range ‘somewhere between US$2.4bn to US$3.2bn to class members’, before pre-judgement interest. 
The timing and outcome of the resolution of this matter is uncertain. Given the complexity and uncertainties 
associated with the actual determination of damages, including but not limited to the number of class members that 
may file valid claims, the number of claims that can be substantiated by class members providing adequate 
documentation, the reduction of trading losses by any trading gains made over the relevant period, the determination 
of reliance by class members on the financial statements, and whether any given class member was the beneficial 
owner of the shares, HSBC is unable at this time to estimate reliably the amount of any damages, or range of possible 
damages, that could arise, but they could be significant. 
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC 
In December 2008, Bernard L. Madoff (‘Madoff’) was arrested for running a Ponzi scheme and a trustee was 
appointed for the liquidation of his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (‘Madoff Securities’), an 
SEC-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser. Since his appointment, the trustee has been recovering assets 
and processing claims of Madoff Securities customers. Madoff subsequently pleaded guilty to various charges and is 
serving a 150-year prison sentence. He has acknowledged, in essence, that while purporting to invest his customers’ 
money in securities and, upon request, return their profits and principal, he in fact never invested in securities and 
used other customers’ money to fulfil requests for the return of profits and principal. The relevant US authorities are 
continuing their investigations into his fraud, and have brought charges against others. 
Various non-US HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds 
incorporated outside the US whose assets were invested with Madoff Securities.
Based on information provided by Madoff Securities, as at 30 November 2008, the purported aggregate value of 
these funds was US$8.4bn, an amount that includes fictitious profits reported by Madoff. Based on information 
available to HSBC to date, we estimate that the funds’ actual transfers to Madoff Securities minus their actual 
withdrawals from Madoff Securities during the time that HSBC serviced the funds totalled approximately US$4.3bn.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)
44 – Legal proceedings, investigations and regulatory matters / 45 – Related party transactions 
366
Plaintiffs (including funds, fund investors, and the Madoff Securities trustee) have commenced Madoff-related 
proceedings against numerous defendants in a multitude of jurisdictions. Various HSBC companies have been named 
as defendants in suits in the US, Ireland, Luxembourg, and other jurisdictions. The suits (which include US class 
actions) allege that the HSBC defendants knew or should have known of Madoff’s fraud and breached various duties 
to the funds and fund investors. In December 2010, the Madoff Securities trustee commenced suits against various 
HSBC companies in the US bankruptcy court and in the English High Court. The US action (which also names 
certain funds, investment managers, and other entities and individuals) seeks US$9bn in damages and additional 
recoveries from HSBC and the various co-defendants. It seeks damages against HSBC for allegedly aiding and 
abetting Madoff’s fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. It also seeks, pursuant to US bankruptcy law, recovery of 
unspecified amounts received by HSBC from funds invested with Madoff, including amounts that HSBC received 
when it redeemed units HSBC held in the various funds. HSBC acquired those fund units in connection with 
financing transactions HSBC had entered into with various clients. The trustee’s US bankruptcy law claims also seek 
recovery of fees earned by HSBC for providing custodial, administration and similar services to the funds. The 
trustee’s English action seeks recovery of unspecified transfers of money from Madoff Securities to or through 
HSBC, on the ground that the HSBC defendants actually or constructively knew of Madoff’s fraud. 
Between October 2009 and July 2010, Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (‘Fairfield’), funds 
whose assets were directly or indirectly invested with Madoff Securities, commenced multiple suits in the British 
Virgin Islands and the US against numerous fund shareholders, including various HSBC companies that acted as 
nominees for clients of HSBC’s private banking business and other clients who invested in the Fairfield funds. The 
Fairfield actions seek restitution of amounts paid to the defendants in connection with share redemptions, on the 
ground that such payments were made by mistake, based on inflated values resulting from Madoff’s fraud. 
There are many factors which may affect the range of possible outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of the 
various Madoff-related proceedings, including but not limited to the circumstances of the fraud, the multiple 
jurisdictions in which the proceedings have been brought and the number of different plaintiffs and defendants in 
such proceedings. The cases where HSBC companies are named as a defendant are at an early stage. For these 
reasons, among others, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to estimate reliably the aggregate liabilities, or 
ranges of liabilities, that might arise as a result of all such claims but they could be significant. In any event, HSBC 
considers that it has good defences to these claims and will continue to defend them vigorously. 
Payment Protection Insurance  
Following an extensive period of consultation, on 10 August 2010 the Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’) 
published Policy Statement 10/12 (‘PS 10/12’) on the assessment and redress of Payment Protection Insurance 
(‘PPI’) complaints. This included (i) new handbook guidance setting out how complaints are to be handled, and 
‘redressed fairly’ where appropriate; (ii) an explanation of when and why firms should analyse their past complaints 
to identify if there are serious flaws in sales practices that may have affected complainants and non-complainants; and 
(iii) an Open Letter setting out common sales failings to help firms identify bad practices. 
After extensive consideration, the British Bankers Association (‘BBA’), as the representative body of UK banks, sent 
a formal pre-action protocol letter to the FSA and the Financial Ombudsman Service (‘FOS’) setting out its concerns 
and what it considered to be the flaws identified in PS 10/12 and Guidance issued by FOS on the handling of PPI 
complaints. The letter indicated that, absent a satisfactory reply, it was the BBA’s intention to apply to the High 
Court for a Judicial Review of both PS 10/12 and the FOS Guidance. The FSA and FOS responded on 28 September 
2010 denying that they had acted unlawfully in introducing the Policy Statement or relying on the Guidance. 
On 8 October 2010, an application for Judicial Review was issued by the BBA seeking an order to quash PS 10/12 
and the FOS Guidance. The FSA subsequently issued a statement on 24 November 2010 seeking to clarify aspects of 
PS 10/12 and the Open Letter. The FSA and FOS filed defences to the Judicial Review application on 10 December 
2010. The Judicial Review application was heard by the Court on 25 – 28 January 2011, and Judgement is currently 
awaited.
HSBC believes that the BBA has a strongly arguable case against both the FSA and the FOS. If the Court ultimately 
concludes, however, after any appeals of the Judgement that may follow from any of the parties, that PS 10/12 and 
the FOS Guidance stand, in whole or in part, then these would need to be taken into consideration when determining 
complaints alleging the mis-sale of PPI.  
If, contrary to HSBC’s current assessment, a decision is reached in the case that results in a potential liability for 
HSBC, a large number of different outcomes is possible, each of which would have a different financial impact.  367
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
There are many factors affecting the range of possible outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, including the 
extent to which one or both of PS 10/12 and the FOS Guidance are upheld, and the underlying rationale for each 
decision; the ways in which PS 10/12 and or the FOS Guidance are found to impose additional requirements over and 
above the common law and the FSA Conduct of Business rules in force at the time relating to the sale of general 
insurance products, and in the handling of firms’ PPI complaints; the effect of any decision on the nature and volume 
of customer complaints; and the extent to which, if at all, HSBC might be required to take action, and the nature of 
any such action, in relation to non-complainants. The extent of any redress that may be required as a result of a 
decision to uphold PS 10/12 and the FOS Guidance, in whole or in part, would also depend on the facts and 
circumstances of each individual customer’s case. For these reasons, among others, HSBC does not at this time 
consider it practicable to provide a reliable estimate or range of estimates of the potential financial impact of an 
adverse decision. 
Pending resolution of the dispute, HSBC continues to review all complaints received which allege that PPI has been 
mis-sold and, where possible, seeks to resolve them. Where HSBC considers it is not in a position to reach a final 
decision on a complaint until the conclusion of the application for Judicial Review of PS 10/12 and the FOS 
Guidance and any subsequent appeals, it informs the complainant that this is the case. 
In December 2007, the Group decided to cease selling PPI products in the UK and a phased withdrawal was 
completed across the HSBC, first direct and M&S Money brands during 2008. HFC Bank Ltd (‘HFC’) ceased selling 
single premium PPI in 2008 and sales of regular premium PPI will reduce as HFC exits its remaining retail 
relationships. During the consultation process in 2009, the FSA reported that it had obtained agreement from firms 
representing 40% of the market for face to face single premium PPI sales to review all such sales since July 2007. No 
HSBC subsidiary or associate was included in that group of firms. 
Regulatory and law enforcement agencies investigations 
HSBC Bank USA entered into a consent cease and desist order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
and the indirect parent of that company, HSBC North America, entered into a consent cease and desist order with the 
Federal Reserve Board in the first week of October 2010. These actions require improvements for an effective 
compliance risk management programme across the Group’s US businesses, including US Bank Secrecy Act (‘BSA’) 
and Anti Money Laundering (‘AML’) compliance. Steps continue to be taken to address the requirements of these 
Orders and to ensure that compliance and effective policies and procedures are maintained. 
Various HSBC Group companies are the subject of ongoing investigations, including Grand Jury subpoenas and other 
requests for information, by US Government agencies, including the US Attorney’s Office, the US Department of 
Justice and the New York County District Attorney’s Office. These investigations pertain to, among other matters, 
HSBC Bank USA’s bank note and foreign correspondent banking businesses and its compliance with BSA and AML 
controls, as well as various HSBC companies’ compliance with Office of Foreign Asset Control (‘OFAC’) 
requirements, and adherence by certain customers to US tax reporting requirements. 
The consent cease and desist orders do not preclude additional enforcement actions against HSBC Bank USA or 
HSBC North America by bank regulatory or law enforcement agencies, including actions to recover civil money 
penalties, fines and other financial penalties relating to activities which were the subject of the cease and desist 
orders. In addition, it is likely that there could be some form of formal enforcement action in respect of some or all of 
the ongoing investigations. Actual or threatened enforcement actions against other financial institutions for breaches 
of BSA, AML and OFAC requirements have resulted in settlements involving fines and penalties, some of which 
have been significant depending on the individual circumstances of each action. The ongoing investigations are at an 
early stage. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to determine the terms on 
which the ongoing investigations will be resolved or the timing of such resolution or for HSBC to estimate reliably 
the amounts, or range of possible amounts, of any fines and/or penalties. As matters progress, it is possible that any 
fines and/or penalties could be significant.

The above outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, 
including interest rates and security, as for comparable transactions with third-party counterparties.
Post-employment benefit plans 
At 31 December 2010, US$4.7bn (2009: US$4.2bn) of HSBC post-employment benefit plan assets were under 
management by HSBC companies. Fees of US$17m (2009: US$15m) were earned by HSBC companies for these 
management services provided to its post-employment benefit plans. HSBC’s post-employment benefit plans had 
placed deposits of US$1,840m (2009: US$929m) with its banking subsidiaries, on which interest payable to the 
schemes amounted to US$4m (2009: US$3m). The above outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of 
business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and security, as for comparable transactions 
with third-party counterparties. 
HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme entered into swap transactions with HSBC as part of the management of the 
inflation and interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. At 31 December 2010, the gross notional value of the swaps was 
US$22.9bn (2009: US$23.7bn), the swaps had a positive fair value of US$2.2bn (2009: positive fair value of 
US$1.0bn) to the scheme and HSBC had delivered collateral of US$3.3bn (2009: US$2.8bn) to the scheme in respect 
of these swaps, on which HSBC earned interest amounting to nil (2009: US$7m). All swaps were executed at 
prevailing market rates and within standard market bid/offer spreads. 
In order to satisfy diversification requirements, there are special collateral provisions for the swap transactions 
between HSBC and the scheme. The collateral agreement stipulates that the scheme never posts collateral to HSBC.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)

Collateral is posted to the scheme by HSBC at an amount that provides the Trustee with a high level of confidence 
that would be sufficient to replace the swaps in the event of default by HSBC Bank plc. With the exception of the 
special collateral arrangements detailed above, all other aspects of the swap transactions between HSBC and the 
scheme are on substantially the same terms as comparable transactions with third-party counterparties. 
On 17 June 2010, HSBC Bank plc made a £1,760m (US$2,638m) special contribution to accelerate the reduction of 
the deficit of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme. On the same day the Scheme used the contribution to acquire 
debt securities with a fair value of £1,760m (US$2,638m) from HSBC in a transaction at an arm’s length value 
determined by the Scheme’s independent third-party advisors.  
HSBC International Staff Retirements Benefits Scheme entered into swap transactions with HSBC to manage the 
inflation and interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities and selected assets. At 31 December 2010, the gross notional 
value of the swaps was US$1.8bn (2009: US$1.8bn) and the swaps had a net positive fair value of US$77m to the 
scheme (2009: US$27m).

Taxation of shares and dividends 
Taxation – UK residents 
The following is a summary, under current law, of 
certain UK tax considerations that are likely to be 
material to the ownership and disposition of shares. 
The summary does not purport to be a 
comprehensive description of all the tax 
considerations that may be relevant to a holder of 
shares. In particular, the summary deals principally 
with shareholders who are resident solely in the UK 
for UK tax purposes and only with holders who hold 
the shares as investments and who are the beneficial 
owners of the shares, and does not address the tax 
treatment of certain classes of holders such as 
dealers in securities. Holders and prospective 
purchasers should consult their own advisers 
regarding the tax consequences of an investment 
in shares in light of their particular circumstances, 
including the effect of any national, state or local 
laws.
Taxation of dividends 
Currently no tax is withheld from dividends paid by 
HSBC Holdings. However, dividends are paid with 
an associated tax credit which is available for set-off 
by certain shareholders against any liability they 
may have to UK income tax. Currently, the 
associated tax credit is equivalent to 10% of the 
combined cash dividend and tax credit, i.e. one-ninth 
of the cash dividend. 
For individual shareholders who are resident 
in the UK for taxation purposes and liable to UK 
income tax at the basic rate, no further UK income 
tax liability arises on the receipt of a dividend from 
HSBC Holdings. Individual shareholders who are 
liable to UK income tax at the  higher rate or 
additional rate  are taxed on the combined amount of 
the dividend and the tax credit at the dividend upper 
rate (currently 32.5%) and the dividend additional 
rate (currently 42.5%), respectively. The tax credit is 
available for set-off against the dividend upper rate 
and the dividend additional rate liability. Individual 
UK resident shareholders are not entitled to any tax 
credit repayment. 
Although non-UK resident shareholders are 
generally not entitled to any repayment of the tax 
credit in respect of any UK dividend received, some 
such shareholders may be so entitled under the 
provisions of a double taxation agreement between 
their country of residence and the UK. However, in 
most cases no amount of the tax credit is, in practice, 
repayable. 
Information on the taxation consequences of the 
HSBC Holdings scrip dividends offered in lieu of the 
2009 fourth interim dividend and the first, second 
and third interim dividends for 2010 was set out in 
the Secretary’s letters to shareholders of 30 March, 
2 June, 1 September and 1 December 2010. In no 
case, was the difference between the cash dividend 
foregone and the market value of the scrip dividend 
in excess of 15% of the market value. Accordingly, 
the amount of the dividend income chargeable to tax, 
and, the acquisition price of HSBC Holdings 
US$0.50 ordinary shares (the ‘shares’) for UK 
capital gains tax purposes, was the cash dividend 
foregone.
Taxation of capital gains 
The computation of the capital gains tax liability 
arising on disposals of shares in HSBC Holdings by 
shareholders subject to UK tax on capital gains can 
be complex, partly depending on whether, for 
example, the shares were purchased since April 
1991, acquired in 1991 in exchange for shares in 
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation 
Limited, or acquired subsequent to 1991 in exchange 
for shares in other companies.  
For capital gains tax purposes, the acquisition 
cost for ordinary shares is adjusted to take account 
of subsequent rights and capitalisation issues. Any 
capital gain arising on a disposal by a UK company 
may also be adjusted to take account of indexation 
allowance. If in doubt, shareholders are 
recommended to consult their professional advisers. 
Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax 
Transfers of shares by a written instrument of 
transfer generally will be subject to UK stamp duty 
at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the 
transfer, and such stamp duty is generally payable by 
the transferee. 
An agreement to transfer shares, or any interest 
therein, normally will give rise to a charge to stamp 
duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% of the 
consideration. However, provided an instrument of 
transfer of the shares is executed pursuant to the 
agreement and duly stamped before the date on 
which the stamp duty reserve tax becomes payable, 
under the current practice of UK HM Revenue and 
Customs it will not be necessary to pay the stamp 
duty reserve tax, nor to apply for such tax to be 
cancelled. Stamp duty reserve tax is generally 
payable by the transferee. 
Paperless transfers of shares within CREST, the 
UK’s paperless share transfer system, are liable to  377
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% of the 
consideration. In CREST transactions, the tax 
is calculated and payment made automatically. 
Deposits of shares into CREST generally will not be 
subject to stamp duty reserve tax, unless the transfer 
into CREST is itself for consideration. Following the 
case HSBC pursued before the European Court of 
Justice (Case C-569/07 HSBC Holdings plc and 
Vidacos Nominees v The Commissioners for HM 
Revenue & Customs) HMRC now accepts that the 
charge to stamp duty reserve tax at 1.5% on the issue 
of shares to a depositary receipt issuer or a clearance 
service located within the European Union is 
prohibited.
Taxation – US residents 
The following is a summary, under current law, of 
the principal UK tax and US federal income tax 
considerations that are likely to be material to the 
ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs by a 
holder that is a resident of the US for US federal 
income tax purposes (a ‘US holder’) and who is not 
resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for U tax 
purposes.. The summary does not purport to be a 
comprehensive description of all of the tax 
considerations that may be relevant to a holder of 
shares or ADSs. In particular, the summary deals 
only with US holders that hold shares or ADSs as 
capital assets, and does not address the tax treatment 
of holders that are subject to special tax rules, such 
as banks, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, 
dealers in securities or currencies, persons that hold 
shares or ADSs as part of an integrated investment 
(including a ‘straddle’) comprised of a share or ADS 
and one or more other positions, and persons that 
own, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the 
voting stock of HSBC Holdings. This discussion is 
based on laws, treaties, judicial decisions and 
regulatory interpretations in effect on the date 
hereof, all of which are subject to change. Under the 
current income tax treaty between the UK and the 
US, US holders are no longer entitled to claim a 
special foreign tax credit in respect of dividends. 
Holders and prospective purchasers should 
consult their own advisers regarding the tax 
consequences of an investment in shares or ADSs 
in light of their particular circumstances, including 
the effect of any national, state or local laws. 
Any US federal tax advice included in this 
Annual Report is for informational purposes only; 
it was not intended or written to be used, and cannot 
be used, for the purpose of avoiding US federal tax 
penalties.
Taxation of dividends 
Currently no tax is withheld from dividends paid by 
HSBC Holdings.  A US holder must include cash 
dividends paid on the shares or ADSs in ordinary 
income on the date that such holder or the ADS 
depositary receives them, translating dividends paid 
in UK pounds sterling into US dollars using the 
exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. A US 
holder that elects to receive shares in lieu of a cash 
dividend must include in ordinary income the fair 
market value of such shares on the dividend payment 
date, and the tax basis of those shares will equal such 
fair market value. 
Subject to certain exceptions for positions that 
are held for less than 61 days or are hedged, and 
subject to a foreign corporation being considered a 
‘qualified foreign corporation’ (which includes not 
being classified for US federal income tax purposes 
as a passive foreign investment company), certain 
dividends (‘qualified dividends’) received by an 
individual US holder before 2013 generally will be 
subject to US taxation at a maximum rate of 15%. 
Based on the company’s audited financial statements 
and relevant market and shareholder data, HSBC 
Holdings does not anticipate being classified as a 
passive foreign investment company. Accordingly, 
dividends paid on the shares or ADSs generally 
should be treated as qualified dividends. 
Taxation of capital gains 
Gains realised by a US holder on the sale or other 
disposition of shares or ADSs normally will not be 
subject to UK taxation unless at the time of the sale 
or other disposition the holder carries on a trade, 
profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or 
agency or permanent establishment and the shares or 
ADSs are or have been used, held or acquired for the 
purposes of such trade, profession, vocation, branch 
or agency or permanent establishment. Such gains 
will be included in income for US tax purposes, and 
will be long-term capital gains if the shares or ADSs 
were held for more than one year. A long-term 
capital gain realised by an individual holder before 
2013 generally will be subject to US tax at a 
maximum rate of 15%. 
Inheritance tax 
Shares or ADSs held by an individual whose 
domicile is determined to be the US for the purposes 
of the United States-United Kingdom Double 
Taxation Convention relating to estate and gift taxes 
(the ‘Estate Tax Treaty’) and who is not for such 
purposes a national of the UK will not, provided any 
US Federal estate or gift tax chargeable has been  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 
Shareholder Information (continued)
T axation of shares and dividends 
378
paid, be subject to UK inheritance tax on the 
individual’s death or on a lifetime transfer of shares 
or ADSs except in certain cases where the shares or 
ADSs (i) are comprised in a settlement (unless, at the 
time of the settlement, the settlor was domiciled in 
the US and was not a national of the UK), (ii) is 
part of the business property of a UK permanent 
establishment of an enterprise, or (iii) pertains to 
a UK fixed base of an individual used for the 
performance of independent personal services. In 
such cases, the Estate Tax Treaty generally provides 
a credit against US Federal tax liability for the 
amount of any tax paid in the UK in a case where the 
shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance 
tax and to US Federal estate or gift tax. 
Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax – 
ADSs
If shares are transferred to a clearance service or 
depository receipt (‘ADR’)  issuer located outside 
the European Union (which will include a transfer 
of shares to the Depository) UK stamp duty and/or 
stamp duty reserve tax will be payable. The stamp 
duty or stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable 
on the consideration for the transfer and is payable 
at the aggregate rate of 1.5%. 
The amount of stamp duty reserve tax payable 
on such a transfer will be reduced by any stamp duty 
paid in connection with the same transfer. 
No stamp duty will be payable on the transfer 
of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS, provided that 
the ADR and any separate instrument of transfer or 
written agreement to transfer remain at all times 
outside the UK, and provided further that any such 
transfer or written agreement to transfer is not 
executed in the UK. No stamp duty reserve tax will 
be payable on a transfer of, or agreement to transfer, 
an ADS effected by the transfer of an ADR. 
US backup withholding tax and information 
reporting 
Distributions made on shares or ADSs and proceeds 
from the sale of shares or ADSs that are paid within 
the US, or through certain financial intermediaries to 
US holders, are subject to information reporting and 
may be subject to a US ‘backup’ withholding tax 
unless, in general, the US holder complies with 
certain certification procedures or is a corporation or 
other person exempt from such withholding. Holders 
that are not US persons generally are not subject to 
information reporting or backup withholding tax, 
but may be required to comply with applicable 
certification procedures to establish that they are not 
US persons in order to avoid the application of such 
information reporting requirements or backup 
withholding tax to payments received within the 
US or through certain financial intermediaries. 379
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Cautionary statement regarding 
forward-looking statements 
The Annual Report and Accounts 2010 contains 
certain forward-looking statements with respect to 
HSBC’s financial condition, results of operations 
and business. 
Statements that are not historical facts, including 
statements about HSBC’s beliefs and expectations, 
are forward-looking statements. Words such as 
‘expects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’, 
‘seeks’, ‘estimates’, ‘potential’ and ‘reasonably 
possible’, variations of these words and similar 
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking 
statements. These statements are based on current 
plans, estimates and projections, and therefore undue 
reliance should not be placed on them. Forward-
looking statements speak only as of the date they are 
made, and it should not be assumed that they have 
been revised or updated in the light of new 
information or future events. 
Written and/or oral forward-looking statements 
may also be made in the periodic reports to the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission, summary 
financial statements to shareholders, proxy statements, 
offering circulars and prospectuses, press releases 
and other written materials, and in oral statements 
made by HSBC’s Directors, officers or employees to 
third parties, including financial analysts. 
Forward-looking statements involve inherent 
risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that a 
number of factors could cause actual results to differ, 
in some instances materially, from those anticipated 
or implied in any forward-looking statement. These 
include, but are not limited to:  
• changes in general economic conditions in the 
markets in which we operate, such as continuing 
or deepening recessions and fluctuations in 
employment beyond those factored into 
consensus forecasts; changes in foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates; volatility in 
equity markets; lack of liquidity in wholesale 
funding markets; illiquidity and downward price 
pressure in national real estate markets; adverse 
changes in central banks’ policies with respect 
to the provision of liquidity support to financial 
markets; heightened market concerns over 
sovereign creditworthiness in over-indebted 
countries; adverse changes in the funding status  
of public or private defined benefit pensions; 
and consumer perception as to the continuing 
availability of credit and price competition in 
the market segments we serve; 
• changes in government policy and regulation, 
including the monetary, interest rate and other 
policies of central banks and other regulatory 
authorities; initiatives to change the size, 
scope of activities and interconnectedness of 
financial institutions in connection with the 
implementation of stricter regulation of financial 
institutions in key markets worldwide; revised 
capital and liquidity benchmarks which could 
serve to deleverage bank balance sheets and 
lower returns available from the current business 
model and portfolio mix; imposition of levies or 
taxes designed to change business mix and risk 
appetite; the practices, pricing or responsibilities 
of financial institutions serving their consumer 
markets; expropriation, nationalisation, 
confiscation of assets and changes in legislation 
relating to foreign ownership; changes in 
bankruptcy legislation in the principal markets 
in which we operate and the consequences 
thereof; general changes in government policy 
that may significantly influence investor 
decisions; extraordinary government actions as a 
result of current market turmoil; other 
unfavourable political or diplomatic 
developments producing social instability or 
legal uncertainty which in turn may affect 
demand for our products and services; the costs, 
effects and outcomes of product regulatory 
reviews, actions or litigation, including any 
additional compliance requirements; and the 
effects of competition in the markets where we 
operate including increased competition from 
non-bank financial services companies, 
including securities firms; and 
• factors specific to HSBC, including our success 
in adequately identifying the risks we face, such 
as the incidence of loan losses or delinquency, 
and managing those risks (through account 
management, hedging and other techniques). 
Effective risk management depends on, among 
other things, our ability through stress testing 
and other techniques to prepare for events that 
cannot be captured by the statistical models it 
uses; and our success in addressing operational, 
legal and regulatory, and litigation challenges.   HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

A
Adjustable-rate mortgages 
(‘ARM’s) 
Mortgage loans in the US on which the interest rate is periodically changed based on a reference price. 
These are included within ‘affordability mortgages’.  
Affordability mortgages Mortgage loans where the customer’s monthly payments are set out at a low initial rate, either variable or 
fixed, before resetting to a higher rate once the introductory period is over. 
Agency exposures Exposures to near or quasi-government agencies including public sector entities fully owned by 
government carrying out non-commercial activities, provincial and local government authorities, 
development banks and funds set up by government. 
Alt-A A US description for loans regarded as lower risk than sub-prime, but with higher risk characteristics than 
lending under normal criteria. 
Arrears Customers are said to be in arrears (or in a state of delinquency) when they are behind in fulfilling their 
obligations, with the result that an outstanding loan is unpaid or overdue. When a customer is in arrears, 
the total outstanding loans on which payments are overdue are described as delinquent. 
Asset-backed securities
(‘ABS’s) 
Securities that represent an interest in an underlying pool of referenced assets. The referenced pool can 
comprise any assets which attract a set of associated cash flows but are commonly pools of residential 
or commercial mortgages.  
B
Back-testing A statistical technique used to monitor and assess the accuracy of a model, and how that model would 
have performed had it been applied in the past. 
Basel II The capital adequacy framework issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2006 in 
the form of the ‘International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards’. 
Basel III In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued final rules ‘Basel III: A global regulatory framework for 
more resilient banks and banking systems’ and ‘Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk 
measurement, standards and monitoring’. Together these documents present the Basel Committee’s 
reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity rules with the goal of promoting a more resilient 
banking sector. The new requirements will be phased in starting 1 January 2013 with full 
implementation by 1 January 2019. 
C
Capital conservation buffer A capital buffer, prescribed by regulators under Basel III, and designed to ensure banks build up capital
buffers outside periods of stress which can be drawn down as losses are incurred. Should a bank’s 
capital levels fall within the capital conservation buffer range, capital distributions will be constrained 
by the regulators.  
Capital planning buffer A capital buffer, prescribed by the FSA under Basel II, and designed to ensure banks build up capital 
buffers outside periods of stress which can be drawn down as losses are incurred. Should a bank’s 
capital levels fall within the capital planning buffer range, a period of heightened regulatory interaction 
would be triggered.  
Collateralised debt obligation 
(‘CDO’) 
A security issued by a third-party which references ABSs and/or certain other related assets purchased by 
the issuer. CDOs may feature exposure to sub-prime mortgage assets through the underlying assets. 
Collectively assessed  
impairment 
Impairment assessment on a collective basis for homogeneous groups of loans that are not considered 
individually significant and to cover losses which have been incurred but have not yet been identified 
on loans subject to individual assessment. 
Commercial paper (‘CP’) An unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by a corporation, typically for the financing of accounts
receivable, inventories and meeting short-term liabilities. The debt is usually issued at a discount, 
reflecting prevailing market interest rates. 
Commercial real estate Any real estate investment, comprising buildings or land, intended to generate a profit, either from capital
gain or rental income. 
Common equity tier 1 capital The highest quality form of regulatory capital under Basel III that comprises common shares issued and 
related share premium, retained earnings and other reserves excluding the cash flow hedging reserve, 
less specified regulatory adjustments. 
Conduits HSBC sponsors and manages multi-seller conduits and securities investment conduits (‘SIC’s). The multi-
seller conduits hold interests in diversified pools of third-party assets such as vehicle loans, trade 
receivables and credit card receivables funded through the issuance of short-dated commercial paper 
and supported by a liquidity facility. The SICs hold predominantly asset-backed securities referencing 
such items as commercial and residential mortgages, vehicle loans and credit card receivables funded 
through the issuance of both long-term and short-term debt. 
Constant net asset value fund 
(‘CNAV’) 
A fund that prices its assets on an amortised cost basis, subject to the amortised book value of the portfolio 
remaining within 50 basis points of its market value. 
Contractual maturities The date on which the final payment (principal or interest) of any financial instrument is due to be paid, at 
which point all the remaining outstanding principal and interest have been repaid. 
Core tier 1 capital The highest quality form of regulatory capital that comprises total shareholders’ equity and related 
non-controlling interests, less goodwill and intangible assets and certain other regulatory adjustments. 
Countercyclical capital buffer A capital buffer, prescribed by regulators under Basel III, which aims to ensure the banking sector capital 
requirements take account of the macro-financial environment in which banks operate. This will 
provide the banking sector with additional capital to protect it against potential future losses, when 
excess credit growth in the financial system as a whole is associated with an increase in system-wide 
risk.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Term Definition 
Credit default swap A derivative contract whereby a buyer pays a fee to a seller in return for receiving a payment in the event
of a defined credit event (e.g. bankruptcy, payment default on a reference asset or assets, or downgrades 
by a rating agency) on an underlying obligation (which may or may not be held by the buyer). 
Credit derivative product 
companies (‘CDPC’s) 
Independent companies that specialise in selling credit default protection on corporate exposures in the 
form of credit derivatives. 
Credit enhancements Facilities used to enhance the creditworthiness of financial obligations and cover losses due to asset 
default.  
Credit risk Risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. It arises 
mainly from direct lending, trade finance and leasing business, but also from products such as 
guarantees, derivatives and debt securities. 
Credit risk adjustment An adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect the creditworthiness of OTC 
derivative counterparties. 
Credit risk mitigation A technique to reduce the credit risk associated with an exposure by application of credit risk mitigants
such as collateral, guarantee and credit protection. 
Credit risk spread The premium over the benchmark or risk-free rate required by the market to accept a lower credit quality. 
The yield spread between securities with the same coupon rate and maturity structure but with different 
associated credit risks. The yield spread rises as the credit rating worsens.  
Customer deposits Money deposited by account holders. Such funds are recorded as liabilities. 
Customer risk rating (‘CRR’) A scale of 23 grades measuring internal obligor probability of default. 
D
Debt restructuring A restructuring by which the terms and provisions of outstanding debt agreements are changed. This is 
often done in order to improve cash flow and the ability of the borrower to repay the debt. It can 
involve altering the repayment schedule as well as debt or interest charge reduction. 
Debt securities Assets on the Group’s balance sheet representing certificates of indebtedness of credit institutions, public 
bodies or other undertakings, excluding those issued by Central Banks. 
Debt securities in issue Transferable certificates of indebtedness of the Group to the bearer of the certificates. These are liabilities 
of the Group and include certificates of deposits. 
Deed-in-lieu An arrangement in which a borrower agrees to surrender the deed for the property to the lender without 
going through foreclosure proceedings and is subsequently released from any further obligations on the 
loan.
Delinquency See ‘Arrears’. 
E
Economic capital The internally calculated capital requirement which is deemed necessary by HSBC to support the risks to 
which it is exposed at a confidence level consistent with a target credit rating of AA. 
Economic profit The difference between the return on financial capital invested by shareholders (‘return on invested 
capital’) and the cost of that capital. Economic profit may be expressed as a whole number or as a 
percentage. 
Equity risk The risk arising from positions, either long or short, in equities or equity-based instruments, which create 
exposure to a change in the market price of the equities or equity instruments. 
Expected loss (‘EL’) A regulatory calculation of the amount expected to be lost on an exposure using a 12 month time horizon 
and downturn loss estimates. EL is calculated by multiplying the Probability of Default (a percentage) 
by the Exposure at Default (an amount) and Loss Given Default (a percentage). 
Exposure A claim, contingent claim or position which carries a risk of financial loss. 
Exposure at default (‘EAD’) The amount expected to be outstanding after any credit risk mitigation, if and when the counterparty
defaults. EAD reflects drawn balances as well as allowance for undrawn amounts of commitments and 
contingent exposures. 
F
Fair value adjustment An adjustment to the fair value of a financial instrument which is determined using a valuation technique
(level 2 and level 3) to include additional factors that would be considered by a market participant that 
are not incorporated within the valuation model. 
First lien A security interest granted over an item of property to secure the repayment of a debt that places its 
holder first in line to collect repayment from the sale of the underlying collateral in the event of a 
default on the debt. 
Forbearance strategies Strategies that are employed in order to improve the management of customer relationships, maximise 
collection opportunities and, if possible, avoid foreclosure or repossession. Such arrangements include 
extended payment terms, a reduction in interest or principal repayments, approved external debt 
management plans, the deferral of foreclosures, other modifications and loan restructures. 
Funded exposures A funded exposure is one where the notional amount of a contract is or has been exchanged. 
Funding risk A form of liquidity risk arising when the liquidity needed to fund illiquid asset positions cannot be 
obtained at the expected terms and when required.  385
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Term Definition 
G
Government-sponsored 
enterprises (‘GSE’s) 
A group of financial services enterprises created by the US Congress. Their function is to reduce the cost 
of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy, and to make them more efficient and 
transparent. Examples in the residential mortgage borrowing segment are Freddie Mac and Fannie 
Mae. GSEs carry the implicit backing of the US Government, but they are not direct obligations of the 
US Government. 
H
Historical rating transition  
matrices (‘HRTM’) 
HRTMs show the probability of a counterparty with a particular rating moving to a different rating over a 
defined time horizon. 
Home Equity Lines of Credit 
(‘HELoC’s) 
A form of revolving credit facility provided to US customers, which is supported by a first or second lien 
charge over residential property. 
I
Impaired loans Loans where the Group does not expect to collect all the contractual cash flows or expects to collect them 
later than they are contractually due. 
Impairment allowances  Management’s best estimate of losses incurred in the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. 
Individually assessed  
impairment 
Exposure to loss is assessed on all individually significant accounts and all other accounts that do not 
qualify for collective assessment.   
Insurance risk A risk, other than a financial risk, transferred from the holder of a contract to the insurance provider. The 
principal insurance risk is that, over time, the combined cost of claims, administration and acquisition 
of the contract may exceed the aggregate amount of premiums received and investment income. 
Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process 
(‘ICAAP’) 
The Group’s own assessment of the levels of capital that it needs to hold through an examination of its 
risk profile from regulatory and economic capital viewpoints. 
Internal Model Method (‘IMM’) One of three approaches defined by Basel II to determine exposure values for counterparty credit risk. 
Internal ratings-based approach 
(‘IRB’) 
A method of calculating credit risk capital requirements using internal, rather than supervisory, estimates 
of risk parameters. 
Invested capital Equity capital invested in HSBC by its shareholders. 
IRB advanced approach A method of calculating credit risk capital requirements using internal PD, LGD and EAD models. 
IRB foundation approach A method of calculating credit risk capital requirements using internal PD models but with supervisory 
estimates of LGD and conversion factors for the calculation of EAD. 
ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association. 
ISDA Master agreement Standardised contract developed by ISDA used as an umbrella under which bilateral derivatives contracts 
are entered into. 
K

L
Level 1 – quoted market price Financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
Level 2 – valuation technique 
using observable inputs 
Financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for 
identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models 
where all significant inputs are observable. 
Level 3 – valuation technique  
with significant unobservable 
inputs
Financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are 
unobservable. 
Leveraged finance Funding provided for entities with higher than average indebtedness, which typically arises from sub-
investment grade acquisitions or event-driven financing. 
Leverage ratio A measure, prescribed by regulators under Basel III, which is the ratio of tier 1 capital to total exposures. 
Total exposures include on-balance sheet items, off-balance sheet items and derivatives, and should 
generally follow the accounting measure of exposure. This supplementary measure to the risk-based 
capital requirements is intended to constrain the build-up of excess leverage in the banking sector. 
Liquidity risk The risk that HSBC does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due, or 
will have to do so at an excessive cost. This risk arises from mismatches in the timing of cash flows. 
Loan modification An account management action that results in a change to the original terms and conditions of a loan either 
temporarily or permanently without resetting the delinquency status of the loan, except in case of a 
‘modification re-age’ where delinquency status is also reset to up-to-date. Account modifications may 
include revisions to one or more terms of the loan including, but not limited to, a change in interest rate, 
extension of the amortisation period, reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment 
of principal.  HSBC HOLDINGS PLC

Term Definition 
Loan re-age An account management action that results in the resetting of the contractual delinquency status of an 
account to up-to-date upon fulfilment of certain requirements which indicate that payments are 
expected to be made in accordance with the contractual terms. 
Loans past due Loans on which repayments are overdue. 
Loan-to-value ratio (‘LTV’) A mathematical calculation that expresses the amount of the loan as a percentage of the value of security.
A high LTV indicates that there is less cushion to protect the lender against house price falls or 
increases in the loan if repayments are not made and interest is added to the outstanding loan balance. 
Loss given default (‘LGD’) The estimated ratio (percentage) of the loss on an exposure to the amount outstanding at default (EAD)
upon default of a counterparty. 
Loss severity The realised amount of losses incurred (including ancillary amounts owed) when a loan is foreclosed or 
disposed of through the arrangement with the borrower. The loss severity is represented as a percentage 
of the outstanding loan balance. 
M
Market risk The risk that movements in market risk factors, including foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, 
interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices will reduce income or portfolio values. 
Medium term notes  
(‘MTN’s) 
Notes issued by corporates across a range of maturities. MTNs are frequently issued by corporates under 
MTN Programmes whereby notes are offered on a regular and continuous basis to investors. 
Monoline insurers
(‘monolines’) 
Entities which specialise in providing credit protection to the holders of debt instruments in the event of 
default by the debt security counterparty. This protection is typically held in the form of derivatives 
such as CDS’s referencing the underlying exposures held. 
Mortgage-backed securities 
(‘MBS’s) 
Securities that represent interests in groups of mortgages, which may be on residential or commercial 
properties. Investors in these securities have the right to cash received from future mortgage payments 
(interest and/or principal). When the MBS references mortgages with different risk profiles, the MBS is 
classified according to the highest risk class.  
Mortgage-related assets Assets which are referenced to underlying mortgages. 
Mortgage vintage The year a mortgage was originated. 
N
Negative equity mortgages Equity is the value of the asset less the outstanding balance on the loan. Negative equity arises when the 
value of the property purchased is below the balance outstanding on the loan.  
Net asset value per share Total shareholders’ equity, less non-cumulative preference shares and capital securities, divided by the
number of ordinary shares in issue. 
Net interest income The amount of interest received or receivable on assets net of interest paid or payable on liabilities. 
Net principal exposure The gross principal amount of a financial asset after taking account of credit protection purchased but 
excluding the effect of any counterparty credit valuation adjustment to that protection. It includes assets 
that benefit from monoline protection, except where this protection is purchased with a CDS. 
Non-conforming mortgages US mortgages that do not meet normal lending criteria. Examples include mortgages where the expected 
level of documentation is not provided (such as with income self-certification), or where poor credit 
history increases the risk and results in pricing at a higher than normal lending rate. 
O
Overnight Index Swap (‘OIS’) 
discounting 
A method of valuing collateralised interest rate derivatives which uses a discount curve that reflects the 
overnight interest rate typically earned or paid in respect of collateral received.  
Operational risk The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external 
events, including legal risk. 
Over-the-counter  
(‘OTC’)

of capital in private companies or the acquisition of a public company that results in the delisting of 
public equity. 
Probability of default (‘PD’) The probability that an obligor will default within a one-year time horizon. 
R
Regulatory capital The capital which HSBC holds, determined in accordance with rules established by the FSA for the 
consolidated Group and by local regulators for individual Group companies. 
Renegotiated loans Loans whose terms have been renegotiated and are treated as up-to-date loans for measurement purposes 
once the specified number and/or amount of qualifying payments required under the new arrangements 
have been received. 
Restricted Shares Awards of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares to which employees will normally become entitled, generally 
between one and three years, subject to remaining an employee.  387
Overview Operating & Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 
Term Definition 
Retail loans Money lent to individuals rather than institutions. This includes both secured and unsecured loans such as 
mortgages and credit card balances. 
Return on equity Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by average invested capital. 
Risk appetite An assessment of the types and quantum of risks to which HSBC wishes to be exposed. 
Risk-weighted assets
(‘RWA’s) 
Calculated by assigning a degree of risk expressed as a percentage (risk weight) to an exposure in 
accordance with the applicable Standardised or IRB approach rules. 
S
Seasoning The emergence of credit loss patterns in portfolios over time. 
Second lien A security interest granted over an item of property to secure the repayment of a debt that is issued against 
the same collateral as a first lien but that is subordinate to it. In the case of default, repayment for this 
debt will only be received after the first lien has been repaid. 
Securitisation A transaction or scheme whereby the credit risk associated with an exposure, or pool of exposures, is 
tranched and where payments to investors in the transaction or scheme are dependent upon the 
performance of the exposure or pool of exposures. A traditional securitisation involves the transfer of 
the exposures being securitised to an SPE which issues securities. In a synthetic securitisation, the 
tranching is achieved by the use of credit derivatives and the exposures are not removed from the 
balance sheet of the originator. 
Short sale In relation to credit risk management, a ‘short sale’ is an arrangement in which a bank permits the 
borrower to sell the property for less than the amount outstanding under a loan agreement. The proceeds 
are used to reduce the outstanding loan balance and the borrower is subsequently released from any 
further obligations on the loan. 
Single-issuer liquidity facility A liquidity or stand-by line provided to a corporate customer which is different from a similar line 
provided to a conduit funding vehicle. 
Sovereign exposures Exposures to governments, ministries, departments of governments, embassies, consulates and exposures 
on account of cash balances and deposits with central banks.  
Special purpose entities
(‘SPE’s) 
A corporation, trust or other non-bank entity, established for a narrowly defined purpose, including for 
carrying on securitisation activities. The structure of the entity and activities are intended to isolate the 
obligations of the SPE from those of the originator and the holders of the beneficial interests in the 
securitisation.
Standardised approach In relation to credit risk, a method for calculating credit risk capital requirements using External Credit
Assessment Institutions (‘ECAI’) ratings and supervisory risk weights. In relation to operational risk, a 
method of calculating the operational capital requirement by the application of a supervisory defined 
percentage charge to the gross income of eight specified business lines. 
Structured finance / notes An instrument whose return is linked to the level of a specified index or the level of a specified asset. The 
return on a structured note can be linked to equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities or 
credit. Structured notes may or may not offer full or partial capital protection in the event of a decline in 
the underlying index or asset. 
Structured Investment Vehicles 
(‘SIV’s) 
Special purpose entities which invest in diversified portfolios of interest-earning assets, generally funded 
through issues of commercial paper, medium-term notes and other senior debt to take advantage of the 
spread differentials between the assets in the SIV and the funding cost. 
Student loan related assets Securities with collateral relating to student loans. 
Subordinated liabilities Liabilities which rank after the claims of other creditors of the issuer in the event of insolvency or
liquidation. 
Sub-prime  A US description for customers with high credit risk, for example those who have limited credit histories, 
modest incomes, high debt-to-income ratios, high loan-to-value ratios (for real estate secured products) 
or have experienced credit problems caused by occasional delinquencies, prior charge-offs, bankruptcy 
or other credit-related problems. 
T
Tier 1 capital A component of regulatory capital, comprising core tier 1 and other tier 1 capital. Other tier 1 capital 
includes qualifying capital instruments such as non-cumulative perpetual preference shares and hybrid 
capital securities.

controlling interests, allowable collective impairment allowances and unrealised gains arising on the 
fair valuation of equity instruments held as available-for-sale. Tier 2 capital also includes reserves 
arising from the revaluation of properties. 
Troubled debt restructuring A US description for restructuring a debt whereby the creditor for economic or legal reasons related to a 
debtor’s financial difficulties grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. 
U
Unfunded exposures An exposure where the notional amount of a contract has not been exchanged.

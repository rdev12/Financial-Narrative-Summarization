The western region is centred around the Group’s former
headquarters in Lviv. This region typically has high levels of
precipitation which reduces the risk of winter kill over the cold
winter months through regular snow cover, and provides excellent
growing conditions in the summer especially for oil seeds through
rainfall combined with high temperatures. The majority of the
Group’s cultivated land is located in this region together with
the majority of its assets and infrastructure.

Very high levels of sunshine in the growing season mean crops
such as soya and sunflower are well suited. There is a long history
of irrigation in Crimea and the Group intends to utilise canal
access and refurbish existing frigate irrigation equipment before
committing to the investment of modern irrigation systems.
Landkom’s operations are located in two sites focused around
two operating former collective farms. This means that from a
logistical perspective operations are efficient with fields only a few
kilometres from the farm base and storage facilities. Owing to dry
weather at the time of harvest, drying is not required which adds
to the cost savings compared to other regions.

Vast expanses of land are available for profitable crop raising.
Field sizes are larger than in western Ukraine giving potential for
increased efficiencies. Rainfall is less than western Ukraine but
soil quality is excellent. The Group intends to focus maize
production in this area. Despite a large area under lease, 
the central region has the lowest level of cultivated land of
Landkom’s regions, which will change quickly. The Group
delivered excellent results on maize here in 2010.

SIGNIFICANT AGRICULTURE BUSINESS.
ABOUT THE COMPANY
The Group’s current farming operations are located throughout
Ukraine and divided to 3 operational clusters: West, Centre and
South. The “black earth” land in Ukraine is among the most fertile
in the world. In 2010, the Group has cultivated 39,000 ha of land
producing over 96,000 tonnes of crops. In 2011 the Group intends
to harvest crops from approximately 48,000 ha of land.
Future demand for agricultural feedstocks looks strong with
increased demand from growing populations and increased
protein intake, combined with legislated demand for biodiesel
related feed-stocks. With its varied crop outputs, the Group is well
placed as a platform to take advantage of price rises occurring
from supply/demand imbalances.
The Group, with its land-bank of 74,000 ha, has the opportunity to
expand its low cost farming, competing favourably against other
farming regions. The Group leases its land under agricultural land
leases, as Ukraine currently has a moratorium in place preventing
the freehold sale of agricultural land. The Group’s land leases
extend on average to approximately 11 years and contain the
right to renew and the right to buy provisions at the end of the
lease period.
The Group uses modern equipment and farming practices to
deliver yields considerably above the Ukrainian historical
averages. Following a complete management team restructuring
undertaken in 2008 and 2009, in response to the rationalisation
strategy required in the face of the global credit crunch and
collapse in commodity prices, the new management team has
executed a strategy of operating a low cost, profitable and
scalable farming model.
In order to achieve its farming strategy, the Group has 
successfully implemented the following defined objectives:
n Maintain strong relationships with land owners and local
government
n Continue to reduce costs per hectare to best in class
n Maximise the proportion of cultivated land from its total 
land holding
n Develop and incentivise staff through modern remuneration
schemes and regular training
n Develop own drying and storage capability to enable 
greater control of the crop sales process
As part of its repositioning strategy, the new management team
has successfully ensured that the Group is well regarded by the
local communities and government in the regions it operates in, as
well as nationally. The Group is a major positive contributor to the
local Ukrainian economy, contributing to social welfare projects,
reinstating derelict land to farming and improving the quality of
existing farmland through sustainable agricultural practices.

OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES INCLUDING RAPESEED, WHEAT,
BARLEY, MAIZE, SOYBEAN AND SUNFLOWER. THESE COMMODITIES
ARE ADDRESSING THE GROWING DEMANDS OF THE GLOBAL
FOOD AND BIOFUEL MARKETS. Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 5
DEMAND DRIVERS
Demand for crops is increasing for multiple reasons:
n Population increases: World population has increased over the
past 30 years and is forecast to continue to increase into the
future. Much of the world population increases are in the
world’s poorest countries. These countries will face increasing
pressure from their own populations for grain. They will turn to
grain exporting countries such as Ukraine to satisfy their
growing needs from their hungry populations. Given the higher
volatility of food prices, country stocks will be increased which
will maintain demand over the coming short to medium term
as stocks are built up.
n Increased competition from biofuel: Biofuels increase
competition for crops such as maize. In the US approximately
one third of maize grown is consumed by the biofuel industry.
This biofuel competition is likely to correlate strongly with the
price of oil.
n Increased meat and dairy production: As global populations
become more wealthy, consumption habits tend towards
increased consumption of meat and dairy. A good example is
that of China where annual meat consumption has risen from
20kg per capita to 50kg per capita between 1980 and 2007.
SUPPLY DRIVERS
Supply is becoming irrevocably more constrained:
n Limited opportunities for global planted hectares to increase:
Cities continue to grow and expand into surrounding country
areas. A majority of supply increases will need to come from
improved technology and yield rather than from increased
farmland.
n Water security: Water security will become an increasingly
important subject as rainfall becomes more volatile.
n Climate change: Climate change appears to be limiting
farming operations on previously fertile land through increased
desertification. Volatile weather conditions increase the risk of
crop failure which in turn discourages greater investment in
yield delivering fertilisers and chemicals.
n Working capital: Finally working capital is still a constraint on
the industry. A lack of working capital prevents investment in
equipment and input which in turn also restricts yield.
UKRAINIAN SITUATION
Ukraine has the largest amount of agricultural land in Europe with
almost 41m hectares capable of supporting commercial farming.
Over 79% of agricultural land (i.e., 32m ha) is used for crop
production. Of this total over 28m ha is owned by smallholders.
Almost 71% of Ukraine’s total surface area constitutes agricultural
land in contrast to 41% of total surface area in the EU. Ukraine’s
agricultural land area is almost 20% of the EU’s land area.
The agriculture sector in Ukraine has gone through a period of
considerable transition since the country achieved independence
in 1991, following the break-up of the Soviet Union. State and
collective farms were officially dismantled in 2000. Farm property
was divided among farm workers in the form of land shares and
the majority of the shareholders leased their land back to the
newly formed private agricultural associations. Over the
subsequent decade following independence, fertiliser use fell by
85% and grain production declined by 50%.
Fertile black earth soil is in limited supply globally. These soils
permit reduced fertiliser input applications for comparable yields
and give potential to deliver highly efficient farming operations.
Land and labour costs are materially lower in Ukraine than in other
regions within Europe. Given the prominence of agriculture within
the economy (approximately 18% of GDP), Ukraine can allocate a
significant portion of its crop to export markets which in turn
provides strong foreign currency generation. Ukraine is a member
of the World Trade Organisation which means it is not generally
permitted to impose export restrictions.
EQUIPMENT
The Group’s agricultural equipment fleet is predominantly western
manufactured allowing the application of best practice western
scale farming techniques into its operations. Tractors, of which the
Group has 87, are mainly John Deere and Massey Ferguson,
combines are a mix of John Deere, Massey Ferguson and Claas.
Current machinery gives the Group the ability to farm
approximately 50,000 ha.
Landkom has created a logistics business which serves Group
operations during peak times and outsourced to 3rd party clients
during the off season. The core of the fleet is 25 Freightliner trucks.
These are fitted with GPS tracking devices and are used to deliver
agricultural inputs to fields and to deliver harvested crops to
storage depots. The trucks have a wide variety of trailers ranging
from specialist grain transporting trailers to flatbed trailers used to
transport heavy equipment across the Group’s operations.
MARKET OVERVIEW
THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR DYNAMICS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. THE SUPPLY/DEMAND
BALANCE FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES IS FRAGILE WHICH HAS CAUSED PRICE
INCREASES IN 2007 AND AGAIN PUSHED UP PRICES IN 2010 TO LEVELS WHICH MARKET
COMMENTATORS BELIEVE WILL BE SUSTAINABLE FOR SOME TIME. PRESSURE IS BEING
APPLIED FROM BOTH THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES. 6 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
CHAIRMAN’S REPORT
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
The Group’s strategy remains to develop a substantial and
profitable enterprise using western farming techniques and
technologies in an underdeveloped part of Europe whilst aspiring
to the highest standards of corporate governance, with the
objective of becoming a profitable major agricultural commodity
producer for the global foodstuff and biofuel markets.
The fundamental drivers supporting the Group’s growth remain
unchanged. Long term demand for crops continues 
to increase largely as a result of global population growth and an
ever growing demand for protein food; while long term supplies of
food remain constrained through increased competition for land
with encroachment from cities and energy crops.
Ukrainian black earth is amongst the best in the world for arable
farming, permitting production costs to remain lower than in
neighbouring EU countries. The Group has a valuable land bank 
of approximately 74,000 hectares and it remains the Group’s goal
to plant as much of this land as possible and as profitably as
possible.
The global dynamics of the agriculture market place have
improved substantially over the last year. Crop prices have 
almost doubled and investor appetite has returned to Ukraine.
With improved efficiency of farming operations, costs have been
lowered to a level which will permit the Group to operate well,
even in a poor pricing environment and to deliver superior returns
in a strong pricing environment.
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
Over the past 12 months Landkom has undergone an operational
turnaround. Changes have taken place to the structure of the
operations which are beginning to come through in improved
financial performance.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCE TEAM. THE PLC BOARD IS MADE
UP OF UKRAINIAN AND INTERNATIONAL MEMBERS. Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 7
Adverse weather conditions in Ukraine were regularly in the news
during the course of the year. Severe droughts in Ukraine and
Russia were widely reported in the press. Less reported were the
heavy rains in the west of Ukraine during the harvest season which
significantly impacted the Group’s operations. Despite these
weather problems, harvested land grew by 19% to 34,506 ha. At
the same time operating costs per hectare, on a like for like basis,
fell by approximately 45%. During 2010, Landkom delivered its first
profitable crops, as a direct result of these operating cost savings.
Operations have continued successfully post the period end.
Winter planting was completed with 28,856 ha of winter crop
successfully planted. Of this, 12,862 was winter rape and 13,149
was winter wheat with the remainder being barley and rye.
The Group prepared an additional 18,800 ha of land for spring
201 1 planting. This will bring total planting to approximately 48,000 ha
for harvest in 2011. The 2011 spring crop planting covers a wider
range of crops to assist agronomic rotational requirements and
reduce crop risk. When added to the geographical diversification
between the three regions, weather and disease risk to the Group
is markedly reduced. Further expansion of the cropped land area
is likely to be focused on the central region further to balance the
Group’s geographical diversification.
FUNDRAISING
In November 2009, the Group raised $16.2 million to expand
cultivated hectarage and provide working capital. On 23 March
2011, the Group announced that it had signed a credit agreement
with Raifeissen Bank Aval for a $9 million facility which will be
drawn down to support general working capital needs and as
explained in the Chief Financial Officer’s Review, the Board
continues to manage cash flow carefully. Previously the Group
had no significant bank borrowings or debt facilities.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Although the Group generated a small EBITDA loss of $4.4 million to
the year end 2010 as a result of late, weather related losses to the
crops in the western operational unit, the Board believes that, should
crop prices remain buoyant, positive EBITDA and net profit are
achievable for 201 1.
Some of the recent price rises in commodities have been locked
in by selling forward a portion of the expected rapeseed harvest.
Prices are attractive at $600 per tonne ex VAT on a CPT (“Carriage
Paid To”) basis. This price is approximately 75% higher than those
prices achieved in 2010 forward sales and 120% higher than
prices achieved in 2009 at the bottom of the market.
Costs on like-for-like crops, fell by an average of 45%. The Group
expects these cost reductions to be maintained in future periods
subject to material increases in the prices of fertiliser, fuel and
other inputs. The Group remains focussed on cash management,
cost control and gross margin maximisation.
BOARD AND MANAGEMENT
Following a period of significant change, the past 12 months 
have provided the Group with the opportunity to integrate the
new Ukrainian management team. Staff morale is high and
the difficult restructuring decisions have been taken swiftly 
and delivered upon. Vitaliy Skotsyk through his continued 
Non-Executive position with his former employer Amaco, has
delivered a close and important working relationship with the
Group’s principal trade supplier.
After the period end, Stephen Pickup CFO indicated his 
intention to step down from the Board and the company. 
John Mapplebeck (non-executive director) has agreed to
become CFO and relinquish his non-executive responsibilities.
Stephen will continue to support the business in the next months
as a corporate finance advisor to the Board.
OUTLOOK
Initial indications on the selling prices of the 2011 crops look
encouraging, backed up by the forward sales contracts on
rapeseed agreed during March 2011 at 75% higher levels than
2010 prices. As operating performance and cash generation
improve, the Group will have increased flexibility on the timing 
of crop sales.
The Board feels that the Group is now in its strongest position since
its IPO in 2007. Commodity prices are high and costs are under
control. The business remains highly operationally geared and is
well positioned to reap the financial benefits of a prolonged
period of positive pricing in the soft commodities market.
The Group continues to be presented with various opportunities 
for expansion but its immediate goal is to continue to plant as
much of the land bank as profitably possible and to deliver
positive EBITDA and net profits.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Welcome to the fourth Annual Report of Landkom, which outlines
the progress made during 2010. Since joining the Group in
September 2009 and taking the role of Chief Executive Officer in
November 2009, my focus has been to turn around the operations
into an efficiently run professional farming enterprise combining
best in class Ukrainian know-how and state of the art western
farming technology together with the highest standards of
corporate governance through the International Board. I brought
many trusted colleagues from my previous projects, which has not
only facilitated restructuring but also helped to introduce and
incorporate company values.
Valuable assets of land, equipment and know-how exist in the
Group and with the correct leadership they can be combined to
produce a model agricultural business in Ukraine. The Group’s goal
is not to just deliver the highest yield, but to achieve the optimal
trade-off between cost and yield in order to maximise profit. The
Group is on course to deliver this objective in 201 1 by achieving
yield improvements whilst maintaining comparable costs.
LAND
Land is the key asset within the business. The Group’s Ukrainian
central management has been set up in Kiev to ensure that land
on all geographical regions of Ukraine obtain visibility and
maintain importance in the Group’s future plans.
The famous “black earth” soil which runs through the heart of
Ukraine is core to our operations. Having remained derelict for
much of the last 20 years, groups like Landkom are in the process
of revitalising it to its former prominence. Productivity will increase
year on year as the soil structure improves and nutrients are
improved through sustainable applications of inputs and informed
crop rotation.
THIS REPORT
OUTLINES THE
PROGRESS MADE
IN THE GROUP
DURING 2010. 
VITALIY SKOTSYK Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010 9
Although the land bank has remained constant at approximately
74,000 ha, the Group has undertaken a considerable series of land
swaps which has changed the actual land held within the land
bank. Land currently in the land bank has either been farmed by
the Group or is in economically viable clusters which will permit
efficient farming in the short term.
Land acquisition costs are rising in Ukraine as the economy
improves and investment returns to the agriculture sector on the
back of increasing commodity prices. The Group estimates that
the value of the unused land bank amounts to around $5 million.
There is no recorded balance sheet value to the land bank given
that it is held through leases and the land acquisition costs have
been expensed in the first years of operations.
The moratorium on agricultural freehold land sales remains in
place although the Ukrainian government is formulating plans to
remove the restrictions and permit landowners to sell or mortgage
their land holdings which would provide a significant stimulus to
the economy. The Group continues to monitor the situation
carefully. The Group’s leases all contain last right of refusal to
purchase in the event that the moratorium is lifted. Typical new
leases with individuals have a 15 year “right to buy” provision.
Currently the Group has seven operating modules ranging from
7,000 to 12,000 ha. Five are in the western region with one in each
of the south and central regions.
STORAGE AND LOGISTICS
During the course of 2010, the Group’s rail-side storage facility in Lviv
Oblast has been significantly upgraded and has become fully
functional with all necessary state approvals. Its dryer and storage
was extensively used in 2010 for Landkom’s own production which
helped reduce costs.
The site is fully licensed with the State Agrarian Fund and has been
used throughout the winter storing third party grain and delivering
extra revenue. Construction of railway line has been completed and
the silo is now able to unload grain directly to railway cars. An extra
buffer zone was constructed thereby increasing handling capacity
by 500 tonnes per day.
A gas pipeline is in the process of construction with plans to connect
the dryer to gas in the first half 201 1 which will reduce the drying costs
significantly compared to the diesel used in the past.
The Group still plans to construct the second phase of the silo, which
was purchased in 2007/8, when resources become available to
finance the project. The Group’s medium term strategy remains to
have up to five silo facilities across the Group’s main areas of
operations. This will decrease costs and permit more flexibility and
control over the crop selling process. Until the medium term strategy
is executed, the Group will continue, when needed, to use good
relationships developed with local silo owners to ensure the harvest is
carefully handled post-harvest and pre sale.
The modular system has also helped to reduce logistics costs by
minimising the distance travelled by machinery to get to the fields.
Deliveries are made locally which reduces time to field and 
reduces the risk of missing weather windows for making specific 
field applications.
FARM BASES
Regional farm bases provide secure areas to store and monitor
crop inputs close to where they are required. Additionally they are
used to carry out repairs on agricultural equipment and to store
water and fuel. The Group has 18 bases around the country in
regions where it leases land. There is an ongoing process of base
refurbishment to improve the efficiency of the service they provide
to the operations where they are located.
AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT
During 2010 a certain element of new machinery was purchased
to meet the requirements of the additional spring crops cultivated.
Given the resurgence of lease financing in Ukraine, the Group
intends to resume capital expenditure to deliver the optimal fleet
to improve efficiency and minimise crop risk. Particular areas of
investment will be combine harvesters and self-propelled sprayers.
These are both areas where we believe we lost considerable
quantities of crop yield through an insufficient quantity of the
appropriate equipment.
Maintenance costs savings were among the greatest savings in
2010 falling by 70% on a per ha basis. This excellent result was in
part due to the Group’s maintenance being managed by an
appropriately incentivised Ukrainian workforce compared to the
expatriate team used in previous periods. Further savings were
also made through improved spare parts purchasing methods
along with internal procedures which assign responsibility for
individual pieces of machinery to specific operators who are
incentivised based on the condition of their equipment. This
scheme has caused the drop in the instances of breakdowns
and neglect of machinery. During the winter period of 2010/11
all machinery has been serviced, diagnosed and repaired to
ensure it is fully operational for the year ahead.
FARMING OPERATIONS
The Group’s farming operations remain focussed on efficiency
and margin. The Group’s immediate target is to raise the
proportion of land bank planted from an expected 65% this 
year to as close to 100% as is efficiently possible, without
sacrificing margin or farming quality.
HARVEST 2010
The Group harvested five main crops across its three regions
during 2010. The western operations produced all five crops
including rapeseed and wheat, the central operations focussed
on maize and the southern operations cultivated wheat, soya,
mustard and other minority crops.
During 2010, Landkom delivered its first profitable crops. Winter
crop losses in 2009/10 were minimal, against a backdrop of
widespread winter kill across Ukraine. However, heavy rains
throughout the spring and summer in the west hindered the
Group’s ability to apply some key inputs which unavoidably
reduced yields. The Group’s 2011 capital expenditure program has
been set to ensure that this risk will be minimised by providing the
farming team with the correct equipment to permit increased
farming days, even in periods of poor weather. 10 Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010
In 2010, for the first time, the Group planted and harvested its 
land in the central region with maize. At the same time, the 
crop rotation strategy was changed to incorporate a wider 
range of spring crops to decrease weather and commodity 
price risk. Spring crops in 2010 made up 46% of the total crop. The
Group intends to maintain this approximate level of spring crops in
the future.
The 2010 harvest demonstrates the operational progress that has
been achieved. Harvested land increased by 19% whilst costs per
ha on comparable crops were reduced on average by 45%.
These cost savings are likely to be maintained into the future,
assuming constant prices for the core inputs of fertilizer, chemicals
and seed.
Landkom’s tonnages relating to harvest are clean and dry 
ready for sale weights as certified by silos. Yields relate to 
certified tonnages collected off harvested ha (excluding lost, 
non-harvested ha). Yields across Ukraine fell in 2010 due to the 
wet weather in the west of Ukraine and the drought in the
remainder of the country. Landkom’s yield results are shown in 
the table opposite.
The western operations were most affected by the heavy rainfall
during spring and summer 2010. In aggregate 14% of crops were
lost and not harvested. Management regards the 2010 crop losses
as exceptional and does not expect such a scale of losses to be
replicated in future periods. Achieved yields are 11% – 48% higher
than average Ukrainian yields and we would hope and expect
2011 yields to be in excess of these levels.
We believe that the rapeseed harvest was impacted by the
limited owned combine resources. Unusual weather conditions in
the rest of the country meant that usual contract combine service
companies were unable to deliver on contract to harvest
Landkom fields causing in field losses. The Group intends to invest
further in combines to reduce this risk in future periods. Landkom
currently owns 21 combines.

WINTER PLANTING 2010
The autumn 2010 planting campaign was successfully completed
within the planting window. Winter crop planting was up 35% 
on 2009 to 28,856 ha. This crop was made up of 12,862 ha of
rapeseed, 13,149 ha of winter wheat, 292 ha of rye and 1,912 ha of
winter barley. The Group will report on how this crop has survived
the winter during April 2011. The winter crop has predominantly
been sown in the western and southern regions.
After the period end, a total of 18,800 ha were prepared for the
spring planting campaign. The Group expects final planting to
reach a total of approximately 48,000 ha which represents a rise 
of approximately 22% on 2009.
SPRING PLANTING 2011
Total spring planting is planned to reach approximately 19,000 ha.
This will be made up maize (43%), spring rapeseed (17%), spring
wheat (20%), soybean (5%) and sunflower (11%). As part of the
spring cropping, the Group plans to plant the entirety of its land
bank in the south which is among the Group’s most contiguous
and efficient farmland.
The 2011 spring crop planting covers a wide range of crops as an
intermediate step before the strategic four crop rotation system.
When added to the geographical diversification between the
three regions, the weather and disease risk to the Group is
markedly reduced. Further expansion of the cropped land area
is likely to be focused on the central region to further balance 
the Group’s geographical diversification.
LIVESTOCK
The Group’s livestock plans have been implemented during the
course of the year. Although currently not the focus of the Board,
livestock shows strong potential profitability when set up on a cost
efficient basis. With limited investment the Group’s livestock
operations have been restructured to improve efficiency and to at
least break even. The Group has two livestock operations in the
west and one in the south.
SALES
The selling process was completed efficiently with rapeseed
revenues required to finance the 2010 autumn planting season.
Other crops have been sold through the year, benefiting from
price rises over the past months. To date, all significant 2010
harvest inventory has now been sold.
Although cash flow requirements to cultivate efficiently the highest
possible proportion of existing land bank limited the Group’s ability
to retain crop in inventory for long periods, Landkom is seeking to
maximize sales proceeds within an approximate window of 6 - 8
months post-harvest.
IT
After the period end, the Group rolled out an online reporting
system developed to give senior management the highest level of
control across country-wide operations. Investment in this system is
expected to deliver further efficiency and assist and expedite
both operational and financial reporting in the future.
SECURITY
Given the widespread nature of operations and assets, strong
independent security is vital to the integrity of the business. In
addition to a small head office based security team, outsourced
contractors are used. Experience shows that outsourced security
alleviates the opportunity for employees to become too close to
security thereby reducing the risk of conflicts.
EMPLOYEES
At the period end, the Group had 717 employees. Of the 717
employees, 112 were employed in administration, 556 were
employed in arable operations and 49 were employed in
livestock. The Group’s employees are predominantly Ukrainian 
in its Ukrainian operations. Employees are incentivised and
responsible for their part of the business. Great care has been
taken to give budgetary responsibility to all areas of the business
and to ensure that all employees are incentivised to perform.
Equity ownership through the share option programme is likely 
to be expanded over the coming years.

2010 HARVEST RESULT 12 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
In 2009, the financial reporting date was brought forward to 
31 October from 31 December in order to better match the
cropping cycle with the financial reporting cycle. The financial
results for 2009 were therefore based on a 10 month period. The
income statement continues to be presented before and after 
the biological asset fair value adjustment, to show the impact of 
these adjustments separately from direct farming costs.
Revenues for the 12 month period to 31 October 2010 were 
$16.8 million (10 months to 31 October 2009: $14.6 million). The
revenues were limited by the decision to delay the sale of some
crops until after the financial year end, in order to take advantage
of an improved pricing environment. Direct costs were sharply
reduced to $16.1 million (2009: $30.3 million). On a like-for-like per
hectare basis operating costs fell 45 per cent which is in excess of
targets set out 12 months ago of 35 per cent.
In addition, at the period end, the Group had harvested crop 
held for sale worth approximately $5.6 million which is recognised
as inventory on the balance sheet. Most crops have now been
sold in excess of the carrying value. The revenues from these sales
will be recognised in the 2011 financial statements.
Due to market conditions and realised yields, the fair value of
biological assets at the point of harvest remained above the
production cost resulting in a positive fair value adjustment.
Biological assets, planted in the autumn 2010, in the ground at 
31 October 2010 have been recognised at cost on the balance
sheet with no fair value gain or loss recognised in the income
statement.
Depreciation and amortisation was $7.3 million (2009 10 months:
$6.4 million). EBITDA losses, before exceptional items, were
substantially reduced to $4.4 million from $21.1 million. The EBITDA
neutral target was missed due to the unexpected crop losses as a
result of adverse weather conditions.

STEPHEN PICKUP Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010 13
Administrative expenses, including share option plan charges,
were $4.9 million (2009: $4.4 million), which on a 10 month pro rata
basis reflects a reduction of 6%. Excluding share option charges,
administrative expenses were $4.3 million, a 9% reduction. These
reductions follow a reduction of 65% in the previous year and put
the Group at a competitive level for a listed entity.
The table below shows the costs for the 2009 and 2010 harvests
and exclude the Group’s southern operations which are currently
accounted for as an associate and are due to be fully
consolidated in 2011. Landkom expects to maintain comparable
input levels in the coming harvest which would mean the costs
savings will be maintained into the future in absence of significant
rises in input costs.
Cash control has remained extremely tight across the Group. The
highest levels of control remain in place to ensure cash is invested
in the areas which will deliver the highest return. Following the
placing in November 2009 which enabled the Group to increase
planting, Landkom has more flexibility to sell crops at optimal
times. Discretionary expenditure was limited to urgent farming
equipment and will increase over the coming years as the
Group’s planting expands and equipment becomes older.
At the period end, within the arable side of the business, following
the assumed spring planting, Landkom had 14.1 employees per
thousand hectares, down from 15.8 in 2009. Management intends
to further improve the ratio through planting additional land with
minimal additional staff.
The Group has now structured its domestic Ukrainian subsidiaries
to take advantage of the tax benefits which currently exist for
farming operations with regards to paying fixed agricultural tax.
This means that in future the Group’s tax burden relates to its land
bank rather than the profits delivered from operations. This is a
very favourable scheme. Ukrainian entities are also eligible for
Ukraine’s special agricultural VAT scheme which assists agricultural
producers by permitting them to retain the VAT on domestic sales
and reinvest the proceeds in agriculture related expenditure.
Before the exceptional items, pre-tax losses (excluding share
option charges) were $11.3 million (2009: loss $27.2 million).
In November 2009, the Group carried out a placing of new shares
for cash which raised gross proceeds $16.2 million for working
capital purposes.
Since the period end, the Group signed a credit agreement 
with Raifeissen Bank Aval for a $9 million facility. This facility will
ensure the Group has sufficient working capital through to the
2011 harvest. The business is highly dependent on cash generated 
from its annual harvest as well as trade and banking credit
facilities. Severe weather, credit restrictions or significant reductions
in agricultural commodity prices could present a material
uncertainty to the groups continued going concern status. Further
details of these uncertainties are outlined in note 2.1 of the
Financial Statements.
Biological assets are increased compared to 2009 due to the
increased planting. Inventories are increased to $9.9 million 
(2009: $5.2 million) mostly reflecting the additional harvested crop
held for sale.
At the period end, the Group had cash of $2.3 million. Due to
increasing commodity prices, the Group’s policy through the year
has been to maintain crop in inventory and to sell it for cash only
when funds are required for operations.
At the period end, the Group had no material finance lease
liabilities, although trade payables were temporarily high at 
$13.2 million. These payables were partially paid down by the sale
of crop inventories post period end and will be further paid down
with some of the proceeds of the Raifeissen facility.
As and when appropriate, the Board uses financial instruments
such as forward off-take contracts or financial derivatives to
hedge commodity prices. The purpose of the Group’s hedging
strategy is to hedge and reduce business risk rather than to
speculate. Due to local legislation, the Group continues to be
unable to hedge against the Ukrainian Hryvnya, although over the
period, stability returned to the US$ UAH exchange rate stabilising
at around 8 UAH to 1 US$.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 17
As the Company is admitted for trading on AIM it is not required 
to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council
(the Code). However the Directors aim to support the principles 
set out in the Code and comply in the areas that they consider
appropriate to do so given the Group’s size, resources and stage
of development. This statement describes how the best practice
principles of corporate governance are applied to the Group.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board, which is responsible for leading, developing and
protecting the interests of the Group, comprises three Non-
Executive Directors and two Executive Directors. The Non-
Executive Directors are of varied backgrounds and experience
and the Board considers them to exercise independent and
objective judgement.
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the
Group between the Board and the Executive Management.
Board meetings are held on a regular basis. The Board sets
strategy, reviews business plans, trading performance and costs,
approves major capital investments and disposals, considers 
all significant operational and financial issues and approves 
the Group’s financial statements, control procedures and risk
management policies. The Board delegates decisions on
contracts and transactions in the ordinary course of business 
to executive management but approves significant transactions
such as bank facilities, forward sales of crops and hedging
contracts.
The Board receives timely information on all material aspects
about the Group to enable it to discharge its duties.
All serving Directors submit themselves for re-election at the
Annual General Meeting.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee the
members and activities of which are detailed in the
Remuneration Report.
Details of the remuneration of each Director are set out in the
Remuneration Report.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
The Company has established an Audit Committee which
comprises the three Non-Executive Directors. The Audit Committee
is chaired by John Mapplebeck who as a former bank executive
possesses both recent and relevant financial experience.
The Audit Committee, which has Terms of Reference agreed 
by the Board, is responsible for reviewing the Group’s accounting
policies, monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial
statements and announcements and reviewing the internal
control and risk management systems and compliance
procedures. It is also responsible for reviewing the scope and
results of the audit, its cost-effectiveness and the independence
and objectivity of the Auditors. A formal Statement of
Independence is received from the external Auditor each year.

INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and
monitoring the Group’s systems of internal control. The process
and systems of internal control are designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
The key procedures that have been established and which are
designed to provide effective control are as follows:
n Management structure – The Board meets regularly to
discuss all issues affecting the Group
n Investment appraisal – The Group has a clearly defined
framework for investment appraisal and approval is
required by the Board, where appropriate
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the systems of
internal control and considers the major business, operational and
financial risks and the control environment and compliance
matters. No significant control deficiencies have come to light
during the year and no weaknesses in internal financial control
have resulted in any material losses, contingencies or uncertainties,
which would require disclosure as recommended by the guidance
for Directors on reporting on internal financial control.
The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that, taking
into account the scale of the Group’s operating interests and
activities and in light of the control environment described above,
there is no current requirement for a separate internal audit
function. On a regular basis the Audit Committee will continue to
review the need to put in place an internal audit function.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Chairman is the Company’s principal spokesperson with
investors, fund managers, the press and other interested parties. At
the Annual General Meeting, private investors are given the
opportunity to question the Board.
GOING CONCERN
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared on 
a going concern basis. Continued operations are reliant upon
material uncertainties including achieving a successful 2011
harvest, stable crop prices, continuing financial support from
Amaco Ukraine, Landkom’s major supplier through extended
credit terms, and the refinancing of US$9m loan in March 2012.
The Directors have concluded that this represents a material
uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. Nevertheless after making
enquiries and considering these uncertainties the Directors are
currently confident that the Group will continue to have adequate
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For
this reason, the financial statements of the Group have been
prepared on a going concern basis.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
CONTINUED Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 19

The Company’s Remuneration Committee is responsible for the administration of the Share Scheme (the Scheme). The rules of the Scheme
are the same for both Directors and employees. Unless otherwise approved by the remuneration committee, the Options granted vest in three
equal tranches on the anniversary of the grant for each of the three years after the date of the grant. The Committee may impose objective
conditions upon the granting of an Option as to the performance of the Group which must be satisfied before Options can be exercised.
Options granted to date have no such performance targets.
The total Options in issue of 23,991,127 represented 5.5% of the issued share capital of 435,008,935 shares at 31 October 2010. The Scheme
permits Options to be granted up to a total of 10% of the Ordinary Shares in issue.

CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
5 APRIL 2011 22 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
The directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements. The directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:
n select suitable accounting policies and then apply them on a consistent basis;
n make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
n state that the financial statements comply with IFRS; and
n prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping reliable accounting records which correctly explain the transactions of the company, and which
enable the financial position of the company to be determined with reasonable accuracy. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 23
We have audited the company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2010 which comprise the group statement of
comprehensive income, group statement of financial position, group statement of changes in equity, group statement of cash flows, and the
related notes 1 to 35. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body for
our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with applicable Isle of Man law and appropriate accounting standards.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view.
In addition we also report if, in our opinion, the group has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company
is not disclosed.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER – GOING CONCERN
In forming our opinion, which is not qualified we have also considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 2.1 to the financial
statements concerning the company's ability to continue as a going concern. The conditions described in note 2.1 indicate the existence of a
material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include the adjustments that would result if the company was unable to continue as a going concern.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, of the state
of affairs of the company and of the group as at 31 October 2010 and of the loss of the group for the year then ended.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2010 28 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
1.1 ORGANISATION AND OPERATIONS
Landkom International Plc (‘the Company’) is a public limited liability company and was incorporated in the Isle of Man on
10 April 2007. Its Registered Office is at 1 1 Hope Street, Douglas and its principal place of business is 2 Brovarska street, Prolisky village,
Kiev region, Ukraine. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) is the cultivation and distribution 
of arable crops for the biofuel and food markets.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated financial statements of Landkom International Plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments measured at fair value and biological assets measured at fair value less
point of sale costs.
The Group has prepared a cash flow forecast which takes into account reasonably possible cash inflows and outflows from its
operations and external funding. The forecast has been prepared through to August 2012 and supports the conclusion of the Directors
that the Group will be able to operate as a going concern with its current resources and those anticipated in the future.
The cash flow forecast is dependent on the following key assumptions:
n Achieving a successful 201 1 harvest with yields and prices in line with management forecasts. Yield forecasts for rapeseed and
wheat are based on levels historically achieved by the Group. Prices forecast for rapeseed, the Group’s principle export crop, are
based on prices achieved by the Group in March 201 1. Prices for the Group’s remaining crops, principally wheat and maize, are
based on current prices in Ukraine.
n The ability of Amaco Ukraine, or other major trade suppliers, to continue providing financial support through extended credit terms
until the 201 1 harvest.
n The refinancing in March 2012 of the current US$9m debt facility, which is due for repayment by the end of February 2012.
The Directors have concluded that these are material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. Nevertheless after making enquiries and considering the uncertainties, the Directors remain confident that the
Group will continue to have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the financial
statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Accordingly, these financial statementsdo not include any adjustments to the carrying amount or classification of assets and liabilities
that would result if the Group were unable to continue as a going concern.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
Management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher
degree of judgement of complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements
are disclosed in note 3.
The Group adopted the following new and amended standards as at 1 November 2009:
Standards affecting the reported results and financial positions
IFRS 3 Business combinations
The revised standard was issued in January 2008 and became effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Changes
affect the valuation of non-controlling interest, accounting for transaction costs, initial and subsequent measurement of a contingent
consideration and business combinations achieved in stages. Its adoption has affected the accounting for the business combination in
the current period and the acquisition costs incurred have been expensed and included in administrative expenses.
IAS 27 – Consolidated and separate financial statements
The revised standard was issued in January 2008 and became effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The
changes of the revised standard affect the Group’s accounting policies regarding changes in ownership interests in its subsidiaries that
do not result in a change in control. Under the revised standard, all such increases or decreases are dealt with in equity, with no impact
on goodwill or profit or loss.
Standards affecting presentation and disclosures
None of the new or revised standards to be adopted for the financial year 2010 affected the presentation and disclosures.
Standards and interpretations adopted with no effect on reported results, financial position and disclosure
IFRS 2 – Share-based payment – group cash-settled share-based payment transactions
The amendment to the standard was issued in June 2009 and became effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January
2010. The amendment clarifies the accounting for group cash-settled share-based payment transactions and supersedes IFRIC 8 and
IFRIC 1 1. The adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on the reported results, financial position and disclosures.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 29
IAS 28 – Investments in associates
The revised standard was issued in May 2008 and became effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The
principle adopted under IAS 27 – Consolidated and separate financial statements that a loss of control is recognised as a disposal
and reacquisition of any retained interest at fair value is extended by consequential amendment to IAS 28. Therefore, when
significant influence is lost, the investor measures any investment retained in the former associate at fair value, with any
consequential gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The adoption of the revised standard did not have any impact on the
reported results, financial position and disclosures.
The Group has elected not to early adopt the following revised and amended standards:
IAS 24 Related party disclosures
The amended standard was issued in November 2009 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 201 1.
The revised standard introduces a partial exemption of disclosure requirements for government-related parties and clarifies the
definition of a related party to simplify the identification of such relationships and to eliminate inconsistencies in the application. The
Group does not expect any impact on its financial position or performance and does not intend to take advantage of the possibility of
an early adoption.
IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation – classification of rights issues
The amendment to IAS 32 on the classification of rights issues has been issued in October 2009 and is effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 February 201 1. For rights issues offered for a fixed amount of foreign currency current practice appears to
require such issues to be accounted for as derivative liabilities. The amendment states that if such rights are issued pro rata to all of an
entity’s existing shareholders in the same class for a fixed amount of currency, they should be classified as equity regardless of the
currency in which the exercise price is denominated. This amendment will have no impact on the Group after initial application and
will be adopted by Group for the Group’s reporting financial statements for the period beginning 1 January 2012.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments: classification and measurement
The IASB has issued the first phase of IFRS 9 that will replace IAS 39. The new standard applies to classification and measurement of
financial assets as defined in IAS 39. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The adoption of
the first phase of IFRS 9 might have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets. The Group will
quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture. The IASB will address
classification and measurement of financial liabilities, hedge accounting and derecognition in separate phases and the completion of
the new standard is expected to be in early 201 1.
IFRIC 14 Prepayment of a minimum funding requirement
The amendment to IFRIC 14 is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 201 1 and will have to be retrospectively
applied. The amendment provides guidance on assessing the recoverable amount of net pension assets and permits an entity to treat
the prepayment of a minimum funding requirement as asset. The future application of this amendment is deemed to have no impact
on the financial statements of the Group.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments
IFRIC 19 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010. The new interpretation addresses the accounting by the entity
that issues equity instruments in order to settle, in full or in part, a financial liability. The adoption of this interpretation will have no effect
on the financial statements of the Group.
2.2 CONSOLIDATION
Basis of consolidation from 1 November 2009
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 October 2010.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses
resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. Change in the ownership
interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
n Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary
n Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest
n Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity
n Recognises the fair value of the consideration received
n Recognises the fair value of any investment retained
n Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
n Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained
earnings, as appropriate. 30 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
2.2 CONSOLIDATION CONTINUED
Basis of consolidation prior to 1 November 2009
Certain of the above-mentioned requirements were applied on a prospective basis. The following differences, however, are carried
forward in certain instances from the previous basis of consolidation:
n Acquisitions of non-controlling interests, prior to 1 January 2010, were accounted for using the parent entity extension method,
whereby, the difference between the consideration and the book value of the share of the net assets acquired were recognised in
goodwill.
n Losses incurred by the Group were attributed to the non-controlling interest until the balance was reduced to nil. Any further excess
losses were attributed to the parent, unless the non-controlling interest had a binding obligation to cover these. Losses prior to 1
January 2010 were not reallocated between NCI and the parent shareholders.
n Upon loss of control, the Group accounted for the investment retained at its proportionate share of net asset value at the date
control was lost. The carrying value of such investments at 1 January 2010 have not been restated.
2.3 SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group produces arable crops in Ukraine with all customers based in Ukraine. Financial information is reported to the board in IFRS
accounting format with profit, assets and liabilities as one agricultural operating segment.
2.4 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).The parent entity’s functional currency is Pounds Sterling. The
functional currency of the Group’s main operating subsidiary is US Dollars. The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
US Dollars.
The Group has determined that the main underlying currency of agricultural crop inputs and outputs is US Dollars. As such it has
selected US Dollars as its presentational currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the profit or loss, except
when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation
differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in
profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets such as equities classified as
available for sale are included in the fair value reserve in equity and are recognised in other comprehensive income.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group companies (none of which has a currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that
have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
n assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;
n income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income
and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions);
n all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to
shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are
recognised in the profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.
The principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
31 OCTOBER 2010 31 OCTOBER 2009
Exchange rate for statement of financial position translation:
Pounds sterling 0.62 to US$ 1 0.62 to US$ 1
Ukrainian Hryvnya 7.97 to US$1 8.13 to US$1
Average exchange rate for income statement translation:
Pounds sterling 0.64 to US$ 1 0.65 to US$ 1
Ukrainian Hryvnya 7.98 to US$ 1 8.16 to US$ 1
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 31
2.5 PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, except freehold land and is calculated using the straight-line method to
allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Buildings 3 – 50 years
Machinery 5 – 10 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 – 5 years
Vehicles 3 – 10 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying
amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable
amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
within administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Assets under construction are stated at cost less impairment losses. The cost of completed construction work is transferred to the
appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences when the relevant assets become operational.
2.6 LEASING
Leases of property, plant and equipment which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classified
as finance leases. Finance leases are classified as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost. Finance leases are capitalised
at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment and the present value of the
minimum lease payments and depreciated over the period of the lease. The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities. Lease
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability.
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Where property lease contracts
contain guaranteed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is amortised on a straight-line
basis over the life of the lease.
2.7 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are recognised when they are controlled through contractual or other legal rights, or are separable from the rest of
the business, and the fair value can be reliably measured.
Applications and IT software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific
software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to five years). Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to
the statement of comprehensive income under the heading of administrative expenses.
2.8 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Business combinations from 1 January 2010
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or 
at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in
administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the
acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance
with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it
should not be re-measured until it is finally settled within equity. 32 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
2.8 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONTINUED
Business combinations prior to 1 January 2010
In comparison to the above-mentioned requirements, the following differences applied:
Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed
part of the acquisition costs. The non-controlling interest (formerly known as minority interest) was measured at the proportionate share
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Business combinations achieved in stages were accounted for as separate steps. Any additional acquired share of interest did not
affect previously recognised goodwill. 
When the Group acquired a business, embedded derivatives separated from the host contract by the acquiree were not reassessed
on acquisition unless the business combination resulted in a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modified the cash
flows that otherwise would have been required under the contract.
Contingent consideration was recognised if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely
than not and a reliable estimate was determinable. Subsequent adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognised as part
of goodwill.
2.9 IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit
to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of
the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately,
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an
impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the
reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
2.10 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. The cost
of work in progress includes costs of preparing agricultural land, raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production
overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
2.11 BIOLOGICAL ASSETS
The Group classifies crops as biological assets. Biological assets are stated at their fair value, based on their current condition, less
estimated point-of-sale costs. The fair value of biological assets is based on market selling price and direct costs required to bring the
assets to saleable condition, discounted at an appropriate discount rate at the reporting date. Agricultural produce harvested from the
Group’s biological assets is recognised as inventory measured at the fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest. Biological assets
that are physically attached to land are recognised and measured at their fair value separately from the land.
The Group classifies livestock as biological assets. Livestock are accounted for at fair value less estimated point of sale costs. The fair
value of livestock is determined by the size of the herd and market prices at the reporting date.
Where there is no reliable measure of the fair value of biological assets at the point of initial recognition, they are measured at cost less
any impairment losses.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 33
2.12 TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables, defined as loans and receivables in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’,
are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is
established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the
receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the present value of future cash
flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The movement in the provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income. Any other trade receivables are recognised at their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful
amounts. An allowance is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
2.13 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
2.14 SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs.
2.15 TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables, defined as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. All of the trade payables are noninterest bearing.
2.16 BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period
of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are
expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the
borrowing of funds.
The Group capitalises borrowing costs for all eligible assets where construction was commenced on or after 1 January 2009.
2.17 TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit or loss,
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can
be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit or loss, except when it relates to items credited or charged in other comprehensive
income directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
2.18 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
(a) Pension obligations
Group companies do not operate private pension schemes. The Group makes contributions for the benefit of employees to Ukraine’s
state pension fund, social security fund, security against injury fund and unemployment fund. These amounts are expensed as incurred.
(b) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is
demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without
possibility of withdrawal; or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. 34 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
2.19 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services
as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other capital reserves in equity, over the
period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s
best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement expense or credit for a period
represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in
employee benefits expense.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon
a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is
satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms
had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that
increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the
date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised
for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or
the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award
on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as
described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share unless
a loss for the period has been recognised in which case the loss is not further diluted.
2.20 PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. If the effect is
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
2.21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative financial instruments
The Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and
borrowings and trade and other payables. Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value (being the fair value of the
consideration given or received) plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date (i.e. the date that the Group commits to
purchase or sell the asset). Regular way purchases or sales are those that require delivery of assets within the period generally
established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The Group has not designated any financial assets as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the
loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired along with the amortisation process.
Other
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised and initially measured at cost. Subsequently, instruments with a fixed maturity are 
re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any
transaction costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Financial liabilities which do not have a fixed maturity are subsequently
carried at fair value.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 35
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction
costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the
amortisation process.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the
amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest
rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either directly or
through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. The Group first assesses
whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or
collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists
for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar
credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually
assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective
assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is
reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value
of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
2.22 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services in the ordinary course
of the Group’s activity. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within
the Group. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of the revenue can be readily measured, it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for the Group’s activity as described below. The
amount of revenue is not considered to be reliably measurable until all contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved. The
Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the
specifics of each arrangement.
(a) Sales of goods
The Group produces and sells a range of arable crops. Sales of goods are recognised when a Group entity has delivered products to
the purchaser, the purchaser has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations
that could affect the purchaser’s acceptance of the products. Delivery does not occur until the produce has been delivered to the
specified location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the purchaser, and either the purchaser has accepted
the produce in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that
all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.
(b) Sales of services
Revenue from time and materials contracts is recognised at the contractual rates as labour hours are delivered and direct expenses
incurred. Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognised under the percentage of completion method and is based on the services
performed to date as a percentage of the total services to be performed.
If circumstances arise that may change the original estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion, estimates are
revised. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs and are reflected in income in the period in
which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known to management.
(c) Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net
carrying amount.
2.23 COMPARATIVES
The comparative period represents the 10 month period from 1 January 2009 to 31 October 2009 and is therefore not directly
comparable to the year to 31 October 2010 which is being reported on in these financial statements. 36 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
3.1 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
In preparing the financial statements the Group must select and apply various accounting policies which are described in Note 2. In
order to apply our accounting policies the Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Biological assets
Biological assets (living crops) are measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of biological assets is determined
based among other estimates on weather conditions, growth potential, harvesting, price development and discount rate. Changes in
any estimates could lead to recognition of significant fair value changes in the statement of comprehensive income. Where little
biological transformation has taken place the Group uses cost as an approximation for fair value.
(b) Deferred income tax assets
Management regularly assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. No deferred tax
asset is recognised when Management believe that it is more likely than not that a deferred asset will not be realised.
(c) Provision for impairment of trade receivables
An allowance is made for doubtful trade receivables. This allowance represents Management’s estimate of accounts receivable that,
subsequent to the time of sale, may be of doubtful collectability because customers may not be able to pay.
(d) Share based payments
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the
date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value requires determining the most appropriate valuation model for a grant of equity
instruments, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to
the valuation model including the expected life of the option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The
assumptions and model used are disclosed in note 22.
(e) Going concern
The Group is required to assess whether it has sufficient resources to continue its operations and to meet its commitments for the
foreseeable future. Going concern is assessed applying cash flow forecasting and estimate based on management’s expectations
and knowledge of the company and its operating environment. Should the going concern assumption no longer remain valid the
carrying value of the Group’s assets will need to be assessed for impairment and the balance sheet will need to be prepared on a
break-up basis. In carrying out the Group’s assessment of going concern key estimates are made on forecast harvest yields and crop
sales prices.
4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
4.1 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk),
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and
seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the key management personnel under policies approved by the Board. Group treasury identifies,
evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with operational management. The Board provides written principles for
overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair value
interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and cash deposits that are denominated in a currency other than the
respective functional currencies of the Group. Operating currencies for the Group are primarily the Ukrainian Hryvnya, pounds sterling
and US dollars.
The Group’s local Ukrainian production costs such as salaries are denominated in Hryvnya. Input costs such as seed, fertiliser and
chemicals along with sales proceeds are denominated in Hryvnya but a majority have an underlying link to international commodity
prices which are denominated in US dollars. The majority of the Group’s trade receivables and payables are denominated in Hryvnya
with a link to US dollars. Due to this link the Group has selected US dollars as the functional currency of its main operating subsidiary in
Ukraine. Strengthening or weakening of the Ukrainian Hryvnya would respectively increase or decrease the local production costs in US
dollar terms. Foreign exchange gains and losses would also be recognised on certain payables and receivables.
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) manages and determines the official exchange rates. An inter-bank market for exchange of
currencies exists in Ukraine and is monitored by the NBU. The Group, through its financial institutions, exchanges currencies at bank
offered market rates.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Landkom International Plc  Annual Report 2010 37
During the year to 31 October 2010, the Ukrainian Hryvnya/US Dollar exchange rate fluctuated between a maximum and minimum of
8.25 and 7.88 Hryvnya to US$1 (10 months to 31 October 2009: 9.38 to 7.56).
The Group’s holding company incurs costs and has raised equity funds in pounds sterling which is its functional currency. The holding
company also maintains the Group treasury funds. As the majority of the Group’s operational costs are US dollars, treasury funds are
also held in US dollars. This creates a non-operational foreign exchange risk.
During the year to 31 October 2010 the Pound Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate has fluctuated between a maximum and minimum of
0.70 and 0.59 Pounds Sterling to US$1 (10 months to 31 October 2009: 0.73 to 0.59).
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:

(b) Price risk
The majority of the Group’s revenues and finished goods inventories are exposed to commodity price risk of the arable crops that it
produces. The Group’s production costs are exposed to oil and gas commodity prices. To manage its price risk arising from fluctuations
in crop prices, the Group may enter into forward off-take contracts or commodity options.

4.1 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED
(c) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
At certain points in time the Group has significant interest-bearing assets and the Group’s income and operating cash flows are
partially dependent on changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from short-term deposits, the maximum balance of such deposits during the year amounted to $15.5 million.
The Group’s trade receivable and payable balances are noninterest-bearing and are not guaranteed or underwritten. These amounts
are presented in notes 18 and 26 respectively.
The Group has finance lease agreements which bear interest as detailed in note 24.
(d) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks, as well as credit
exposures to customers including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk, after taking into account allowances for un-recoverability, is the fair value of the relevant
assets as follows:
2010 2009
$000 $000
Trade receivables 377 401
Receivables due from related parties 1,920 –
Cash and cash equivalents 2,341 222
4,638 623
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair values.
The following table shows the Group’s receivables at the reporting date that are subject to credit risk and the ageing and impairment
profile thereon:
RECEIVABLES RECEIVABLES

For customers, an assessment of the credit quality of the customer is made, taking into account its financial position, past experience
and other factors.
Trade receivables classed as neither past due nor impaired are from customers the Group has significant trading history with, and are
classed by management as credit worthy.
In assessing the recoverability of receivables the Group takes into account factors such as credit ageing, the financial position of the
counterparty and past experience.

Sufficient cash is expected to be generated through the Group’s operating cycle, bank working capital finance, and effective cash
management to meet the contractual cash flows disclosed above. Risks in relation to cash management and financing are discussed
in note 2.1.
(f) Agricultural risk
The Group’s operations are in western, central and southern regions of Ukraine. This geographical spread of operations lowers the
Group’s weather risk. Crop management and machinery investment strategies further mitigate the remaining risk.
The primary risk in the western region is wet weather during harvest and growing season. In order to mitigate this risk the Group is
progressively investing in grain drying facilities, crop protection machinery and in its own, as opposed to contracted, harvesting
machinery.
The primary risk in the central region is drought. The Group manages this risk by planting crops which have greater resistance to lower
levels of rainfall.
The primary risk in the southern region is drought. The Group inherited irrigation infrastructure when it acquired its land in the southern
region. Much of this equipment requires refurbishment which the Group intends to carry out in order to minimize the risk of drought.
Winter temperatures in Ukraine are often significantly below zero. In order to manage the winter kill risk, the Group times its autumn
planting and uses appropriate crop protection chemicals to achieve the desired amount of pre winter crop development.
The Group has developed a crop rotation plan to ensure that its cultivations are sustainable, crop diseases and pests are managed,
and chemical and fertilizer applications can be minimized.
Agricultural risk can impact the quantity and quality of goods harvested from the Group’s land. This will have a direct and equal
impact on the Group’s revenue. A 10% reduction or increase in yield will have 10% impact on overall revenue from harvested goods. 40 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010

13. EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
Basic and fully diluted loss per share have been calculated on the loss after taxation for the year/period and the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year/period.
Adjusted loss per share before amortisation of software intangible assets and share based payments charge has been presented in
addition to the basic earnings per share since, in the opinion of the Directors, this provides shareholders with a more appropriate
representation of the underlying earnings derived from the Group’s businesses.

During 2009 management identified a group of farming equipment assets which it intended to sell in future periods. The carrying value
of these assets was assessed as significantly above the fair value less cost to sell. These assets were therefore written down to fair value
less cost to sell resulting in an impairment charge of $1,919,000 which was included with exceptional items in the 10 months ended
31 October 2009.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of $22,000 which have been pledged as security
against bank loans (see note 25).
Several items of farming equipment could not be located when an asset count was carried out after the 2009 harvest. These assets
were therefore written down to nil value in use resulting in an impairment charge of $198,000 which was included within exceptional
items in the 10 months to 31 October 2009.
Assets under construction are comprised of the materials required for the construction of a silo complex, a flat storage site and farm
bases. Assets under construction will be completed when the group has sufficient financial resources.

16. BIOLOGICAL ASSETS
The Group’s interests in biological assets are held in its Ukraine subsidiaries.
The Group’s biological assets are made up of three distinct groups:
n Winter crops planted during the autumn of 2010 and due to be harvested in the summer of 201 1. Due to the insignificant amount of
biological transformation these crops are valued at cost.
n Spring crops planted in 2010 and due to be harvested within 1 month of the reporting date. These crops are accounted for at fair
value less estimated point of sale costs.
n Livestock biological assets which is made up mainly of beef and dairy cattle at a variety of ages. These animals are valued at fair
value less estimated point of sale costs.
The fair value of crop biological assets at each reporting date is determined based on the area planted and market prices at the
reporting date, and based on the crops’ location and condition, which includes estimates of biological transformation and yield
potential. Where little biological transformation has taken place the Group uses cost as an approximation for fair value.
The fair value of livestock biological assets at each reporting date is determined based on the lower of reporting date market value,
and discounted cash flow valuation.
Fair value is estimated on the basis of the present value of expected net cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted pre-tax
discount rate. Changes in any estimates could lead to recognition of significant fair value changes in the profit or loss. 46 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010

22. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
UNAPPROVED COMPANY SHARE OPTION PLAN (THE PLAN)
The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the period was the Unapproved Share Option Plan established on
22 November 2007. Options granted under the Plan become exercisable following the first, second or third anniversary of the date of
the grant, and once vested may be exercised up to the fifth anniversary of the date of vesting. There are no performance conditions
attaching to the awards. Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options under the
Plan during the period.

No options were exercised during the year to 31 October 2010 (2009: Nil).
Options outstanding at 31 October 2010 had exercise prices of 6.75p to 78p (2009: 17p to 86p) and average contractual life of 5.72
years (2009: 5.44 years).
Options were valued using the binomial option pricing model, but adjusted to model the particular features of the options. The
principal inputs to the valuation model for the awards were:
AWARD DURING AWARDS DURING
YEAR ENDED 10 MONTHS ENDED
31 OCTOBER 2010 31 OCTOBER 2009
Risk free interest rate 1.3% – 2.2% pa 2.1 – 3.4% pa
Expected volatility 70% pa 70% pa
Dividend yield 0% pa 0% pa
Employee turnover 0% pa 0% pa
The fair value incorporates a number of factors, including the expected effects of early exercise due to employees leaving service after
the awards have vested or simply wishing to cash in their options upon exercise.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of share prices for a group of comparable companies over a
period commensurate with the expected lifetime of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of the options awarded in 2010 valued in accordance with IFRS 2 was 3.8p and the weighted average
expected life from grant date was 7.0 years.The Group recognised a total expense of $580,000 (2009: $394,000) in respect of the Plan. 50 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same tax levied by the same fiscal authority.
As at 31 October 2010 the Group had a potential unrecognised deferred tax asset of $1,673,000 (2009: $3,681,000) relating to trading
losses available to carry forward. Due to uncertainty of future recoverability of tax losses, the Directors’ view is that this asset will not be
realised and is therefore not recognised in these financial statements.
As at 31 October 2010 and 31 October 2009 the Group had no deferred tax liabilities. 52 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010

Tax and other regulatory compliance
Ukrainian legislation and regulations regarding direct and indirect taxation continue to evolve. The legislation and regulations in force
are new and untested. The interpretation of the legislation tend to be subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent enforcement by
local, regional and national authorities, and other Government bodies.
The uncertainty of application and the evolution of Ukrainian tax laws, including those affecting cross border transactions, create a risk
of additional tax payments having to be made by the Group, which could have a material effect on the Group’s financial position and
results of operations. The Group does not believe that these risks are any more significant than those of similar enterprises in the Ukraine.

Acquired during the year:
Morion Agro PP Ukraine Farm operations 100.0%
Gostcha AI PP Ukraine Land lease holding 100.0%
The acquisition of Morion Agro PP was classified as a business combination and is described in note 32. In the view of the Directors the
acquisition of Gostcha AI PP does not satisfy the definition of a business combination as defined by IFRS 3 and consequently this
acquisition has been treated as an asset purchase and included in property, plant and equipment at the cost to the Group.
32. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On 2 September 2010 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Morion Agro PP, a Ukrainian farming entity for cash
consideration of $197,000. The acquisition was made in order to expand the Group’s land bank and take control of assets.

Negative goodwill arising on acquisition 103 54 Landkom International Plc Annual Report 2010
32. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONTINUED
A gain arose on the acquisition because the acquiree vendors did not recognise the fair value of the identifiable assets which was
judged by independent valuers to be significantly above book value. The gain recognised on acquisition is not expected to be
taxable. The Directors are satisfied that the fair value of the assets acquired appear fairly stated resulting in the gain on acquisition.
The following net cash outflow occurred on acquisition of subsidiaries:
$000
Consideration paid in cash 197
Less: cash and cash equivalent balance acquired (4)

Included within the loss for the year is a loss of $13,720 attributable to Morion Agro PP. Revenue for the period includes $1,787 of income
attributable to Morion Agro PP.

Consort Medical plc  
Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
This year Consort Medical 
has successfully built 
on the achievements of 
2012, with significant 
developments across  
the business. 
Our financial performance has fulfilled the 
Board’s expectations, ending the year in a 
strong position. After accounting for the sale of 
King in mid-February, like for like total revenues 
from products and services
1
 increased by 1.3% 
to £129.5m (FY2012: £127.8m), and like for 
like total operating profit before special items
1
 
increased by 2.9% to £21.5m (FY2012: £20.9m). 
Adjusted total EPS increased by 5.2% to 54.9p 
per share (FY2012: 52.2p).
Like for like Cash Flow from Operating Activities
1
 
increased to £20.0m (FY2012: £17.6m). 
Following the King Systems disposal, our balance 
sheet has strengthened, with year-end net cash 
at £37.0m (FY2012: Net Debt (£37.7m)).
We have made solid progress in translating 
our development pipeline into firm revenue 
generating growth. The Chiesi NEXThaler 
has launched, and our other programmes 
have progressed through several important 
milestones. A year ago I reported that we had 
secured the development contract for Kind 
Consumer’s Oxette nicotine delivery device. 
This has been successful, and in December 
we secured an exclusive commercial supply 
contract from Nicoventures, who have licensed 
the product from Kind. 
Our Innovations team, which has now been in 
operation for two years, has been expanded 
further, and is generating a significant pipeline 
of innovations which we are confident will lead 
to new commercial opportunities and operating 
leverage.
In December we agreed the sale of the King 
Systems business to Ambu A/S for a cash 
consideration of £79.6m ($123.3m) plus an earn-
out of up to a further £32.3m ($50m) over three 
years. The King business had received significant 
investment and management time, the benefits of 
which were beginning to emerge in the reduction 
of the cost base and the organic growth from 
the King Vision video laryngoscope. The value 
received from the sale fully reflects the returns 
which we expect the business to generate over 
the coming three years. 
Following the sale of King Systems, our Group 
strategy remains largely unchanged, though with 
a stronger focus on the Life Sciences sector. 
We have significant development opportunities 
in front of us which will provide diversified 
growth and operating leverage, both in products 
and in services. In addition to these organic 
opportunities, we will review appropriate and 
complementary inorganic opportunities which 
would provide further execution on our strategy. 
Following the disposal of King Systems, our 
balance sheet strength enables us to consider a 
range of opportunities.
Board Change
Nick Higgins, Corporate Development Director, 
left Consort Medical earlier this year. The Board 
would like to thank Nick for his significant 
contribution to the growth and development of 
the Company over the past three years, and 
wishes him every success in the future. 
People
I wish to thank our employees for their excellent 
contributions over the past year, which have 
been crucial in strengthening the Company’s 
position. In particular I would like to thank the 
King Systems’ employees, and to wish them 
every success in the future.
I also thank our shareholders for their continued 
support for the Company.
Dividend
The Board has reviewed the final dividend, and  
I am pleased to recommend that it will be 
increased 5% to 12.71p per share. The dividend 
will be paid on 25 October 2013 to shareholders 
on the register at 20 September 2013, following 
our Annual General Meeting on 2 September 
2013.

Consort Medical plc  consortmedical.com  
Stock Code: CSRT
Its core business Bespak 
is a global market leader in 
the manufacture of inhaled 
drug delivery devices for 
pharma partners. 
Below are some of the key motivations for 
investment in Consort Medical plc.
1
 Long Term Contracts
Bespak serves Life Science customers with 
drug delivery devices for drug therapies which 
have a long life cycle. The device is defined 
and licensed as part of the drug master file, 
and hence the sourcing is protected. The Life 
Sciences customers invest significant resources 
in launching, marketing and building the 
treatment franchises which often have high rates 
of repeat prescription. The core of the Bespak 
business is in respiratory therapies, with drugs 
that alleviate symptoms, and patients adopt 
preferred drugs on an ongoing basis. 
Accordingly demand is stable and predictable, 
hence there is relatively high visibility of future 
revenues.
2 Premium Quality and  
Regulatory Expertise
Over 500 million devices are produced annually 
by Bespak, in a highly regulated environment. The 
quality standards required are world class, and 
Bespak is one of only a handful of players globally 
who have the process know-how and expertise 
to consistently deliver 6-sigma quality on such a 
high volume of components and devices. 
As well as significant process and production 
know-how, Bespak operates a dual strategy 
of highly regulated contract manufacturing of 
customer products, and the supply of its own 
proprietary products which are protected by 
extensive Intellectual Property (IP).
This value delivery to the customer enables 
Bespak to command attractive margins.
3
 Product Development Portfolio
In 2008 Consort Medical developed a new 
strategy, a key part of which was diversification 
of the device type offerings — from respiratory 
into injectables, nasal, ocular and point-of-
care (POC) diagnostics (horizontal) — and of 
the extent of the service offering — into drug 
handling and packaging (vertical).
Since then Bespak has assembled an 
impressive development portfolio of new 
opportunities, both contract manufacture and 
own IP based; both organically and via the 
acquisition of the Medical House. This includes 
the Nicoventures nicotine inhaler for which 
the multi-year exclusive supply contract was 
awarded to Bespak in December 2012.
Of these, the proprietary Integrated Dose 
Counter (IDC) for Teva’s Qnasl, and contract 
manufactured Chiesi NEXThaler have already 
been launched. 
Significant further growth potential exists from 
Injectables, Nasal, Nicotine Inhalation, and POC 
diagnostic cartridges, as well as further core 
respiratory metered dose inhaler (MDI) and 
dry powder inhaler (DPI) opportunities. Above 
and beyond these specific opportunities, the 
Innovations team in Cambridge are developing 
a range of novel product offerings, which are 
expected to evolve into specific commercial 
opportunities.
4
 Inorganic Development
Following completion of the sale of the King 
Systems business in February 2013, the Group 
is a more focused Life Sciences provider with 
a clear strategy for growth. Whilst this will be 
mostly organic in focus, the Group can also 
develop in its chosen strategy through selective, 
relevant and value enhancing acquisitions.
With the proceeds of the King Systems disposal 
and retention of its banking facilities, it has 
significant financial resources to do so.
5
 Management Team
Consort Medical has a management team which 
has executed successfully the chosen strategy 
of sustained/diversified organic growth, selective 
investments/acquisitions, and cost efficiency. 
Both Bespak and King Systems have been 
transformed under this strategy.
The current Consort Medical management has 
significant M&A experience and competence 
realising 17.3 x EBITDA for the King Systems 
disposal, identifying and making key equity 
investments into Atlas Genetics, and in acquiring 
injectables technology through the acquisition 
of the Medical House, from which the first 
commercial revenues are expected in FY2014.
Following the disposal of King Systems in 
February 2013, the main business of Consort 
Medical is Bespak. Bespak has a capable 
management team across all functions, which 
is both sustaining its core competencies, and 
leveraging them in strategic growth initiatives.
Why Invest?
Demand is stable 
and predictable, 
hence there is 
relatively high visibility 
of future revenues.

Consort Medical plc  
Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
Bespak’s business model is built to support two 
principal goals: helping our customers succeed 
in commercialising their own designs of drug 
delivery devices; developing proprietary designs 
of drug delivery devices, for sale to blue chip 
customers in Life Sciences. To this aim, Bespak 
has and will continue its diversification of the 
drug delivery segments in which it operates as 
well as increasing its share of the value added 
content in the supply chain. 
To date Bespak has evolved the range of drug 
delivery opportunities from its origins in the 
respiratory segment to that of injectables, nasal, 
ocular, and point-of-care diagnostics. Bespak 
has also further enhanced its share of the 
value added in the supply chain beyond that of 
product design, development, industrialisation 
and commercial manufacturing operations, 
and into the handling drugs for the purposes of 
clinical trials and final market release on behalf of 
our customers.
Bespak has developed significant core 
capabilities, competencies and processes 
developed through strategic investments in skills, 
technologies and infrastructure that provide 
for the best long-term growth and profitability 
prospects based on the value they deliver to our 
customers, whether based on either customer or 
Bespak owned intellectual property.

New Product Introduction Process 
A stage gated process honed over many years 
and major programmes involving concept 
creation through to second sourcing. 
Programme Management 
Bespak operates a formal programme 
management process with dedicated 
programme managers leading customer-centric 
teams to ensure programmes are delivered to 
agreed goals, objectives and milestones.
Prototype, Pilot, and Volume 
Manufacture
Ability to manufacture products in singles, tens, 
hundreds, thousands and millions through a 
wide range of capabilities fulfilling needs at the 
development, clinical and product launch and 
commercialisation stages. 
High Precision Injection Moulding
Repeatable and reproducible component 
manufacturing processes, whereby very 
tight tolerances are achieved through closely 
controlled processes and equipment. Bespak 
manufactures over 2.5 billion components  
per annum.
High Speed Automated Assembly 
Bespak has in-depth knowledge and capability 
in design of fully automated assembly machines 
and has long established relationships with a 
number of suppliers. Bespak operates 27 state-
of-the-art fully automated assembly machines 
manufacturing over 500 million devices per 
annum. 
Industrialisation and Scale-up
This is critical to the conversion of development 
opportunities into marketed realities in a regulated 
environment. Bespak has industrialised more dry 
powder inhalers than any other company and 
we continue to improve our processes to better 
serve our customers.
Regulatory and Quality Compliance 
In licensing a drug, there are two ‘files’: the drug 
file and the device file which fit together jointly for 
the approval license. Bespak, its postal address, 
the materials and the equipment used are all 
defined in the device master file, which ensures 
long term visibility of supply, and a high barrier  
to entry. 
This is supported by quality management 
processes and systems which ensure 6-sigma 
quality performance of manufactured parts, 
supported by lab release testing and analysis. 
Bespak operates to ISO 13485, and has a 
clinical trials license. This regulatory and quality 
compliance is validated externally by over 30 
audits per annum.
Continuous Improvement
Bespak has a dedicated continuous improvement 
team focused internally and externally on the 
supply chain with the goal of improving processes 
and operations and eliminating non-value added 
activities. The team targets over £1 million of cost 
savings per annum.
Our business model is flexible, adapting to the 
continuously changing market and economic 
environment. The Company has strengthened 
its position through strategic investments and 
acquisitions in higher value areas such as 
injectables and drug handling capabilities. In 
addition, the Company has improved overall 
productivity and is investing significantly in
opportunities to participate in some of the 
world’s most critical markets. As a result, the 
Company continues to enhance its operating 
performance. 
This, supported by the Company’s long-term 
financial model, has enabled the Company to 
deliver consistently strong earnings, cash flows 
and returns on invested capital in changing 
economic environments.

Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
Key Products and 
Intellectual Property
Bespak manufactures 
a wide range of 
specialty medical 
drug delivery devices. 
Although Bespak has historically focused on 
drug delivery devices for use in the treatment of 
asthma and COPD with the provision of metered 
dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powder inhalers 
(DPI), it is extending its reach to include nasal 
drug delivery devices, auto-injectors, nicotine 
delivery devices, and point-of-care diagnostic 
devices.
Bespak’s range of currently marketed products 
includes the following key products: 
1
 Metered Dose Inhaler
Bespak is a global leader in supply of MDI 
Valves serving major branded Life Sciences and 
generics companies. Bespak uniquely offers its 
own proprietary clean rubber technology and 
rubbers for use in its valves. Bespak has to date 
manufactured over one billion Hydro Flouro Alkane 
(HFA) valves which is a significant achievement 
given the fact that the CFC (Chlorofluorocarbon) 
to HFA (hydroflouroalkane) propulsion transition 
only occurred in early/mid 2000s.
2
 Integrated Dose Counter
Bespak operates in highly regulated markets with 
increasing regulatory requirements and hurdles. 
One such is the FDA requirement for low dose 
indication of MDIs and DPIs. Bespak offers 
a proprietary fully integrated (numeric) dose 
counter which has already been launched with 
Teva Pharmaceuticals. Moreover, Bespak has 
further programmes in development with major 
regional and global Life Sciences companies.
3 GSK’s Diskus Device
Since its launch, Bespak has been and remains 
a major manufacturer of GSK’s Diskus DPI. 
The device forms part of the world’s largest 
respiratory franchise for the treatment of 
asthma and COPD. Bespak has partnered with 
GSK since early 1990s. Bespak has to date 
manufactured over 550 million Diskus devices.
4
 Chiesi’s Foster NEXThaler
This device has been previously referred 
to as DEV750 in Bespak’s pipeline of new 
products. The product has regulatory approval 
in 14 European markets and was launched 
in Germany in March 2013. The device, in 
development at Bespak since 2005, is a unique 
breath actuated DPI. Bespak is currently scaling 
up manufacture to support the upcoming 
planned launches in further European territories.
5
 Products in Development
Bespak is currently working with a number of 
European and global Life Sciences companies 
to develop respiratory, injectible, nasal, nicotine 
inhalation, and point-of-care diagnostics 
devices. Information on these programmes is 
summarised in the Bespak product development 
pipeline chart (see page 9).

novel drug delivery devices.

Development Portfolio. 
During the previous financial year, we added 
three new programmes to the Development 
Portfolio. During FY2013 there has been 
significant activity on the portfolio, and 
substantial resources are being added to 
manage these opportunities. 
During the year the Chiesi NEXThaler was 
launched, in Germany initially with regulatory 
approval already secure for another 13 European 
countries.
Another significant development in the year 
was the award of a multi-year exclusive 
supply contract for Nicoventures. Previously a 
development programme with Kind Consumer, 
Nicoventures has licensed the product IP from 
Kind, and awarded the supply contract to 
Bespak. The product has been filed with the 
MHRA for approval.
All programmes have made further progress 
towards launch, except NAS010 which is under 
review by the customer — as indicated at the 
time of the Interim results. The Group followed 
its first two tranches of equity investment in Atlas 
Genetics with a third in April 2013. Significant 
progress has been made on the point-of-care 
(“POC”) Test Cartridge, POC010, though launch 
is now expected about six months later in H2 
2014.
In addition to the above, there are discussions 
on a number of programme opportunities in 
process currently, in established IP , contract 
manufacturing, and new IP (in particular from 
the Innovations team in Cambridge), and we 
expect to be able to unveil a new development 
programme on at least one of these within the 
next six months.

Bespak operates across a 
number of complementary 
market sectors: Respiratory, 
Auto-Injection, Nasal, 
Nicotine delivery and Point-
of-care (POC) diagnostics. 
All these sectors share key characteristics: large 
multinational customers serving global markets; 
high levels of regulatory control, high barriers to 
entry, and the ability to deliver substantial growth 
in the near term.
Respiratory
The respiratory sector is large, estimated at 
US$24bn drug sales and £272m of device sales 
in 2013 with the device revenues predicted to 
deliver a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 3% to 2016. Bespak estimate current share 
of 22% of this market. The respiratory sector 
is one of the most highly regulated resulting in 
high barriers to entry. A number of key drugs are 
coming off patent resulting in a number of new 
generic entrants and associated opportunities 
for Bespak to supply both metered dose inhaler 
(MDI) and dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices. 
Although sales remain relatively flat in the 
traditional western economies, significant volume 
growth is being seen in emerging markets with 
the Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese (BRIC) 
markets becoming more important in terms of 
their domestic consumption.
Auto-Injectors
The auto-injector sector is a relatively high 
growth market, the end drug market of which is 
estimated at US$175bn in 2013 with a CAGR 
of 5% to 2016. Growth is being driven by a 
large number of new drugs that require delivery 
by injection. Whilst Bespak currently have a 
negligible share of this market, it is estimated 
that circa 60% of all new drugs in development 
will be delivered parenterally and may therefore 
require some form of auto-injector. Many of 
these new “large molecule” biologic drugs are 
highly viscous and require specialist devices 
to enable them to be effectively administered, 
often by the patient themselves in a non-
clinical environment. The continued drive to 
greater self-administration with the associated 
improvements to patient compliance, patient 
outcomes and healthcare economics will create 
significant opportunities for Bespak to develop 
and manufacture auto-injectors to meet  
these needs.
Nasal
The nasal drug market is estimated to be worth 
circa £8.9bn in 2013 with the associated device 
sales being £310m. CAGR is estimated at 2.4% 
through to 2016 with growth being delivered 
from two main areas. Firstly a number of existing 
branded drugs are coming off patent leading to 
generic entrants all requiring their own delivery 
system as the original device associated with the 
branded drug is normally unavailable to them. 
Secondly, the nasal route is extremely effective 
and a number of existing and new drugs are 
being reformulated to enable delivery via the 
nose, again all requiring delivery devices. Bespak 
currently has a negligible share of this market, yet 
has two firm development pipeline opportunities.
Nicotine Delivery
Although the non-tobacco nicotine substitution 
delivery market is in its infancy, with 2012 UK, 
France and Germany revenues estimated at 
£310m, it is forecast to deliver significant growth 
over the short term, estimated CAGR of 116% to 
2016. The key drivers for this growth centre on 
both the consumer and regulatory appetite for 
safer alternatives to tobacco smoking coupled 
with the associated public health and healthcare 
economic benefits. Bespak will participate in 
this market through the Nicoventures contract 
awarded in December 2012.
POC Diagnostics
The POC diagnostic sector is a relatively high 
growth market with an estimated CAGR of 
6.6% to 2016. This diagnostic model enables 
the patient to be tested, diagnosed and treated 
in one appointment, whereas the traditional 
model requires samples to be sent away to 
a laboratory for testing, with patient recall 
required for treatment. Market growth is being 
driven by the combined benefits of: increased 
patient compliance, improved patient outcomes 
and lower cost of provision. Pharmaceutical 
companies are looking to exploit POC systems 
as part of a companion diagnostics strategy 
where drugs and tests are sold as combined 
“test and treat” strategy. Bespak has an equity 
investment in the Atlas Genetics, as well as a 
manufacturing contract to produce disposable 
test cartridges for Atlas.
In conclusion, Bespak operates across a 
number of diversified but complementary 
market sectors, each offering significant growth 
opportunities based on existing and emerging 
core competencies, with high barriers to entry 
and opportunity to protect value through the 
generation of IP .

Group Strategy
In 2008, the Group defined its strategy in  
three elements:
1. Organic revenue growth from:
•	New developments in core respiratory 
business
•	Diversification into adjacent markets and 
territories
•	Increasing revenue by capturing more of 
the value chain
2. Investment in activities in adjacent/ 
complementary technologies/markets
3. Operating leverage from growth, and  
ongoing cost efficiency
Since then it has realised significant achievement 
of these goals:
1. Organic Revenue:
•	Launch of Integrated Dose Counter on 
Teva’s QNASL, and the Chiesi NEXThaler. 
Development and launch of the King Video 
Laryngoscope
•	Development of two Auto-Injector 
development programmes, and significant 
new Auto-Injector IP development from 
the Innovation team. Securing two Nasal 
development programmes
•	Securing commercial drug handling on 
the Nicoventures and one of the Nasal 
programmes
2. Investment in the Medical House, and  
Atlas Genetics.
Following the divestment of King Systems, 
this core strategy is unchanged, though now 
more tightly focused on the drug delivery and 
Life Sciences services market. Our strategy is 
primarily organic growth, to be supplemented 
with relevant and value enhancing inorganic 
opportunities as they become available.
3. Operating leverage and cost efficiency:
Bespak margins have grown and the King 
Systems business was consolidated to improve 
its operating margins.

Respiratory
In respiratory, we will continue to increase our 
share both through the development of new 
products and through selling into new and 
developing geographical markets. We will 
maintain our competitive position by continuing 
to leverage Continuous Improvement (CI) 
activities as products move into the mature 
stage of their product life cycle.
Auto-Injectors
Our strategy for the auto-injector sector is 
focused on the commercialisation of the existing 
pipeline in conjunction with the development 
of further IP and the exploitation of “Innovation 
on Demand” opportunities through our growing 
Innovation team based in Cambridge. We will 
continue to move up the value chain by offering 
assembly and drug handling and will continue to 
look for additional, selective acquisitions.
Nasal
Our strategy for the nasal market is focused 
on the delivery of our existing development 
programmes plus further exploitation of our 
growing IP portfolio via a number of “Innovation 
on Demand” opportunities. 
Nicotine Delivery
Our approach to the Nicotine Delivery sector is 
to successfully industrialise & commercialise the 
Nicoventures device, and then to increase the 
value add content, and exploit wider geographic 
opportunities as the business and market 
develops.
POC Diagnostics
The POC Diagnostic strategy is focused on the 
commercialisation of the Atlas device as a first 
stage penetration of the market. Following a 
successful outcome to this programme we will 
leverage our development, manufacturing and 
regulatory know-how in order to grow our market 
share, possibly in conjunction with selective 
acquisitions.
In conclusion, Bespak’s strategy is to 
continue to grow by exploiting its current and 
emerging competencies, in both existing and 
adjacent market sectors, in a mixed model of 
proprietary IP protected products and contract 
manufacturing, whilst harnessing more of the 
value chain to include drug handling and final QP 
release to the market. 
Bespak Strategy
Specific to the Bespak 
business, its strategy is 
to operate a mixed model 
producing both its own 
proprietary products, and 
the contract manufacture 
of customers’ products, 
based on its know-how and 
regulatory expertise.
In terms of customers, Bespak will sell new 
products into current and new divisions of existing 
customers building on its strong relationships, 
whilst also cultivating relationships with new 
customers in order to deliver diversified growth.
Bespak will continue to diversify its revenue 
portfolio by growing its product offering in 
respiratory and non-respiratory markets. It will 
also grow by moving up the value chain: from 
its core expertise of design for manufacture, 
moulding and assembly through to filling the 
devices with drug and releasing to the end 
market via QP (Qualified Person) release.
Our core competences in the high volume, high 
quality regulated respiratory market are readily 
transferrable to our chosen adjacent sectors: 
Auto-Injectors, Nasal, Nicotine Delivery and 
point-of-care (POC) Diagnostics. Our strategic 
intent is to build on these strong foundations 
whilst adding new skills to meet new challenges, 
including drug handling, final device assembly, 
pharmaceutical packaging and QP release to the 
end market.

Consort Medical plc  
Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
In our last Annual Report, 
I outlined how the Group 
had executed on its growth 
strategy in both Bespak 
and King Systems. 
That progress has continued in FY2013. In 
Bespak, we have launched a product from 
the development pipeline, and have also 
been awarded a potentially transformational 
programme from Nicoventures. King Systems 
was divested from the Group in February 2013, 
with a very full valuation being realised, reflecting 
the success of the new investment and strategy 
in the business in the last few years. We have 
also delivered on our financial expectations and 
end the year with a very strong balance sheet, 
and with a development portfolio that is set to 
deliver significant organic growth. 
On a like for like basis

, revenue from products 
and services increased by £1.7m (1.3%) 
to £129.5m (FY2012: £127.8m). Bespak 
revenues

 from products and services rose by 
£1.5m (1.7%) to £95.0m (FY2012: £93.5m) and 
King revenues

 rose by £0.2m (0.4%) to £34.5m 
(FY2012: £34.3m).
On a like for like basis

(FY2012: £20.9m). Bespak’s operating profit

grew 6.6% to £19.5m (FY2012: £18.2m) with its 
operating margin increasing to 20.5% (FY2012:

(FY2012: 52.2p). Basic EPS from continuing and 
discontinued operations increased by 71.7% to 
84.9p per share (FY2012: 49.5p) due to the gain 
on disposal of King Systems (see note 11 to the 
financial statements).
Like for like Cash Flow from operating activities

increased to £20.0m (FY2012: £17.6m). 
Like for like EBITDA
1
 before special items was 
up £1.1m (4.0%) at £28.3m (FY2012: £27.2m). 
Working Capital on a like for like basis was down 
at £8.4m (FY2012: £9.3m) representing 8.8% 
of sales (FY2012: 10.1%) following a sustained 
tightening of working capital management 
processes throughout the year.
Capital expenditure of £11.0m (FY2012: £12.1m) 
was lower than the previous year, which saw 
investment in the King Systems transformation 
programme draw to a close. The cash proceeds 
on disposal of King Systems totalled £74.7m of 
which £57.1m was used to repay the Group’s 
debt in full leaving the Group balance sheet in 
a net cash position of £37.0m (2012: Net debt 
£37.7m). With headroom of £76.1m under its 
undrawn banking facility, and a further £25.0m 
available under the accordion facility, the Group 
has significant cash resources available.
Further commentary on the financial results is 
contained within the Chief Financial Officer’s 
review, in particular this year to clarify the 
financial performance on a like for like and 
statutory reporting basis, in the light of the King 
Systems’ disposal.
The Board is proposing a 5% increase in the 
final dividend to 12.71p (FY2012: 12.1p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 19.71p. 
This increase rebases the Company’s dividend 
cover, and underlines the Board’s confidence 
in the sustainability of the current performance, 
and in the prospects for the conversion of 
its development opportunities into increased 
revenue and operating leverage.
Last year we reported that we had added three 
new programmes to our development pipeline. 
This year, our focus has been on progressing 
these opportunities through our pipeline towards 
Chief 
Executive’s 
Review 
Consistent strong 
financial performance 
and strategic 
execution.
“...continued progression of the development 
pipeline towards launch and the divestment 
of King Systems for a full price before 
contingent consideration.”

Our Performance
Strategic Report
launch. I am pleased to report that in March 
this year the Chiesi NEXThaler (DEV750) was 
launched, and production is ramping up to 
support demand. We also signed an exclusive 
commercial supply agreement with Nicoventures 
for a novel nicotine delivery device. We also have 
a number of new opportunities which are under 
discussion, including novel IP-led opportunities 
from our Cambridge-based Innovations team. 
In December 2012 we announced that we 
had signed a contract with Nicoventures, 
to supply a novel nicotine inhalation device 
(previously referred to as the Oxette device). 
The device is intended as a safer alternative 
to smoking, delivering a regulated dose of 
nicotine to the user. In the previous year we 
had been developing the Oxette product with 
Kind Consumer, and producing samples for 
them to conduct clinical trials. Kind Consumer 
Limited has responsibility for obtaining market 
authorisation for the product, and their 
application is currently [being considered] by 
the MHRA. Following regulatory authorisation, 
through a licensing agreement, the global 
commerical rights will pass to Nicoventures. 
Nicoventures awarded Bespak a multi-year 
exclusive supply contract. This programme is an 
important business win for Bespak. We are very 
encouraged by this opportunity.
We have continued to invest in our Innovations 
team during this year: the Cambridge-based 
team now stands at ten and growing, and 
we are now investing over £1m per annum in 
this aspect of our R&D alone. During a recent 
Investor Day at Bespak, we unveiled for the 
first time some of the developments which are 
being worked on. We have a clear Innovation 
philosophy and methodology, at the core of 
which is the identification and satisfaction 
of unmet needs in patients, clinicians, Life 
Sciences companies, commercial arena and 
other technical requirements. We have received 
positive responses to our innovations, and we 
expect to be translating some of them into firm 
commercial development opportunities in the 
coming months and years.
In December we announced the divestment 
of King Systems, our US-based subsidiary 
engaged in the development and manufacture 
of disposable supplies to anaesthetists and 
emergency care practitioners. In recent years, 
we have made significant investments to improve 
the efficiency and reduce the operating costs of 
the business through factory consolidation and 
automation, and to deliver enhanced organic 
revenue growth through the development of the 
King Vision video laryngoscope. It is testament to 
the turnaround achieved in the business that we 
received a number of unsolicited approaches to 
purchase the business, and agreed a sale which 
provided us with both an attractive up front 
consideration, and a potentially substantial earn 
out. The sale completed on 15 February 2013.
We have continued to execute on our strategy 
for diversified growth which we launched 
in 2008. At that time, Bespak was primarily 
focused on the respiratory market, and King 
Systems was in need of new revenue streams 
and a more efficient cost base. Our strategy 
enabled us to reposition King’s cost base 
and to create a strong engine of new organic 
growth for the business, which enabled us 
to sell it at a full valuation. In 2008, Bespak 
was principally engaged in the design and 
manufacture of devices for respiratory drugs; 
by contrast, today it has diversified such that it 
operates in nasal, injectables, nicotine delivery, 
ocular and POC diagnostics. Moreover it has 
secured a greater share of the value chain than 
previously, through the addition of drug handling 
services to its customers, through one of the 
nasal development contracts as well as to 
Nicoventures. 
Following the divestment of the King Systems 
business, our core strategy remains unchanged. 
Over the past five years, we have successfully 
diversified the business both horizontally and 
vertically, strengthened the cost base, and 
made selective investments into both the 
Medical House Injectables technology, and the 
Atlas Genetics POC diagnostics business. Our 
strategy will continue with a tighter focus on the 
Life Sciences market, as we exploit the organic 
development opportunities in front of us. In 
addition, we will look to grow the business 
through inorganic means as suitable and value 
enhancing opportunities which fit with the 
Bespak business become available, and which 
can be leveraged to create further enhanced 
shareholder value. 
In summary it has been a very significant year in 
a number of areas: consistent strong financial 
performance; strategic execution in progressing 
the development pipeline towards launch; the 
successful launch of the Chiesi NEXThaler; 
securing a potentially transformational contract 
from Nicoventures; and the divestment of 
King Systems at an attractive valuation. We 
look forward optimistically to continuing strong 
performance as our strategy continues to deliver.

Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
Bespak
Overview
Bespak revenue from products and services grew 
1.7% to £95.0m (FY2012: £93.5m), in line with 
expectations. Bespak operating profit (before 
special items
2
) grew 6.6% to £19.5m (FY2012: 
£18.2m) with operating margin increasing to 
20.5% (FY2012: 19.5%) largely from increased 
service income and operating leverage.
Our growing Innovation team has made significant 
progress this year, developing a strong pipeline 
of new opportunities. Many of these have been 
introduced to customers with a very positive 
reception, and the team’s services have also 
been commissioned on an “Innovation on 
Demand” basis.
Our development pipeline is exceptionally strong. 
Our tried and proven process methodologies are 
delivering progress on a number of programmes. 
The award of the Nicoventures programme has 
brought new opportunity to the pipeline.
Following the successful grant of the clinical 
trials license in 2011, the regulatory team is 
developing the necessary processes and controls 
for commercial drug handling. This will be an 
integral part both of the Nicoventures project and 
one of the pipeline nasal contracts: the team is 
confident of the successful grant of regulatory 
licensing for this in 2013.
In March 2013, the Chiesi NEXTHaler was 
launched following a significant development 
and industrialisation programme, which began 
in 2005. Industrial planning is well advanced to 
scale up facilities and equipment for Nicoventures 
manufacturing, which will include the reopening 
and refurbishment of our Milton Keynes facility.
Innovation
We have developed a range of “service” offerings 
and business models that are focused on 
meeting the needs of the market, in an exciting 
and formative year for Innovation. This has 
involved building a team, drawn from a variety of 
backgrounds, and providing appropriate facilities 
in Cambridge.
With a larger team now in place we are making 
good progress in identifying unmet or unsatisfied 
market needs and generating viable concepts that 
meet the expectations of all parties involved with 
a drug device, including the patient, clinician and 
our Life Sciences partner. We are also looking 
at aspects of the supply chain and the drug as 
opportunities to innovate. Through this effort, we 
have a full pipeline of development projects from 
simple functional elements through to full product 
developments and clearly identified opportunities 
that exist for both our “opportunity discovery” and 
“Innovation on Demand” offerings. 
The innovation process starts by investigating 
potential opportunities and using our four 
stage-gate process, and results in robust 
concepts that we know meet unsatisfied need 
and equally importantly will be reproducible in 
high volume manufacture. The primary objective 
of the process is to minimise the overall risk 
(commercial, user, pharmaceutical and technical) 
through early targeted mitigation activities thereby 
maximising the chances of success once the 
product is in the market. 
We do not offer a one size fits all process; we 
listen to our clients and have taken the approach 
of creating a series of proven functional building 
blocks rather than developing a fixed device that 
solves a given specific problem. This approach

provides the flexibility to meet the needs of our 
clients in two ways: opportunity discovery and 
Innovation on Demand.
Opportunity discovery allows us to build device 
solutions that will satisfy the needs of our clients 
and identify new needs as well as those that 
are not met in the current market. For instance 
there is a trend towards larger volume delivery of 
more viscous drugs. In response to this we have 
developed drug delivery techniques that enable 
these challenges to be overcome. This delivery 
technology combined with our other functional 
building blocks has enabled us to develop a 
range of five injection devices from a simple 
assisted injector - the Syrina Micro, through to the 
sophisticated Syrina AI which inserts the needle, 
delivers the drug, waits a short period of time to 
allow the drug to disperse before retracting and 
informs the patient that the process is complete 
and that the needle is safely shielded. The next 
step is work with our partners to embody this into 
a fully functional device that meets the needs of a 
specific patient group.
Innovation on Demand is beginning to show 
its value as a service offering. We can use our 
increasing range of basic building blocks to solve 
the very specific challenges encountered by 
the client. This requires working closely with our 
clients and discussing those “difficult-to-solve” 
challenges. As an example, a client has a drug 
that consists of two viscous, liquid components 
that need mixing moments before injection but 
must be kept separate prior to this. The aim was 
to find a single device solution that was both easy 
to use and convenient for the clinician and patient 
alike. Armed with this brief and within four weeks 
of discussing the problem, the Innovations team 
was able to produce a working demonstrator of 
a potential device. This was a combination of 
proven functional elements and novel elements, 
and satisfied the basic requirements of our client. 
We are now working with the client to produce a 
more robust demonstrator.
Product Development
Bespak operates in every phase of a device’s 
development lifecycle, from early to late stage 
clinical trials, as well as post launch where 
the business may become a second source 
of supply. Device suppliers who partner with 
customers whilst a product is in development 
invariably become the sole supplier at launch. 
Bespak’s preference is for early involvement 
where it is possible to apply greatest influence on 
the product design, not just to assure functional 
robustness but also to make it suitable for high 
volume manufacture.

Consort Medical AR2013-Front.indd   19 23/07/2013   12:17:14 22417.04   24/06/13   Proof 3 - FRONT END
Consort Medical plc  
Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
Whilst the overall approval timescales for drug 
delivery devices are long, the development lead 
times can be very aggressive in order to achieve 
clinical and launch deadlines. Bespak recognises 
that product development is an iterative process 
and it aspires to reduce the number of iterations 
required for a product, whilst progressing through 
each iteration as quickly as possible. In order 
to achieve this, the business has developed 
capabilities and competencies internally as well 
as having established a network of third party 
specialist suppliers. Internal capabilities include 3D 
CAD platforms (Unigraphics, ProE, SolidWorks, 
AutoCAD), mouldflow simulation, 3D printing 
(suitable for early stage functional evaluation), CT 
Scanning and an extensive laboratory capable of 
analytical and physical testing with both placebo 
and active ingredients. Bespak was an early 
investor in CT Scanning technology and it has 
proved pivotal in the diagnosis of discovery during 
product development. Rapid identification of root 
cause significantly reduces development iteration 
and reduces the associated lead times. 
Bespak has a proven track record in developing 
both proprietary products and products owned by 
others. The Easifill primeless valve is a proprietary 
product currently pending FDA approval via a 
lead customer. This product was designed to 
meet an unmet need in the market. Development 
increased the breadth of the organisation’s 
Intellectual Property portfolio whilst challenging 
and helping to evolve internal capabilities and 
competencies. Development progressed through 
pilot tooling and hand assembly with extensive 
laboratory product verification testing to determine 
iterative requirements to achieve robustness 
suitable for volume manufacture. The product 
is currently manufactured using multi-cavitation 
tooling and automated assembly with capacity 
in the millions. Variants of the Easifill valve are 
currently being sampled and evaluated by a range 
of other customers. 
On the Nicoventures programme, Bespak’s 
role here is to support the “Design Authority” 
not only to achieve the functional specification 
but to influence design such that the product is 
suitable for high volume manufacture. Bespak’s 
experience of drug/device interaction is critical to 
analysis of the root cause and solution generation. 
The product leverages Bespak’s check valve, 
Metered Dose Inhaler valve technology and 
medical device product expertise making Bespak 
the ideal partner of choice.
Regulatory and Quality
Bespak’s products are used in medical drug 
delivery applications, where patient outcomes 
can be directly affected by product quality. 
Consequently Bespak operates in a highly 
regulated environment with demanding quality 
and reliability expectations and requirements.
Our experience and focus in this sector has 
enabled us to develop significant expertise 
in high quality automation and sophisticated 
online checking systems. This has enabled 
us to achieve the product reliability standards 
necessary for medical products. We have hired 
talented people, enabling us to develop the 
business processes, experience, and “know-
how” required to meet complex regulations  
and precise manufacturing methodologies  
and controls. 
Our regulatory audit performance demonstrates 
that we reliably meet regulatory expectations. Our 
quality performance is well illustrated by a recent 
report from a major customer where the defect 
level of products supplied over the prior 
12 months was 0.2 parts per million — this 
exceeds the internationally accepted six sigma 
level of excellence.
We have developed and grown our Analytical 
Laboratory services — these enable us to 
provide a full service to our customers in product 
development, in clinical trials, and in volume 
manufacturing.
We have progressively developed our regulatory 
competence, and with it our business model 
offerings. This journey began with ISO 9001, 
then ISO 13485 — for medical devices. Then 
in May 2011 we were granted the necessary 
licence to make clinical trials supplies. In the 
summer of 2013 we will be seeking a licence 
that will allow us to manufacture and supply 
fully completed pharmaceutical products at a 
commercial scale into the distribution network. 
This drug handling capability will enable us to

Industrialisation, Manufacturing, 
Continuous Improvement (CI)
In order to meet its customers’ new product 
industrialisation needs, Bespak has evolved 
a framework which is tailored to meet the 
individual requirements of each programme. A 
programme manager navigates the journey from 
entry into the business, through product and 
process development, to handover into routine 
operations. The process is risk based and 
whilst stages exist in series, they are often run 
in parallel to compress lead times. All activities 
are undertaken in full compliance with applicable 
guidelines and regulations. 
Chiesi’s Nexthaler was industrialised at Bespak 
and launched in March 2013 in Germany, with 
other European territories expected to follow in 
due course. Nexthaler entered Bespak in 2005 
via Cambridge Consultants from another contract 
manufacturer. Bespak’s initial brief was to transfer 
the technology into the business and support 
Design for Manufacture activities resulting in a low 
volume capability suitable for clinical trials. Over 
the past years, Bespak has supported design 
iteration and subsequent design verification whilst 
evolving a manufacturing capability suitable for 
launch. Work will continue at King’s Lynn for 
the next year as additional capacity is installed. 
Establishing a suitable manufacturing footprint 
for the Nexthaler operation enabled the business 
to redevelop some existing footprint, whilst 
also providing an opportunity to consolidate 
other product operations under one roof. This 
consolidation effort was undertaken over the 
past 12 months and led to significant productivity 
improvements with resultant cost savings.
Following the award of the Nicoventures 
programme, the decision was taken to re-open 
and re-fit the Milton Keynes facility which will be 
used for all of the injection moulded components. 
Product assembly will take place in King’s Lynn.
As a manufacturer, Bespak has over 8,000 
square metres of clean room space currently 
installed and operational at its King’s Lynn facility.
The business assembles more than 500 million 
complex devices per year comprising more than 
3.6 billion components, of which approximately 
2.6 billion are moulded on site. The site boasts 
27 automatic assembly lines, 95 injection mould 
presses and more than £50m of tooling assets. 
All of these numbers are expected to grow as the 
exciting range of new products pass through the 
industrialisation pipeline to volume manufacture. 
Bespak also has an exceptional quality record 
and has manufactured more than 1 billion HFA 
MDI valves and 500 million Diskus devices 
without major issue.
Manufacturing processes are developed to 
ensure that a product can be supplied in high 
volume to the agreed specification at all times. 
These processes are continuously improved 
to minimise waste in all of its forms and 
maximise the value-add to customers. Bespak 
has well established Continuous Improvement 
processes and practices built on lean 
manufacturing/6 sigma principles, and it aspires 
to achieve World Class standards in operations. 
A pilot initiative has just been launched to 
build on the Continuous Improvement platform 
implemented over the past few years to drive 
World Class Manufacturing and associated 
productivity improvements to the next level. This 
will lead to a further exciting transformation in 
Operations performance.

 from products 
and services grew 0.4% to £34.5m (FY2012: 
£34.3m) and fell 20.0% (FY2012: £43.1m) 
without adjusting the comparatives. King Systems 
like for like operating profit decreased 23.0% to 
£2.0m (FY2012: £2.6m) with operating margin 
decreasing to 5.9% and decreased by £1.3m 
(38.6%) without adjusting the comparatives 
(FY2012: £3.3m). 
King Systems’ transformation continued strongly 
in the year under Consort Medical’s ownership.
The Ohio facility was exited as expected about 
two weeks before the sale of the business 
completed. This was made possible by 
achievement of milestones on the Manufacturing 
Automation programme, on both the bag dip and 
breathing mask lines.
In addition, the King Vision video laryngoscope 
continued its sales growth, fulfilling our 
expectations up to the time of the sale. In 
addition, the development of the next generation 
King Vision was also progressing on schedule.
King Systems was also successful in securing a 
multi-year exclusive supply contract with HPG, a 
major partner in the Hospitals supply chain.
The business departed the Group in good 
shape, well positioned to grow both revenue and 
profitability in the future. The disposal transaction 
was also structured in such a way that Consort 
Medical shareholders will be able to participate in 
the financial upside which the King Vision video 
laryngoscope will continue to bring.
Full details of the transaction are included in the 
Financial Review.
Outlook
The breadth and depth of our development 
pipeline is substantial, and in the coming twelve 
months we expect to see significant progress 
through the achievement of milestones on current 
programmes, including product launches, as we 
deploy significant additional resources to convert 
these opportunities.
In addition to the firm pipeline, we have a number 
of live early stage project enquiries under review, 
including new projects from our Innovations team. 
We would expect to convert at least one of these 
into our development pipeline over the next six 
months.
Volume production at the Bespak business 
continues to meet our expectations for the 
current year, which will include the ramp-up in 
production of the Chiesi NEXThaler following 
launch and roll-out to further territories.
The Board expects the sustained organic 
growth initiatives to continue to convert into 
progressively increased revenue and operating 
leverage for Consort Medical over time, as 
well as from further development programme 
wins. The Group continues to evaluate suitable 
inorganic opportunities which are consistent with 
its strategy.
One of our customers reported a defect level 
of just 0.2 parts per million, exceeding the 
international six sigma level of excellence.

Corporate 
Responsibility
Managing Corporate Responsibility (CR) remains 
a priority for the Consort Medical Board across 
the key areas of environment, employees, 
ethical standards and our local communities. We 
manage these areas within our business activities 
to ensure they remain a business priority in 
delivering sustainable shareholder value.
Governance Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
Committee continues to meet on a regular basis 
to review performance and continues to drive 
improved performance across all areas. The 
committee is chaired by Ian Nicholson, a non-
executive director, and consists of senior leaders 
across the Group. 
The focus of our activity is shaped by the four 
pillars of our CR framework. These cover:
•	Community — recognising the needs of the 
communities in which we operate
•	Employees — supporting our people
•	Environment — managing our environmental 
impact
•	Ethical standards — acting with integrity to 
achieve the highest ethical standards
Performance management The Group’s CR 
performance is reviewed against a number of 
key performance indicators (KPIs) for the issues 
which are outlined in our CR framework. This 
mechanism has now been in place for a couple 
of years and helps to guide our efforts and direct 
resource to the areas in which we can make 
the biggest difference. Progress against KPIs is 
noted in the achievements table.
These KPIs currently cover the areas of 
employee turnover and diversity, health and 
safety, waste recovery, water consumption 
and community investment. Our monitoring 
and reporting against these KPIs continues 
to improve and our interrogation of these 
measurements enables a better understanding 
of our risks and opportunities across our key 
impact areas.
Stakeholder engagement We recognise 
that our people are central to delivering our CR 
vision and objectives and we continue to explore 
further employee engagement opportunities. We 
are also exploring opportunities to incorporate 
CR-related discussions with a number of our key 
external stakeholders; opening dialogue with our 
customers, suppliers and local communities to 
support our efforts in this area.
Our performance We have seen year-on-
year performance improvements across our 
programme of activities, with a summary of 
performance highlighted below for each of 
the pillars:
Community
We are committed to supporting the patient 
population we serve and the communities 
in which we operate. Both local and 
national charities are considered important 
stakeholders for our businesses. To help deliver 
this commitment Bespak has established 
employee-led charity groups, with the aim of 
maximising opportunities to partner with external 
organisations.

Our Performance
Strategic Report
Grand East Anglia Run
Bespak continues to offer long-term support 
for the annual Grand East Anglia Run (GEAR), 
through both direct sponsorship support and 
encouraging employee participation. This helps 
to cement Bespak’s reputation and brand in 
the local community, whilst also supporting our 
health and wellbeing programme by encouraging 
employees to lead healthier lifestyles. For the first 
time this year Bespak offered 150 free places on 
the mini GEAR run, with these places distributed 
between the ten Norfolk high schools.
Schools, Colleges and Universities
Bespak continues to be an active supporter of 
local schools, colleges and universities, through 
regular work experience, career events and/or 
projects. This has included:
•	helping students to prepare for job interviews 
by completing mock interviews;
•	supporting an engineering careers event, 
helping students to prepare CVs and apply for 
positions, all of which increased the chances 
of getting an interview; and
•	supporting the three main high schools in 
King’s Lynn with science awards. Bespak 
employees assisted South Wootton Junior 
School with their science week by facilitating a 
one day event for pupils; introducing Bespak 
and a range of healthcare products in a fun 
environment.
We view all these pupils as potential future 
employees and it is our intention to continue to 
support young people in our local communities 
who wish to pursue a career in engineering by 
offering careers advice and work experience 
opportunities. 
Charitable Support
During November 2012, a number of Bespak 
employees raised £1,455 to support men’s 
health charities by growing moustaches for the 
annual Movember event.
Bespak’s Environment, Health and Safety Team 
launched a local ‘Foodbank’ appeal (part of the 
Trussell Trust) which is aimed at helping local 
families. All employees across the King’s Lynn site 
have been asked to donate non-perishable food 
products which will then be collected at a local 
Foodbank depot and distributed to those most 
needy in the King’s Lynn and surrounding areas.
The Charity Committee has approved a request 
from the RSPB Titchwell Marsh Nature Reserve 
to fund the purchase of an Automated External 
Defibrillator for use at this isolated location 
in Norfolk.
Employees
The business remains focused on investing in 
the training and development of employees, 
delivering effective communications and 
facilitating staff engagement, and providing 
opportunities for career progression.
Training and Development
Bespak’s training team has been working with 
managers to conduct a Skills Gap Analysis for 
their teams to define training / development 
requirements. By defining the skills required for the 
roles and assessing the current competencies, 
skills gaps and areas of risk are identified. Good 
Skills Gap Analysis helps to ensure the training 
budget is targeted correctly and supports the 
business in delivering its objectives. 
Apprenticeship Scheme
Our aim is to develop high quality, well trained and 
motivated individuals with externally recognised 
qualifications and Bespak specific knowledge, 
skills and competencies. Two specialised 
apprenticeships commenced at Bespak in 
January 2013, one in Technical Engineering 
and the other in Maintenance. The former will 
be working with the Moulding and Metrology 
Engineering team supporting the team with 
Moulding Engineering project activities. The latter 
will work with the Devices Maintenance Team 
supporting the team with maintenance activities. 
Both apprenticeship training programmes will 
be completed by August 2013. We have been 
running the scheme for a number of years and 
are committed to continuing the engineering 
apprenticeship programmes. Recruitment is 
currently in progress for four new apprentices to 
commence in August 2013 to cover the following 
pathways: technical support; toolmaking; 
maintenance and plastic injection moulding.
Health and Safety
This past year has seen the continuation of all 
the proactive approaches to prevent harm to 
any persons who work at or visit Company sites. 
With Bespak’s diversification programme, we are 
now shifting into new areas including handling 
active drugs in some of our products. This 
brings a complete new education programme 
at all levels involved in these exciting new 
opportunities. We have made good progress 
with a team that is keen to learn and who are 
adapting quickly to new ways of working.
We are entering a phase where site development 
will bring in a substantial amount of construction. 
This year more than ever we have scrutinised the 
safety credentials of the tendering companies, 
with Health and Safety playing a more prominent 
part of the selection decision.
Across the business we are fortunate to 
have had a good safety record. There is a 
determination in the Company to keep our 
focus on Health & Safety and ensure we do all 
we can to prevent harm to our employees, and 
the people who enter our sites. Health & Safety 
remains a key priority in the business and is the 
first reported item at both the Company and 
divisional Board meetings.
Environment
The Group continues to prioritise the 
management of environmental performance 
specifically in the areas of energy, waste 
management, and water efficiency.
Environmental Management 
Bespak was accredited to ISO14001 in March 
2010 for environmental compliance and was 
successfully re-accredited in February 2013. 
During the first certification period the business 
has embedded the principles of environmental 
management within the organisation. In the next 
phase Bespak will need to further demonstrate 
its commitment to preventing environmental 
pollution. 
The focus of ISO14001 is to ensure that the 
business has the systems and processes in 
place to ensure 100% compliance to applicable 
environmental legislation. Going forward our 
drivers are to manage waste, reduce energy 
consumption, together with the consumption 
of natural resources e.g. water, and maintain 
compliance to legislation. These not only 
reduce our environmental impact they make 
good business sense. In order to achieve these 
objectives engagement with our employees, 
through education and involvement is key 
to success.

Waste
Bespak continues to work to reduce its waste 
generation with less than 10% of waste being 
sent to landfill. This has been driven by a focus 
on waste minimisation and segregation at source, 
supported by a number of quality initiatives.
A current example of a segregation at source 
initiative which has significant business benefits 
is the waste disposal cost reduction project. 
Over the last 12 months Bespak has sent more 
than 280 tonnes of general waste to a waste 
management company with approximately 80% 
of this general waste recycled. Segregation 
at source by Bespak provides a significant 
opportunity, not only in terms of reducing 
costs of disposal but in realising the benefits of 
recycling. The net benefit to Bespak is estimated 
at more than £50k per annum. Segregation 
can also positively influence behaviour which is 
essential in the quest to reduce waste at source.
A good example of a waste reduction initiative 
emerged from the world class manufacturing 
pre-pilot initiative in a localised area of our valve 
manufacturing. Work undertaken identified 
that by changing the vessel used to hold 
silicone emulsion, the quantity consumed and 
consequently disposed of per year was reduced 
by approximately 50% or 1.8 tonnes. 
Energy
There has been ongoing improvement to 
reduce energy consumption at Bespak despite 
the pressures of a growing business. This has 
resulted in a net reduction in consumption of 12% 
relative to the FY2011 baseline figure. Continued 
focus on further energy consumption reductions 
will be driven in the next financial year by the 
introduction of a new energy management system 
and the appointment of an Energy Manager.
Specific activities which have led to a reduction 
in energy consumption include managing of 
compressed air and associated losses across 
plant/equipment; optimising clean room air 
handling and specifically reducing the number 
of air changes; focusing attention on area 
shutdowns over weekends and holiday periods 
together with lighting improvements in defined 
areas. Focus in the last 12 months has been 
on consolidation of experiences and knowledge 
gained through the initiative to date together with 
the integration of eSight energy management 
software. It is intended to install energy display 
monitors locally into production areas, to 
capitalise on the use of the energy management 
system. In addition discussions have been held 
with Carbon Trust, to assist the business with 
identifying new areas where further savings and 
optimisation can be achieved. 
Water
Progress has been made to reduce water 
consumption, primarily from Integrated 
Aluminium Components Ltd (IAC) operations, 
which accounts for 92% of all water consumed 
by the Bespak division.
Specific focus in FY2013 has seen a reduction 
of more than 25% consumption relative to 
FY2011 resulting in significant cost savings. 
Specific water saving initiatives contributing to 
this reduction have included:
•	installation of flow alarms to monitor water 
entering the waste effluent treatment plant;
•	fixing of leaks from tanks and valves on site 
(13% of all tanks and valves demonstrated 
some form of loss);
•	improved control and metered flows into all 
anodising tanks and some rinse tanks on the 
anodising plant; 
•	increased “dwell time” on non-critical stages of 
the manufacturing process thereby improving 
water recovery; and
•	recycling of water into processes for less 
critical steps in the manufacturing process.
Ethical Standards
We continue to operate to the highest ethical 
standards across the Group. It is our policy to 
uphold all laws relevant to prevention of bribery 
and corruption in all jurisdictions in which we 
operate. The Company has in place policies 
covering Anti-Corruption and Bribery; Gifts and 
Hospitality; Business Ethics and Whistleblowing 
procedures and ensures that these are reviewed 
on a regular basis. 
Group Values
The Group values are integrity, customer focus, 
results driven, transparency and accountability. 
Following the introduction of the values three 
years ago the Group has initiated an employee 
led review to enhance employee engagement.
Divestment of King Systems
King Systems was sold during the year. Prior 
to this divestment King Systems completed a 
number of CR related initiatives, including the 
introduction of an engagement council; more 
focused internal communications and integration 
of the Group values.

Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
Financial 
Review
FY2013 was a successful year for Consort 
Medical, with continuing growth in Bespak 
revenue and profits, and strong cash generation 
from operations. Our development pipeline 
continued to advance, providing clearer 
evidence of future growth, with the launch of the 
Chiesi NEXThaler and the award of the multi-year 
exclusive supply agreement from Nicoventures. 
The sale of King Systems was completed in 
February 2013, providing a full value for the 
current and future prospects for that business. 
The Company invested further in the equity of 
Atlas Genetics, as the technology moves closer 
to commercialisation.

2) Statutory trading performance
Following the disposal of King Systems,  
the Group’s income statement has been  
re-stated to include profit after tax from King 
Systems within discontinued operations and the 
comparative figures for the rest of the income 
statement have been restated accordingly. 
Revenue from products and services on 
continuing operations (entirely attributable to  
the Bespak division) grew 1.7% to £95.0m 
(FY2012: £93.5m). 
Operating profit from continuing operations 
before special items increased by £1.6m 
(10.1%) to £18.1m (FY2012: £16.5m). Profit  
before tax on continuing operations before 
special items increased by £1.9m (13.2%) to 
£16.2m (FY2012: £14.3m). Profit before tax 
after special items from continuing operations 
decreased by £0.2m (1.5%) to £14.7m

Profit after tax before special items from 
discontinued operations decreased by £0.8m 
(22.0%) to £2.8m (FY2012: £3.6m). Profit

operations increased by £11.0m to £13.3m.
Adjusted EPS from continuing and discontinued 
operations increased by 5.2% to 54.9p per 
share (FY2012: 52.2p). The basic aggregate 
EPS increased by 71.7% to 84.9p per share 
(FY2012: 49.5p) due to the gain on disposal of 
King Systems (see note 11).
Taxation
The tax charge from continuing and 
discontinued operations for the year was £3.5m. 
The tax charge before special items from 
both continuing and discontinued operations 
of £3.8m reflects an effective rate of 19.4% 
(FY2012: 23.0%).
Our development 
pipeline continues to 
advance providing 
clear evidence of 
future growth.

Our Performance
Strategic Report
The tax charge before special items on 
continuing operations (see note 10 to the 
financial statements) was £3.2m resulting in an 
effective rate of 19.7% (FY2012: 20.8%). The 
R&D tax credit claims in the UK, a falling UK tax 
rate and finalisation of brought forward liabilities 
contributed to the reduced overall tax charge.
The tax credit from discontinued operations 
(see note 28) of £0.1m reflects the fact that no 
tax was charged against the gain on disposal, 
as the substantial shareholder exemption was 
available to the Group. The tax charge before 
special items from discontinued operations was 
£0.6m at an effective rate of 17.5% which was 
lower than the statutory rate due to the receipt 
of an R&D tax credit in the period up to disposal 
attributable to King Systems.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a 5% increase in the 
final dividend per share of 12.71p (FY2012: 
12.1p) such that the total dividend for the period 
amounts to 19.71p (FY2012: 19.1p) as set out 
in note 12 to the financial statements. The final 
dividend will be paid on 25 October 2013 to 
shareholders on the register on 20 September 
2013. Dividend cover, based on earnings before 
special items, was 2.8 times (FY2012: 2.7 
times). At the 30 April 2013 share price of 800p 
this represented a yield of 2.5%.
Special Items from Continuing 
Operations
Special items from continuing operations of 
£1.9m consist of £0.9m of amortisation of 
intangible assets created on the acquisition of 
the Medical House in 2009, a charge of £0.5m 
against an operating lease from the Medical 
House and other costs of £0.2m. The Group 
also incurred a one off tax charge of £0.7m 
in respect of the recognition of a deferred tax 
liability following the announcement to re-open 
the site at Milton Keynes offset by the tax effect 
of the above special items of £0.4m. See note 6 
to the financial statements.
Discontinued Operations
On 15 February 2013, Consort Medical 
completed the sale of King Systems to Ambu 
A/S. This followed a number of unsolicited 
approaches from parties interested in acquiring 
the business.
The upfront consideration was £77.4m 
($120.0m), which following adjustments 
for working capital increased to £79.6m 
($123.3m). This represents a 17.3 multiple of 
the FY2012 EBITDA. Given the anticipated near 
term improvements expected in the financial 
performance of the business at the time of 
sale, contingent consideration mechanisms 
were agreed as a central element of the value 
realisation from the disposal. The first was a 
£6.5m ($10.0m) lump sum payment upon the 
launch of the King Vision next generation blade. 
The second element was a three year earn out 
of up to $40.0m based on the King Vision sales 
in the period from 1 May 2013 to 30 April 2016: 
£12.9m ($20.0m) of this was based on the 
King Systems business plan at the time of sale, 
with a further £12.9m ($20.0m) upside for up 
to 100% outperformance of that plan. Payment 
of the £6.5m ($10.0m) lump sum plus the first 
£12.9m ($20.0m) of the earn-out would equate 
to a valuation multiple of 21.5x FY2012 EBITDA; 
payment of the full £32.3m ($50.0m) would 
equate to a valuation multiple of 24.3x FY2012 
EBITDA.
The disposal has been accounted for as 
follows and is included within special items from 
discontinued operations as set out in note 28 to 
the financial statements:
£m
Cash proceeds 79.6
Fair value of contingent 
consideration receivable 11.5
Net assets disposed (78.0)
Disposal costs (4.9)
Recycling of foreign exchange 
gains from reserves 2.7
Gain on disposal 10.9
Other special items from discontinued operations 
include £1.1m of amortisation of intangible 
assets recognised on the acquisition of King 
Systems in 2005 and £0.2m of restructuring 
costs in respect of the King transformation 
programme, offset by a £0.2m credit on the 
unwind of the discount on the contingent 
consideration receivable from Ambu and the tax 
effect of the above special items of £0.7m.
Revenue from discontinued operations 
decreased by £8.6m (20.0%) to £34.5m 
(FY2012: £43.1m). Profit before tax and special 
items from discontinued operations decreased 
by £1.7m (33.8%) to £3.4m (FY2012: £5.1m).
Investment in Atlas Genetics
In April 2013, the Group made a further 
investment of £1.1m in Atlas Genetics Limited: 
this was the second tranche of the funding 
initiated in July 2011, when the Group invested 
£1.4m, adding to the £1.2m invested in a 
previous funding round in February 2011. The 
Group’s total investment to date now stands 
at £3.7m as set out in note 16 to the financial 
statements. Substantial progress has been 
made in the last year in the point-of-care (“POC”) 
diagnostics card development — in conjunction 
with Bespak — and with the development of the 
card reader and assay tests. The Group now 
holds 16.9% of the equity, or 15.7% on a fully 
diluted basis. The other equity partners include 
Novartis Venture Funds, Johnson & Johnson 
Development Corporation, Life Science Partners 
and BB Biotech Ventures. The third tranche 
of this round of funding is due in March 2014, 
and the Group may invest a further £0.5m. We 
continue to believe that having been joined 
as co-investors by two leading healthcare 
companies with significant diagnostic interests 
and two leading Life Science investors, that 
their investment underlines the great potential of 
Atlas. The additional funding is expected to be 
sufficient to launch the current products for the 
detection of chlamydia and gonorrhoea as well 
as to start development of diagnostic tests for 
other infectious diseases.
Bespak has retained its long term manufacturing 
rights to the disposable card used in the Atlas 
system and continues with an arm’s length 
development contract to design for manufacture 
and scale up production of the disposable card. 
The Group will continue to account for Atlas as 
an equity investment in the accounts of Consort 
Medical plc.
Inorganic Investment
Following the sale of King Systems, the Group 
has significant cash resources available to invest 
in relevant and value enhancing investments. The 
Group’s strategy is discussed on pages 2 to 13: 
this highlights the Group’s area of focus and the 
opportunities available to it for acquisitions. Such 
acquisitions would be appraised against strict 
criteria for closeness of strategic fit, availability, 
integration, valuation and value creation.

Balance Sheet
Following the disposal of King Systems in 
February 2013, the Consort Medical balance 
sheet has been materially strengthened. Year-
end Net Cash was £37.0m (FY2012: Net Debt 
(£37.7m)). With headroom of £76.1m under its 
undrawn banking facility, and a further £25.0m 
available under the accordion facility, the Group 
has significant available cash resources. Gross 
assets were £142.5m (FY2012: £182.8m). The 
pension deficit increased to £11.8m (FY2012: 
£3.4m) and is reviewed separately below. 
Provisions fell from £3.7m at the beginning of the 
period to £2.6m at 30 April 2013.

Working Capital on a like for like basis was down

revenue (FY2012: 10.1%) following a sustained 
tightening of working capital management 
processes throughout the year. 
2) Statutory cash flow performance
Cash Flow from Operating Activities increased 
by £1.6m (8.6%) to £20.0m (FY2012: £18.4m). 
EBITDA before special items decreased by 
£0.1m (0.3%) to £28.3m (FY2012: £28.4m). 
Working Capital reduced by £4.8m or 41.4% due 
to the disposal of King Systems during the year.
Capital expenditure of £11.0m (FY2012: 
£12.1m) was lower than the previous year, 
which saw investment in the King Systems 
transformation programme draw to a close. Net 
cash received on disposal of King Systems 
totalled £74.7m of which £57.1m was used to 
repay the Group’s debt in full leaving the Group 
balance sheet in a net cash position of £37.0m 
(2012: Net debt £37.7m).
The Group refinanced its principal bank facilities 
in June 2012 with the Royal Bank of Scotland 
(RBS) and HSBC. In order to eliminate the risk of 
volatile currency movements affecting our 
headroom, we have continued to split our main 
facilities into two revolving credit facilities (RCFs). 
The first RCF is for $56m (undrawn at 30 April 
2013) and the second RCF is for £40m (also 
undrawn at 30 April 2013). These facilities total 
£76.1m and will expire in November 2016. 
Margins remained unchanged from the old 
facilities, with a cost of between two and three 
percent over LIBOR depending upon the ratio 
of net debt to EBITDA prevailing at the time. A 
non-utilisation fee of 40% of the interest margin 
on the undrawn balance applies. 
Under the terms of the refinancing, the Group 
also has a £25m “accordion” facility, by which 
further facilities may be made available by RBS 
and HSBC under the current terms to support 
significant investment or acquisition opportunities 
which may arise.
The Group maintains levels of sterling cash 
sufficient to meet imminent obligations and to 
be a reserve in case of an adverse event. These 
funds are invested with a range of reputable 
financial institutions approved by the Board. 
With net cash on the balance sheet, the 
Group clearly remains comfortably within both 
its headroom and its covenants. Taking into 
account the cash balances available, the total 
headroom at the period end was £113.1m 
(FY2012: £28.8m).

Our Performance
Strategic Report
Foreign Currency and European 
Exposure
The Group monitors its foreign currency 
exposures carefully and seeks to mitigate all 
material transactional exposures. The Group 
currently has low exposure to movements in 
the euro and US dollar movements. Where 
necessary we buy or sell forward currency to 
protect current period transactions. 
The Group does have significant sales into the 
Euro zone. We are vigilant as to the growing 
risks in Europe, but it is an important feature 
of our market that our customers are generally 
very profitable and stable entities for whom our 
products are generally a small part of the total 
cost of sales. The majority of them purchase 
product from us in GB pounds and they are 
generally unable to change their supply chains 
due to the regulatory environment in the short or 
even medium term. We continue to monitor the 
situation closely.
Pension Scheme
Bespak operates a defined benefit pension 
scheme in the UK that is closed to new 
employees, who are eligible to join a defined 
contribution pension scheme (see note 21 to 
the financial statements). As at 30 April 2013, 
the deficit under IAS19 reporting requirements 
was £11.8m compared with £3.4m as at 30 
April 2012. The movement was primarily as a 
result of gross liabilities increasing to £91.3m 
(FY2012: £71.5m) due to abnormal conditions in 
the global markets that have further depressed 
discount rates, partially offset by a recovery in 
asset values. The Group completed its triennial 
revaluation of the pension scheme as at 30 April 
2011, at which point the pension scheme was 
in a small actuarial surplus. The next triennial 
actuarial valuation will take place as at 30 April 
2014. 
Risk Management
The Group considers effective risk management 
to be a high priority. Specific risk management 
activities are reviewed on pages 30 to 31 of 
the Annual Report. We are pleased to report 
that the Group incurred no material financial or 
business losses despite the riskier economic 
and business environment.

Principal Risks 
& Uncertainties
Our performance and prospects may be affected by risks and uncertainties relating to our business 
and operating environment. Our internal controls include risk management processes to identify 
key risks, and where possible to manage those risks through systems and processes, and by 
implementing specific mitigation strategies.
The most significant risks identified through our progressive review of the risk register that could 
materially affect the Group’s ability to achieve its financial and operating objectives are summarised in 
this section. Other risks are either unknown or deemed less material.
Risk Controls and Mitigating Actions
Product quality failure: The Group operates 
in highly regulated markets with strict quality 
requirements. Any quality failure involving the 
Group’s products could lead to loss of reputation, 
reduction in revenues, recall costs or sanction by 
the regulators.
The Group has rigorous quality assurance 
processes. Incoming raw materials are analysed, 
production processes are controlled, with 
automated checks by vision systems and metrology, 
and products are sampled for testing prior to 
release.
Reliance upon key customers/products: Bespak 
has a degree of reliance on a relatively small 
number of key customers/products, and the loss 
of one such customer/product could lead to a 
significant reduction in revenues.
The Group has significant intellectual property and 
there are significant barriers to entry. Regulation 
often restricts customers’ ability to transfer business 
elsewhere, and there is seldom loss of business 
once approved on a customer programme. We 
maintain a close dialogue with all of our customers. 
Our strategy of diversification has opened up a 
broader range of products and customers, and is 
progressively diluting this reliance through growth 
with other customers/products.
Regulatory risk: The operations of the Group are 
subject to various regulatory requirements which 
confer a degree of protection as well as an element 
of compliance risk, in particular to delivering growth.
A strong compliance regime is in place and regular 
reviews and audits take place, not only by regulatory 
bodies such as the FDA but also by customers. 
Bespak is ISO13485 accredited and operates SAP 
in all its main processes, and has recently expanded 
its externally recognised regulatory competence in 
acquiring a Clinical Trials license.
Development risk: The Group is developing a 
range of products at any time, any of which may 
fail in clinical trials, be stopped by the customer or 
may not become commercially successful once 
launched.
The Group follows rigorous processes for the 
development of new products. Where possible, 
it is developing the technology as a platform for 
multiple programmes to reduce the exposure to any 
individual trial. Development and industrialisation of 
medical devices is considered a core competence 
of the Group.
Growth risk: Bespak has been successful in 
acquiring an extensive product development 
portfolio, which places significantly increased 
demands for resources on the business. 
The business has well-honed programme planning 
and management systems and processes. This 
provides good visibility of resource requirements, 
whether capital, space, equipment or people, 
and enables timely fulfilment on multiple parallel 
programmes.

Our Performance
Strategic Report
Control of Financial Risk
Financial risks are generally considered relatively low for the Group because of its strongly profitable, cash generative base, and because it is able to take 
action to hedge or insure against most material financial risks. This section reviews our key policies for control of financial risks.
Risk Controls and Mitigating Actions
Credit risk The Group has implemented policies and processes that require appropriate credit 
checks to be made on potential customers before sales over certain limits are 
agreed. Credit limits and outstanding receivables are reviewed monthly and action 
taken if a new risk is identified. The Group has an excellent record on collection of 
receivables. The Group monitors the levels of cash held with financial institutions 
and the credit rating of those institutions in order to manage the credit risk on cash 
balances.
Interest rate risk The Group is not currently subject to interest rate risk on its revolving bank facility, 
as it is currently undrawn. The Group’s policy is to convert a large portion of any 
floating rate debt into fixed rate debt using interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk 
of adverse effects from a rise in interest rates.
Currency risk The Group is a sterling denominated Group which has a minor element of its 
income and costs in US dollars and Euros. It has a hedging strategy to contract 
forward for known exposures to reduce the impact of currency fluctuation. 
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly on a monthly basis.
liquidity risk The Group has strong cash flows, and good earnings visibility ensures that its 
margins are sufficient to exceed normal operating costs. Its business is cash-
generative, and there are well embedded cash and working capital management 
processes. Currently the Group has no borrowings, but has £76.1m of committed 
facilities in place until 2016.
Pension risk The Group works closely with the Pension Trustees to ensure that the Defined 
Benefit Scheme is adequately funded and that the assets are invested appropriately 
to meet future liabilities as they fall due. The Scheme was closed to new members 
in 2002, and was in surplus at the last actuarial valuation in 2011, though this may 
change before the next triennial valuation in 2014.

Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
Significant Agreements — Change of Control
There are a number of significant agreements containing provisions that 
take effect (including provisions permitting counterparties to terminate 
agreements) upon a change of control of the Company. These include 
both commercial and bank loan facilities agreements. Maintaining strong 
relationships with all counterparties is an important element in the risk 
management of the business and to help safeguard the Company’s 
interests to help mitigate against any impact resulting from any change of 
control of the Company should it occur.
Share Capital and Control
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are set out on page 87. All 
of the Company’s issued share capital comprises ordinary 10p shares 
which are fully paid up and rank equally in all respects.
The ordinary shares are listed on the Official List of the London Stock 
Exchange and are included in the techMARK index. In addition, the 
Company has entered into a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) 
programme with the Bank of New York Mellon, under which the Company’s 
shares are traded on the over-the-counter market in the form of American 
Depositary Shares (ADS).

the Company’s SAYE and 2002 ESOS Schemes. No new ordinary shares 
have been allotted under the Company’s share option schemes since the 
end of the year and up to the date of this report.
Rights Attaching to Shares
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, in addition to those 
conferred by law, are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, 
copies of which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or 
from the Company Secretary. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled 
to receive the Company’s reports and accounts, to attend and speak at 
general meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise 
voting rights and to participation in any distribution of income or capital.
Transfers of Shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or on the 
exercise of voting rights attached to them save where the Company has 
exercised its rights to suspend their voting rights or to prohibit their transfer 
following the omission of their holder or any person interested in them to 
provide the Company with information requested by it in accordance with 
Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006 or where their holder is precluded from 
exercising voting rights by the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules or 
the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. None of the shares carry any 
special rights with regard to the control of the Company.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of ordinary shares where 
such transfer documents are not lodged by acceptable means or proof of 
title is required.
Purchase of Own Shares
At the Annual General Meeting on 30 August 2012 shareholders approved 
a resolution of the Company permitting it to purchase its own shares up to 
a maximum of 2,902,318 ordinary shares. This resolution remains  
valid until the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting. As at  
12 June 2013 the directors had not used this authority. A resolution will be 
proposed at this year’s Annual General Meeting to renew this authority.
The Company operates an independent share ownership trust to acquire 
shares in the market to satisfy share option plans. During the year the 
Company’s share ownership trust purchased 94,800 ordinary shares on  
5 April 2013 at a price of 795.06p each and 30,215 ordinary shares on  
12 April 2013 at a price of 792.04p each. The Company’s share 
ownership trust currently holds 511,378 ordinary shares of 10p each 
representing 1.75% of the Company’s issued share capital.
Issue of Shares
At the 2012 Annual General Meeting, shareholders approved a resolution 
to give the directors authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £967,439 and further shares in accordance with ABI guidelines 
in connection with a rights issue up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,934,879 (inclusive of £967,439). In addition, shareholders approved 
a resolution giving the directors a limited power to allot shares for cash in 
other circumstances. These resolutions remain valid until the conclusion of 
this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
A resolution will be proposed at this year’s Annual General Meeting to 
renew these authorities.
Further explanation of the resolutions will be included with the Notice 
of Annual General Meeting, which will be circulated to shareholders 
separately.

the Remuneration Report on pages 36 to 43.

In the case of each director, so far as each is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. Each 
director has taken all the steps he/she ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting

Company’s registered office, Breakspear Park, Breakspear Way, Hemel 
Hempstead on 2 September 2013 at 2.00 pm. Details of the resolutions

Our Governance
Corporate Governance
The main features of the Group’s internal controls and risk management 
systems in relation to the process for preparing consolidated financial 
statements can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 
44 to 49. The Corporate Governance Report forms part of this Directors’ 
Report and is incorporated into it by cross reference.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are the Company’s auditors and a resolution 
to reappoint them and to authorise the directors to set their remuneration 
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group 
and parent Company financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
•	select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•	state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•	prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 14 
and 15 confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
•	the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
•	the Directors’ Report and divisional Operating Reviews found on pages 
18 to 21 include a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

in the formulation and approval of the Company’s future remuneration 
policies.

The Remuneration Committee’s principal role is to determine and make 
recommendations to the Board regarding the policy for the remuneration of 
the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the executive directors, the Company 
Secretary and other members of the senior executive management of 
the Company. It also determines the policy for, and scope of, pension 
arrangements and approves the design of performance-related pay 
schemes, sets the targets for such schemes, and approves payments 
under such schemes.
The Committee reviews the design of all share incentive plans for the 
approval of the Board and the shareholders. It determines each year 
whether awards will be made and if so, the overall amount of such awards, 
the individual awards to be made to executive directors and other senior 
executives, and the performance targets to be used.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee were reviewed 
during the year and are published on the Company’s website. 
Activities During the Year Ended 30 April 2013
The Remuneration Committee met six times during the year. Details of 
attendance at the meetings are shown in the attendance table on page 45. 
The key matters discussed at these meetings were:
•	Evaluation of performance conditions for 2009 Long-term Incentive Plan 
(‘LTIP’) awards (which did not vest) 
•	LTIP Performance Criteria
•	Malus and Clawback provisions
•	Award grants under the LTIP , Deferred Bonus Plan and Share  
Incentive Plan
•	FY2012 bonuses 
•	FY2013 bonus targets and criteria
•	Remuneration of executive directors and senior executives 
•	Non-executive directors’ fees 
•	Senior executives’ compensation for loss of office 
•	Committee Terms of Reference 
In discussing the above matters, the Remuneration Committee considered 
the remuneration policies of the Company as a whole. 
In addition, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the HR Director and the 
Company Secretary were invited to attend some or all the meetings but 
did not attend when any matter related to their own remuneration was 
discussed. Representatives of Deloitte LLP also attended meetings.
Advice
In March 2010, the Remuneration Committee appointed Deloitte LLP as 
independent remuneration advisers. Since their appointment, Deloitte LLP 
has provided the Committee with advice in connection with executive 
director remuneration packages, and pensions and share scheme matters 
more generally. Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and is committed to the Group’s voluntary code of practice for 
remuneration consultants in the UK.
Separately, Deloitte LLP has also provided the Company with advice on 
the valuation of share awards for IFRS 2 purposes and also in connection 
with the Company’s risks and controls. The Committee has received legal 
advice in relation to its share schemes from Eversheds LLP .
Executive Directors’ remuneration
Policy on Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Our policy is to provide remuneration packages for executive directors and 
senior executives which: 
•	are sufficiently attractive to enable the Company to recruit and retain 
talented individuals with the necessary skills and expertise to support 
the development of Consort Medical and grow long term value for our 
shareholders; and
•	contain levels of performance related variable pay such that they 
are aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders, provide 
appropriate motivation for executives to execute the strategy agreed by 
the Board and to develop and grow the Company and shareholder value, 
whilst taking account of internal and external risks.

Our Governance
This is achieved by:
•	setting base pay within a market competitive range by reference to 
relevant comparator companies, and taking account of the experience 
and performance of the individual concerned. Where appropriate, it is 
the policy of the Committee to pay upper quartile base salaries where 
the incumbent has proven himself to be of the highest calibre, along with 
demonstrable and sustained success in their role;
•	operation of an annual bonus (with a longer-term deferred share element) 
where annual performance targets are closely tied to core financial, 
operational and strategic performance measures linked to the Company’s 
strategy. The deferred share element of the annual bonus ensures that 
part of the value of payments earned remains tied to the Company’s share 
price for a three year period, thus embedding longer-term alignment with 
the interests of our shareholders within the annual bonus plan;
•	offering participation in a Long-term Incentive Plan, which provides for 
awards of free shares to be earned over a three year period, based 
on meeting stretching shareholder value linked performance targets 
(currently based on relative total shareholder return measured against a 
comparator group of companies).
•	expecting executive directors to build up and maintain a holding of 
Company shares equal to at least one-times salary thus promoting 
alignment of directors’ interests with those of shareholders.
When assessing remuneration, the Committee takes care to ensure that 
individuals are not overpaid in relation to their roles and responsibilities, and 
that packages for senior individuals are appropriate in comparison to the 
remuneration of other employees within the Company.
Summary of the Key Components of the Executive 
Directors’ Remuneration
The table below provides an overview of each element of the 2012/13

Base Salary
The annual salary of each executive director and senior executive is 
determined by the Remuneration Committee and is reviewed with effect 
from 1 August each year. As part of the August 2012 review, the Company 
considered market data provided by Deloitte LLP for companies of a similar 
size and complexity to Consort.
In making decisions regarding pay increases, the Committee considered 
the above data and also assessed individual performance within each 
role, prevailing market conditions, the Company’s performance and recent 
salary increases in the Company as a whole. 
On appointment the base salary of the CEO was set at a low level relative 
to the then benchmark, given this was a new appointment to the role. 
Since the appointment of Jonathan Glenn as CEO, the Company 
has undergone transformational and successful change with a strong 
improvement not only in financial performance but also a significant 
increase in market capitalisation. The Committee confirmed its view last 
year that this was in large part due to the CEO’s leadership. Last year’s 
report advised of the Committee’s decision to realign the base salary of the 
CEO at the upper quartile level. For 2012/2013 the Committee concluded 
that an increase in salary for the CEO of 3.5% was appropriate. This was 
effective from 1 August 2012. 
Following a review of the current environment and pay practices in the rest 
of the business, the Committee approved, with effect from 1 August 2013 
a base salary increase for the CEO and CFO of 2.9% and 3% respectively.
Annual Bonus
Overview 
The annual bonus comprises two elements: cash and deferred shares. To 
emphasise specific personal objectives aligned with our strategic goals, 
for FY2014, 80% of the cash element will continue to be based on PBT 
before special items performance but the remaining 20% of the cash 
element will be subject to the Committee’s assessment of success against 
personal objectives. Awards under the deferred share element will continue 
to be subject to the Committee’s assessment of performance against the 
strategic goals of the Group, but subject to the underlying PBT before 
special items performance in the year. The Committee considers that this 
combination of measures provides an appropriate balance of focus on 
financial and wider business and strategic goals. 
The strategic measures for the bonus are assessed each year and 
represent areas that are important for the long-term success of the 
Company including matters such as growth, new value creation, 
broadening the depth and range of the product portfolios, innovation and 
diversification into adjacent markets while keeping tight controls on cost.
The Committee considers that when taken together, the cash and deferred 
elements strengthen the alignment between shareholders and executive 
directors’ interests, and encourages a longer-term focus on shareholder 
value, by requiring a three year deferral of a proportion of the annual bonus 
payable in shares.

FY2013 Bonus 
The table below shows the annual and deferred bonus opportunity for the executive directors for the year ended 30 April 2013, and the required 
performance level against budgeted PBT.
In determining the actual bonus to be awarded, the Committee also made an assessment of individual performance against strategically important goals 
both at a corporate and personal level.

In FY2013 the strategic measures for executive directors included broadening the depth and range of the product portfolios including through innovation, 
diversification into adjacent markets and capturing a greater share of the value chain through vertical integration while keeping tight controls on cost.
The Company performed well against the targets set for the FY2013 annual bonus, which reflected the Company’s focus on profitability and 
diversification. Reflecting this, bonuses awarded to executive directors for the year FY2013 were as follows:
Role Total Bonus Cash Element
Deferred Share Element
(Deferred until June 2016)
CEO £505,625 £323,600 £182,025
CFO £206,726 £135,558 £71,168
long-Term Incentive Plan (“l TIP”)
Overview and FY2013 Awards
The LTIP is designed to align the interests of executive directors with those 
of shareholders on a long-term basis. The maximum aggregate value of 
awards that may be granted to executive directors under the LTIP is one 
times salary. Vesting of awards is dependent upon meeting performance 
conditions measured against Total Shareholder Return performance as 
described below. The comparator group and performance conditions 
remain unchanged from the previous year.
Awards under the LTIP can either take the form of nil cost options, share 
settled Share Appreciation Rights
1
 or approved options (made under the 
HMRC approved Company Share Option Plan
2
). In recent years, only 
awards of nil cost options and approved options have been made.
FY2013 Performance Conditions
The performance conditions for awards granted during the year are based 
on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over a three-year time frame (measured 
from the date of award). Relative TSR was chosen as the performance 
condition which most appropriately reflects shareholder value creation.
The comparator group has been selected on the basis of the constituents 
of the FTSE Small Cap Index, excluding investment trusts, finance, 
property and insurance companies.
The vesting schedule for the FY2013 LTIP awards is summarised  
as follows:
Relative TSR performance Vesting schedule
Company TSR less than mean annualised 
comparator TSR 0%
Company TSR equal to mean annualised 
comparator TSR* 25%
Company TSR greater than lower of:
i) mean annualised comparator TSR +7%; and
ii) upper quartile annualised comparator TSR* 100%
* Straight-line vesting applies between these points.
FY2014 Performance Conditions
As previously disclosed, the Committee have kept the LTIP performance 
conditions under review. At the time of printing, following feedback from 
shareholders the Committee is considering revising the LTIP performance 
conditions to include TSR and EPS for awards to be made in the future. 
Further details will be disclosed in our FY2014 remuneration report.
2010 LTIP Awards
The performance period for the 2010 LTIP awards ended in April 2013. 
The Committee determined, after advice and analysis from Deloitte, that 
based on the Company’s relative TSR performance in the three years to 
30 April 2013 (and in line with the plan rules), the awards will vest in full.

 Details of the Performance Shares and SARs can be found in note 27 to the accounts.

 The LTIP operates in conjunction with an HMRC approved Company Share Option Plan to utilise capacity under the HMRC limits.

Other Current Long-Term Incentives
Participation in the HM Revenue & Customs approved Share Incentive Plan 
and the UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (both available to all 
eligible UK employees) is made available to executive directors. Please see 
note 27 to the accounts for further details on these plans.
The operation of the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme has been 
discontinued except in relation to options already granted and outstanding 
at the time of discontinuance.
Pension
The Company provides executive directors with a Group Personal Pension 
Plan, which includes the benefit of a life assurance policy. To the extent 
that the aggregate of employee and employer contributions exceed the 
annual allowance, a taxable cash supplement is provided.
The Company’s contribution/cash supplement for the executive directors 
(as a percentage of base salary) is shown below:
Company contribution/cash 
supplement
CEO 20%
CFO/CDD 17.5%
Policy on Shareholdings
Executive directors are expected to accumulate a shareholding equivalent 
to one times annual salary over a five-year period, and to maintain this level 
of shareholding. Other senior executives are expected to accumulate a 
lower level of shareholding over a similar time frame.
The Company’s various equity related incentive arrangements can provide 
a means to develop this shareholding.
Service Contracts
The service contracts for the executive directors are summarised below:

CEO J Glenn 26 July 2006 
CFO R Cotton 25 June 2012
CFO T Woolrych* 24 June 2008
CDD N Higgins

  Mr Higgins resigned on 28 February 2013.
All executive directors have contracts terminable by the Company on 
one year’s notice and with earlier termination for cause. The policy of the 
Remuneration Committee is to treat each case on its merits, in accordance 
with applicable law. 
In the event of early termination, other than for cause, the relevant 
executive director’s current salary and contractual benefits (principally 
car allowance, pension and life assurance) will be taken into account in 
calculating the liability of the Company. Annual bonuses and long-term 
incentives are discretionary and dealt with in accordance with the rules of 
the applicable schemes.
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early 
termination of the above contracts.
External Appointments 
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors 
may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other 
companies. The directors are entitled to keep the fees from external 
appointments. 
None of the executive directors hold any external appointments. 
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
Policy on Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
The Board is responsible for determining the policy on remuneration of 
non-executive directors. The Company aims to attract non-executive 
directors who, through their experience, can further the interests of the 
Company and make an effective contribution to its strategic development. 
Terms of Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive directors have appointment letters, the terms of which 
recognise that their appointments are subject to the Company’s Articles of 
Association and their service is at the discretion of the shareholders.
All non-executive directors submit themselves for election at the Annual 
General Meeting following their appointment and subsequently at intervals 
of no more than three years.
The table below shows the appointment and expiry dates for the non-
executive directors:

Non-Executive Directors’ Fees  
(including the Chairman)
The fees for non-executive directors (including the Chairman) are reviewed 
every two years and are determined by the Board and the Committee as 
appropriate after taking into account the level of responsibility, relevant 
experience and specialist knowledge of each non-executive director, 
and appropriate external advice. Non-executive Board members are not 
involved in any discussion in relation to their own fees.
At its meeting on 30 April 2013 the Board approved an increase in the 
basic non-executive director fee to £38,500 with effect from 1 May 2013. 
The Remuneration Committee approved an increase in the fees of the 
Chairman to £130,000 with effect from 1 May 2013.
Share-based incentives are not awarded to non-executive directors, but 
they are encouraged to hold shares in the Company.
Travel and other reasonable expenses incurred in the course of performing 
their duties are reimbursed to non-executive directors.
The fees structure for the non-executive directors is shown in the following

Performance conditions for the LTIP awards made in 2009 were not met. 
The awards have lapsed in full. The period for measuring the performance 
conditions for the LTIP awards made in 2010 expired in April 2013. The 
Committee has determined after receiving advice and analysis from Deloitte 
that the performance condition was met and awards will vest in August 
2013 (September 2013 for related CSOP awards).
SAYE = Save As You Earn employee share option scheme. These options 
are not subject to performance conditions. This is an all-employee share 
scheme governed by specific tax legislation.
Since 30 April 2013, no directors have acquired interests in the ordinary 
shares of the Company.
None of the directors had a material interest at any time during the period 
in any contract of significance, other than a service contract, with the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Senior Executives’ remuneration
Policy on Senior Executives’ Remuneration
In addition to the executive directors, there are three senior executives who

Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
The UK Corporate Governance Code
The Group is committed to practising good corporate governance of its 
affairs as part of its management of relationships with its shareholders 
and other stakeholders. The Group seeks to uphold and to report on 
compliance in accordance with best practice in corporate governance.
Compliance Statement
The directors are satisfied that the Group has complied with the principles 
and provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) 
which was published in June 2010 (available from www.frc.org.uk) and 
was compliant throughout the financial year under review. The Board has 
noted the introduction of the September 2012 edition of the Code to 
apply for periods commencing on or after 1 October 2012. During the 
current financial year, the Board will continue to assess its practices to 
ensure continued compliance with the Code and will monitor any changes 
required to be made to further develop and enhance its governance 
policies including reporting against the 2012 edition of the Code in its next 
Annual Report. 
The principles of the Code cover five areas: leadership, effectiveness, 
accountability, remuneration and relations with shareholders. With the 
exception of the directors’ remuneration (which is dealt with separately 
under the Remuneration Report) the following sets out how the Board has 
applied the principles.
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance. Its policy is to appoint directors with appropriate 
skills who have sufficient time to carry out their duties adequately. The 
Board provides opportunities through site visits and regular access to 
senior management to permit directors to familiarise themselves with the 
Company and the markets in which it operates.
Leadership
The Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the Company. 
Individual members of the Board have equal responsibility for the overall 
stewardship, management and performance of the Group and for the 
approval of its long-term objectives and strategic plans.
Division of Responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the role of the Chairman 
and that of the Chief Executive of the Company and the roles are clearly 
set out in writing and reviewed by the Board. The primary responsibility 
of the Chairman is to lead and manage the Board and to promote high 
standards of corporate governance, and that of the Chief Executive is to 
manage the business of the Group.
The Chairman
Peter Fellner was appointed non-executive Chairman of the Company 
with effect from 1 May 2009. The Chairman is responsible for leading and 
managing the Board and ensuring its effectiveness on all aspects of its role. 
He works closely with the Chief Executive on developing Group strategy, and 
provides general advice and support as well as participating in the dialogue 
between the Company and its major shareholders. Dr Fellner has attended 
all Board meetings held during the year and commits substantial time to 
fulfilling his role. His other significant commitments are listed in his biography 
on page 15.
The Chairman was considered to be independent on his appointment.
The Chief Executive
Jonathan Glenn is the Company’s Chief Executive. His principal 
responsibility is to manage the Group’s business and to lead the senior 
management team in delivering the Company’s strategic and operational 
objectives.
The Senior Independent Director
Dr William Jenkins was appointed the Senior Independent Director with 
effect from 1 September 2011. Where the Chairman is not present, the 
Senior Independent Director is responsible for and has chaired meetings of 
the non-executive directors who have met when required during the year. 
He is available to meet with shareholders. 
The Non-Executive Directors
Independence
Each of the non-executive directors are free from any relationship with the 
executive management of the Company and are free from any business or 
other relationship that could affect or appear to affect the exercise of their 
independent judgement. The Board considers that all of the Company’s 
non-executive directors are independent directors, in both character and 
judgement, in accordance with the recommendations of the Code. 
The Operation of the Board
Reserved Matters and Delegated Authorities
The Board has the authority for ensuring that the Group is appropriately 
managed and achieves the strategic objectives it sets. To achieve this, the 
Board reserves certain matters for its own determination including matters 
relating to Group strategy, approval of interim and annual financial results, 
dividend policy, major capital expenditure, treasury policy, risk management 
and the effectiveness of the systems of internal control. The full schedule of 
matters reserved to the Board was reviewed during 2011 and is published 
on the Company’s website.
The Board performs its responsibilities through an annual programme of 
meetings, and by continuous monitoring of the performance of the Group 
as a whole. The Board also delegates the discharge of a number of its 
responsibilities to committees and management as described below.

Executive Committee and divisional operating boards. For details please 
see pages 46 to 48.
Effectiveness
The Board’s Composition
As of 30 April 2013 the Board of the Company consisted of the non-
executive Chairman, two executive directors and four non-executive 
directors. The profiles of the Board members are set out on pages 14 and 
15. No individual or group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision-
making process. The non-executive directors occupy, or have occupied, 
senior positions in industry. Together they constitute a valuable body of 
relevant industry experience and expertise. 
Board Diversity
The Board believes in the importance of diversity (including but not limited 
to gender) and the benefits that it can bring to the operation of an effective 
Board. The female representation on the Board constitutes 12.5%. 
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-executive directors are appointed to the Board following a formal, 
rigorous and transparent process, where appropriate, involving external 
recruitment agencies, to select individuals who have a depth of relevant 
experience, thus ensuring that the selected candidates will be capable 
of making a considerable contribution to the Board. The process for the 
appointment of Steve Crummett and Ian Nicholson is addressed on page 
46 as part of the responsibilities of the Nomination Committee.
Terms of Appointment and Time Commitment
All non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three 
years subject to satisfactory performance. After this time they may serve 
additional three-year terms following review by the Board. All non-executive 
directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the proper 
performance of their duties. Directors are expected to attend all Board 
meetings and committee meetings of which they are members and 
any additional meetings as required. Further details of their terms and 
conditions are summarised in the Remuneration Report on pages 36 to 
43 and the terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available at the Company’s Registered Office.
Induction and Professional Development
Upon joining the Board, newly appointed directors receive a tailored 
induction comprising background information on the operation and 
activities of the Group, the role of the Board and its committees and 
those matters reserved for the Board’s decision, and the latest financial 
information on the Group. During the year Messrs Cotton, Crummett 
and Nicholson each underwent a full induction programme on joining 
the Board. They were also encouraged to visit the sites at which the 
Group operates and were invited to meetings with relevant members of 
senior management. Training and development needs of directors are 
reviewed regularly. The directors are kept appraised of developments in 
legal, regulatory and financial matters affecting the Group from the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Company Secretary, the Group’s external auditors and 
advisers. 
Information and Support
Board members are provided with appropriate documentation in advance 
of each Board and committee meeting. Senior executives are invited to 
attend Board meetings periodically for the purpose of making presentations 
on their areas of responsibility. In addition to formal Board meetings, the 
Chairman and Chief Executive meet frequently and make regular contact 
with other Board members. The Board and the senior executives meet 
formally once during each financial year to discuss corporate strategy.
Independent Professional Advice
The Board has approved a procedure whereby directors may consult the 
Company’s advisers and, if necessary, take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense, although not in respect of a director’s 
personal interests. Before seeking advice, the director concerned must 
notify the Chairman, or in his absence, the Senior Independent Director. No 
such advice was sought by any director during the year.

Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
Company Secretary
Board members have access to the Company Secretary who attends all 
Board meetings. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary 
is subject to the approval of the Board. 
Board Evaluation
An evaluation of the Board is carried out each year. As for previous years, 
a Board evaluation was carried out during the year ended 30 April 2013. 
A rigorous and formal review required completion of a questionnaire 
relating to the performance of the Board and its committees and with 
regard to compliance with the Code. The evaluation focused on the 
role of the directors and the Board; the non-executives directors; the 
executive directors; Board meetings; committees of the Board; monitoring 
performance; leadership and culture; and corporate governance. 
There was general recognition that directors understood the strategy 
and objectives of the Company and that non-executive directors were 
kept adequately and timely informed of developments to allow proper 
monitoring of business performance. Recognition of the benefit from 
increased experience of the business sectors in which the Company 
operated resulted in the recruitment of Ian Nicholson as a non-executive 
director. Non-executive directors expressed a desire for more regular 
opportunities to meet with senior management. It was considered that 
the Company operated to standards of corporate governance required of 
a listed company and that the Board led by its Chairman was fully aware 
of shareholder views and provided effective leadership. The Board will 
continue to review its effectiveness in the year ahead.
Election and Re-election of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require all directors to retire and 
submit themselves for re-election at the first AGM after appointment and 
thereafter at least every three years. The Notice of Annual General Meeting 
will give details of those directors seeking re-election.
Meetings of Non-Executive Directors
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the non-executive directors meet 
informally, without the Chairman being present, principally to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance and to review his remuneration. The Chairman 
holds meetings at least annually with the non-executive directors without 
the executive directors present.
Board Committees
The Board has the three main committees listed below. The current  
terms of reference of each committee may be obtained from the 
Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
During the year members of this committee were William Jenkins 
(Chairman), Lynn Drummond who stepped down from the Committee in 
February 2013, Jim Dick until his retirement on 30 August 2012, Steve 
Crummett from his appointment in June 2012 and Ian Nicholson from 
1 March 2013. The Chairman is invited to attend all meetings, but does 
not attend any part of any meeting at which his own service contract is 
discussed. The Chief Executive attends by invitation where appropriate 
except where his own remuneration is being considered.
The Remuneration Committee is primarily responsible for determining 
the structure, components including pension rights and compensation 
payments and level of the remuneration packages of the Chairman, the 
executive directors and designated members of the senior management 
team. Details of the role of the Remuneration Committee and attendance 
of Committee members are set out on page 45. The Remuneration 
Committee met six times during this year.
Nomination Committee
Members during the year were Peter Fellner (Chairman), Chris Banks 
and Jim Dick (until their retirement on 30 August 2012), Jonathan Glenn, 
William Jenkins, Lynn Drummond and following their appointment on 13 
June 2012 Steve Crummett and Ian Nicholson.
The Nomination Committee is primarily responsible for reviewing the 
membership of the Board and identifying suitable candidates for 
appointment and reappointment as directors. In addition, the Board has 
delegated responsibility to the Nomination Committee for succession 
planning both at Board and senior management level. The inclusion of the 
Chief Executive in the membership of the Nomination Committee ensures 
that a balanced view is taken regarding the needs of the Group as a whole. 
The Committee ensures that the search for Board members is undertaken 
against objective criteria and with due regard to the benefits of diversity 
including gender. Appointments are made on merit taking into account the 
importance of maintaining a balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge. 
The Nomination Committee met independently from the Board on one 
occasion during the year with all eligible members in attendance. 
During the year, Messrs Crummett, Nicholson and Cotton joined the 
Board. The Nomination Committee identified the importance of recruiting 
individuals with relevant and recent experience to complement the existing 
skills and experience of the Board. Using the services of the Zygos 
Partnership and Spencer Stuart the Committee undertook a recruitment 
search for suitable candidates for the roles of Chief Financial Officer, Audit 
Committee chair (a non-executive director with recent and relevant financial 
experience) and a non-executive director with relevant pharma business 
experience. Neither the Zygos Partnership nor Spencer Stuart has any 
other connection with the Company.

Our Governance
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent non-executive 
directors. Members during the year have been Steve Crummett who 
succeeded Chris Banks as Chairman from Chris’ retirement on  
30 August 2012, Jim Dick (until his retirement) and Lynn Drummond. Ian 
Nicholson joined the Audit Committee on his appointment to the Board. 
Steve Crummett is the individual who the Board considers has recent and 
relevant financial experience and is a chartered accountant.
The external auditors’ lead partner and the Chief Financial Officer attend 
each meeting as requested by the Committee. 
The Audit Committee met three times during the year. The meetings were 
attended by all members. At each meeting the members of the Committee 
took the opportunity of meeting the external auditors without management 
being present.
During the year the Audit Committee discussed the following key items:
 – Risk assurance
 – Treasury
 – Accounting policies
 – Financial results and budgets
 – Engagement and review of external auditors 
 – Review of audit and non-audit services and fees
 – Review of reimbursed expenses
 – Committee Terms of Reference
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing on behalf of the Board 
the Group’s financial and reporting practices and disclosures, reviewing the 
integrity of the financial statements, the Group’s system of internal controls, 
the work of the external auditors and Group compliance with financial 
policies, laws and regulations. Audit Committee terms of reference may be 
obtained from the Company’s website.
The annual and half-yearly financial reports are reviewed by the Committee 
through a process which includes discussion with the Chief Financial 
Officer and the external auditors. The external auditors prepare reports 
to the Committee on significant accounting policies and issues and 
judgements applied in the preparation of the financial reports. The Audit 
Committee gives its recommendation to the Board concerning the 
adoption and publication of all financial reports to shareholders.
In addition to the Board, the Audit Committee has conducted its annual 
review of the system of internal controls based on a review of significant 
risks identified, internal reviews, external audits and reports from 
management.
Non-Audit Services
In accordance with its policy on non-audit services provided by the 
Company’s auditors, the Committee reviews and approves the award of 
any such work. The Audit Committee refers to the Board for approval of 
any work comprising non-audit services where the fees for such work will 
represent a significant proportion of the annual audit fee. 
During the year PwC has provided accounting and due diligence support 
for corporate development activities. Ernst & Young LLP have handled 
the Group’s tax compliance programme and audited the defined benefit 
pension scheme. Deloitte LLP have provided remuneration advice and 
valuation service in respect of Long-term Incentive Plan grants and 
KPMG LLP have provided risk assurance audit services.
Auditor Independence
The Audit Committee keeps under review the scope and results of the 
external audit work, its cost and the independence and objectivity of the 
auditors. The independent auditors operate procedures to safeguard 
against the possibility that their objectivity and independence could be 
compromised. This includes the use of quality review partners, a technical 
review board (where appropriate) and annual independence review 
procedures. The auditors are required to rotate the lead audit partner to the 
Group every five years. The Committee has considered the reappointment 
of the auditors of the Group and recommended to the Board that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be proposed for reappointment, having 
noted the scope and results of their work in relation to this year’s audit 
as well as their objectivity, effectiveness and independence. The Board 
endorsed this recommendation. 
Internal Audit
The Audit Committee has from time to time considered the need for a 
separate dedicated internal audit activity and has again concluded that in 
its opinion, given the scale and nature of the Group’s operations, this is not 
required. Instead the Group conducts appropriate internal audit activities 
through both the deployment of independent Group employees, and 
through the engagement of internal audit services from suitably qualified 
external providers. The Audit Committee keeps this under review.

Whistle-blowing
The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the internal procedures 
whereby employees can raise concerns about possible financial or other 
irregularities. The policy gives guidance on the type of matters that staff 
may wish to disclose, and a means of doing so via an independent 
organisation in the event that any staff member feels that he or she cannot 
make a disclosure via the usual management channels. 
The Group is committed to the highest standards of openness, integrity 
and accountability and the prevention of bribery and corruption. The 
Group operates a whistle-blowing policy so that employees can report 
confidentially any matter giving rise to concerns about the operation of the 
Group’s business.
Other Committees
The Executive Committee
This Committee is responsible for the executive management of the 
Group. It comprises the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Company Secretary/General Counsel, the Bespak managing director, 
and the Director of Human Resources. This Committee meets monthly to 
review and make decisions on operational matters not reserved for Board 
decisions.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for reviewing and 
prioritising the Group’s Corporate Responsibility activities, further details of 
which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility Review on pages 22 to 
25 of this report. The Committee is chaired by non-executive director Ian 
Nicholson. Other members include the Chief Executive Officer, the Bespak 
managing director and the Director of Human Resources. The Company 
Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Scientific Advisory Board
The role of the Scientific Advisory Board is to provide an expert 
independent view on the current portfolio of products and programs 
together with advice and guidance on the external environment in the 
specific therapeutic areas that Consort operates in. 
Risk Committee
The role and responsibilities of the Risk Committee are outlined under the 
section Risk Management.
Accountability
Internal Controls Review
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has received 
regular reports on areas of any significant risk and on related internal 
controls. The Board reviews the framework of internal controls annually 
and has reviewed the effectiveness of its internal systems of control as 
they have been operated within the year in accordance with the Turnbull 
Guidance (2005). This system has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and accounts. 
The review covers all material controls including financial and financial 
reporting processes, operational, compliance and risk management 
systems.
Controls over the financial reporting process and preparation of the 
consolidated accounts consist of extensive reviews by qualified and 
experienced individuals that ensure that all elements of the financial 
statements and appropriate disclosure are considered and accurately 
stated.
Risk Management
The Board accepts responsibility for determining the nature and extent of 
the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. 
There is an ongoing internal process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing significant risks faced by the Company that is regularly reviewed 
by the Risk Committee, the Executive Committee and then by the Board. 
This process has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of 
this report. 
The Risk Committee is responsible for advising the Executive Committee 
on the co-ordination and prioritisation of risk management issues 
throughout the Group and developing risk management strategy; ensuring 
that the Board’s risk policy is implemented throughout the Group through 
effective development and review of risk registers, mitigation plans and 
insurance policies and promote risk awareness at all levels.
A risk management strategy encompassing risk assessment and risk 
treatment has been adopted with the key objective to ensure that 
risk management is an integral part of the strategic and operational 
management decision making, planning and implementation process. Risk 
appetite and tolerance has been reviewed and agreed by the Board and 
will be considered annually and monitored as appropriate.

Our Governance
The Company’s strategic plan is reviewed annually at an off-site meeting 
involving the Board and the Executive Committee. An annual budget is 
prepared by each of the operating divisions of the Company and this is 
consolidated into a Group Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the 
Board.
Further information on how we manage our business risks is set out in the 
Risk section on pages 30 and 31, which contains a list of the principal 
risks and uncertainties.
Control Procedures 
Progress against budget is monitored at operating business and Group 
levels throughout the Company via monthly reporting of actual financial 
performance against budget and prior period actual results. The 
Executive Committee also reviews monthly the key measures of operating 
performance.
The Group has clear authority limits deriving from the list of matters 
reserved for decision by the Board, including capital expenditure approval 
procedures.
Financial Reporting
The directors’ responsibility for preparing the accounts is set out in the 
Directors’ Report on page 35.
Going Concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the parent 
Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future and have therefore adopted the going concern basis 
in preparing the accounts.
Remuneration
Our Remuneration Report, which describes the level and components of 
the remuneration of the directors, is set out on pages 36 to 43.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board regards relationships with shareholders as very important and it 
aims to encourage open dialogue with them through regular meetings  
with the Group’s institutional shareholders, including regular meetings 
following the announcement of the Company’s interim and annual 
results. During the year the Company held an investor day at its Bespak 
facility for key investors and analysts to allow them to develop a greater 
understanding of the business, its products and ongoing strategy. 
Meetings are also held at other times with institutional investors and other 
shareholders at their request. Shareholders may meet with any new non-
executive director if they wish. The Chairman ensures that views expressed 
at these meetings are reported to the Board as a whole. The Company’s 
brokers also attend Board meetings at the request of the Chairman to 
provide feedback on shareholder opinion.
The Senior Independent Director is available to meet with shareholders as 
required.
The Annual General Meeting
All shareholders have the opportunity of discussing the Group’s 
performance and development at the Annual General Meeting, which 
provides a forum for shareholders to raise issues with the Board. Members 
of the Remuneration, Nomination, Audit and Corporate Responsibility 
Committees will also be available at the Annual General Meeting so that 
shareholders may discuss any queries they may have.
Our previous AGM was held in Hemel Hempstead on 30 August 2012 
and the full voting results on each of the resolutions are published on 
our website. Our 2013 AGM will be held on 2 September 2013 at the 
Company’s registered office in Hemel Hempstead.

Consort Medical plc  
Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
General information
Consort Medical plc is a public limited company listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled under the laws 
of England and Wales, registered number 406711. The address of 
the registered office is given on page 102. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in the operating review on 
pages 18 to 21.
1. Presentation of the financial statements and accounting 
policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRS, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and International Accounting Standards and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (collectively referred to as IFRS) 
and related interpretations, as adopted for use in the European Union in all 
cases.
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost 
convention, as modified by certain financial assets and financial liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) at fair value. The specific accounting 
policies adopted, which have been approved by the Board and which have 
been applied consistently in all years presented, are described within this 
note.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements.
Consolidation
The financial statements include the financial statements of the Company 
and all the subsidiaries during the years reported for the periods during 
which they were members of the Consort Medical plc group (“the Group”).
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that 
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary 
acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification of a discontinued 
operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to 
be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a 
discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is presented as 
if the operation had discontinued from the start of the comparative period. 
The disposal of King Systems, as described in note 28, gives rise to a 
discontinued operation and restatement of comparatives.
Segmental reporting
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to be the 
Executive Committee. This committee is responsible for the executive 
management of the Group and comprises the Chief Executive, the Group 
Finance Director, the Corporate Development Director, the Group Director 
of Operations, the Company Secretary/General Counsel, the General 
Manager of the Group’s Bespak business and the Director of Group 
Human Resources. This committee meets monthly to make decisions on 
operational and strategic matters other than those reserved for the Board. 
The committee is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
the performance of the Group. The Group’s operating segments are 
determined with reference to the information that is supplied to the Executive 
Committee in order for it to allocate the Group’s resources and to monitor 
the performance of the Group. Historically, that information was analysed 
between the Group’s two divisions, Bespak and King Systems. Following 
the disposal of King Systems, the Executive Committee focuses on the 
operations of the Group as a whole and does not identify individual operating 
segments and, as a result, the Group has only one reportable segment.
Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements 
of the parent company and all its subsidiaries made up to 30 April 2013. 
Subsidiaries are entities which are directly or indirectly controlled by the 
Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one-half of 
the voting rights.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as 
the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of completion. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective 
of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition 
is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Costs of 
acquisition are charged to the income statement in the period in which they 
are incurred. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group undertakings are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. 
Uniform accounting policies have been adopted across the Group.
In the parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are 
accounted for at cost less provision for any impairment.
Investments
Equity investments in entities that are neither associates nor subsidiaries 
are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of Consort Medical plc’s 
entities are measured using that entity’s functional currency, which is the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is 
the parent company’s functional and presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when deferred 
in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment 
hedges.
Notes to the Accounts

The results and financial position of all Group undertakings that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency with (i) assets and liabilities for each balance 
sheet translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;  
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement translated at average 
exchange rates for the period; and (iii) all resulting exchange differences 
recognised as a component of other comprehensive income.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment 
in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments 
designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate.
The average GBP:USD exchange rate for the financial year used in the 
preparation of these financial statements was 1.60 (2012: 1.59). The 
closing exchange rate was 1.55 (2012: 1.62).
Revenue
Revenue from sales of products is recognised when the risk and rewards 
of ownership pass to the customer, and is stated net of value added tax 
and other sales taxes. The point at which risk and reward is transferred 
is usually determined from shipping terms, which vary from customer to 
customer. Revenue from sales of services is recognised in the period 
in which the related chargeable costs are incurred or when revenue is 
earned under contractual obligations. Revenue from sales of tooling and 
equipment is recognised on acceptance by the customer. Revenue is 
recognised when it is probable that economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group.
Advance payments received from customers are credited to deferred 
income and the related revenue is released to the income statement in 
accordance with the recognition criteria described above.
Post-employment benefits
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are 
generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-
administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The 
Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined 
contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient 
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in 
the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that 
is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define 
an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, 
usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service 
and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit 
pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets, together with 
adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated 
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to 
maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the 
changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in 
service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the 
past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or 
privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual 
or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once 
the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as 
employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in 
the future payments is available.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the 
grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to 
be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted:
•	including any market performance conditions (for example, an entity’s 
share price);
•	excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining 
an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
•	including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the 
requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about 
the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense is 
recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of 
the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each 
reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. 
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company may issue new shares. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs 
are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the 
employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured 
by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting 
period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a 
corresponding credit to equity.

1. Presentation of the financial statements and accounting 
policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost including any incidental 
costs of acquisition less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is 
recognised so as to write off the cost of fixed assets (less the current 
expected residual value) on a straight-line basis over their expected useful 
lives as follows:
–  Freehold buildings and leasehold buildings  
with original lease terms over 50 years 50 years
–  Leasehold buildings with original lease terms 
less than 50 years
Remaining period of 
lease
– Cleanrooms 20 years
– Building services 10 to 20 years
– Plant, equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years
Cleanrooms and building services are categorised within plant and 
equipment. Land is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds 
with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
Assets under construction
The costs of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as incurred and 
are not depreciated until such time as the assets are commissioned, when 
the total costs are transferred to the appropriate asset category.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the 
date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured 
as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount 
of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the 
acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of 
the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
or more frequently if events or circumstances require. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-
generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the 
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount 
of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period.
Internally generated intangible assets — research and development 
expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred. 
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product 
development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
 – An asset is created that can be identified;
 – It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic 
benefits; 
 – It is technically feasible that the intangible asset can be completed so 
that it will be available for use or sale and there are sufficient available 
resources to complete it; and
 – The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where a product requires regulatory approval prior to launch, it is 
presumed that there is insufficient certainty over the product’s technical 
feasibility to recognise an intangible asset prior to that approval being 
obtained.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful economic life of 
capitalised development costs is 5 to 10 years. Where no internally-
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is 
recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets, including purchased patents, know-how, 
trademarks, software licences, customer contracts and relationships and 
distribution rights are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful economic lives through operating 
expenses. The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets are as 
follows:
Computer software: 4 years
Patented and unpatented technology and know-how: 10 years
Trademarks and trade names: 10 years
Customer contracts and relationships: 5 to 10 years
Licences and distribution agreements: 2 to 11 years
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets  
excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in  
circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any  
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in  
order to determine the extent of impairment loss. Where it is not possible  
to identify separate cash flows relating to individual assets, Consort  
Medical plc estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating  
unit to which it belongs.
Leasing commitments
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership 
are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rentals 
payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the 
benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as finance leases,

as if the asset had been purchased outright. Assets held under finance 
leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, 
at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined 
at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor 
is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of 
the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. 
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost comprises the direct cost of production and the 
attributable portion of overheads based on normal operating capacity 
appropriate to location and condition. Cost is determined on a first in, first 
out basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution. Provision is made if necessary for any slow-moving, 
obsolete or defective stock. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
In the consolidated and Company statements of cash flows, cash and 
cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, 
other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three 
months or less, and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated and Company 
balance sheets, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities.
Finance income and costs
Interest receivable and payable on bank deposits and borrowings is 
credited or charged to finance income and expenses as it falls due. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Where there is an expectation that some or all of a provision 
will be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the 
reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision 
is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the 
effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other 
finance expenses.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an obligation will 
only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation 
cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not 
recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is 
probable.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
held at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables 
is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently held 
at amortised cost.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value, net 
of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on 
an accruals basis to the income statement and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as 
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or 
all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until 
drawdown occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as 
a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the 
facility to which it relates.
Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which 
they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are 
recorded in the period in which they are approved and paid.
Taxation
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as 
adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in full using the balance sheet liability 
method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
except in respect of investments in subsidiaries where Consort Medical plc 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet 
date on the same basis.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. It is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement except when it relates to items credited or 
charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or 
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances 
on a net basis.

1. Presentation of the financial statements and accounting 
policies continued
Share capital, share premium and share issue costs
Share issue costs are incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of 
new shares or options and are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the 
proceeds. Any excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of any 
shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital 
(treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled 
or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, 
any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market 
risks from treasury operations. The principal derivative instruments used by 
the Group are interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for 
trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet 
at cost and then re-measured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value. 
Hedging derivatives are classified on inception as fair value hedges, cash 
flow hedges or net investment hedges. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
are recognised in equity. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the 
income statement in line with the hedged forecast transaction.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement  
in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when 
the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to 
the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings 
is recognised in the income statement within “revenue”. However, when 
the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-
financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses 
previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in 
the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts 
are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of inventory 
or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets. When a hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains 
in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in 
equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for as cash 
flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described 
in this note, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are 
not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in 
the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
Judgements
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the directors have 
made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements.
A Impairment of goodwill 
The Group tests, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment in accordance with the accounting policy above. The 
recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The 
use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the 
choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value 
of these cash flows. Actual outcomes could vary. The value in use of The 
Medical House cash-generating unit, which is part of the Bespak segment, 
is dependent upon the successful launch of injectable products by the 
Group’s customers. Whilst management’s view, based on the facts at the 
date of signing these financial statements, is that these products will be 
launched successfully within a reasonable timescale, the product launches 
are largely outside of the Group’s control and subject to approval by 
regulatory bodies, and so there remains a risk that future cash inflows will 
be less than forecast in the value in use calculations.
B Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements.
C Development costs
In assessing whether development costs meet the recognition criteria for 
internally generated intangible assets, which are described elsewhere in 
this note, the directors make certain critical judgements as to the technical 
feasibility and commercial viability of the related product, and around the 
likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval. 
D Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Significant 
judgement is required in determining the Group provision for income 
taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate 
tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax 
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially 
recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax 
provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

Consort Medical plc  consortmedical.com  
Stock Code: CSRT
E Provisions and related assets
In determining whether to recognise a provision in respect of a potential 
liability, management assesses the likelihood of the liability being payable. 
This assessment includes a review of the specific facts by suitably 
qualified and experienced Group personnel, experience of similar matters 
and communications with potential counterparties and the Group’s legal 
advisers. Where the matter leading to a provision may be covered by 
the Group’s insurance policies, management consults with the Group’s 
insurers, loss adjustors and legal advisers to determine whether the 
success of any insurance claim is “virtually certain”, which is the threshold 
used by the Group in the recognition of any insurance asset.
Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
A Post-employment benefits 
The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit obligation of the 
Group’s defined benefit pension schemes depends on the selection of 
certain assumptions which include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary 
growth, mortality and expected return on scheme assets. Differences 
arising from actual experiences or future changes in assumptions will be 
reflected in subsequent periods. See note 21 for further details.
B Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable 
amount is determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the 
basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
C Provisions and related assets
In determining the amount to recognise for any provision or related asset, 
management consults with suitably qualified and experienced Group 
personnel, considers the Group’s experience of similar matters and 
communications with potential counterparties and the Group’s legal advisers. 
D Contingent consideration
The value of contingent consideration on the disposal of King Systems 
depends upon the performance of that business following its disposal. 
Actual performance could vary from forecast.
Special items and other non-GAAP performance measures
The directors believe that the “adjusted” profit and earnings per share 
measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the 
underlying performance of the business. These measures are consistent 
with how business performance is measured internally. The adjusted profit 
before tax measure is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and 
may not be directly comparable with “adjusted” profit measures used by 
other companies. 
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax are to exclude the 
following special items:
•	Employee severance costs;
•	Plant restructuring and impairment of related property, plant and equipment;
•	Acquisition-related expenses;
•	Accelerated amortisation of upfront loan arrangement fees; and
•	Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets.
Further detail on the special items in the period can be found in note 6.
The directors also refer to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) as a performance indicator. EBITDA also 
adds back any profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment.
Adoption of new and revised standards
No new standards or amendments to standards have had a material 
impact on the Group in the current financial year.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following 
Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases 
have not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in other Entities
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IAS 1 (amended)
Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive 
Income
IAS 12 (amended) Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets
IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits
IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
Amendments to IFRS7 
and IAS 32
Financial Instruments on Asset and Liability 
offsetting
IFRIC 20
Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a 
Surface Mine
Annual improvements 2011
The adoption of IFRS 9 which the Group plans to adopt for the year 
beginning on 1 May 2015 will impact both the measurement and 
disclosures of Financial Instruments. The directors do not expect that the 
adoption of the other standards listed above will have a material impact on 
the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
The Group will adopt the revised version of IAS 19 for the year beginning 
on 1 May 2013. If this revised standard were adopted for the financial 
year ended 30 April 2013, the IAS 19 charge recognised in the income 
statement would increase by £0.3m.
Parent company financial statements
The financial statements of the parent company, Consort Medical plc, 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the 
European Union in all cases. On publishing the parent company financial 
statements together with the Group financial statements, the Company is 
taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not 
to present its individual income statement or statement of comprehensive 
income and related notes that form a part of these approved financial 
statements.

* Restated (see note 1).
Employee severance costs are in respect of the restructuring of UK operations.
Plant restructuring and recall costs include a charge for an onerous property lease.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets represents the charge for other intangible assets acquired with The Medical House in 2009.
Acquisition-related expenses are diligence costs incurred in investigating potential investment opportunities.
The special tax item is in respect of a one off tax charge arising due to the re-opening of the site at Milton Keynes which changes the tax basis of the 
valuation of the industrial buildings requiring the recognition of a deferred tax liability.
In the prior year, plant restructuring and recall costs included a credit for an onerous property lease and reversal of a fixed asset impairment in the Bespak 
division. The amortisation of upfront loan arrangement fees incurred during the Group’s refinancing in 2010 was accelerated following the refinancing of 
the loans in June 2012.

Factors affecting future tax charge
In June 2012, the UK Government enacted the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013. Further rate 
reductions to 21% from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015 have also been announced but are not yet substantively enacted. Therefore, the 
UK deferred tax assets and liabilities included within these financial statements have been provided at a rate of 23%. The forecast effect of the further 
proposed reductions in rate by 2015 would be to decrease the net deferred tax liability by approximately £0.3m.
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of £27,313,000 (2012: £28,713,000) that are available for offset against future chargeable gains in 
the UK group. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not reasonably foreseeable that these will be utilised.
Deferred tax assets of £1,783,000 (2012: £1,860,000) in respect of tax losses carried forward have not been recognised due to insufficient certainty 
over their recoverability. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less 
than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and contingently issuable shares under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The carrying value of goodwill, translated at year-end exchange rates, is made up of balances arising on acquisition of the following businesses, which 
comprise individual cash-generating units:
2013
£000
2012
£000
The Medical House plc 15,800 15,800
King Systems Corporation – 43,793
15,800 59,593
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. Value in use calculations are utilised to calculate recoverable amount. Value in use is 
calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the cash generating unit in which the goodwill is contained.  
The discount rate applied comprises the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country-specific risks and is calculated at 11% 
(2012: between 9% and 11%). This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount to pre-tax cash flows.
The value in use calculation for the Medical House was prepared and approved by the Board based upon the first five years of the Group’s strategic 
plan, which takes into account both past performance and expectations for future market development. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated 
using an annual growth rate of 2%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the sectors in which this cash generating unit operates. 
The assumptions include successful product launches for existing customers in 2013 and revenues from as yet unidentified customers from 2016. 
Cancellation or significant postponement of those launches would lead to an impairment of goodwill. The directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable 
changes to other key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill carried for the 
Medical House and the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
Critical judgements around goodwill impairment are disclosed in note 1.

The Group operates pension schemes in the UK to provide pensions to retired employees. UK pension benefits are provided by a defined benefit 
scheme, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service, and by defined contribution schemes, 
whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee. The defined benefit 
scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 30 June 2002.
Increases to pensions in payment and in deferment in respect of future service are capped at 2.5% per annum. The members’ share of the cost of the 
Scheme is 8% of pensionable salaries and is generally paid via a “salary sacrifice” arrangement. Under this arrangement the Group meets the full cost 
of accrual, but members receive a reduction in their salary equal to their share of the cost of the Scheme. Members have the right to opt out of this 
arrangement if they wish to receive their full salary and contribute to the Scheme, in which case the Group’s contributions to the Scheme are reduced. 
Contributions to defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of an independent, professionally qualified actuary. Pension 
costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, using the projected 
unit method. Liabilities are assessed annually in accordance with the advice of an independent actuary. Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the 
Group’s defined benefit scheme are undertaken, normally every three years.
The following information relates to the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme, the Bespak plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme (“the Scheme”).
The Group also operated a smaller defined contribution scheme in the USA which was disposed of during the year (see note 28). The pension cost 
associated with this scheme of £41,000 (2012: £33,000) has been reported within discontinued operations.

Contributions
Under the Schedule of Contributions agreed with the Scheme’s trustees in place at the time this disclosure was prepared, the Group expects to 
contribute approximately £1.0m to the defined benefit scheme in the 2014 financial year.
Explanation of the relationship between Consort Medical plc and the trustees of the Scheme
The Scheme assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees. The trustees of 
the Scheme are required to act in the best interests of the Scheme’s beneficiaries. The appointment of trustees to the Scheme is set out under Rule A16 
of the Scheme’s trust deed and rules dated 14 March 1997. The Scheme has a policy that one-third of all trustees should be nominated by members of 
the Scheme.
Disclosure of principal assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted at the balance sheet date were:
2013 2012
Discount rate 4.3% p.a. 5.0% p.a.
Future RPI inflation 3.3% p.a. 3.2% p.a.
Future CPI inflation 2.3% p.a. 2.2% p.a.
Future salary increases 3.8% p.a. 3.7% p.a.
Rate of pension increases
RPI inflation capped at 5% p.a. 3.2% p.a. 3.1% p.a.
RPI inflation capped at 5% p.a. with a minimum of 3% p.a. 3.6% p.a. 3.5% p.a.
RPI inflation capped at 2.5% p.a. 2.2% p.a. 2.2% p.a.
CPI inflation capped at 3.0% p.a. 2.1% p.a. 2.1% p.a.
Expected return on plan assets 4.8% p.a. 5.4% p.a.
The IAS 19 accounting standard “Employee benefits” requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to market yields at the balance 
sheet date on high quality fixed income investments. The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the 
post-employment obligations.
The discount rate has been developed from a spot yield curve based on UK Government bonds, adjusted to reflect the credit spread between AA-rated 
corporate bonds and Government bonds.
The expected rate of inflation is an important building block for the salary growth and pension increase assumption. A rate of inflation is “implied” by the 
difference between the yields on fixed-interest and index-linked Government bonds.

21. Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued
For the majority of members, pension accrued before 6 April 1997 does not receive any guaranteed increases and it is assumed that no discretionary 
increases will be awarded. Pension accrued between 6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 receives increases in line with inflation subject to a maximum of  
5% per annum (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 3.2% per annum). Some members receive fixed increases of 3% per annum 
on pension accrued before 6 April 1997 and increases in line with inflation subject to a minimum of 3% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum 
on pension accrued between 6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 3.6% per annum). For all 
members, pension accrued after 1 May 2009 receives increases in line with inflation subject to a maximum of 2.5% per annum (for which the Company 
has assumed future increases will be 2.2% per annum).
One of the key assumptions made in valuing the pension scheme’s liabilities are the mortality rates used to assess how long pensions will be paid for. The 
mortality rates used to calculate the Scheme’s liabilities were updated as part of the Scheme’s actuarial valuation in 2008 to reflect the results of surveys 
that have highlighted that people are living longer. The mortality rates now used in calculating the Scheme’s liabilities are based on data collected between 
1991 and 1994, but allow for the accelerated improvements in longevity witnessed since that time and also allow for these accelerated improvements 
to continue in the future with a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1% per annum. These mortality tables are referred to as 110% of the PA92 long 
cohort tables with a 1% per annum underpin.
The current life expectancies (in years) underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the Scheme are:
2013 2012
Life expectancy at age 65 Male Female Male Female
Member currently aged 65 23.6 25.9 23.5 25.7
Member currently aged 45 25.9 28.2 25.7 28.1
The overall expected return on assets has been calculated as the weighted average of the expected return for the principal asset categories, net of 
investment expenses, held by the plan as follows:
2013 2012
Asset category Weighting Expected return Weighting Expected return
Gilts 16% 2.6% 16% 3.4%
Corporate bonds 26% 4.0% 27% 4.7%
Equities 49% 6.0% 47% 6.4%
Hedge funds 9% 5.0% 10% 5.4%
Cash 0% 0.0% 0% 0.0%
Overall 100% 4.8% 100% 5.4%
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure Scheme liabilities
The sensitivity of the Scheme’s liabilities to changes in the principal assumptions used to measure these liabilities is illustrated below. The illustrations 
consider the single change shown with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged. In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied 
by offsetting changes in another assumption (this is not always the case).
The Group liability is the difference between the Scheme liabilities and the Scheme assets. Certain changes in the assumptions will be as a result of 
changes in market yields. Where this is the case, the market value of Scheme assets may change simultaneously, which may or may not offset the 
change in assumptions. For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the Scheme liability, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value 
of assets so that the net effect on the Group liability is reduced.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on Scheme’s accrued liabilities
Discount rate Decrease by 0.25% p.a. Increase by 6.8%
Rate of inflation and salary increase Decrease by 0.25% p.a. Decrease by 7.1%
Rate of inflation and salary increase Increase by 0.25% p.a. Increase by 7.7%
Rate of mortality Members assumed to live one year longer Increase by 2.1%

How the liabilities arising from the Scheme are measured
The Group provides retirement benefits via the Scheme to some of its former employees and approximately 30% of current UK employees. The level of 
retirement benefit is principally based on salary earned in the final three years of employment and period of service as a Scheme member.
The projected liabilities of the Scheme are apportioned between members’ past and future service using the projected unit actuarial cost method. The 
deficit in the consolidated balance sheet is the difference between the projected liability allocated to past service (the defined benefit obligation) and the 
market value of the assets of the Scheme. The defined benefit obligation makes allowance for future earnings growth. If all active members were assumed 
to leave the Group and the allowance for future earnings growth was replaced by an allowance for statutory revaluation, the liabilities would reduce by 
approximately £5.2m.
An alternative measure of liability is the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer. This amount represents the amount 
that would be required to settle the Scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the 
Scheme. The latest estimate of the amount required to settle the Scheme’s liabilities was calculated at 30 April 2011. This indicated that the amount 
required was £43.9m in excess of the assets held by the Scheme.
Future funding obligations in relation to the Scheme
The trustees have selected a funding target based on the Scheme being closed to new members but with active members continuing to accrue benefits. 
The agreed funding objective is to reach, and then maintain, assets equal to 100% of the value of the projected past service liabilities, assessed on an 
ongoing basis, allowing for future salary increases for active members.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by an independent actuary for the trustees of the Scheme and 
was carried out as at 30 April 2011. Following the valuation and changes to the Scheme’s benefits for future service the trustees agreed that the Group 
could cease paying deficit reduction contributions of £238,000 per month.
.
Nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments held by the Scheme
The expected return on the Scheme’s assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the financial period for returns over the life of the 
related obligation. The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value. Some of these bond 
investments are issued by the UK Government and the risk of default on these is very small. The trustees also hold bond investments issued by public 
companies. There is a more significant risk of default on these which is assessed by various rating agencies. The trustees also have a substantial holding 
of equity and hedge fund investments, with a target of 60% of the Scheme’s assets being invested in these funds. The investment return related to 
these is variable, and they are generally considered much “riskier” investments. It is generally accepted that the yield on these investments will contain a 
premium (“the equity risk premium”) to compensate investors for the additional risk of holding this type of investment. There is significant uncertainty about 
the likely size of this risk premium.
The majority of the equities held by the Scheme are in international blue chip entities. The aim is to hold a globally diversified portfolio of equities, with a 
target of 22% of equities being held in the UK, 27% in the rest of Europe, 20% in North American equities, 10% in each of Japanese and Pacific Basin 
equities and 11% in emerging markets.
As part of the investment strategy review, the trustees, in conjunction with the Group, have carried out an asset-liability review for the Scheme. These 
studies are used to assist the trustees and the Group in determining the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within 
the Scheme. The results of the study are used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a 
significant increase in the Scheme’s deficit by providing information used to determine the pension scheme’s investment strategy.

On 1 June 2012, the Group cancelled its GBP term loan and revolving credit facilities. On the same day, the Group signed a $56m multicurrency 
revolving facility and a £40m multicurrency revolving facility. Under the terms of the refinancing, the Group also has a £25m “accordian” facility, by which 
further facilities may be made available by RBS and HSBC under the current terms to support significant investment or acquisition opportunities which 
may arise. The new facilities expire in November 2016 and have interest and covenant terms similar to the cancelled facilities.
In February 2013 Group borrowings of £47.1m were repaid using the funds obtained from the disposal of King Systems (see note 28). At the same time 
the Group’s interest rate swap instruments were cancelled because the Group no longer had floating rate interest payable. These comprised:-
•	two three-year interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $40m commencing in January 2011. Under the terms of the swaps the Company 
received interest on a variable rate basis and paid interest fixed at 1.483%, plus bank margin;
•	an interest rate swap on $7.5m commencing on 28 April 2011 and expiring on 31 January 2014. Under the terms of the swap the Company received 
interest on a variable rate basis and paid interest fixed at 1.5275%, plus bank margin;
•	an amortising interest rate swap for £10m commencing on 28 April 2011 and expiring on 31 October 2013. Under the terms of the swap the Company 
received interest on a variable rate basis and paid interest fixed at 1.775%, plus bank margin.
All borrowings and loan facilities are unsecured. The bank loans and overdrafts are subject to cross-guarantees between Group undertakings. 
Interest on the multicurrency revolving credit facility is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.00% and 3.00%, depending upon the ratio of net 
debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and on UK overdrafts at 1.75% above UK base rate.

The Group purchases its own shares using an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) to satisfy entitlements under the Group’s Long-Term Incentive 
Plan. The cost of the shares held by the ESOT is deducted from retained earnings. The ESOT is financed by a repayable-on-demand loan from the 
Company of £3,472,000 (2012: £2,472,000). As at 30 April 2013 the ESOT held a total of 511,378 ordinary shares (2012: 419,564 shares) at a cost of 
£2,829,502 (2012: £1,998,716) and market value of £4,091,024 (2012: £2,781,709).

26. Financial instruments and related disclosures continued
External borrowings are managed centrally by Group Finance and comprise a combination of long and short-term finance.
Consort Medical plc does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and the Group’s Treasury policies specifically 
prohibit such activity. All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders and to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, 
issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Selling margins are sufficient to cover normal operating costs and the Group’s operating subsidiaries are cash-generative. None of the entities in the 
Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in new product development as well as to 
make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as 
borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as total equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash or plus net 
debt.
As at 30 April 2013, the Group is in a net cash position following the settlement of debt on completion of the disposal of King Systems (see note 28).
The gearing ratios at 30 April 2013 and 30 April 2012 were as follows:
2013
£000
2012
£000
Total borrowings 2 52,338
Less: cash and cash equivalents (36,966) (14,685)
Net (cash)/debt (36,964) 37,653
Total equity 103,755 90,283
Total capital 66,781 127,936
Gearing ratio N/A 29%
The Group has historically monitored two widely used ratios to measure the ability to service debt, being net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover. 
These measures were ahead of target throughout 2013.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The table entitled ‘Fair value of financial assets and liabilities’ presents the carrying amount and the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities 
under IFRS. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where market values are not available, fair values are determined 
using the prevailing interest and exchange rates. 
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Forward exchange contracts — based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date;
Interest rate swaps — based on the market values at the balance sheet date;
Contingent consideration — the discounted value of anticipated future receipts. 
The fair value of other assets and liabilities approximates to the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet.
Fair value and cash flow hedging activities
All derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. Gains and losses are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement unless they are designated as hedging instruments and tested to be effective under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments — 
Recognition and measurement’, in which case the element of gains and losses that fulfil the hedge effectiveness criteria are taken directly to equity.
Consort Medical plc’s hedging strategy is unchanged in respect of covering the transactional risk of foreign currency sales and purchases and hedging 
the net investment position of foreign subsidiaries.

26. Financial instruments and related disclosures continued
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk, against which, in the past, the Group has sought to 
protect itself through interest rate swaps. As the Group is currently in a net cash position, no interest rate swaps are now held.
Foreign exchange risk management
The Group’s principal currency exposure is movement between Sterling and the US dollar.
Transactional exposure 
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge transactional currency exposures. As a result there were no material net monetary assets or liabilities 
in foreign currencies, having taken into account the effect of forward exchange currency contracts that have been used to match foreign currency 
exposures. 
The Group hedges a proportion of forecast foreign currency transaction exposure generally extending up to 12 months. At 30 April 2013, the Group 
held forward contracts to hedge the equivalent of £2.4m of forecast foreign currency transaction exposures (2012: £3.2m). The fair value of the forward 
exchange contracts was a liability of £55,000 at 30 April 2013 (2012: asset £95,000). The Group currently does not designate these forward contracts 
as cash flow hedges and so gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
The primary exposures in the UK business are transactions denominated in the USD and the Euro. A 10% decline in Sterling against the USD and the 
Euro (which is considered reasonably possible) would increase operating profit and equity by £0.2m (2012: £0.3m). A 10% increase in the value of 
Sterling (which is considered reasonably possible) would have a similar but opposite effect.
Translational exposure
The income statement of the Group’s US business is converted into Sterling each month for reporting purposes at the average exchange rate throughout 
the year. Consequently, there is a translational exposure arising from movements in the Sterling/USD exchange rate. The Group does not hedge this 
translation exposure.
At 30 April 2012 the Group had a borrowing of $59m (£36.3m) which was designated as a hedge of the Group’s net investments in the United States. 
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing were transferred to equity to offset gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the 
subsidiaries. The borrowing was repaid following the disposal of King Systems. In the year ended 30 April 2013 there was a gain of £1.8m taken to equity 
on retranslation of the Group’s net investment in its US business (2012: gain of £1.0m).
A decline of 10% in the value of Sterling at the year end would increase the value of the Group’s net assets and equity by £1.5m (2012: increase of 
£4.6m). A 10% increase in the value of Sterling would have a similar but opposite effect.
Committed facilities 
As explained in note 23, the Group has committed facilities available at floating rates which expire in November 2016 and an overdraft facility that expires 
within one year.
Market risk of financial assets
The Group invests centrally managed liquid assets in short-term investments with banks at floating interest rates. These investments are classified as cash 
and cash equivalents.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk in respect of its major customers such that, if one or more of them is affected by financial difficulty, 
it could materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial results. However, the Group generally does not expect its customers to fail to meet their 
obligations.
The Group does not believe that it is exposed to major concentrations of credit risk on other classes of financial instruments. The Group is exposed to 
credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet 
their obligations.
The Group applies Board-approved limits to the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and employs strict minimum creditworthiness criteria 
as to the choice of counterparty. The Group takes out credit insurance cover against the majority of export sales.

Liquidity risk 
The Group operates internationally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades. Selling margins are 
sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and the Group’s main operating subsidiaries are cash-generative.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, 
dividends and repayment of maturing debt. The Group may, from time to time, have additional demands for finance, such as acquisitions. 
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
The following table sets out the classification of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. Receivables and payables have been included to the extent that 
they are classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation. Provisions have been included where 
there is a contractual obligation to settle in cash.

classified as Level 2, provided all significant inputs to the valuation model are based on observable market data. In other cases the instrument is classified 
as Level 3. The Company has no financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss.

Under the terms of the disposal of King Systems, completed on 15 February 2013, the purchaser, Ambu A/S, is due to pay amounts of consideration 
contingent upon the performance of King following disposal. This comprises:
•	a milestone payment of US$10m upon completion of the first commercial sale of a video laryngoscope currently under development by King with a 
reusable display and an adaptor containing reusable optics and a disposable blade;
•	payments with a potential maximum value of US$40m related to the sales of King Vision products for the three years ending 30 April 2016. 
In arriving at the fair value of contingent consideration, the directors have assessed the amounts of contingent consideration expected to arise together 
with the anticipated timing of collection by Consort. They have taken account of a statement made on 2 May 2013 by Ambu A/S that the first commercial 
sale of the video laryngoscope is expected by the end of Ambu’s current financial year, being 30 September 2013. The projected amounts receivable 
have been discounted with reference to the cost of capital in Ambu and therefore the risk of a receivable value from it. The dollar amount receivable is 
converted to sterling at spot exchange rates.
As at the date of disposal of King, the fair value of contingent consideration is valued at £11,490,000. As at 30 April 2013 this value is £11,676,000, with 
an increase of £199,000 as a result of the unwinding of discounting with the passage of time and with a reduction of £13,000 as a result of exchange.

27. Employee share schemes
Share options
The Group operates share award schemes whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares in Consort Medical plc at no cost, subject  
to the achievement by the Group of certain specified performance targets. It also offers savings-related share option schemes. Since the introduction of 
the 2005 LTIP scheme no further awards have been made under any Executive Share Option Scheme. In August 2011 and October 2011 awards were 
made under a new Company Share Option Scheme.
Grants of share options are normally exercisable at the end of the three-year vesting/performance period. Grants under savings-related share option 
schemes are normally exercisable after three years’ saving. Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years 
from the date of grant. Options under the share option schemes are normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant. The majority of 
options under the savings-related share option schemes are now granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In June 2012, share options were granted under the new Company Share Option Scheme in tandem with grants under the LTIP . Further details are 
provided below.
Share options awarded to the directors are subject to performance criteria as laid out in the Remuneration Report.

Option pricing
For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the stock-based compensation charge, the Black–Scholes option pricing model has been used. The 
assumptions used in the model are as follows:
SAYE
scheme
2013
Risk-free interest rate 0.3%
Dividend yield 2.7%
Volatility 22.8%
Expected lives of options granted under:
Savings-related share option schemes 3 years
Weighted average share price for grants in the year:
Savings-related share option schemes — market and option price 702p
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk-free 
rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Performance Share Plan (LTIP)
The Group operates a Performance Share Plan whereby awards are granted to directors and senior management at no cost. The percentage of each 
award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a three-year measurement period.

27. Employee share schemes continued
Awards granted in the year were made in the form of an award of performance shares, and a linked CSOS option. The cumulative economic effect of 
these awards for both participants and the Company is identical to that for performance shares, and as such the fair value of these awards has been 
calculated on this aggregate basis.
During the year awards under the LTIP were granted to a number of employees. The fair value per share under award at grant has been calculated using a 
Monte Carlo share pricing model. The assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
19 June 2012 25 June 2012
Share price at grant date 635p 678p
Shares under option 356,784 40,581

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of Consort Medical plc

Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and the related

been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the parent Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 35, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about  
the amounts and disclosures in the financial  
statements sufficient to give reasonable  
assurance that the financial statements are  
free from material misstatement, whether  
caused by fraud or error. This includes an  
assessment of: whether the accounting  
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and  
the parent company’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the Consort 
Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 
to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
•	the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent Company’s affairs as at 30 April 2013 
and of the Group’s profit and Group’s and 
parent Company’s cash flows for the year then 
ended; 
•	the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; 
•	the parent Company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and
•	the financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the lAS 
Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
 
•	the part of the Remuneration Committee 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
•	the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•	adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
•	the parent Company financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
•	certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
•	we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review: 
•	the directors’ statement, set out on page 49, in 
relation to going concern; 
•	the parts of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our 
review; and

by the Board on directors’ remuneration.

(a)  The maintenance and integrity of the

and, accordingly, the auditors accept no 
responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements since 
they were initially presented on the website.
(b)  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

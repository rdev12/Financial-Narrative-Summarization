We expected the office supplies market to show some improvement in 2013 as the UK
economy came out of recession and that this would benefit our Managed Procurement activity.
During the first half of 2013, however, it became clear that the market was not improving.
Customers’ buying habits have also changed over the last two years, with a focus on lower cost
products, buying little and often and other changes targeted at reducing their direct costs.
The Board expects this to be a permanent shift in buying behaviour.  This has increased our
cost to serve and impacted our net margins, though our Managed Procurement activity
continued to out-perform the market which declined by 9% year on year. It remains the larger
part of the Group, accounting for 63.5% of Group revenue and 52.8% of Group EBITA before
central costs. 
By contrast our Business Critical Services activities operate in growing segments of the
market.  Banner Managed Communication, the largest of these activities, saw a general
recovery in marketing budgets in its segment, with increased spend towards the end of 2013
on digital channels in particular.  Business Critical Services now represent some 36.5% of
Group revenue and 47.2% of Group EBITA before central costs.   
Our underlying profit before tax for 2013 was £4.2m. For reasons detailed in the Strategic
Report and Significant Accounting Policies, we are making prior year adjustments that restate
2012’s underlying profit before tax from £6.5m to £4.2m. This flattening of Group
performance over a two year period does no more than confirm the urgency of the need for the
recovery programme we started in the second half of 2013.  
We significantly reduced net debt in 2013 by £7.2m to £21.8m at 31 December 2013 (2012:
£29.0m), owing to an increase in operating cash flow to £13.0m (2012: £6.5m).
These results are reported in more detail in the Chief Executive’s Review and the Strategic
Report which follow. 
Chairman’s Statement  
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 2 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 3
Dividend
At the half year, we advised shareholders that we could not
recommend an interim dividend.  This was a particular
disappointment as we had shareholders who had been loyal to
us since we listed in 2004.   
The Board remains of the view that, in current circumstances,
investing free cash in our recovery programme and where
possible in strengthening our Business Critical Services, is in
the best long term interest of shareholders.  We, therefore, do
not recommend a final dividend for 2013 and do not expect
to re-instate the dividend during 2014.  
Chairman
As reported in November 2013, David Callear decided to
stand down as Chairman because of his wife’s terminal illness.
David has been with the business since before it listed, has
made a significant contribution to it, remains very committed
to it and is familiar with the industry so we are grateful that
he has felt able to continue as a non-executive Director. 
Outlook
Trading to date is satisfactory, it is in line with expectations
and our operating costs are reducing.  However, we are
concerned that the office supplies market as a whole will not
improve in 2014, so we remain of the view that underlying
profit in 2014 is likely to fall short of 2013.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM will be held at the Company’s head office, St
Crispins, Duke Street, Norwich on 29 May 2014 at 11.00 am.
Notice of the AGM will be circulated separately, together with
the proxy forms, for use at the AGM.

Strategy and change 
We believe our market strategy remains sound.   Business
Critical Services has performed satisfactorily since we
committed to diversification in 2008 and we are focused on
growing it organically to become the larger part of the Group.
Managed Procurement’s task is to retain its position in the
contract office supplies market, protecting margin as it does
so and, whenever possible, building further profitable market
share, which it has shown can still be done. We have a
satisfactory pipeline of sales opportunities across the Group.  
The changes we have to make, which we started in the second
half of 2013, re-model the way we support our markets and
we need to use our free cash flow to do this. Re-modelling will
also enable us to re-finance the Group in advance of our
current term loans, which currently stand at £12.5m,
maturing in June 2015.  We are working closely with our bank,
The Royal Bank of Scotland, in this regard.
Our programme to reduce overheads, both centrally and in our
operating activities, will run through much of 2014.  The next
step is to change the way we handle the logistics side of our
business to give us a platform that fits the changed office
supplies market and takes into consideration the fact that the
leases on our three main sites are due for renewal this year.
We shall shortly complete our review of the options for
implementation during the rest of 2014.  The recovery
programme should reach its full annualised rate of benefit
from early 2015.    
In short, our focus is on doing all we can to improve
performance and strengthen the business.

Results: performance
Group revenue was some 2% up year on year at £231.9m
(2012: £227.0m).  Underlying profit before tax at £4.2m was
similar to 2012 (£4.2m restated), with underlying earnings
per share at 8.7p as against 2012’s 8.5p.
Results: cash/net debt
Group net debt at 31 December 2013 was £21.8m, a
reduction of £7.2m on 2012, reflecting a similar reduction in
the level of average daily net debt throughout the period.
These reductions reflect a number of measures: the lower
dividend payment of £1.3m (2012: £4.1m); lower exceptional
costs with the Group’s 2013 restructuring programme
starting in the second half; and operational improvements, in
particular a focus on overdue debtors and on stock, which was
significantly reduced over the year while maintaining product
availability. The focus on cash generation and reducing debt
remain key management imperatives.    
Managed Procurement
Our Managed Procurement activity encompasses both our
contract business, Banner Business Services, which services
large corporate and public sector customers, and Truline,
which services the independent dealer channel through our
contract with the Advantia group. In 2013 revenue was flat
year on year at £147.3m, representing 63.5% of Group
revenue (2012: £147.5m) and 52.8% of Group EBITA before
central costs (2012: 62.3%).
Banner Business Services (BBS)
BBS revenues increased slightly year on year, markedly
outperforming the overall office products market, which is
calculated to have declined by 9%.  This outperformance was
aided by the new contract with The Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS) and the retention of existing business with the NHS,
although profitability was affected by the mix of business and
continuing pressure on gross margins.  We implemented the
RBS contract in February 2013 with no loss of service to the
customer.  The contract has traded in line with expectations
from the start and we have become one of RBS’s preferred
suppliers.
In the latter part of the year, we were formally notified of an
extension to our Government Office Supplies Contract
(GOSC) for a minimum of 6 months as well as an extension to
the wider public sector supply framework for 12 months.
Throughout the year we continued to secure new business,
using the BBS “Managed Procurement Model” as a core part
of our offering.  The model is an open-book approach, allowing
the customer visibility of the product net margin earned by
BBS, after taking into consideration all costs to service the
contract.  The customer can assess the cost to serve and can
change ordering patterns to manage his costs.  
Truline
Truline maintained a consistently high service level to the
Advantia dealer network; new dealers have since signed up
and the pipeline is looking strong for 2014.  In an industry
sector where service levels are often compromised, our last
mile delivery service is proving to be a significant competitive
advantage. 
T aken together, our Managed Procurement activity remains a
substantial business and a leader in the office products
market.  We have confidence that the changes to optimise our
operations as mentioned in the Chairman’s Statement will
underpin future profitability. 
Business Critical Services
Revenues in Business Critical Services grew 6% year on year,
as the full year impact of contract wins in 2012 came through
in 2013.  In 2013, revenue was £84.6m which represented
36.5% of the total Group revenue (2012: £79.5m and
35.0%) and 47.2% of Group EBITA before central costs
(2012: 37.7%).
Banner Managed Communication (BMC)
BMC is the largest business in the Business Critical activities
of the Group.  It has grown substantially over recent years,
has invested in infrastructure, and has market opportunities
Chief Executive’s Review 
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 4 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 5
to grow further organically, while enhancing its profitability.
In 2013, with revenues of £79.2m (2012: £75.7m)  it
retained all its major contracts and won and launched
important new accounts which will benefit 2014 including
Care UK, Bourne Leisure and Harvey & Thompson Group.
The provision of marketing services continues to grow, with a
general recovery in budgets and an increased spend on digital
marketing channels in particular towards the end of 2013.
We are also seeing a continuing trend to outsource to
companies which are best placed to provide a professional
and targeted service.  In 2013, BMC was voted amongst the
top 100 outsourcing firms globally in an IAOP poll, reflecting
its success in executing multichannel marketing campaigns
for its clients.
BMC’s ability to measure accurately the return on client
marketing investment has helped its clients focus their spend
and, together with its increased sales in technical applications
to support their marketing communications, meant that some
15% of revenue in 2013 derived from services other than
traditional print management.  
BMC was also, for the first time, asked to act for an
established client in the USA, an exciting marketplace with
clear potential for further growth.  In 2014, we hope to
continue expansion outside the UK through opportunities
provided by existing clients. 
Banner Document Services (BDS)
BDS, our secure document destruction service operating
Closed Loop
TM
, the fully auditable recycling solution for
customers, delivered continued growth during the year, with
sales revenue increasing to over £5m (2012: £3.8m). Banner
Records Management which provides an on-site and off-site
digital solution for document storage and retrieval was
launched during the year and is expected to deliver growth in
2014 as we make customers aware of this additional,
complementary service offering.
Private / public sector mix
In 2013, private sector corporate customers provided 70%
of Group revenue compared to 66.8% in 2012.
Operating Costs
Logistics and distribution are significant costs for the Group,
but delivering excellent service remains an important
strategic differentiator. In 2013, despite the change in
customer buying habits to ‘little and often’ , as outlined in the
Chairman’s Statement, we were able to maintain our overall
service costs at the 10% targeted level. These efficiency
gains were delivered through greater productivity levels
across all logistics activities, most notably in warehouse line
picking and last mile distribution. Addressing and adapting to
these continuing changes remains a challenge today and is the
imperative driving our re-modelling programme. 
In the second half of 2013, we started a programme to reduce
our central support costs. This is continuing and will yield its
main benefit from the second half of 2014.
Chief Operating Officer
In March 2014, Steve McKeever resigned as Chief Operating
Officer to take up a leadership role in the IT industry. We thank
him for his considerable contribution to the Group and wish
him well in his new role.
Employees
The Group is essentially a people not an asset business.  Our
staff deliver outstanding service to our customers and it is
because of them that we are still outperforming our peers in
the office supplies industry. The Board recognises that 2014
will be a further challenging year and wants to thank them in
advance for their continuing commitment and diligence.

Strategic Report
Principal activities 
The principal activity of the Company is
that of a holding company. The Group’s
principal activities are delivering managed
procurement of office supplies and
business critical services.
Development and performance
during the year
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief
Executive’s Review provide an overview of
the underlying performance and
development of the Group in 2013.
Results: accounting treatment
During 2013, we reviewed certain
accounting treatments relative to best
practice, to provide greater transparency
of the Group’s financial performance and
to improve our financial reporting. 
We have changed the timing of the
recognition of advance supplier rebates
for contributions to catalogue production
and for other purchasing agreements,
which have grown in significance in the
recent past.  For these, the Board has
determined that our policy will now be to
recognise the advance rebate within the
catalogue distribution or purchasing
period with which it is associated. Our
approach to software recognition has
been revised such that both licence and
maintenance revenues are now being
recognised over the contracted term of
the licence. We have also determined that
customer rebate recognition should align
more closely with the relevant reporting
period. Deficiencies were found, too, in the
contract cost estimation models used by
Banner Managed Communication which
had led to an under recognition of cost of
sales. These and a pensions adjustment
driven by a change in accounting
standards have required us to make prior
year adjustments to 2012 and earlier
years, which are explained in full in the
Significant Accounting Policies note in the
accounts.   
These adjustments affect comparison
between 2013 and 2012, and indicate
that the financial position in 2013 was, in
relative terms, stronger than at first
appeared, though this does not detract
from the need for change, as already
covered in the Chairman’s Statement and
Chief Executive’s Review.  
Revenue and profit
T otal revenue was £231.9m (2012
restated: £227.0m). Underlying profit
before tax was £4.2m (2012 restated:
£4.2m) before non-recurring costs of
£0.8m (2012: £4.0m), amortisation of
intangibles relating to acquisitions of
£1.5m (2012: £1.2m) and share option
charges of £nil (2012: £0.5m). Operating
profit before such costs was £6.5m
(2012 restated: £6.3m) and operating
profit after such costs was £4.2m (2012
restated: £0.5m).  Profit before tax, after
such costs, was £1.8m (2012 restated: a
loss of £1.6m) and profit after tax was
£1.3m (2012 restated: a loss of £1.4m).
The underlying profit margin was 1.8%
(2012 restated: 1.8%).
Non-recurring costs are those significant
items that by virtue of their size or
incidence are separately disclosed to
enable a better understanding of the
Group’s operating performance. In 2013,
£0.6m (2012: £0.7m) related to
compensation payments and £0.2m
(2012: £0.9m) to operational efficiency
improvements.  In 2012, of other non-
recurring costs, £1.9m related principally
to the maintenance of customer service
levels in the early stages of the Advantia
contract and the remainder were items to
reshape the business in line with its
diversification strategy. A full analysis of
the non-recurring costs is set out in note
5 to the financial statements.
Cash flow, net debt and financing
As set out on page 45, the Group
generated net cash from operating
activities of £10.1m (2012: £4.2m). At
31 December 2013, net debt was
£21.8m, a decrease of £7.2m from
£29.0m at the start of the year.
Net debt of £21.8m is supported by
borrowing facilities committed until June
2015. We have agreed with RBS to
amend the committed facilities to allow
headroom for more rapid execution of our
reorganisation programme. The facilities
comprise a term loan of £12.5m
repayable over 5 years with the next
instalment of £1.5m due in December
2014; a revolving credit facility of
£2.0m; overdraft facilities of £1.0m; a
stock facility of £3.0m  and an invoice
discounting arrangement of up to
£27.0m. Financial covenants are applied
to those committed facilities and the
Group has continued to comply with the
set covenants.
Tax
A full analysis of the tax charge for the
year is set out in note 9 to the financial
statements. 
The Group’s effective tax rate in 2013
was 27.6% (2012 restated: 12.7%).
The low effective rate in 2012 is
primarily attributable to expenses not
deductible for tax purposes and the
impact of adjustments in respect of
prior year estimates.  The Group has a
further £1,965,000 (2012:
£1,965,000) of non-trading losses
where no tax asset is recognised as
there is currently no expectation that
these non-trading losses can be offset
against future profit streams. 
The amount of corporation tax paid
during the year was £0.3m (2012:
£0.3m). 
The effective tax rate in the near future
is anticipated to be marginally above the
standard rate of UK corporation tax. 
Shareholders’ return
Basic and diluted earnings per share
were 3.6p (2012 restated: loss of 3.9p)
with underlying earnings per share of
8.7p (2012: 8.5p).  There is no dividend
paid or payable in respect of 2013.  The
total dividend paid in respect of 2012
was not covered by earnings, although it
was covered 1.2 times by underlying
earnings.  Shareholders’ equity at the
end of the year was £14.5m (2012
restated: £15.6m).
The middle market quotation of the
Company’s Ordinary shares at the end of
the financial year was 31.0p with a
market capitalisation of £11.3m
(including shares held by the employee
benefit trust).

Change of auditors
We decided that 2013 was an
appropriate time to consider a change
of auditors. PricewaterhouseCoopers
had given many years of committed
service but we consider it good practice
to refresh professional advisors after a
period.  During a formal tender process,
we included each of the four largest
audit firms and selected KPMG LLP .
Business model and strategy
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief
Executive’s Review summarise our
business models, their rationale and
effectiveness and set out the changes in
strategy required by market pressures
and by our performance over 2012 and
the first half of 2013.  
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties
facing the Group are set out below:
• Loss of a large customer
The Group has a number of large
customers and is, therefore, potentially
vulnerable to the loss of any one of
these. Our GOSC contract is the largest
that will be tendered during 2014 for
award by the end of 2014 with a start in
the first half of 2015.  Contingency
plans are formulated and quantified
before any large re-tenders are
submitted to seek to enable the
business to respond rapidly, with
minimal disruption, to a large contract
loss. This, coupled with a strategy of
diversifying the customer base and
widening the business portfolio at the
same time as maintaining a high level of
service, is designed to help mitigate the
exposure.
2013 2012*
Gross margin % 25.2% 25.2%
Gross margin percentage is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. It is the measure of sales 
profitability after related direct purchase costs and is a measure comparable with other companies.
Slightly lower margins in Managed Procurement, owing to the dilutive impact of business won on an ex-works 
basis, have been mitigated by the higher margins in Business Critical Services.
Distribution cost % 10.1% 9.8%
This represents the cost associated with distribution (in 2012, before £2.9m of non-recurring costs) 
expressed as a percentage of revenue.  
Changes in customer ordering habits have offset distribution efficiencies achieved in 2013.
Administration cost % 12.7% 13.0%
This is the cost associated with administration (before £0.8m of non-recurring costs (2012: £1.1m), 
amortisation £1.5m (2012: £1.2m), and share option charges £nil (2012: £0.5m)) expressed as 
a percentage of revenue.
Efficiencies and a small increase in revenue are reflected here. 
Underlying profit % 1.8% 1.8%
This measures underlying profit (before non-recurring costs, amortisation and share option charges) 
as a percentage of revenue.
The stabilisation of underlying profit is a recurring theme here.
Underlying earnings per share 8.7p 8.5p
Underlying eps is the profit on ordinary activities after tax (before the after tax effect of non-recurring 
costs, amortisation and share option charges) divided by the weighted average number of 
Ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Net debt £21.8m £29.0m
Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from the long and short term borrowings.
Net debt decreased by £7.2m largely as a result of the focus on working capital management 
and debt reduction.

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Overall measurement of the financial performance of the operating segments, Managed Procurement and Business Critical
Services, is based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation (EBITA). Details can be found in note 3 to
the financial statements.
The individual KPIs which o2o uses to measure business performance are gross margin, distribution costs, administration
costs and underlying profit, all expressed as a proportion of revenue, underlying earnings per share and net debt.

Strategic Report (continued)
• Reduction in gross margins
Continued pressure on gross margins is
inevitable in a highly competitive market
place.  Our risk management seeks ways
to mitigate margin reductions, by
working with customers and suppliers to
reduce cost while maintaining service
standards and product quality.  Cost
increases result mainly from adverse
movements in the cost of production or
foreign exchange.  The Group also
benchmarks suppliers, validates
proposed cost increases against raw
material market indices, re-engineers
product and reviews the logistics
process.  We also work with our
customers to review their purchasing
behaviour and required service levels.
• Interruption of operations or IT
services
The business is built around a proven
service with reliance on our warehouses
and IT infrastructure. A severe
disruption in either of these areas could
have a significant impact on the Group.
In order to mitigate these risks we
maintain appropriate disaster recovery
plans and insurance cover.
• Competitors
The Group operates in a highly
competitive market. The risk exists,
therefore, that contracts are awarded
simply on the basis of lowest price,
irrespective of the overall value
package. Our strategy is to deliver a
wide range of first rate, added-value
services at competitive prices. Recent
contract wins and retentions help
demonstrate that this approach is
valued by our customers across the
Group. 
• Economic backdrop
The Group is inevitably affected to
some degree by economic slowdown
and changes in exchange rates and the
potential that lower levels of activity
lead to reduced demand for some of the
goods and services provided by the
Group. This was particularly evident
with the reduction in public sector sales
volumes as a consequence of
Government austerity measures. In
addition, economic circumstances
affect suppliers. However, the Group has
limited exposure to the failure of any
single supplier since, for the majority of
products purchased, alternative
sourcing or product options are
normally available. 
The Group’s committed borrowing
facilities afford some protection against
increased funding requirements should
they arise. In addition, the widespread
nature of our customers help to
mitigate risks in the wider economy.
• Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a
variety of financial risks, which include
market risk (comprising currency risk,
commodity price risk, cash flow and fair
value interest rate risk), credit risk and
liquidity risk, the details of which are
described in note 1 to the financial
statements. 
• Working capital management
The risk from limited availability of
further capital could constrain the
growth of the business. The Group
mitigates this risk by regular monitoring
of cash flow and funding requirements
to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities
are in place to service its operating
activities. 
Human rights   
Those activities which are directly
controlled by the Group are
substantially in developed countries
with strong human rights legislation
with which the Group fully complies.
However, the Group does source
products and services globally and
takes active steps to uphold ethical and
responsible behaviour in its dealings
and those of its suppliers.

Corporate Social Responsibility Statement
o2o is committed to upholding its ‘good
for you, good for us, good for everyone’
trading ethos. CSR is important to o2o
because it is important to o2o’s
customers, staff and shareholders. It
also makes good business sense,
leading to greater efficiency, lower
costs and improved competitiveness. 
Workplace
Over 900 people are employed across
the Group and their experience, skills
and commitment are key to o2o’s
success. As well as providing a safe and
healthy working environment, o2o
promotes a positive internal culture
that enthuses and challenges its
employees and allows them to
challenge what they do, openly and
constructively.
Employees
o2o has a diverse workforce and
recognises the individual needs of its
employees. For example, it supports
working parents by operating childcare
schemes and offering flexible working
arrangements, subject to the
operational needs of the business.
The Company ensures that its
employees are kept aware of changes in
employee-related legislation and
arranges Group-wide awareness
programmes when appropriate, such as
diversity and anti-discrimination
awareness in response to the Equality
Act 2010 and an understanding of anti-
corruption measures to ensure
compliance with the Bribery Act 2010. 
Each business has its own internal
communications activity such as
newsletters, websites, local employee
forums and employee suggestion
schemes. Group-wide communication is
facilitated by the Group’s intranet where
o2o news is published, internal
vacancies are posted and a wide range
of HR forms and corporate policies are
available for download. 
Cross-functional meetings provide a
valuable forum for employees to share
knowledge on a variety of business
matters such as products and services,
warehouse operations, logistics,
customers and suppliers. This has
helped identify cross-selling capabilities
within the Group. In addition, relevant
employees have opportunities to meet
the Group’s key suppliers and gain a
better understanding of the products
they are selling and for the suppliers to
showcase the new products included in
the Group’s catalogues.
Health & Safety
A strong health and safety culture exists
throughout the Group and collective
responsibility is encouraged. This is led
by a dedicated Health and Safety
Manager to ensure compliance with
statutory, regulatory and other industry
requirements, and fully supported by
the Board who receive monthly health
and safety reports and updates. 
All sites operate under an OHSAS
18001 certified health and safety
management system, audited by BSI.
During 2013, 11 o2o sites were audited
with no major non-conformities.
Annual workplace inspections/audits
are undertaken by an independent
Health and Safety Consultant with
follow up visits to ensure that all
corrective actions have been completed.
Internal observation and legal
compliance audits are undertaken by
the o2o quality, environment, health &
safety (QEHS) teams at all sites and this
has led to the development and group-
wide availability of user friendly
intranet web pages on specific QEHS
aspects. Management presentations on
BSI certifications and the impact on the
Group and its employees ensure
continued improvement is supported at
the highest level.
o2o’s main warehouse is enrolled with
the British Safety Council (BSC),
allowing access to information and
training modules. Our Guildford and
Manchester sites have previously won
International Health and Safety Awards
(with Merit) from BSC based on their
work practices and health and safety
culture. These sites, along with the
Norwich Head Office site, are entered
for this year’s award. 
All employees receive health and safety
awareness training and fire, manual
handling, display screen equipment and
workplace task-specific risk
assessments are conducted at each site.
o2o’s health and safety procedures are
available on the Group intranet and each
o2o location has a health and safety
group, comprising employees from
different levels and functions, with
responsibility for conducting reviews of
current practices and taking any
corrective action necessary. Our senior
operations managers are trained to BSC
Level 2 and all members of the Head
Office health and safety group have
attained BSC Level 1 certificate.
Refresher training courses are provided
to ensure knowledge is kept up-to-date.
All delivery drivers undertake an
internet-based road safety course as
well as CPC training. An initiative was
rolled-out during the year to promote
safety for all employees driving on
Company business. All driving licences
are checked with Intelligent Data
Systems (IDS) via DVLA and every six
months, company car drivers are
required to provide their managers with
vehicle condition reports. Employees
who have opted for a car allowance are
required to confirm vehicle details
(insurance, MOT , essential service and
maintenance checks etc.) via an on-line
portal, Fleet2. 
Community
o2o recognises that it has a
responsibility towards the wider
community and is particularly proud of
the efforts of its employees to raise
funds for charity.
Whilst community relations are
managed at a local level, o2o expects its
high standard of business principles to
be maintained in all dealings and
representations.
Work experience placements are
offered to students and, wherever
practicable, preference is given to local
businesses when outsourcing services
such as catering, cleaning and
recruitment.
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 9 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 10
o2o has an established charity
committee to help o2o employees
contribute to community and charitable
events by encouraging and co-ordinating
fundraising across the Group. A third of
all revenues received from warehouse
recycling initiatives (see page 11) goes
to employee nominated charities and
local causes, which also benefit from an
array of fundraising activities, including
office ‘dress down’ days, cake sales,
raffles and various sponsored events.
Product marketplace
o2o promotes the use of products
containing recycled materials or
manufactured from sustainable
resources and using sustainable
manufacturing methods. The Group
ensures good practice throughout its
supply chain and helps its customers to
do likewise.
Ethical sourcing
o2o sources products on a global basis
and encourages all of its suppliers to
operate environmental management
systems. o2o will not knowingly trade
with organisations that behave in a
manner that is unethical or
irresponsible.
In particular, o2o takes active steps to
audit the ethical performance of
suppliers who manufacture the Group’s
own brand products. First, o2o is a
member of Sedex, the supplier ethical
data exchange. In addition, o2o’s buyers
visit suppliers’ factories overseas and
use SGS, an independent assessor, to
ensure compliance with the Ethical
Trading Initiative’s base code which is
founded on the conventions of the
International Labour Organisation and is
an internationally recognised code of
labour practice. 
Green OPTIMISA™
The Green OPTIMISA™ system enables
customers to calculate the
environmental impacts of their contract
with o2o, including the use of paper,
CO2 emissions and transport (fuel
consumption). This is important to many
o2o customers and the system
therefore adds value commercially, as
well as from a CSR perspective.
Environmentally preferred products
o2o operates the Globe & Tick™
accreditation scheme, which makes it
easy for customers to select
environmentally preferred products.
The range of ‘green alternatives’ now
consists of over 1,600 products for
every area of the workplace, from
office supplies to catering, technology
to promotional items. Globe & Tick™
products constitute over 20% of the
lines contained within the o2o
catalogue for 2014. Recent additions
to the Globe & Tick™ range are o2o’s
own brand Closed Loop™ filing products
made using 100% recycled Closed
Loop manila.
All Globe & Tick™ products are audited
against independently set criteria
before they are showcased in the o2o
Green Guide, which is published
annually. The Green Guide also
incorporates information on other
sustainable products and services and
how customers can minimise the
impact of their day to day working
practices on the environment.
o2o is a certified member of both the
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and
the Programme for the Endorsement of
Forest Certification (PEFC) promoting
responsible and sustainable forest
management.  
Fairtrade is designed to give
disadvantaged farmers a guaranteed
price for products that meet
internationally agreed standards.
Rainforest Alliance focuses on
standards covering worker protection,
their environment and their
communities. A range of Fairtrade and
‘Rainforest Alliance certified’ catering
supplies are included in o2o’s
catalogue.
Catalogues and brochures
All of o2o’s main catalogues are printed
on paper made from 100% recovered
waste. Surplus catalogues are always
recycled and the use of electronic
catalogues is promoted wherever
possible.
Recycling services 
o2o offers a portfolio of recycling
services, notably waste paper through
its Closed Loop™ service. Having
supplied its customers with copier
paper, the Closed Loop™ service collects
the waste paper, securely shreds it, and
a leading paper mill then converts it
back into copier paper to be used again
by the customer, thereby ‘closing the
loop’ .
Compared to manufacturing a ream of
virgin copier paper, 81% less water,
71% less energy and 53% less carbon
are used in manufacturing a ream of
Closed Loop™ recycled paper. In 2013,
3.39 million reams were produced
(2012: 2.8 million reams).
Closed Loop™ has won several
accolades since its inception including a
Green Apple Award in 2010, a Bronze
Zero Waste Award in 2012 and a
T omorrow’s FM award in 2013. It was
also key to the business being named
‘Recycling and Waste Management
Large Business of the Y ear’ in 2012.
More information can be found on the
website www.bannerclosedloop.co.uk.
In addition, o2o offers the safe disposal
of batteries, printer cartridges,
uniforms, office furniture and
technology products.
Environment
The Group ensures that, in satisfying its
customers’ requirements, both the
goods and services supplied and its own
housekeeping comply with legislation
and best practice.  o2o operates an
environmental management system
that has been certified to the
international standard ISO 14001:
2004 and has made significant
progress in reducing the environmental
impact of its business activities. 
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement (continued)
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 10 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 11
Waste management
o2o is a national distributor of business
products and aims to keep packaging to
a minimum through a combination of
improved box utilisation, larger product
pack sizes and customer education
regarding the environmental benefits of
consolidating orders. T owards the end of
2012, o2o introduced its trademarked
recyclabox™, a sturdy but easily
collapsible box made from 100%
recycled card. Recyclabox™ is used for all
deliveries and customers are
encouraged to return the folded boxes to
the drivers to be re-used again and again.
Where possible, o2o utilises 
e-commerce to reduce the amount of
paper used in the transaction process.
The Group trades with most of its larger
customers and suppliers electronically . 
Recycling
All of o2o’s distribution hubs have
procedures to recycle waste materials.
A ‘backloading’ process ensures that
waste cardboard and shrinkwrap is
taken back to o2o’s warehouses for
recycling, using the same trunker vehicle
that delivers goods for onward
shipment to customers. Drinks cans and
plastic bottles are also recycled.
In November 2012, the Manchester
distribution centre achieved ‘zero
landfill’ status assisted by White
Recycling Limited. All general waste
from this site is now 100% recycled.
White Recycling Limited collect the
waste and further segregate items for
recycling with any residual waste going
through its waste exchange operation
transforming waste into quality
secondary fuels of varied specifications
for a variety of end users. At the
moment our Basingstoke distribution
centre recycles only 92.5% of its waste
but is working with recycling companies
to achieve ‘zero landfill’ in the near
future. 
Overall, the volume of cardboard and
paper recycled in 2013 was 423 tonnes
(2012: 420 tonnes) and the volume of
plastic that was recycled was 61.5
tonnes (2012: 60 tonnes). 
Energy management
Over the past few years o2o has
invested in improving energy usage. The
Manchester distribution centre
benefited from an air source heat pump
which converts air drawn from the
atmosphere into a source of heat for
use in radiators and, in the Basingstoke
warehouse, a new heating system with
down fans was installed. Low energy
lighting was also fitted throughout
these sites and movement sensors were
fitted to light fittings within the office
and warehouse of our new Barking hub
to help reduce energy usage.
Based on kilowatts of gas and electricity
used, a total of 2,360.25 tonnes of CO2
were emitted in 2013 by o2o’s 23
locations which are a mix of large
warehouses, offices and small
distribution hubs. The availability of
complete and comparable data for all
sites has been hindered by changes in
locations and a switch in providers as we
aligned and made coterminous our
energy suppliers’ contracts. We expect
to have this data available for 2014. 
Of this total, 1,642 tonnes of CO2 were
emitted by our four larger sites
(Manchester, Basingstoke, Guildford
and Norwich) in 2013.  Excluding
Guildford (as we do not have
comparable data for 2012) the total
tonnage emitted was 1,017 tonnes
(2012: 1,089 tonnes).  The reduction
reflects a phased transfer to 100%
renewable electricity source, initiated in
2012 and completed in November
2013, for those sites where we manage
our utilities. In 2014, we expect to be
reporting significantly lower emissions.
Looking further ahead, we are currently
exploring the possibility for solar energy
for our freehold site in Hinckley.
Carbon management
As a national distributor, o2o operates its
own in-house fleet of delivery vehicles and
employs a number of initiatives to
maximise efficiency and minimise the
environmental impact of the fleet. A four
year renewal scheme means that the
most up-to-date, clean running and fuel
efficient vehicles are available. The HGV
vehicles are Euro 5 compliant, having
sloping roof trailers and aerodynamic
bodies to minimise fuel usage and utilising
selective catalytic reduction to minimise
pollution. Almost all of the vehicles are
diesel and some are fitted with stop-start
technology which switches the engine off
when the vehicle has a prolonged stop.
Journeys are optimised by means of a
sophisticated fleet management system
and Navman tracking. Double deck trailers
are used to transport larger quantities of
goods in a single journey . Back-loading
arrangements exist whereby delivery
vehicles collect stock on their return to
the warehouse in an otherwise empty
vehicle. 
CO2 emissions generated by the delivery
fleet were 4,439 tonnes in 2013 (2012:
5,801 tonnes), a significant reduction
from the previous year. This was largely as
a result of ceasing palletised deliveries
for The Pallet Network, which had become
an unprofitable non-core activity , and also
a reduction in the number of vehicles
because of route optimisation.
The company car scheme encourages
staff to select cars from a defined range
of low emission vehicles and video and
telephone conferencing are used to
minimise the need for business travel.
CO2 emissions generated by company car
fleet were 658 tonnes in 2013. A
comparable figure for 2012 is not
available.

server requirements to Iomart. The
transactions are on normal commercial
terms.
Directors’ third party indemnity
provisions
A qualifying third-party indemnity
provision as defined in s234 of the
Companies Act 2006 was in force for
the benefit of each of the Directors in
respect of liabilities incurred as a result
of his office, to the extent permitted by
law during the financial year and also at
the date of approval of the financial
statements. In respect of those
liabilities for which Directors may not be
indemnified, the Company maintained a
directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policy throughout the
financial year.
Statement of Directors’
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for
preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the
financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that law, the
Directors have prepared the Group and
parent Company financial statements in
accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union. Under Company
Law, the Directors must not approve the
financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group
and the Company and of the profit or
loss of the Group for that period.  In
preparing these financial statements,
the Directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently;
● make judgements and accounting
estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
● state whether applicable IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union have
been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements; and
● prepare the financial statements on
the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to assume that the
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for
keeping adequate accounting records
that are sufficient to show and explain
the Company’s transactions and
disclose, with reasonable accuracy at
any time, the financial position of the
Company and the Group to enable them
to ensure that the financial statements
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report
comply with the Companies Act 2006
and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and the Group and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and

Directors’ responsibility
statement
Each of the Directors, whose names and
functions are listed on page 14 confirms
that, to the best of his knowledge:
● the Group financial statements,
which have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the EU, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial
position and profit of the Group;  
● the Annual Report and Accounts,
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the
information necessary for
shareholders to assess the
Company’s performance, business
model and strategy; and
● in accordance with s418 Companies
Act 2006, in the case of each
Director in office at the date the
Directors’ Report is approved, that:
(a) so far as the Director is aware,
there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s
auditors are unaware; and
(b) he has taken all the steps that he
ought to have taken as a Director
in order to make himself aware of
any relevant audit information and
to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of that
information.
Employee involvement
Employee share schemes
A long term incentive scheme is in
operation for executive Directors and
senior managers.  Details are included in
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on
pages 32 to 33. 
The Group also has Save As Y ou Earn
(SA YE) schemes under which employees
are granted an option to purchase
Ordinary shares in the Company in
either three or five years’ time,
dependent upon their entering into a
contract to make monthly contributions
to a savings account over the relevant
period. These savings are used to fund
the option exercise. There are currently
two live schemes: one launched in
November 2011 and one launched in
October 2013. Both schemes offer
three or five year savings plans. Details
of these schemes are given in note 26 to
the financial statements. Details of the
executive Directors’ participation are
included in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on page 34.
A low cost dealing service is available to
employees which provides a simple way
of buying or selling o2o shares. In
addition, an on-line share portal,
available through the Company’s
registrar, allows individuals to view and
manage their shareholdings. Details of
these services are available on the
Company’s website.
Employee benefit trust (EBT)
No options vested during the year so as
at 31 December 2013, the total number
of Ordinary shares held by the EBT
remained at 138,155 (0.38% of the
issued Ordinary share capital of the
Company (2012: 138,155 (0.38%))).
Whilst held in trust, the shares do not
attract any payment of dividends.
Although the trustee may exercise his
right to vote in respect of any shares
held within the trust from time to time,
this right is typically waived.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to a policy that
provides all employees irrespective of
background or disability, with equality of
opportunity for employment, training,
career development and selection on
the basis of ability, qualifications and
suitability for the job.  Executive
Directors, managers and employees are
required to promote equality of
opportunity and to take full account of
the policy in their day-to-day work.  The
aim is to recruit the most appropriate
and qualified staff in the industry and
the Group is committed to the principle
of maximising every employee’s
potential.  In selecting, training and
promoting staff, the Group has to take
account of the physically demanding
nature of much of its work.  Employees
who become disabled will be retained
and re-trained, where possible.
Diversity and anti-discrimination
o2o’s diversity and anti-discrimination
policy is available to employees via the
Group intranet. The principles of the
policy are outlined in the Nomination
Committee Report on page 21.
Bribery and anti-corruption
o2o does not tolerate any form of
bribery or corruption and this is codified
in the Group policy on anti-corruption
available on the Group intranet.
Employees are required to declare
details of any gift or hospitality
received in connection with their
employment and in conjunction with the
Business Ethics Policy set out in the
staff handbook. Where there is any
doubt of a conflict of interest,
employees are asked to seek approval in
advance.
Corporate and social
responsibility
A summary report on the Group policies
and objectives in respect of CSR,
including health and safety, business
ethics and environmental performance
is set out on pages 9 to 11. 
Independent auditors and
limited liability arrangement
The change of auditor during the year is
detailed in the Audit Committee Report.
A resolution to appoint KPMG LLP as
auditor will be put to shareholders at
the forthcoming AGM.
KPMG LLP’s terms of engagement
include a limitation on liability for losses
incurred in connection with the
engagement, up to a maximum
aggregate of £1.0m providing claims
are made within 4 years. This limitation
is disapplied for statutory audit and
interim financial statement review work.
Political donations
The Group has made no political
donations and incurred no items of
political expenditure during the period
(2012: £nil).

Statement of compliance with
the UK Corporate Governance
Code 2010 and 2012 (the
Code)
The Code sets out standards of good
corporate governance and is publicly
available on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website www.frc.org.uk. 
For the majority of 2013, the Directors
consider that the Company has
complied with the principles set out in
each section of the Code. However,
following the change in Board roles in
November 2013, there are now a few
exceptions to this, as set out below. 
The application of the Code’s principles
with respect to the composition and
operation of the Board, the
remuneration of the Directors,
shareholder relationships and
procedures for financial reporting and
internal control are described below. 
Board composition
The Board comprises the Chairman,
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director
and two non-executive Directors. Up
until his resignation on 10 March 2014,
Steve McKeever fulfilled the role of
Chief Operating Officer. Biographical
details of the Board members are set
out on page 12.
In November 2013, David Callear
stepped down as Chairman for personal
reasons. He agreed, for the time being,
to remain on the Board as a non-
executive Director. At short notice,
having consulted with advisors and with
the support of the Board, Jim Cohen
assumed the role of Chairman. Whilst
this provided an immediate practical
solution, it was recognised that the
appointment would conflict with the
Code’s provisions: that the chairman of
the Board should not also chair the
Remuneration Committee (Code
provision D.2.1) and that Boards should
have a nominated Senior Independent
Director (Code provision A.4.1). The
Board considered appointing an
additional non-executive Director but
having also consulted its advisors,
decided against doing so at this point in
time. In doing so, the Board took the
view that the on-going involvement of
the other members of the Remuneration
Committee would ensure continuity and
self-govern any conflicts of interest.
With a small Board, the Directors do not
see a need for a Senior Independent
Director to support the Board internally.
Jim Cohen, Simon Moate and Hugh
Cawley are all available to shareholders
on request.
The Chairman is responsible for leading
the Board and ensuring there is timely
and effective communication to and
between all Board members. He ensures
that Board decisions are made after
taking into consideration the interests
of all stakeholders. The Chief Executive,
supported by the senior management
team, is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Group and, once
agreed by the Board as a whole, the
development and implementation of
strategy.  He sets the objectives to
ensure the successful delivery of
targets and allocates decision-making
and responsibilities accordingly. The
normal segregation of responsibilities
between the Chairman and the Chief
Executive has been set out in writing
and approved by the Board. The
Chairman’s other main commitments are
disclosed on page 12. A statement of
Directors’ responsibilities is given on
page 14 of the Directors’ Report. The
respective responsibilities of directors
and auditors are given on page 39 of the
Independent Auditors’ report to the
members of office2office plc.
The non-executive Directors are free
from any business or other relationship
which could materially interfere with the
exercise of their judgement and have no
involvement with the day-to-day
management of the Group. The Board
considers the non-executive Directors
to be independent, underpinning their
ability to challenge decisions and bring a
depth of debate and alternative
viewpoint to the Board. The terms and
conditions of the non-executive
Directors’ appointments are available
on request from the Company’s
registered office.
In accordance with the Articles, no more
than one third of the Directors are
required to retire at each AGM and all
Directors are required to submit
themselves for re-election at least once
every three years. Directors who have
served three consecutive three-year
terms must offer themselves for re-
election annually. Details of Directors
retiring and seeking re-appointment at
the next AGM are given on page 14.
New appointments to the Board are
made following the recommendation of
the Nomination Committee. Upon
joining the Company, directors are
supplied with comprehensive
documentation aimed at providing
information in relation to the remit and
obligations of the role and current
Board topics. In addition, and where
appropriate, meetings are arranged with
advisors and key shareholders by way of
introducing the new director.
The Company Secretary reports to the
Board and advises individual Directors
as required on Board procedures,
corporate governance matters and
changes in the regulatory environment.
A procedure also exists for Directors to
take independent professional advice at
the Company’s expense. 
Activities of the Board
The Board operates formally through
agenda-driven Board meetings, which
are normally held on a monthly basis.
The agenda covers both operational and
strategic matters, however, separate
strategy days are also held to focus on
longer term considerations without the
distraction of the day-to-day
operational matters. At each meeting,
all Directors are invited to declare the
nature and extent of their interests in
the matters for discussion. Frequent
informal dialogue between the Directors
supplements the formal Board
meetings. 
Formal presentations by, and informal
meetings with, senior management
allow the Board to keep abreast of
operational matters, helps their
understanding of the business and
Corporate Governance Statement
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 17 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 18
improves communications both in and
out of the boardroom. 
The Board is responsible to
shareholders for the management and
control of the Group’s activities, its
strategic objectives, its system of
corporate governance and the
stewardship of its resources. This is
achieved by regular review of the key
activities of the Group through the
monthly management accounts, reports
and presentations. A Board pack
comprising information to be reviewed
and discussed is forwarded to all Board
members in advance of the monthly
meetings to allow the Directors to be
fully prepared. Regular detailed reports
on the Company’s funding and liquidity
position are also circulated. Upon
release, analyst and broker reports are
circulated and the Board is updated on
any movements in major shareholdings.
There is a formal schedule of matters
reserved for consideration and approval
by the Board which is a constituent part
of the Group’s Commitment and
Authority schedule to ensure
appropriate approvals are obtained at
all levels of activity and expenditure. 
The types of decision which are taken by
the Board are those relating to
strategic, group and corporate matters
including financial commitments,
acquisitions and disposal of business
activities. Although operational
decisions are delegated to senior
management any significant matters
are likely to be discussed in advance at
Board level. In this way, the Board and
senior management are able to balance
the longer term strategic direction with
immediate operational requirements
and delivery of acceptable financial
results. Specific responsibilities have
been delegated to Board committees as
described below. 
Under the Companies Act 2006,
Directors must avoid any situations in
which they have or could have a direct or
indirect interest that conflicts with
Company interests. The Articles provide
the Board with the authority to approve
any such conflict, as appropriate.
The Company maintains appropriate
insurance to cover its Directors and
Officers against the costs of defending
themselves in legal proceedings taken
against them in that capacity and in
respect of any damages resulting from
those proceedings. In addition, the
Company indemnifies the Directors to
the extent permitted by law and its
Articles. Neither the indemnities nor the
insurance provide cover where the
Director or Officer is proved to have
acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Board performance evaluation
A performance evaluation of the Board
and its committees is conducted on an
annual basis.  In a departure from
previous years, where Directors have
completed a questionnaire for this
purpose, the feedback from individual
discussions between the house-broker
and key shareholders in October 2013
formed an independent basis for a
performance evaluation by the
Nomination Committee which was later
shared with the Board.  The house-
broker confirmed that the discussions
were not directed in any way but were
an open dialogue on the Company, its
management and direction, past and
present. 
In addition, during the year, the
Chairman met the non-executive
Directors without the executive
Directors present to discuss the
performance of individual executive
Directors and other senior managers.
The non-executive Directors also met
without the Chairman being present to
discuss his performance.
Committees of the Board
Specific responsibilities are delegated
to sub-committees of the Board. The
composition of these sub-committees is
provided below together with reference
to reports on their activities. All other
decisions are taken collectively by the
Board.
Board sub-committees are appointed to
act on behalf of the Board for specific
projects or one-off matters as and when
required.  This enables matters to be
dealt with quickly and efficiently
without formal scheduled meetings and
proceedings are fully minuted for
approval by the Board. Composition of
the sub-committees varies according to
the nature of the business covered.  
The Nomination Committee is
responsible for reviewing the size,
structure and composition of the Board
and making recommendations to the
Board if it considers that any changes
are required. It keeps succession plans
under review and has a formal
procedure for appointments to the
Board and senior management team.
The Nomination Committee comprises
the Chairman and both non-executive
Directors. David Callear continues to
chair this Committee. A report on its
activities is given on page 21.
The Remuneration Committee reviews
and makes recommendations on the
Group’s overall remuneration policy,
including individual remuneration
packages for executive Directors, the
Chairman and senior management. It is
also responsible for the Company’s
share schemes and senior incentive
plans. The Remuneration Committee
comprises the Chairman and both non-
executive Directors. As explained on
page 17, and notwithstanding his
appointment as Chairman of the Board
in November 2013, Jim Cohen continues
to chair this Committee except where
there are matters concerning himself.  A
report on its activities is given on page
24.
The Audit Committee assists the Board
in discharging its responsibilities
effectively for financial reporting, risk
review and internal control. It comprises
the Chairman and both non-executive
Directors.  All members have financial
literacy. Chris Batterham, who chairs
this Committee, and David Callear are
Chartered Accountants and have
relevant financial expertise, as
described in their biographies on page
12.  A report on its activities is given on
page 22.
The Risk and Opportunity Committee
was formed in 2010 and, up to February
2014, was chaired by Jim Cohen.  Chris
Batterham will chair the meetings going

Each shareholder receives the annual
report and financial statements
containing the full year results. Half
yearly results are published on the
Company’s website but are available in
hard copy form only on request.
Following the announcement of results,
presentations are given to the
investment community in London and
Edinburgh. The full year and half year
reports and presentations are made
available on the Company’s website
(www.office2office.co.uk). Additionally,
and in accordance with the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules, interim
management statements were released
via the RNS news service in April and
November 2013.
The Company’s AGM takes place in
Norwich and formal notification,
together with the annual report and
financial statements, is sent to
shareholders at least 20 working days in
advance of the meeting. All Board
members are available, formally during
the AGM and informally afterwards, for
questions. Each item of business is the
subject of a separate resolution. The
collection and analysis of the proxy
votes is handled independently by the
Company’s registrars. The Chairman
announces the results of the proxy
votes after shareholders have voted on
a show of hands. These results are also
made available on the Company’s
forward. The aim is to provide a forum
for risk and opportunities to be
regularly reviewed by Board members
and senior management. There is no set
membership, as this will vary according
to the matters under review.  Further
details are provided on page 23.
As Board packs are issued in advance of
the Board meetings, all Directors are
kept informed of the matters to be
discussed and have the opportunity to
make their views known to the Chairman
prior to the meeting if they are unable to
attend. Minutes of meetings are
circulated to the respective members of
the Board or committees.
Directors’ remuneration
The Directors’ Remuneration Report on
pages 24 to 36 includes details of
remuneration policies and the
remuneration of Directors.
Relationship with shareholders and
constructive use of the AGM
The Board, led by the Chairman,
recognises the importance of effective
communication and accountability to all
shareholders and is kept informed of
their views through frequent contact
with the house-brokers and feedback
from direct communications with, and
presentations to, institutional investors
and fund managers.  
website. Details of the 2014 AGM are
set out in the notice of the meeting
enclosed with this report.
The Chairman is available to
shareholders on all matters relating to
governance and strategy. All members
of the Board may be contacted through
the Company’s website.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for
the Group’s system of internal control
and delegates the annual review of
internal control processes and their
effectiveness to the Audit Committee.
The internal control systems are
designed to meet the Group’s needs and
address the risks to which it is exposed.
Such systems mitigate, rather than
eliminate, the risks faced by the
business and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material mis-statement or loss.
Necessary actions are taken to remedy
any significant failings or weaknesses as
they are identified. The Directors have
conducted a review of the effectiveness
of the Group’s system of internal control
and consider it appropriate for the
business. As part of this review, there
were certain accounting treatment
changes and an adjustment made in
respect of Goods Received Not Invoiced
(see page 47). No other failings or
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 19 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 20
Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
weaknesses were identified. A detailed,
group-wide review of risk and
opportunity is overseen by the Risk and
Opportunity Committee. See page 23
for further details. 
The key elements of the Group’s
procedures and internal financial
control framework are:
● the close involvement of the
executive Directors in all aspects of
the day-to-day operations, including
regular meetings with senior staff
from across the Group and a review
of the monthly operational reports
compiled by senior management;
● clearly defined responsibilities and
limits of authority as set out in the
Group’s Commitment and Authority
schedule. The Board has
responsibility for strategy and has
adopted a schedule of matters which
are required to be brought to it for
decision;
● financial teams dedicated to each
business segment but with a
reporting line to the central finance
function. This ensures that the
specific accounting needs of each
segment can be closely managed
whilst ensuring financial discipline is
maintained;
● central control of key functions such
as tax, treasury, payroll, legal and
insurance, rather than on a divisional
basis;
● a comprehensive system of financial
reporting, forecasting and budgeting.
Detailed budgets are prepared
annually for all parts of the business
and consolidated by the central
finance team. Reviews occur through
the management structure
culminating in a Group budget which
is considered and approved by the
Board;
● an agreed time-plan and schedule of
responsibility for the preparation of
consolidated accounts and a
continual review process with the
Board. Reports and statements are
prepared independently from the
financial statements to ensure
integrity of content;
● Group management accounts are
prepared monthly and submitted to
the Board for review. V ariances from
budget and prior year are closely
monitored and explanations are
provided for significant variances.
Detailed expense reports with
comparisons against budget are
issued monthly to cost centre
managers to assist in cost control; 
● a continuous process for identifying,
evaluating and managing significant
risks across the Group together with
a comprehensive annual review of
risks which covers both financial and
non-financial areas; and
● an annual review of insurance cover
for the Group including a review of
disaster recovery plans for IT and the
warehouses. The significant risks
facing the business are considered to
be the loss of a large customer or a
major interruption of warehouse
operations or IT services. Further
detail is provided on pages 7 to 8 of
the Strategic Report.
This process is in accordance with the
Turnbull guidance and has been in place
throughout the year under review and up
to the date of approval of the annual
report and financial statements.
Going concern
The Group has net current liabilities as
at 31 December 2013 and has traded
profitably since the balance sheet date
with the profits generated contributing
to the funding of the Group’s working
capital requirements. In addition, the
Group meets its day-to-day working
capital requirements through sufficient
and appropriate credit facilities that are
committed until June 2015. The Group’s
forecasts indicate that it is able to
operate within the level of its current
facilities and related covenants for the
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the
Directors, having made appropriate
enquiries, consider it reasonable to
assume that the Group and the
Company have adequate resources to
continue for the foreseeable future and,
for this reason, have continued to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
Corporate social responsibility
(CSR)
Measures to ensure responsible
business conduct and the identification
and assessment of risks associated with
social, ethical and environmental
matters are managed in conjunction
with all other business risks and
reviewed at regular meetings of the
Board and senior management. 
o2o maintains its CSR initiative entitled
‘good for you, good for us, good for
everyone’ which aims to combine added
value for customers with tangible
benefits for the business and the
environment. 
A summary report on the Group’s
policies and objectives for CSR is set
out on pages 9 to 11.

Nomination Committee Report
Composition of the Nomination
Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises
David Callear (Committee Chairman),
Jim Cohen and Chris Batterham. The
Company Secretary is secretary to the
Committee. When appropriate, the
Chief Executive is invited to attend
Committee meetings.
Role of the Nomination
Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-
committee of the Board, responsible for
all appointments to the Board, giving full
consideration to succession plans and
the leadership of the Group. The
Committee meets as required and
engages with recruitment consultants
when appropriate.  It makes
recommendations to the Board for any
changes to the Board and its
committees that it considers necessary
and also reviews the senior
management structure. The Committee
has a formal procedure for
appointments to the Board and gives
due regard to the diversity of skills,
knowledge, experience and gender.
However, given the relatively small size
of the Board, there are no set objectives
in relation to diversity and
appointments are made by the Board,
following recommendation by the
Nomination Committee, based on merit
against objective criteria. 
The formal procedure for appointments
to the Board is available, together with
the Committee’s terms of reference, on
the Company’s website
(www.office2office.co.uk).
During 2013, the Committee met on
four occasions, principally to discuss the
resignation of Mark Cunningham and
the appointment of Hugh Cawley as
Group Finance Director, Chairmanship
of the Board and also Board
performance.
Further details with regards to Mark
Cunningham’s termination agreement
are provided on page 31. 
Details of Hugh Cawley’s remuneration
are provided in the Directors’
Remuneration Report.  Harvey Nash
PLC, who has no connection with the
Company, was engaged in the
recruitment process.
The Committee also met to discuss the
change of Chairman and consulted with
advisors prior to the Board’s decision to
accept David Callear’s resignation as
Chairman and Jim Cohen’s appointment.
Further details are provided on page 31
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
As explained on page 18 of the
Corporate Governance Statement, the
Committee reviewed feedback from
discussions between the house-broker
and key shareholders on the Company
and its management which later became
the basis for the Board performance
evaluation.
After the year end, Steve McKeever
resigned as Chief Operating Officer.
During his tenure, Steve McKeever built
a strong team and the Committee
therefore advised the Board that it
should not replace him at Board level
until it has had time to assess whether it
is best served through an internal or
external appointment or, indeed, can
manage by re-distributing his
responsibilities.
Diversity and anti-
discrimination 
The Board fully supports a culture that
promotes diversity across a range of
criteria. The Group’s diversity and anti-
discrimination policy was formulated in
response to the Equality Act 2010 and
is available to employees via the Group
intranet and the employee handbook.
The policy’s fundamental principle is
that every employee has the right to be
treated fairly, in an environment in which
individual differences are recognised,
respected and valued. It raises
awareness of diversity (including
gender) in the workplace and what
constitutes unacceptable behaviour. It
communicates how the Company
undertakes to manage diversity and
eliminate unlawful discrimination within
the Group. Complaints are treated in
confidence and resulting actions will
vary depending on the circumstances of
the discrimination. If necessary,
employees may be taken through a
formal disciplinary procedure which may
result in dismissal.

Audit Committee Report
Composition of the Audit
Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Chris
Batterham (Committee Chairman), Jim
Cohen and David Callear.  Chris
Batterham and David Callear are
Chartered Accountants.  Non-
committee members and the Company’s
external auditors are invited to attend
meetings as and when appropriate. The
Company Secretary is secretary to the
Audit Committee.   The Committee’s
terms of reference are available on the
Company’s website
(www.office2office.co.uk).
Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is a sub-
committee of the Board and its
responsibilities include:
● reviewing and recommending to the
Board for approval, the half-year
report, the annual report and
financial statements, results
announcements of the Group and any
other formal announcements relating
to the Group’s financial performance;

● reviewing the impact of changes in
accounting policies and standards;
● reviewing the Group’s systems of
internal financial control, risk
management policies and
procedures; 
● monitoring and reviewing the
requirement for an internal audit
function;
● considering the appointment of the
external auditors, overseeing the
process for their selection and
making recommendations to the
Board in relation to their
appointment;
● monitoring and reviewing the
effectiveness and independence of
the external auditors, agreeing the
nature and scope of their audit, their
remuneration and considering their
reports on the Group’s accounts and
systems of internal financial control
and risk management; and
● monitoring the Group’s whistle-
blowing procedures.
Main activities of the Audit
Committee
The Audit Committee met on seven
occasions in 2013 with other Board
members and the auditors attending as
required. In addition to fulfilling its
responsibilities as set out above, the
Committee also met to conclude the
tender process for a change of auditor,
recommending to the Board that KPMG
LLP be appointed as auditors.
Subsequent meetings were held with
KPMG LLP prior to their review of o2o’s
half-yearly results.
Change of auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC)
resigned as auditors with effect from
12 July 2013 and KPMG LLP were
appointed. As required by section 519
of the Companies Act 2006, PwC
provided a statement confirming the
circumstances and this was forwarded
to all shareholders on the register at
that point in time. The statement
confirmed there were no extenuating
circumstances. A resolution to appoint
KPMG LLP as auditors will be put to
shareholders at the next AGM.
Significant issues in relation to
the financial statements  
A number of prior year adjustments
have been made to the accounts further
to a review of certain accounting
treatments relative to best practice and
to provide greater transparency of the
Group's financial performance and
position.  As a consequence of these and
other changes, the prior year results
have been restated. Details are
provided in the Significant Accounting
Policies to the Accounts. In the current
financial year, there is an insignificant
impact. Overall the Board believes these
changes provide greater clarity and a
more appropriate reflection of
underlying financial performance.
The significant judgements considered
by the Committee in relation to the
2013 accounts, including those referred
to above, were as follows:
Intangible asset impairment
The carrying value of the Group’s
goodwill has been reviewed to
determine whether there is any
indication of impairment. The key
judgements, explored further in note 2
to the financial statements, are in
determining the forecasted cash flows,
the discount rate and the growth rate  in
underlying impairment models.
Following review and discussion with
management and the external auditors,
the Committee is satisfied that the
value in use of the CGUs exceeds the
carrying value of the intangible assets.
Revenue recognition
During the year, the Group took the
decision to revise its accounting policy
for the sale of software licences and
related maintenance services, changing
from instant recognition of such
revenues on delivery to recognition over
the contract term, to better reflect
industry practice.  Having made
appropriate enquiry, the Committee
concurs with this change in approach.
Accounting for supplier rebates and
catalogue contributions
The Committee considered the timing
of the recognition of advance supplier
rebates for contributions to catalogue
production and for other purchasing
agreements, together the rebates.
These amounts have grown in
significance in the recent past, so a
thorough review was carried out to
ensure that all such supplier
agreements were captured and that the
impact on prior years was thoroughly
understood.  Whilst we understand that
there are other companies in the office
products industry where recognition is
still immediately upon invoicing of the
rebate at the start of the contract
period, the Committee has
recommended that the policy will now
be to recognise both these advances
over the catalogue distribution or
purchasing period with which they are
associated. The Committee also
recommended that customer rebate
recognition should align more closely
with the relevant reporting period.
Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working
capital requirements through a
combination of the profits generated
and the credit facilities it enjoys with
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS),
committed until June 2015.  We agreed
with RBS to amend these facilities to
allow headroom for more rapid
execution of our reorganisation
programme.  The Group’s forecasts
indicate that we are able to operate
within the terms of the amended
facilities so that the Committee, after
discussion with management and the
external auditors, agree that continuing
adoption of the going concern basis is
appropriate in preparing these financial
statements.  The Directors have
considered the factors that impact the
Group’s future development,
performance, cash flows and financial
position along with the Company’s
liquidity in forming their opinion on the
going concern basis. The details of the
Directors’ assessment are also included
in the Significant Accounting Policies to
the Accounts.

Risk and opportunity
management – internal audit
function
A Risk and Opportunity function was
established in 2010 to deliver value to
the business by ensuring risk is
managed at every level throughout the
Group, reducing inefficiencies through
process improvements and optimising
the opportunities that this brings.
Individual managers have taken
responsibility for their respective areas
and a formal reporting procedure has
been established by the Risk and
Opportunity Manager. Overseeing this
function is the Risk and Opportunity
Committee, comprising Audit
Committee representatives, the Risk
and Opportunity Manager and those
Directors and managers responsible for
key priorities. It provides a forum for
discussion, enables progress to be
monitored and actions to be prioritised. 
The Committee does not consider it
necessary to have a separate internal
audit function and considers the Risk
and Opportunity approach will help
mitigate the principal risks and
uncertainties facing the Group which are
set out on pages 7 to 8 of the Strategic
Business Review.
The Risk and Opportunity Committee
met on two occasions during 2013 and,
more recently, in March 2014 to review
the risk register, consider the progress
made and reassess priorities.
Key priorities identified and completed
during the year were:
● the migration of IT servers to a
secure external hosting environment;
● the auto enrolment of pensions; and 
● harmonisation of the accounting
treatment of vendor funding
programmes.
Key risks and opportunities identified
and in progress are:
● changes in customer buying behavior
and the impact on revenue;
● the co-termination of the main
property leases at the end of 2014;
● re-financing; and
● the development and integration of
IT systems across the Group.
Review of whistle-blowing
policy
o2o has a whistle-blowing policy in place
which establishes a confidential channel
of communication for employees to
bring matters of concern about the
running of the business to the attention
of senior management. Upon being
notified of such a concern, the policy
sets out a defined process for full
investigation and, where necessary,
corrective action to be taken. The Audit
Committee reviews the whistle-blowing
policy on an annual basis.
No concerns were reported in the year
and following a review of the policy, no
changes were considered necessary. The
policy is available on the Company’s
website (www.office2office.co.uk).
Independence of external
auditors
Prior to the change of auditor in mid-
2013, PwC had been the Company’s
auditors since 2002 maintaining
independence through partner rotation
as required by the Auditing Practices
Board.  The appointment of KPMG LLP
upholds the independence required of
external auditors.  
The Committee will continue to review
the effectiveness and independence of
external auditors by:
● assessing KPMG LLP’s performance
on an annual basis through meetings
with key personnel;
● monitoring their independence and
objectivity by reviewing their
relationship with the Group and
ensuring Group policy is followed in
relation to the provision of non-audit
services; and
● reviewing anticipated future service
requirements and assessing their
ability to meet the requirement by
seeking opportunity to challenge,
question and confirm the new service
proposition.
The Committee meets the external
auditors; ahead of the audit to review
and approve scope and fees and obtain
written confirmation of their
independence; and following the audit,
without the executive Directors being
present to discusses the efficiency of
the audit process and any observations
they wish to share with the Committee.
Group policy on the provision of non-
audit services requires that, other than
for corporate taxation services,
approval is sought from the Committee
in advance of any engagement.  The
Committee will consider, taking into
account the scope of the work and level
of fees involved, whether the provision
of such non-audit services impairs the
independence and objectivity of KPMG
LLP .
As detailed in note 7 to the financial
statements, total fees paid to KPMG
LLP in 2013 were £177,000, of which
£93,000 related to audit fees and
£10,000 related to the 2013 interim
review. In addition, KPMG LLP were
engaged to perform taxation advisory
and compliance services for fees of
£27,000 and £27,000 respectively and
also audit related assurance services for
fees of £20,000. The Committee
approved all fees prior to the work being
undertaken. With regards to tax
services, these were provided by an
independent team and the Committee
was satisfied that the level of fees did
not prejudice KPMG LLP’s
independence.

Annual statement by the
Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee
This Directors Remuneration Report is
the first report prepared under the new
regulations. It sets out our policy on the
remuneration of executive Directors, for
approval by shareholders, as well as
reporting on the year ended 31
December 2013.
Policy
The objectives of the Remuneration
Committee and of the Board are that
remuneration policy and practice should
motivate, reward and retain executive
Directors and our senior management
generally as o2o’s leadership team,
should be fair and rewarding for all
employees and should align the
interests of our senior executives and all
our employees with the interests of our
shareholders.
Since o2o listed in 2004, our
remuneration package for executive
Directors has been a relatively simple
structure of salary, standard benefits,
pension, annual bonus and a long term
incentive scheme. This structure also
applies to the senior management.  
Unfortunately, o2o’s long term incentive
scheme, the Performance Share Plan
(PSP), has not been effective for
reasons that are not unique to o2o.  In
the early years after Listing we
generated enough free cash for a
progressive dividend policy but
nonetheless fell short of the rates of
growth in UEPS that we had applied to
the PSP as good market practice, while
it was difficult to find a truly
representative group for measuring
total shareholder return (TSR).  We
evolved performance targets to align
the scheme more closely to our
situation but UK recession, the decline
in the office supplies market and the
impact on our profitability have meant
that very few awards have reached the
threshold for vesting, despite out-
performing our peer group.   
We decided it would not be appropriate
to consider further changes in 2013,
given o2o’s performance during the year,
and as a consequence decided not to
grant any PSP awards in 2013 other
than for recruitment purposes. The PSP
in its current form reaches the end of its
10 year term in November 2015 and we
will consult with shareholders in
advance about how to replace it.    
We do not intend to change the other
elements of the remuneration package
for executive Directors in any material
respect in 2014.   For 2015, we will be
considering whether the balance
between our bonus arrangements and
the PSP is appropriate for o2o’s market
place. 
2013 summary 
Routine matters covered by the
Committee during the year included
annual salary reviews and bonus target
setting. In view of the limitations placed
on pay increases across the Group,
inflationary increases only were
awarded to the executive Directors in
2013. The annual cash bonus plan, which
is detailed below, covers the immediate
key objectives of the Group and was re-
set with 2013 targets.
The bonuses earned by the executive
Directors were in respect of working
capital and personal objectives.  The
bonuses earned by the Chief Operating
Officer and the Group Finance Director
were £17,460 and £26,000
respectively and will be paid in 2014.
The Chief Executive has waived his
entitlement to a bonus of £25,428.
The PSP awards granted in 2010 were
capable of vesting in 2013. However, as
explained later, the threshold levels of
performance were not met, resulting in
these awards lapsing during the year.
2014 expectations 
No changes are envisaged to be made to
the base salary levels of executive
Directors in 2014.
The bonus structure for the executive
Directors in 2014 will be targeted at
financial performance, progress
towards re-financing from June 2015 or
earlier and change management. The
same maximum bonus opportunities
employed last year (i.e. 100% of salary
for the Chief Executive and 60% of
salary for other executive Directors) will
apply.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
The PSP awards granted in 2011 have a
measurement period concluding in May
2014 and a vesting date of 20 June 2014
following which the Committee will decide
the extent to which they vest.
Directors
In 2013 there were two changes to the
Board and there has been a further change
in early 2014.
Mark Cunningham resigned as Group
Finance Director on 30 January 2013 and
the Board appointed Hugh Cawley to
succeed him in February of that year. Hugh
Cawley’s remuneration package was
commensurate with the role that the
Committee expected from the position
including a greater involvement with the
City. The Committee was conscious that
the package had to be suitably attractive to
recruit a high calibre candidate but also had
to be in line with the remuneration
structure for the current executive team.
As reported in the Chairman’s Statement
on page 3 David Callear sadly felt he must
step down as Chairman in November 2013
because of his wife’s terminal illness. I
recognise that my continued chairmanship
of the Remuneration Committee, now that I
am also Chairman of the Board, is contrary
to the UK Corporate Governance Code.
This was, however, the only practical
decision in the circumstances and was fully
supported by our advisors.  We would not
expect this arrangement to continue in the
long term and the Nomination Committee
will during 2014 consider how best to
appoint a new Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee.
As reported in the Nomination Committee
Report, Steve McKeever resigned on 10
March 2014 as Chief Operating Officer. 
Our remuneration policy is set out over
pages 25 to 29 and our implementation
report is set out over pages 30 to 36.
Shareholders will be asked to vote
separately on these at the Company’s AGM
on 29 May 2014. The remuneration policy
will be subject to a binding vote and the
Implementation Report will be subject to
an advisory vote.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 24 Remuneration Committee and its terms of reference
o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 25
The Remuneration Committee is a sub-committee of the Board.
Membership comprises Jim Cohen (Committee Chairman),
Chris Batterham and David Callear, all of whom are
independent of management and free from any business or
other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of
their independent judgement. As explained on page 17, since
taking the role of Chairman of the Board and notwithstanding
this is in breach of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Jim
Cohen continues to chair the Committee, although he is absent
from discussions concerning himself. When necessary, non-
committee members are invited to attend by prior
arrangement.  
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the
Company’s website (www.office2office.co.uk). 
The principal function of the Committee is to make
recommendations to the Board regarding the Company’s policy
on the remuneration, benefits and terms of employment of the
executive Directors. In addition, the Committee assists with the
recruitment and remuneration of new Board members and also
monitors the remuneration of senior management generally. 
The Committee met on seven occasions in the year and the
principal matters covered were:
● annual salary and performance bonus arrangements for
the executive Directors;
● determination of prior year target achievements; 
● termination payment to the previous Finance Director;
● remuneration package for the new Group Finance
Director;
● the grant of options under the SA YE scheme to all
employees in October 2013; and
● consideration of alternative long term incentives.
In determining remuneration packages and policies, due
regard is given to any legal requirements, the provisions
of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the UKLA
Listing Rules. The Committee sought independent advice
from its appointed advisors, Aon Hewitt Limited
(operating through the brand New Bridge Street) and
Macfarlanes LLP on an ad hoc basis rather than a retained
fee basis. Aon Hewitt Limited did not provide any other
services to the Company during the year under review.
Macfarlanes LLP are appointed by the Company to
provide advice on various other corporate and legal
matters. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice they received
during the year was objective and independent.
Remuneration policy in respect of
executive Directors is aimed to ensure
that the Group achieves its potential
and increases shareholder value.  
The remuneration packages are
designed to attract and retain high
calibre, skilled and experienced
individuals, to motivate them to manage
the affairs of the Group and to take the
business forward. A combination of
annual bonuses and long term incentives
is aimed to ensure immediate and longer
term objectives are met and to drive
exceptional performance in both the
short and the long term. Pensions and
other benefits are in keeping with the
business and industry.
Consideration of pay and conditions
for the wider Group
The Committee does not consult with
employees when formulating or
reviewing remuneration policy for the
executive Directors but does have
regard for the pay and employment
conditions across the Group generally,
including the basis of any salary
increases and, at a detailed level, the
remuneration of the senior management
team.  
Employee remuneration packages are
generally simpler than those of the
executive Directors, with salaries
reflecting local market rates for the
skills and experience employed.
Salaries are periodically reviewed to
ascertain their competitiveness and
although annual increases are not
guaranteed, discretionary increases
may be made based on merit.  o2o
operates a defined contribution pension
scheme which is open to all permanent
employees and complies with the
Government’s change in workplace
pension provision and auto-enrolment.
The Company’s defined benefit pension
scheme was closed to future accrual on
31 December 2011. Full details are
given in note 24 of the financial
statements. Other benefits and cash
incentives may apply according to the
nature of individual roles and functions.
Long term incentive awards are limited
to the senior management team on a 
discretionary basis to ensure an
alignment of interests with shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views
and ABI guidelines
The views of shareholders and the
guidelines of relevant authorities such as
the ABI are taken into account when
formulating and implementing
remuneration policy. Previously, the
Committee has consulted with key
shareholders and the ABI prior to
amending performance measures for long
term incentive awards and will continue
to do so with regards to any proposed
major change to executive remuneration.
Service agreements
The service agreements for all of the
executive Directors are on a rolling basis
and terminable on 12 months’ notice by
either party, with the right for the
Company to make a payment in lieu of
salary and benefits, excluding bonus, for
any unexpired period of notice.  These
payments may be made on a phased basis
and are subject to mitigation.

executives with the skills,
experience and motivation to
direct and manage the affairs of
the Group.
Reviewed and fixed annually, with
changes normally effective from
1 April, having taken account of
the performance of the individual,
changes in their responsibilities,
intended pay increases across the
Group and, when appropriate,
externally benchmarked against
salaries for similar jobs.
Salaries are periodically reviewed
to ascertain their
competitiveness. Any increases
will generally not exceed
prevailing rates of inflation.
None
Benefits
Contributes to an overall
competitive remuneration
package to attract and retain
executive Directors.  
Benefits include car and fuel
allowances, private medical
healthcare, life assurance,
provision of relocation assistance
if/when applicable. Other
benefits may be offered if
considered appropriate and
reasonable by the Committee.
The benefits are set at a level
comparable to those offered by
companies of a similar size for
similar roles. There is no
automatic annual increase
although they are periodically
reviewed to ensure they remain
competitive. The cost of providing
some benefits will be subject to
externally charged premiums.
None
Annual bonus
T o focus executive Directors on
the achievement of annual
financial business targets and
personal objectives.
T argets are renewed annually to
ensure they are aligned with the
short term objectives of the
Group and those areas of the
business over which the executive
Director has responsibility.
The bonus payable is determined
after the end of the relevant year
based on performance against
targets.
Up to 100% of base salary is
offered to the Chief Executive. Up
to 60% of base salary is offered
to other executive Directors.
The Committee retains discretion
over payment of each element of
the bonus.
A mix of financial, operational,
departmental and personal
performance metrics are used,
typically weighted to financial
targets with the primary aim of
encouraging and rewarding strong
and sustainable annual
performance. Sliding scales and
de minimis thresholds may apply. 
Long term incentive
Incentivises the executive
Directors in the achievement of
longer term objectives and
rewards exceptional
performance. 
Awards are generally, but not
always, made annually with actual
vesting dependent upon the
achievement of performance
conditions over a three year
period.
For awards granted prior to
2014, a provisional banking
arrangement is in place for the
achievement of targets during the
three year period, whereby each
element is measured after pre-
agreed trigger points. Actual
vesting will only occur three years
after the award was granted. 
Awards may be up to 100% of
salary, however the Committee
has discretion to make awards of
up to 200% of salary for
recruitment or retention
purposes.
The Committee has discretion on
whether and to what extent
targets have been met or, if an
exceptional event has occurred,
that the targets are no longer
appropriate.
The Committee will set such
targets, whether based on
financial and/or share price
performance targets as they
consider appropriate from time
to time to ensure that sustained
long term generation of
shareholder value is encouraged
and rewarded.

Remuneration policy table:  executive Directors
The remuneration policy , if approved by shareholders at the AGM on 29 May 2014, will apply with immediate effect until replaced by
a new or amended policy , but no longer than three years. Any commitments made by the Company prior to the approval and
implementation of this policy , but which are consistent with the policy in force at the time, will be honoured.
Each element of the remuneration policy for executive Directors is set out in the table below.
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 26 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 27
Base salary
No changes are envisaged to be made to
the base salary levels of executive
Directors in 2014.
Annual bonus
Performance conditions for the annual
bonus scheme focus on short term
objectives that can be measured in the
current financial year. These objectives
are typically concerned with improving
profitability and financial strength. The
performance metrics are a mix of
financial, operational and departmental
targets based on approved budgets and
on a sliding scale basis with a de minims
threshold. Recognising that each
executive Director has, in addition to
common Group objectives, different
areas of control and responsibility, an
element of bonus is aimed at the
achievement of individual or operational
objectives.
The Committee reserves discretion for
the payment of any element of the
bonus in the event of genuinely
unforeseen and exceptional trading
circumstances or where individual
performance merits. Any such
discretionary payments will not exceed
the maximum indicated in the policy
table.
The annual bonus for 2014 will operate
in accordance with the above policy with
performance metrics based on financial
performance, progress towards re-
financing from June 2015 or earlier and
change management. The targets
themselves relate to the 2014 financial
year and, as they are deemed to be
commercially sensitive, are not
disclosed. Performance against these
targets will be published in next year’s
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Long term incentives
As described above, the Company has
had a long term incentive plan, the
Performance Share Plan (PSP), in
operation since its approval by
shareholders in November 2005. The
PSP rules allow awards over Ordinary
shares, subject to performance criteria
and vesting in three years, to be made to
individuals. The number of Ordinary
shares awarded is calculated by
reference to the three day average of
the closing mid-market quotation of the
Company’s share price prior to the
award date. These awards are typically
structured as ‘nominal cost’ options with
an exercise price of 0.1p per share.
Performance targets are set at the time
of grant, however the Committee may,
under the plan rules, adjust performance
targets where they have become unfair
or impractical. The Committee may also
amend the performance target to take
account of exceptional circumstances
Additional notes to the remuneration policy table: executive Directors
but will consult with major shareholders
before doing so. 
In its current form the PSP will expire in
November 2015 although outstanding
awards granted under this plan will
continue to operate under its terms and
conditions. It is likely that a resolution to
approve a new plan will be put to
shareholders at the 2015 AGM. 
Pension
Pension contributions of up to 10 % of
basic salary are paid to the individual
pension scheme of the executive
Director. No additional benefits are
payable by the Company in the event of
early retirement. 
Save as you earn share plan (SA YE)
The Group operates an HMRC approved
SA YE scheme open to all employees,
including the executive Directors, who
have been employed within the Group
for a minimum of six months. There are
currently four plans in operation: three
year and five year plans launched in
2011 and 2013.  The SA YE scheme in
its current form will expire in
September 2014 although its
provisions shall nevertheless continue in
full force and effect in relation to
options then subsisting. It is likely that a
new SA YE scheme will be put to
shareholders at the 2015 AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
Illustration of application of remuneration policy for different performance
scenarios
The new regulations require an illustration to be provided of the potential value of
the executive Directors’ remuneration packages based on three performance
scenarios.
These charts are indicative only. Share price movement which impact the value of PSP
awards, has been excluded. Assumptions made for each scenario are as follows:
Min – fixed remuneration only (i.e. latest known salary, benefits and pension).
T arget – fixed remuneration plus 50% of maximum annual bonus opportunity and
50% vesting of PSP awards. A PSP award of 100% of salary has been used for the
purposes of this illustration.
Max – fixed remuneration plus maximum annual bonus opportunity and full vesting of
PSP awards. A PSP award of 100% of salary has been used for the purposes of this
illustration. 
Policy for holding external appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold external appointments providing these do
not interfere with the business of the Group on a time or conflict of interest basis. The
executive Directors are required to declare any such appointments to the Board in
advance of accepting the appointment. Any fees received may be retained directly by
the individual.
Policy for payment on loss of office
The key principle in determining
payments for loss of office will be the
contractual entitlement. Any
extenuating circumstances would be
dealt with on a case by case basis
although no payments would be made
that could be construed as a reward for
poor performance. Payment in lieu of
salary and benefits may be staged over
any unexpired period of notice, during
which time the executive Director must
take all reasonable steps to mitigate
through alternative employment. 
There is no automatic entitlement to
annual bonus, although the Committee
has discretion over the payment of any
annual bonus in respect of the financial
year of cessation, based on
performance against pre-determined
targets set and taking into account the
timing and circumstances of the
cessation of office.
Generally any outstanding share awards
granted under the Company’s PSP
scheme, will lapse upon cessation of
employment. There are some exceptions
to this, notably ‘good leaver’ provisions
and on a change of control.
Good leaver provisions provide the
Committee with discretion to allow the
awards to vest or become exercisable
either on the date falling six months
after the date of cessation of
employment or on the vesting date, to
the extent the Committee determines
that the performance targets have been
satisfied with a pro rata reduction to
reflect the proportion of the
performance period not served
(although the Committee has the
discretion to determine such higher or
lower proportion as appropriate).
In the event of a change of control or
takeover, all awards granted under the
PSP vest or become exercisable to the
extent that the performance targets
have been satisfied, as determined by
the Committee, with a pro rata
reduction to reflect the proportion of
the performance period not served,
unless determined otherwise by the
Committee.

The Committee has similar discretion in
determining the extent to which awards
vest or become exercisable upon the
passing of a resolution to wind up the
Company. Upon a re-organisation, the
Committee has discretion to allow the
awards to be exchanged for options
over shares in the new holding company,
on such terms determined by the
Committee
Approach to recruitment
remuneration
The composition of a remuneration
package for the appointment of a new
director would be determined by the
Committee, having considered where
appropriate, any advice from
remuneration or recruitment
consultants. Generally, all of the
elements tabled on page 26 would be
offered.  The base salary would take due
account of all the relevant
circumstances such as the previous
incumbent’s salary, prevailing market
rates and the experience of the recruit.
Initial annual bonus arrangements would
take into account the timing of the
appointment and the validity of targets
in common with other executive
Directors but would be subject to the
maximum stated in the policy table.
Under the PSP rules, an award of up to
200% of basic salary may be offered to
a new recruit if the Committee
considered this necessary and in
shareholders’ interests, along with
temporary living allowances or
relocation assistance.  The Committee
retains discretion to make appropriate
remuneration decisions to meet
individual circumstances of the recruit
such as an offer of similar benefits to, or
the buy-out of forfeited benefits from,
previous employment. However, when
determining the amount of any buy-out
arrangement (which could be provided
under the PSP or utilising rule 9.4.2 of
the UKLA Listing Rules), the Committee
will take full account of the size and
structure of awards forfeited from
previous employment. In addition, if a
director is recruited from overseas, the
Committee retains discretion to accord
with standard remuneration practice of
their country of residence.
The above policy applies to both internal
promotions and external appointments
to the Board. If necessary, to cover
short-term situations, the Committee
may make interim appointments or
appoint a non-executive Director to an
executive function.
Service agreements for newly
appointed executive Directors could be
terminable on 6 months’ notice by either
party during any probationary period,
but are likely to be extended to 12
months’ notice after satisfactory
completion of this period.
Purpose and link
to strategy
Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Attract and retain high-calibre
individuals.
Basic fees and additional fees for
chairmanship of Board
Committees and to the Senior
Independent Director, are
reviewed periodically.
Some benefits such as car
allowance and healthcare may
also be provided.
No entitlement to pension
benefits or participation in Group
incentive schemes or employee
share plans.
Fees paid reflect the expected
commitment and contribution of
the roles and are positioned
against comparable roles in
companies of a similar size. 
Although annual increases are not
prescribed any made would not
exceed prevailing rates of
inflation.
Additional payments may be
made for time commitments over
and above contract terms.

Remuneration policy table: non-executive Directors (including Chairman)
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Chief Executive and the remuneration of
the Chairman is determined by the non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive.
Generally, three year renewable service agreements are offered to non-executive Directors, terminable on three months’ notice
by either party.  Upon immediate termination by the Company, three months’ fees may be paid in lieu of notice. After a maximum
of three terms on this basis, the non-executive Directors may continue on renewable one year agreements, subject to annual re-
election by shareholders. 
See resolution 3 of the AGM notice in respect of the above Directors’ remuneration policy.

Additional notes to the single total figure table of Directors’ remuneration earned in 2013 - audited
Salary and fees
Simon Moate and Steve McKeever received a 2.5% increase in salary with effect from 1 April 2013.
Hugh Cawley receives a basic annual salary of £200,000. The above figure represents salary paid from when he joined the Board
on 25 February 2013.
Mark Cunningham resigned from the Board on 30 January 2013 and was paid monthly to the end of July after which, in
accordance with his contractual terms, a lump sum settlement was made. The table above includes 12 months’ pay in lieu of
notice. For further details see page 24.
In 2012, David Callear received an increase in fees for additional time commitments in managing strategic activity and this was
adjusted upon a return to normal time requirements during 2013. In the latter part of 2013, following the change in chairmanship
of the Board, Jim Cohen’s annual fee was increased from £56,650 to £115,000 to reflect the change in his responsibilities and
time commitment. David Callear’s annual fee was reduced from £137,500 to £55,000 inclusive of a £5,000 fee for his continued
chairmanship of the Nomination Committee. 
Benefits
T axable benefits comprised car benefits and private healthcare. The executive Directors also have life assurance at the rate of
four times annual salary. This is not a taxable benefit.
In accordance with his contractual terms, Mark Cunningham continued to receive taxable benefits to the end of July 2013. 
Annual bonus
The following targets and proportion of bonus entitlement applied to the executive Directors in 2013:
Performance measure and
maximum percentage of bonus
Performance targets Actual performance Actual percentage of bonus
achieved
40% - growth in UEPS 15% of the bonus entitlement
payable on achieving 90% of
budgeted UEPS rising to 40% on
achieving 110% of budgeted
UEPS with pro-rating between
these points.
The UEPS growth target was not
achieved. 
Nil
25% - net debt management
(year end and average month end
targets)
40% of this element payable for
achieving an annual average month
end net debt target, and the
maximum bonus entitlement for
achieving an improved lower level
of net debt. Pro-rating applies
between these points.
Whilst the year end net debt was
better than budget, the annual
average net debt was skewed by
higher balances at the start of the
year and hence the target for
average net debt was not
achieved.
Nil
15% - working capital
management
A bonus of up to 5% each for
achieving working capital days for
debtors, creditors and stock
within a budgeted range.
The year end and annual average
stock days achieved were better
than target. Debtor days and
creditor days achieved were
outside the budgeted range.
Simon Moate* – 5%
Steve McKeever – 3%
Hugh Cawley – 3%
20% - personal objectives Specific to each Director’s role
and responsibility.
The achievement of individual
targets is considered
commercially sensitive and is not
disclosed.
Simon Moate* – 2.8%
Steve McKeever – 6%
Hugh Cawley – 10%
*Simon Moate has waived his entitlement to a bonus of £25,428 that would otherwise have been paid.

*Further to Steve McKeever and Mark Cunningham leaving the Company , under the terms of the PSP , their awards have lapsed.
In accordance with the PSP rules, the number of shares awarded is determined by reference to the three day average of the
closing mid-market quotation of the Company’s share price prior to the award date.
PSP awards granted in 2010 
The number of shares granted in 2010 were based on 100% of salary using an average share price of 155.5p. The performance
criteria, as measured over the three year period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012, were based, in an 80:20 proportion,
on: (i) UEPS growth in excess of RPI; and (ii) a comparative measure of TSR against companies in the FTSE Small Cap Index.
Neither targets were achieved and the awards lapsed without vesting in 2013.
PSP awards granted in 2011 and thereafter
In 2011, following consultation with key shareholders and the ABI, the PSP became a two part scheme with Part A and Part B
awards.
Part A awards have performance measurements split equally between growth in UEPS and share price.
The UEPS component is split into three equal tranches to be measured annually. Each tranche will provisionally vest 50% for
achieving a minimum UEPS growth target. Proportionate provisional vesting will occur on a straight-line basis for UEPS growth
up to a higher level target.
The share price component is tested on five occasions during the three year performance period. If the share price hits an agreed
average price in the 30 day period following the announcement of results (average share price*) then between 20% and 100% of
this component will provisionally vest.  
The purpose of Part B awards was to provide a recruitment and retention incentive. These have no performance conditions
attached but are subject to an underpin as determined by the Committee. 
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 32 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 33
PSP awards granted in 2011
In 2011, Part A and Part B awards, each to the value of 100% of salary were granted to Simon Moate and Steve McKeever. The
total number of shares was determined using an average share price of 133.5p. The performance targets for Part A awards were
as follows: 
UEPS growth over RPI Extent to which tranche Average Extent of provisional 
provisionally vests share price* vesting
4% 50% 160p 20%
8% 100% 200p 30%
240p 100%
Further to an average share price* of 160p being achieved in the period following the announcement of the 2011 final results,
20% of the Part A award (10% of the whole PSP award) provisionally vested.  The PSP awards are due to vest on 20 June 2014
following which the Committee will decide the extent to which they vest. As mentioned above, the awards granted to Steve
McKeever will lapse.
PSP awards granted in 2012
The PSP awards granted in 2012 to Simon Moate and Steve McKeever were Part A awards to the value of 100% of salary. The
total number of shares was determined using an average share price of 137.5p. The same performance targets as 2011 apply
and they have a vesting date of September 2015. T o date, there has been no provisional vesting.  As mentioned above, the awards
granted to Steve McKeever will lapse.
PSP awards granted in 2013
Other than those awarded to Hugh Cawley following his appointment, no PSP awards were granted in 2013. Hugh Cawley’s PSP
award of 214,670 shares at a share price of 93.2p was equivalent to 100% of salary, split equally between Part A and Part B
awards. Performance targets for the Part A award are as below:
UEPS growth over RPI Extent to which tranche Average Extent of provisional 
provisionally vests share price* vesting
4% 50% 107p 20%
8% 100% 134p 30%
161p 100%
*average share price as referred to above and re-based proportionately, from the 2011 targets, to the share price at the date of
grant in April 2013.
The first measurements will be made after the announcement of the 2013 full year results.
Pension
Pension contributions to the executive Directors’ personal pension schemes were made at a rate of 10% of basic salary. None of
the executive Directors have arrangements under the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme or the defined benefit
pension scheme which is now closed.

The executive Directors are eligible to participate in o2o’s SA YE schemes on the same terms as other employees. During the year,
Simon Moate and Steve McKeever elected to cancel their existing SA YE savings contracts, in order to join the new SA YE scheme
launched in October 2013. The options granted during the year were with an exercise price of 45.4p per share, being a 20%
discount on the closing share price immediately prior to the launch. Being eligible, Hugh Cawley also joined the new scheme. All of
the executive Directors are saving the current maximum monthly amount of £250 in the 5 year scheme. As mentioned above, the
options granted to Steve McKeever will lapse.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the members
of office2office plc 
Opinions and conclusions
arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial
statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial
statements of office2office plc for the
year ended 31 December 2013 which
comprise the Consolidated Income
Statement, the Consolidated Statement
of Comprehensive Income, the
Consolidated and Company Balance
Sheets,  the Consolidated and Company
Statements of Cash Flows, the
Consolidated Statement of Changes in
Equity, the Company Statement of
Changes in Equity and the related notes.
In our opinion:  
● the financial statements give a true
and fair view of the state of the
Group’s and of the Company’s affairs
as at 31 December 2013 and of the
Group’s profit for the year then
ended;  
● the Group financial statements have
been properly prepared in
accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
● the Company financial statements
have been properly prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the EU and as applied in accordance
with the provisions of the Companies
Act 2006; and 
● the financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act
2006 and, as regards the Group
financial statements, Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of
material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on
the financial statements the risks of
material misstatement that had the
greatest effect on our audit were as
follows:
Valuation of goodwill (£50,523k)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report,
the accounting policy and note 12
(financial disclosure).
● The risk – The carrying value of
goodwill is a significant part of the
net assets of the Group.  The Group
has experienced lower than expected
profitability over the last few years
and there is a risk of impairment of
the Group’s goodwill.  Goodwill is
assessed for impairment using a
discounted cash flow model to
calculate a value in use.  Due to the
inherent uncertainty involved in
forecasting and discounting future
cash flows, which are the basis of the
assessment of the valuation, this is
one of the key judgemental areas
that our audit focused on. 
● Our response – Our audit procedures
included, among others, challenging
the budgeting procedures upon
which the forecasts are based and
the principles and integrity of the
models used and assessing whether
they were consistent with the
forecasts used to support the going
concern assumption (see below).  We
explain below the work performed in
respect of the budgets in our
response to the going concern and
financing arrangements risk.  We also
assessed the longer term
assumptions including projected
growth rates, cost inflation, discount
rates and the other key inputs,
including the potential risk of
management bias, and considered
the market capitalisation of the
Group.  We assessed the adequacy of
the Group’s disclosures (see Note
12) in respect of impairment testing
and whether disclosures about the
sensitivity of the outcome of the
impairment assessment to changes
in key assumptions properly
reflected the risks inherent in the key
assumptions and the requirements
of relevant accounting standards.
Accounting for supplier rebates and
catalogue contributions (£177k and
£61k respectively)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report,
the accounting policies and the Changes
in Accounting Policies and Restatement
section of Significant Accounting
Policies (financial disclosure).
● The risk – The Group has a number of
complex agreements with suppliers
which include rebates from these
suppliers if certain conditions are
met and catalogue contributions.
There is often judgement required in
allocating the rebate and
contributions between accounting
periods due to the complexity of the
contractual conditions.    The Group
has changed its accounting
treatment in the year in respect of
certain supplier rebates and
catalogue contributions such that
their recognition should more closely
align with the relevant reporting
period and this has given rise to
certain prior year adjustments, as
described in the Changes in
Accounting Policies and
Restatement section of Significant
Accounting Policies.  The treatment
of these rebates and contributions
could impact the timing and quantum
of cost of sales, other operating
income and profits recognised in
each period and is therefore
considered to be a significant audit
risk.
● Our response – Our audit procedures
included, among others, obtaining a
list of all supplier rebates and
catalogue contributions and testing a
sample of the significant contracts.
Our contract analysis focused on
assessing the key clauses in the
contracts in relation to rebates and
contributions and evaluating the
Directors’ documentation of their
judgements in determining the timing
and treatment of the rebate and
contribution recognition. We have
assessed the disclosure of cost of
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp1_39_v10_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp1_33  11/04/2014  14:37  Page 37 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 38
sales and other operating income in
the financial statements and agreed
this to underlying documentation and
have considered the appropriateness
and consistent application of the
revised accounting treatment.   
Revenue recognition (£231,887k)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report,
the accounting policy, the Changes in
Accounting Policies and Restatement
section of Significant Accounting
Policies and note 3 (financial
disclosures).
● The risk – The Group’s results include
contracted revenues for software for
which the timing of recognition is
judgemental due to the performance
periods often not being contractually
prescribed. The judgements relating
to these revenues do impact the
timing and quantum of revenue and
profit recognised in each period. The
Group has re-assessed the
appropriateness of its policies
relating to this source of income and
this has given rise to certain prior
year adjustments, as described in the
Changes in Accounting Policies and
Restatement section of Significant
Accounting Policies.  
● Our response – Our audit procedures
included, among others, obtaining a
list of all such revenue and critically
assessing significant contracts.  Our
contract assessments focused on
key contractual terms and evaluating
the Directors’ documentation of their
judgements in determining the timing
of the revenue recognition, through
determining the nature of any
performance criteria and confirming
the recognition is consistent with the
Group’s accounting policies. We have
also evaluated the timing of
contracted cashflows in respect of
these revenues and any impact on
the recognition of revenue.  We have
assessed the disclosure of revenue in
the financial statements and agreed
this to underlying documentation.  
Going concern and financing
arrangements
Refer to the Audit Committee Report,
the accounting policy, note 2, note 20
and the Going Concern section of
Significant Accounting Policies
(financial disclosure).
● The risk – The financial statements
explain how the Directors have
formed the judgement that the going
concern basis is appropriate in
preparing the financial statements of
the Company and the Group.  The
Group had bank debt of £23,587k as
at 31 December 2013. The related
facilities include certain covenants,
which have been amended favourably
for the Group subsequent to the year
end and with which the Group was in
compliance at the year end. The
Directors have concluded that,
particularly in view of the revised
banking agreement, the degree of
uncertainty attached to whether the
going concern basis is appropriate is
not material. As this assessment
involves consideration of future
events, there is a risk that the
Directors’ judgement is inappropriate
and that the uncertainty should have
been assessed as material, in which
case additional disclosures would
have been required.
● Our response – Our audit procedures
included, among others, obtaining
and analysing the revised banking
agreements in order to understand
the covenants.  We assessed the
Group’s accuracy in forecasting in
prior periods through comparison to
actual results in order to obtain an
understanding of the accuracy of the
budgeting process, and challenged
the Group’s cash flow and covenant
forecasts, which cover the period
from the date of approval of these
financial statements until 30 June
2015. We also discussed with the
Directors, the Group’s plans beyond
this point.  We assessed the
appropriateness of the assumptions
underlying the forecasts, including
assumptions over revenue, margins,
costs, discount rates and cash flow
timings, using our knowledge of the
Group and its industry with reference
to both internal management
information and externally derived
data and benchmarks.  We evaluated
the level of headroom between the
cash flow forecasts and available
facilities and in respect of the
revised covenants.  We evaluated the
sensitivity analysis performed by the
Group around revenue, costs and
other key assumptions and also
performed our own further
sensitivities, where appropriate, to
understand the level of headroom
within the revised facilities.  We also
assessed the adequacy of the
Group’s disclosures relating to the
use of the going concern basis of
preparation and the associated risks.
3. Our application of materiality and
an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial
statements as a whole was set at
£350,000.  This has been determined
using a benchmark of Group revenue (of
which it represents 0.15%), which we
consider to be one of the principal
considerations for members of the
Company in assessing the financial
performance of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to
report to it all corrected and
uncorrected misstatements we
identified through our audit with a value
in excess of £17,500, in addition to
other audit misstatements below that
threshold that we believe warranted
reporting on qualitative grounds.
The group audit team audited the Group
as if it was a single aggregated set of
financial information. The audit was
performed using the materiality level
set out above and covered 100% of
total Group revenue, Group profit
before taxation, and total Group assets.

4. Our opinion on other matters
prescribed by the Companies Act
2006 is unmodified  
In our opinion:  
● the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited
has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act
2006; and
● the information given in the Strategic
Report and the Directors’ Report for
the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial
statements.  
5. We have nothing to report in
respect of the matters on which we
are required to report by exception  
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are
required to report to you if, based on the
knowledge we acquired during our audit,
we have identified other information in
the annual report that contains a
material inconsistency with either that
knowledge or the financial statements,
a material misstatement of fact, or that
is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report
to you if: 
● we have identified material
inconsistencies between the
knowledge we acquired during our
audit and the Directors’ statement
that they consider that the annual
report and financial statements
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the
information necessary for
shareholders to assess the Group’s
performance, business model and
strategy; or
● the Audit Committee Report does
not appropriately address matters
communicated by us to the Audit
Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are
required to report to you if, in our
opinion:  
● adequate accounting records have
not been kept by the Company, or
returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not
visited by us; or  
● the Company financial statements
and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited
are not in agreement with the
accounting records and returns; or  
● certain disclosures of directors’
remuneration specified by law are not
made; or  
● we have not received all the
information and explanations we
require for our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required
to review:
● the Directors’ statement in relation to
going concern; and
● the part of the Corporate Governance
Statement relating to the Company’s
compliance with the nine provisions
of the 2010 UK Corporate
Governance Code specified for our
review.
We have nothing to report in respect of
the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’
Responsibilities Statement, the
Directors are responsible for the

office2office plc (the Company) and its
subsidiaries (the Group) provide managed
procurement and business critical
services. The Group operates in the
United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
The Company is a public limited company ,
which is listed on the London Stock
Exchange and is incorporated and
domiciled in the United Kingdom. The
address of its registered office is St
Crispins, Duke Street, Norwich, NR3 1PD.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies applied
in the preparation of these consolidated
financial statements, and applied by the
Company as appropriate, are set out
below. These policies have been
consistently applied to all the years
presented, unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements
of the Group and the individual financial
statements of the Company have been
prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU),
IFRS-IC (IFRS Interpretations
Committee) interpretations and the
Companies Act 2006 as applicable to
companies reporting under IFRS. The
consolidated financial statements have
been prepared under the historical cost
convention.
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with IFRS
requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement
in the process of applying the Group’s
accounting policies. The areas
involving a higher degree of judgement
or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are
significant to the consolidated
financial statements, are disclosed in
note 2.
Going concern
The Directors, in their detailed
consideration of going concern, have
reviewed the Group’s future cash
forecasts and revenue projections,
which they believe are based on prudent
market data and past experience, and
believe, based on those forecasts and
projections, that it is appropriate to
prepare the financial statements of the
Company and the Group on a going
concern basis. 
In arriving at this conclusion the
Directors considered the Group’s
financing arrangements, which comprise
a term loan of £12.5 million, revolving
credit facility of £3m and £30 million of
asset backed bank facilities committed
to June 2015. 
During the year the Group generated
£7m from both trading and a large
series of sustainable detailed actions.
This focus on cash continues and we
anticipate continuing to generate cash
in the future.  One of the main
applications of cash during the year was
repayment of £4m of bank debt.  The
next repayment is currently scheduled
for December 2014 when £1.5m is due
to be repaid.  The balance of the term
loan is then scheduled to be repaid in
June 2015.  
The Company has started discussions
with its Lender, well ahead of the expiry
date, regarding the refinancing of these
facilities. Both the Company and its
Lender are committed to the
refinancing of both the term loan and
the other facilities on suitable terms
and no matters have been drawn to the
Company’s attention to suggest that a
refinancing will not be forthcoming on
acceptable terms. The related facilities,
including certain covenants, have been
amended favourably for the Group
subsequent to the year end.
In contemplation of revised debt
facilities the company has prepared
detailed cash flow forecasts to the end
of 2016.  Sales volumes, the impact of
ongoing restructuring and trading
continuing to follow current trends, are
key assumptions in these forecasts and
relevant sensitivities have been applied.
The existing bank facilities are subject
to just two basic financial covenants set
by the Lender. At the date of this report
the Group has complied in all respects
with the terms of its borrowing
agreements, including its financial
covenants, and forecasts to continue to
do so. 
Consequently, the Directors have a
reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group will continue to
comply with the covenants in their
facilities and they have adequate
resources to meet their liabilities as
they fall due for a period of at least 12
months from the date of approval of the
financial statements. For this reason,
they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.

IFRS 11, ‘ Joint arrangements’ .
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which
the Group has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies
generally accompanying a shareholding
of more than one half of the voting
rights. The existence and effect of
potential voting rights that are currently
exercisable or convertible are
considered when assessing whether the
Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from
the date on which control is transferred
to the Group. They are de-consolidated
from the date that control ceases.
The subsidiary undertakings included
within these financial statements are
shown in note 14 to the financial
statements.
The acquisition method of accounting is
used to account for business
combinations. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the fair value of the
assets given, equity instruments issued
and liabilities incurred or assumed at
the date of exchange. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a
business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date, irrespective of the
extent of any minority interest. The
excess of the cost of the acquisition
over the fair value of the Group’s share
of the identifiable net assets acquired is
recorded as goodwill. If the cost of the
acquisition is less than the fair value of
the net assets of the subsidiary
acquired, the difference is recognised
directly in the income statement.
Directly attributable costs associated
with a business combination are
recognised in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and
unrealised gains on transactions between
Group companies are eliminated on
consolidation. Unrealised losses on
transactions between Group companies
are also eliminated but are considered for
impairment purposes in respect of the
asset transferred. Accounting policies of
subsidiaries have been aligned where
necessary to ensure consistency with the
policies adopted by the Group.
Changes in accounting policies
and restatement
The Group has adopted the following
changes in accounting policies and
restatements:
●
Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation
of Items of Other Comprehensive
Income (see (a))
●
IAS 19 – Employee Benefits (2011)
(see (b))
●
Amendment to the revenue
accounting policy – Sale of software
(see (c))
●
Amendment to the treatment
relating to supplier rebates and
contributions for catalogue
production (see (d))
●
Amendment to the treatment
relating to customer rebate
recognition (see (e))
●
Amendment to the prior year
accruals for goods received not
invoiced (see (f))
●
IFRS 13 – Fair V alue Measurement
(see (g))
(a) Presentation of items of other
comprehensive income
As a result of the amendments to IAS 1,
the Group has modified the presentation
of items of other comprehensive income
in its statement of comprehensive
income, to present separately items that
would be reclassified to profit or loss in
the future from those that would never
be. Comparative information has also
been re-presented accordingly .
The adoption of the amendment to IAS
1 has no impact on the recognised
assets, liabilities and comprehensive
income of the Group.
(b) Defined benefit plans
As a result of the modifications to IAS
19, the Group can no longer use the
corridor approach to account for
actuarial gains and losses arising on its
defined benefit pension scheme liability
which are now recognised immediately
within other comprehensive income. The
Group will immediately recognise all
past service costs; and replace interest
cost and expected return on plan assets
with a net interest amount that is
calculated by applying the discount rate to
the net defined benefit liability.
Further details of the effect of the change
are set out in note (h) below.
(c) Sale of software
During the period the Group reassessed
the appropriateness of its accounting
policy in respect of the sale of software
licences and related maintenance services.
Previously, where collection of payments
was deemed likely, then both licence and
maintenance revenues were recognised on
initial delivery of the software. Under the
new policy, both licence and maintenance
revenues will be recognised over the
contracted term of the licence, better
reflecting industry practice.
Further details of the effect of the change
are set out in note (h) below.
(d) Supplier rebates and contributions
for catalogue production
Supplier contract rebates, being payments
received from suppliers as part of
purchasing agreements, and contributions
for catalogue production are treated as
deductions in cost of sales and other
operating income, respectively . In the past
they have been recognised upon receipt of
payment when there has been no future
liability or commitment towards future
purchases, or purchases at uneconomic
pricing. The Group has taken the decision to
defer the recognition of these payments and
amortise them over, respectively , the life of
the supplier contract or the catalogue
distribution period. The Group believes this
change provides more appropriate
recognition of its obligations and underlying
financial performance.
Further details of the effect of the change
are set out in note (h) below.
(e) Customer rebate recognition
Customer rebates are not recognised
where the probability of payment is
considered remote. Management have
reconsidered the method by which they
assess the likelihood of payment,
following a number of payments being
identified where the rebate provided was
insufficient, which has resulted in
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 47 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 48
Significant Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2013
additional rebates being recognised.
The Group has revised its approach so
as to better assess any liabilities due
under such rebate agreements.
Further details of the effect of the
change are set out in note (h) below.
(f) Remeasurement of prior year
accrual relating to goods received
not invoiced
Following a review of invoices posted in
2013 relating to 2012, it was
established that the goods received not
invoiced accrual of £8,251,000 had
been understated by £594,000.  The
prior year balances have been restated
to correct this error. There is no impact
on the financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2013.
Further details of the effect of the
change are set out in note (h) below.
(g) Fair value measurement
IFRS 13 establishes a single framework
for measuring fair value and making
disclosures about fair value
measurements, when such
measurements are required or permitted
by other IFRSs. In particular, it unifies the
definition of fair value as the price at
which an orderly transaction to sell an
asset or to transfer a liability would take
place between market participants at the
measurement date. It also replaces and
expands the disclosure requirements
about fair value measurements in other
IFRSs, including IFRS 7, ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosures’ .
IFRS 13 is applied prospectively and
has had no material impact on the
accounts in the current year.
(h) Summary of quantitative impact
The following tables summarise the
impacts resulting from the above
changes in accounting policies on the
Group’s financial position, profit and
comprehensive income. Adjustments
have been reflected in the restated
Consolidated Income Statement,
Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income, Consolidated
Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement
of Changes in Equity and earnings per
share for the year ended 31 December
2012 for these amounts.  There is no
effect on the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows.

Significant Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2013
Revenue
Revenue is measured by reference to
the fair value of consideration received
by the Group from goods supplied and
services provided to external
customers. Revenue is stated after
deducting rebates, returns and other
similar discounts, and after eliminating
sales between Group companies and is
exclusive of value added tax. Revenue is
recognised upon the performance of
services or when the significant risks
and rewards of ownership are
transferred to a customer, which occurs
on delivery of goods or in the case of ex-
works arrangements, when custody of
goods is transferred to the customers’
logistics provider.
Supply of goods
Our Managed Procurement segment
provides a stock and distribution
operation for the supply of stationery
and office products, furniture and
technology products. Revenue is
recognised once the delivery to the
customer has been completed. 
Supply of services
Our Business Critical Services segment
is a service based operation providing
print management, document
management, marketing services, direct
marketing and professional consultancy
and on and off site shredding services.
The value attributed to the service is
determined through contractual prices
agreed prior to the commencement of
the work with the customer. Where
there are retained customer
arrangements and a range of services
are provided, the revenue for each
separate service is recognised when all
the elements of that service are
complete, with amounts accrued or
deferred on the balance sheet as
appropriate; each separate service is
generally subject to specific pricing.
Supply of software licences and
related maintenance services
A small part of our Business Critical
Services segment relates to the sale of
software licences and related support
and maintenance services.  Revenue is
recognised over the contractual term of
the agreement with the customer, with
amounts accrued or deferred on the
balance sheet as appropriate.
Supplier admin fees and rebates
Supplier admin fees are recognised in
our Business Critical Services as a
supplier management charge and
recognised as revenue against the
period to which purchasing relates.
Supplier rebates are amounts received
from suppliers in our Managed
Procurement segment and recognised
as a deduction in product cost against
the period to which purchasing relates.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a
manner consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker.  The chief
operating decision-maker, which is
responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating
segments, has been identified as the
Executive Board of Directors.
Foreign currency translation
The financial information in this report
is presented in Sterling, the functional
and presentational currency of the
Company, rounded to the nearest
thousand.
Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into Sterling
at the rate of exchange ruling at the
date of transaction. All realised foreign
exchange differences are taken to the
income statement. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into Sterling
at the rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date and differences are
recognised in the income statement.
The results and financial position of
the Group entities that have a
functional currency different from the
presentational currency are translated
into the presentational currency as
follows:
●
assets and liabilities for each balance
sheet presented are translated at the
closing rate at the date of that
balance sheet;
●
income and expenses for each
income statement are translated at
average exchange rates (unless this
average is not a reasonable
approximation of the cumulative
effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case
income and expenses are translated
at the rate on the dates of the
transactions); and
●
all resulting exchange differences are
recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income.
Other operating income
Contributions for catalogue production
are recognised over the life of the
catalogue distribution period. Catalogue
distribution periods run for one year.
Contributions for catalogue production
are recognised as other operating
income.
Non-recurring costs
Non-recurring costs are those
significant items which are separately
disclosed by virtue of their size or
incidence to enable a full understanding
of the Group’s financial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to non-
recurring costs are principally
restructuring related and business
start-up or closure costs, costs in
respect of key management changes,
transaction costs incurred in respect of
business combinations, gains or losses
on disposal of trading activities and
costs associated with the closure of
employee pension schemes.
Business combinations and
goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation
represents the excess of the cost of
an acquisition over the fair value of the
Group’s share of the net assets/net
liabilities of the acquired subsidiary at
the date of acquisition. If the cost of
acquisition is less than the fair value
of the Group’s share of the net
assets/net liabilities of the acquired
entity (i.e. a discount on acquisition)
then the difference is credited to the
income statement in the period of
acquisition.  Goodwill is allocated to
cash generating units for the purposes
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 51 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 52
Significant Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2013
of impairment testing and is tested
annually for impairment (refer to
impairment of assets policy) and
carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. 
At the acquisition date of a subsidiary,
goodwill acquired is recognised as an
asset and is allocated to each of the
cash-generating units expected to
benefit from the business
combination’s synergies and to the
lowest level at which management
monitors the goodwill. 
On disposal of a subsidiary the
attributable amount of goodwill is
included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill acquired up to 31 December
2003 was capitalised and amortised
over its useful economic life. As
permitted by IFRS1, ‘First-time
Adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards’ , the classification
and accounting treatment of business
combinations made prior to 1 January
2004 was not amended on transition to
IFRS. Under IFRS, goodwill has an
indefinite useful economic life and is not
subject to amortisation.
Other intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets
as part of business combinations at
fair value at the date of acquisition.
The determination of these fair values
is based upon management’s
judgement and includes assumptions
on the timing and amount of future
incremental cash flows generated by
the assets acquired and the selection
of an appropriate cost of capital. The
useful lives of intangible assets are
estimated and amortisation charged on
a straight-line basis.
Customer relationships
Customer relationships are recognised
as intangible assets at the fair value of
the consideration paid to acquire them
less provisions for amortisation and
impairment. The fair value attributed
to the customer relationships acquired
through a business combination is
determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows to be
generated from that asset at the risk
adjusted, post tax, weighted average
cost of capital at the time of the
acquisition for that business
combination. The residual values of
customer relationships are assumed
to be £nil.
Amortisation is provided so as to write
off the cost of the customer
relationships over the expected
economic lives of the asset in equal
annual instalments as follows:
Customer relationships arising on the
acquisition of:
T ripleArc plc
(BMC) 10 years
Accord Office Supplies Limited
(Accord) 10 years
The Print Factory (London) 1991
Limited and DSR Group Limited
(BMC) 10 years
Martin Luck Limited – Newbury branch
(Accord) 10 years
Brands
Brands are recognised as intangible
assets at the fair value of the
consideration paid to acquire them less
provisions for amortisation and
impairment. The fair value attributed to
the brands acquired through a business
combination is determined by
discounting the expected future cash
flows that would be generated by a
royalty stream in respect of the brands,
at the risk adjusted, post tax, weighted
average cost of capital at the time of
the acquisition for that business
combination. The residual values of
brands are assumed to be £nil.
Amortisation is provided so as to write
off the cost of the brands over the
expected economic lives of the asset in
equal annual instalments as follows:
T ripleArc plc 
(BMC) 10 years
Accord Office Supplies Limited
(Accord) 10 years
Software
Costs associated with maintaining
software are expensed as incurred.
Development costs controlled internally
and directly attributable to the design
and testing of identifiable software are
recognised as intangible assets when
there is an ability and intention to use or
sell the software product, completion of
the software is reasonably certain and
the expenditure attributable to the
software during its development can be
reliably measured. Directly attributable
costs, that are capitalised as part of the
software project include the software
development employee costs and an
appropriate portion of relevant
overheads.
Other development expenditures that
do not meet these criteria are
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously
recognised as an expense are not
recognised as an asset in a subsequent
period.
Purchased software is recognised as an
intangible asset at the fair value of the
consideration paid to acquire it less
provisions for amortisation and
impairment.
Software is amortised on a straight line
basis over its useful economic life of 3-5
years.
The amortisation charge in respect of
customer relationships, brands and
software is recognised within
administrative expenses.
Impairment of non-financial
assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful
life, for example, goodwill are not
subject to amortisation and are tested
annually for impairment. Assets that
are subject to amortisation or
depreciation are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair
value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the

(cash-generating units).
In respect of assets other than goodwill,
an impairment loss is reversed if there
has been a change in the estimates used
to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to
the extent that the asset’s carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation or
amortisation, if no impairment loss had
been recognised.
Impairment losses recognised in
respect of goodwill are not
subsequently reversed.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated
at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses. Historical costs
include expenditure that is directly
attributable to the acquisition of the
items. The assets’ residual values and
useful lives are reviewed annually and
adjusted as appropriate.
Subsequent costs are included in the
asset’s carrying amount or recognised
as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future
economic benefits associated with the
item will flow to the Group and the
cost of the item can be measured
reliably. The carrying amount of the
replaced part is derecognised. All
other repairs and maintenance are
charged to the income statement
during the financial period in which
they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposal are
determined by comparing the proceeds
with the carrying amount and are
recognised in the income statement.
Depreciation commences in the month
that the assets are fully installed and
commissioned and is provided on a
straight line basis at rates calculated to
write off the cost, less estimated
residual value, of each asset over its
expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold land
- not depreciated
Freehold buildings
- over 40 years
Short leasehold land and buildings
- over the lease term
Plant and machinery
- over 4 to 15 years
Office equipment
- over 3 to 10 years
The depreciation charge in respect of
freehold land and buildings, short
leasehold land and buildings, plant and
machinery and office equipment is
recognised within distribution costs and
administrative expenses.
Investments
In the Company’s financial statements,
investments in subsidiary undertakings
are initially stated at cost, being the fair
value of the consideration given.
Investments are reviewed where an
indication of impairment exists.  An
impairment loss is recognised for the
amount by which the asset’s carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of
an asset’s fair value less costs to sell
and value in use.
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases, as
defined under IAS 17, ‘Leases’ , are
capitalised and included as part of
property, plant and equipment. They
are depreciated over their useful lives
or the lease term (if shorter). The
capital elements of future obligations
under finance leases are included as
liabilities in the balance sheet. The
interest element of the rental
obligations is charged to the income
statement over the period of the lease
and represents a constant proportion
of the balance of capital repayments
outstanding.
Leases in which a significant
proportion of the risks and rewards of
ownership are retained by the lessor
are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating
leases are charged to the income
statement on a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an
incentive to enter a lease are spread
evenly over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories comprise of finished goods
and goods held for resale and are stated
at the lower of cost or net realisable
value. Cost includes all expenditure
directly attributable to bringing each
product to its present location and
condition on a first in first out method.
Net realisable value is based on
estimated selling price less further
costs expected to be incurred to
completion and disposal.
Provision for obsolete, slow moving and
defective inventories are made on a line
by line basis, where necessary, in order
to reduce inventory to the lower of cost
or net realisable value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents shown on the
balance sheet comprise cash balances
and deposits with banks that have a
maturity of three months or less from
the date of inception.
Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities on the
balance sheet, but are included as a
component of cash and cash equivalents
for the purposes of the statement of
cash flow as they form an integral part
of the Group’s cash management.
Bank overdrafts include cash book
overdrafts and confidential invoice
discounting arrangements whereby the
amount borrowed is limited to a
proportion of the trade receivables.
Provisions
The Group makes provision for liabilities
when it has a legal or constructive
obligation arising from a past event; it is
probable that an outflow of resources will
be required to settle the obligation; and
the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions for property dilapidations
represent the current estimated costs
to repair leased properties which are
required to be made good before the
properties are returned at the end of
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 53 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 54
Significant Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2013
the lease term. Provisions are made on a
property by property basis and the
timing of the utilisation will differ for
each property.
Provisions for onerous leases are
recognised when the Group believes
that the unavoidable costs of meeting
the lease obligations exceed the
economic benefits expected to be
received under the lease. 
Provisions are measured at the present
value of the expenditures expected to
be required to settle the obligation
using a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the
obligation. The increase in the provision
due to passage of time is recognised as
interest expense.
Retirement benefit costs
Group companies operate both defined
benefit and defined contribution
pension plans.
The Group maintains a defined benefit
pension scheme for former employees
of Her Majesty’s Stationery Office,
which requires contributions to be made
to a separately administered fund. The
scheme is closed to new members. The
scheme closed to future accrual on 31
December 2011. The scheme is
administered by trustee directors of
Banner Business Supplies (Pensions)
Limited, which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of office2office (UK) plc, a
subsidiary company of office2office plc.
The net surplus or deficit of the defined
benefit pension scheme is calculated in
accordance with IAS 19, ‘Employee
Benefits’ , based on the fair value of the
plan assets less the present value of the
defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent
actuaries using the projected unit credit
method. The present value of defined
benefit obligations is determined by
discounting the estimated future cash
outflows using interest rates of high-
quality corporate bonds that are
determined in the currency in which the
benefits will be paid, and have terms to
maturity approximating to the terms of
the related pension liability.
Where the actuarial valuation of the
scheme demonstrates that the scheme
is in surplus, the recognised asset is
limited to that for which the Group can
benefit in future, for example, by
refunds or a reduction in contributions.
Remeasurements of the net defined
benefit liability, which comprise
actuarial gains and losses, the return on
plan assets (excluding interest) and the
effect of the asset ceiling (if any,
excluding interest), are recognised
immediately in Other Comprehensive
Income (OCI). The Group determines the
net interest expense (income) on the net
defined benefit liability (asset) for the
period by applying the discount rate
used to measure the defined benefit
obligation at the beginning of the annual
period to the then-net defined benefit
liability (asset), taking into account any
changes in the net defined liability
(asset) during the period as a result of
contributions and benefit payments.
Net interest expense and other
expenses related to defined benefit
plans are recognised in profit or loss.
When the benefits of a plan are changed
or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting
change in benefit that relates to past
service or the gain or loss on
curtailment is recognised immediately
in profit or loss. The Group recognises
gains and losses on the settlement of a
defined benefit plan when the
settlement occurs.
A valuation is performed annually by an
independent actuary. Further details in
respect of the assumptions used in
providing the valuation are included in
note 24 to the financial statements.
Since 30 September 1996, all new
employees have been eligible to join
the Group’s personal pension scheme,
which is a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions to defined contribution
arrangements are charged to the
income statement in the period in
which they fall due.  The assets of the
scheme are held separately from those
of the Group in an independently
administered fund.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of share-
based compensation schemes
including a SA YE scheme which is open
to all employees. The fair value of the
employee services received in
exchange for the grant of options
(approximated by reference to the fair
value of the option granted) is
recognised as an expense. The fair
value of the option is measured at
grant date and spread over the vesting
period (which is the period over which
all of the specified vesting conditions
are to be satisfied) through the income
statement with a corresponding
increase in equity. The fair value of the
share options and awards are
measured using an option-pricing
model taking into account the terms
and conditions of the individual
schemes. The fair value of options
awarded under schemes with market
based performance conditions is
estimated using a Monte-Carlo model.
The fair value of options awarded
under schemes with non-market based
performance conditions is estimated
using a Black-Scholes model.
Shares purchased through the employee
benefit trust (EBT) are held at cost and
treated as Treasury Shares and are
deducted from retained earnings. The
right to a dividend and voting rights on
these shares has been waived. 
When options are exercised, the
Company sells shares through the EBT
to satisfy the options.
The Group makes charges to the
income statement for any potential
employer’s national insurance liability
on options granted, based on the
Directors’ best estimate of the fair
value of the options granted at the
balance sheet date and spread over the
vesting period of the option.
The fair value of the options granted
under the various schemes has been
accounted for in the Group’s financial
statements. The grant by the Company
of options over its equity instruments
to the employees of subsidiary
undertakings in the Group is treated as
a capital contribution. The fair value of
employee services received, measured
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 54 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 55
Significant Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2013
by reference to the grant date fair
value, is recognised over the vesting
period as an increase to investment in
subsidiary undertakings, with a
corresponding credit to equity. 
At each balance sheet date, the
Company revises its estimate of the
number of options that are going to
vest. The Group recognises the impact
of any revision to original estimates, if
any, in the income statement, with a
corresponding adjustment to equity. The
proceeds on exercise of options, net of
any directly attributable transaction
costs, are credited to share capital (at
nominal value) and share premium when
the options are exercised.
Current and deferred income tax
The tax charge for the period comprises
both current and deferred tax. T ax is
recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to
items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable
on the taxable income for the period and
any adjustment to tax payable in
respect of previous periods, and is
calculated on the basis of tax rates (and
laws) that have been substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the
balance sheet liability method on
temporary differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying value for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is determined on a non-
discounted basis using tax rates (and
laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date and which are expected to
apply when the related deferred tax
asset is realised or deferred tax liability
is settled. 
Where the intrinsic value of a share
option exceeds the fair value, the
corresponding deferred tax on the
excess is recognised directly in equity.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only
to the extent that it is probable that
sufficient taxable profit will be available
to utilise the temporary difference.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities
are recognised on the Group’s balance
sheet when the Group becomes a party
to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.
The Group classifies its financial assets
and liabilities in the following
categories: loans and receivables, and
other financial liabilities. The
classification depends on the purpose
for which the financial assets or
liabilities were acquired. Management
determines the classification of its
financial assets and liabilities at initial
recognition. The classification of
financial liabilities is determined in
accordance with IFRS 7, ‘Financial
instruments: Disclosures’ , taking
account of the repayment profile of the
liability.  For those with fixed or
determinable payment profiles the
amounts are recognised as either
current liabilities or, where amounts are
not due for more than 12 months after
the reporting period, as non-current
liabilities.
T rade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised
initially at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less
provision for impairment. A provision
for impairment of trade receivables is
established when there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able
to collect all amounts due according to
the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the
debtor, probability that the debtor will
enter bankruptcy or financial
reorganisation and default or
delinquency in payments (more than 60
days overdue) are considered indicators
that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the
difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of
estimated future cash flows. The
carrying amount of the asset is reduced
through the use of an allowance account
and the amount of the loss is recognised
in the income statement within revenue.
When a trade receivable is
uncollectable, it is written off against
the allowance account for trade
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of
amounts previously written off are
credited against revenue in the income
statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at
fair value net of transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at
amortised cost; any difference between
the proceeds (net of transaction costs)
and the redemption value is recognised
in the income statement over the period
of the borrowings using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current
liabilities unless the Group has an
unconditional right to defer settlement
of the liability for at least 12 months
after the balance sheet date.
T rade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing
and are recognised initially at fair value
and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the
Company are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs.
Where any Group company purchases
the Company’s equity share capital
(treasury shares), the consideration
paid, including any directly attributable
incremental costs (net of income taxes)
is deducted from equity attributable to
the Company’s owners until the shares
are cancelled or reissued. Where such
shares are subsequently reissued, any
consideration received, net of any
directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related
income tax effects, is included in equity
attributable to the Company’s owners. 
The Group assesses at each balance
sheet date whether there is objective
evidence that a financial asset or a
group of financial assets is impaired.
The above financial assets and liabilities
are grouped as follows:
●
Cash and cash equivalents and trade
and other receivables (excluding
prepayments) are classified as loans
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 55 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 56
Underlying profit is calculated as follows:
2013 2012
£000 £000
Profit before income tax 1,823 (1,631)
Add:
Share option charges (note 26) 48 541
Non-recurring costs (note 5) 834 4,002
Amortisation of intangibles (note 12) 1,487 1,244
Underlying profit before income tax 4,192 4,156
* Restated, see Significant Accounting Policies.

and receivables for the purpose of
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments:
Disclosures’ .
●
Borrowings, finance leases and trade
and other payables (excluding
statutory liabilities) are classified as
other financial liabilities at
amortised cost for the purpose of
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments:
Disclosures’ .
Dividends
Distributions to owners are disclosed as
a component of the movement in the
statement of changes in shareholders’
equity. A liability is recorded for a final
dividend when the dividend is approved
by the Company’s shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised in the period in
which they are paid. 
Use of non-GAAP profit
measures
The Directors believe that the use of
underlying profit before income tax
provides a clearer understanding of the
performance of the Group. This measure
is used for internal performance
analysis. Underlying profit is not defined
by IFRS and therefore may not be
directly comparable with other
companies’ adjusted profit measures. It
is not intended to be a substitute for, or
superior to, IFRS measurements of
profit.
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 56 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 57
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, commodity price risk and cash
flow and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on
the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
(a) Market risk
(i) Currency risk
The Group operates in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and, accordingly, has limited exposure to foreign exchange
risk. Currency risk is managed by matching, where possible, cash inflows and outflows denominated in Euros.
The Group does not currently hedge any foreign currency transactions but continues to keep this policy under review.
Management have considered and concluded that a movement of 10% would be a reasonable benchmark over which to
determine the sensitivity of the Group’s performance to foreign exchange rate risk, because a movement of this magnitude is
considered to be a reasonable approximation of movements that could be expected to occur.  For the year ended 31 December
2013, if the Euro had weakened/strengthened by 10% against Sterling with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit and
the movement in net assets for the year would have been £25,000 (2012: £29,000) lower/higher, as a result of foreign exchange
gains/losses on translation of the Euro-denominated transactions and monetary assets and liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss.
The calculation applied in determining the impact of a 10% movement in exchange rates is based upon adjusting the average
exchange rates by 10% on the Euro-denominated transactions.
(ii) Commodity price risk
The Group has exposure to changes in commodity prices such as steel, oil and paper (including supplier price increases as a result
of foreign exchange movements), which form a constituent part of many of the products sold. It is the policy of the Group to pass
on these unavoidable cost price increases to customers as appropriate.
The Group does not currently hedge its exposure to commodity prices but continues to keep this policy under review.
Management have considered and concluded that a movement of 1% in gross margin percentage would be a reasonable
benchmark over which to determine the sensitivity of the Group’s performance to commodity price risk, because a movement of
this magnitude is considered to be a reasonable approximation of movements that could expect to be incurred by the Group.  For
the year ended 31 December 2013, if the gross margin percentage had weakened/strengthened by 1% with all other variables
held constant, gross profit for the year would have been £2,319,000 (2012: £2,270,000) lower/higher.
(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group has interest-bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents.  The Company has interest-bearing assets in the
form of loans to subsidiary companies. Therefore interest income is sensitive to movements in interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk predominantly arises from short and long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates
expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate
risk. During 2012 and 2013, the Group’s borrowings, other than in respect of finance leases, were all at variable rates and all
borrowings were denominated in Sterling.
The Group continues to keep its policy of not hedging its exposure to interest rate movements under review.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, management have considered and concluded that a movement of 100 basis points would
be a reasonable benchmark over which to determine the sensitivity of the Group’s performance to interest rate risk, because a
movement of this magnitude is considered to be a reasonable approximation of movements that could be expected to occur. If
interest rates on borrowings had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the
year would have been £290,000 (2012: £316,000) lower/higher, as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate
borrowings.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial
institutions as well as credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘ A ’ are accepted in normal
circumstances.
1. Financial risk management
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 57 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 58
Internally, customers are rated according to financial position, history of trading and other factors. Individual credit limits are
based on internal and external ratings, in accordance with limits set by management. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly
monitored. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s diverse customer base.
(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate amount
of committed credit facilities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (comprising undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and
cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings
based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. 
The amounts shown are contractual (including interest), undiscounted cash flows.

There have been no breaches in the contractual terms of the amounts shown above.
In addition to short-term borrowing facilities, the Group refinanced a £20,000,000 loan on 19 May 2011. The loan is repayable in
instalments between June 2012 and June 2015, with interest charged at a floating rate linked to LIBOR. A maturity analysis is
provided at note 20 to the financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013
Currency risk profile of financial assets/liabilities
The Group did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies at 31 December 2013 and has not used any instruments to hedge foreign currency transactions.
Financial assets/(liabilities) relating to cash balances and overdrafts held at financial institutions are at floating rates
denominated in the currency held below:
2013 2012
£000 £000
Sterling - deposits 1,401 389
Sterling - bank overdrafts (11,452) (13,469)
(10,051) (13,080)
Euro - deposits 331 1,154
Swedish Krona - deposits 174 182
(9,546) (11,744)
There is no material currency risk relating to other financial assets or liabilities.
Fair values of financial instruments
See note 20 for consideration of the differences between the carrying amount and the fair value of borrowings. The fair value of
other financial assets and liabilities is not materially different to their book value due to the short term maturity of the instruments. 
Committed and uncommitted undrawn facilities
The Group has the following undrawn borrowing facilities:
2013 2012
£000 £000
Gross undrawn committed confidential invoice discounting facility 15,717 21,353
Gross undrawn committed stock facility 2,998 -
Revolving credit facility 2,000 -
Short-term overdraft 1,000 1,000
Cash book overdraft (167) (2,822)
Net undrawn facilities 21,548 19,531
Bank balances 1,906 1,725
Available liquidity 23,454 21,256
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had drawn £11,283,000 against its committed invoice discounting facility. At that date the
Group had a cash book overdraft of £167,000 (2012: £2,822,000) and bank balances of £1,906,000 (2012: £1,725,000). If all
payments had cleared on the day of issue, the Group would have had net available liquidity of £23,454,000 (2012:
£21,256,000).
The confidential invoice discounting facility is a committed facility, subject to sufficient security from trade receivables, expiring
in June 2015.
The Group has sufficient headroom to enable it to conform to covenants on its existing borrowings. The Group has sufficient
working capital and undrawn financing facilities to service its operating activities.
There have been no breaches in the covenants on borrowings in the year ended 31 December 2013 and up to the date of signing
the financial statements.
Capital risk management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as facilities plus total shareholders’ equity, so as to maintain
investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Within this overall policy, the Group
seeks to maintain an optimum capital structure by a mixture of debt and retained earnings. Funding needs are reviewed
periodically and also each time a significant acquisition is made. A number of factors are considered which include the net
debt/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) ratio, future funding needs (usually potential
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 59 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 60
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013
acquisitions) and Group banking arrangements (including the monitoring of debt covenants over current funding arrangements).
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. The primary source of funding for the
Group is bank borrowings.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of gearing ratio, calculated as net debt divided by
total equity. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non current borrowings, less cash) as shown in the
balance sheet. T otal equity is defined as total equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet. T otal capital is calculated as
total equity plus net debt.
During 2013, the Group decreased its gearing ratio from 65% to 60%. The gearing ratios at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were
as follows:
2013 2012
£000 £000
T otal borrowings (note 20) 23,676 30,757
Less: cash and cash equivalents (note 18) (1,906) (1,725)

2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition,
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
in the period in which the estimate is revised if revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Determination of cash flows, discount rates used in business combinations and impairment reviews of goodwill and
other intangibles 
Discount rates are determined by management for the purpose of valuing fair values of intangible assets arising on business
combinations and to determine the net present value of cash flows in respect of annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other
intangibles when appropriate.
The discount rates used for the purpose of impairment reviews are based on the appropriate cost of capital adjusted for
management’s perceived risk.
The cash flows attributable to the cash-generating unit to which goodwill (and, when appropriate, other intangibles) is allocated,
are based on management’s best estimates of future profitability and the resulting cash flows.
While management believes the discount rates and cash flows used are the most appropriate rates, changes in these
assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill, other intangibles, or in the fair value of intangibles in respect of business
combinations differing to the values recorded.
Income tax
The Group is subject to income tax in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Significant judgement is required in
determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination
is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts
that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such
determination is made.

Impairment of inventories
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and damaged stock. This provision represents the difference
between the cost of the stock and its estimated market value, based upon stock turn rates, market conditions and trends in
consumer demand.
Allowances for doubtful receivables
Allowances are made for doubtful receivables and for estimated losses resulting from the subsequent inability of customers to
make required payments. If the financial conditions of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
to make payments, additional allowances may be required in future periods.
Supplier rebates and catalogue contributions
Allowances are made for rebates and catalogue contributions to be received from suppliers for purchases which have already
been made. If the financial conditions of suppliers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
payments, these allowances may be required to be reversed in future periods.
Software licences and related maintenance services
A small part of our Business Critical Services segment relates to the sale of software licences and related support and
maintenance services. Management have taken the judgement that revenue is recognised over the contractual term of the
agreement with the customer, with amounts accrued or deferred on the balance sheet as appropriate. 
Pensions
The determination of the pension benefit obligation and expense for the defined benefit pension plan is dependent on the
selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Those assumptions are described in note 24 to
the financial statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of increase in future
compensation levels and expected mortality rates. A portion of the plan assets are invested in equity securities. The equity
markets have experienced volatility, which has affected the value of the pension plan assets. This volatility may make it difficult
to estimate the long-term rate of return on plan assets. Assumptions are based on actual historical experience and external data
regarding compensation and discount rate trends. While the Directors believe that the assumptions are appropriate, significant
differences in the actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the pension obligation and
the future expense.
Share based payments
The fair value of options awarded under schemes with market based performance conditions is estimated using a Monte-Carlo
model. The fair value of options awarded under schemes with non-market based performance conditions is estimated using a
Black-Scholes model. These models require the use of estimates and forward looking projections.
3. Segmental information 
IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’ , requires a ‘management approach’ , under which segment information is presented on the same
basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.  The operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports
regularly reviewed by the Executive Board of Directors, the Executive Board of Directors being the chief operating decision-
maker, in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their respective performance.
The Board considers the business from a service perspective.  The Group is organised into two business segments:
●
Managed Procurement; and 
●
Business Critical Services
The trading brands of each reportable segment (Banner Business Services and T ruline in respect of Managed Procurement and
Banner Managed Communication and Banner Document Services in respect of Business Critical Services), do not qualify as
reportable segments as decisions about the allocation of resources and the assessment of performance are not made at this level.

Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted earnings before interest,
taxation and amortisation (EBITA).  This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditure from the
operating segments, such as restructuring costs. An analysis of intangible assets and amortisation, although not included in the
performance measure for the segments, have been included to aid the reader. Other information provided to the Board, except as
noted below, is measured in a manner consistent with that in the financial statements.

11. Earnings per share
(a) Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average number
of Ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding Ordinary shares held by the EBT .
2013 2012
Profit/(loss) attributable to owners of the Company (£000) 1,320 (1,424)
Weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue (‘000) 36,171 36,081
Basic earnings per share (pence) 3.6 (3.9)
(b) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding to assume
conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares. The Company has one category of dilutive potential Ordinary shares, being
share options. For share options, a calculation is undertaken to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at
fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the
subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the
number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
2013 2012
Profit/(loss) attributable to owners of the Company (£000) 1,320 (1,424)

Customer relationships have 6.2 years (2012: 7.2 years) and brands have 4.5 years (2012: 5.5 years) before the assets are
written down in full.  Software costs are amortised over three to five years from date of purchase.
Company
The Company had no intangible assets (2012: none).
Impairment of goodwill
In accordance with IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’ , the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its goodwill and reviews it
annually or more regularly if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. For the purposes of assessing impairment,
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units) and
goodwill is allocated to these cash-generating units. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-
generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The components of goodwill by business segment (which represent cash-generating units) are shown below:
2013 2012
£000 £000
Managed Procurement 19,116 19,116
Business Critical Services 31,137 31,137
50,253 50,253
A review was undertaken at 31 December 2013 to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill was impaired by reference to
value in use calculations. The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts as
approved by the Board of Directors for a five year period and then into perpetuity based on no changes to the underlying strategy
of the business. Cash flow projections beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate referred to
below, and are considered appropriate as it is expected that there will be no significant changes in the operation of these
businesses.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculation were:
●
cash flow projections for the five year period are based upon recent observable performance of the Group, including budgeted
gross margin and expected operating cash inflows;
●
the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group is 10.8% (2012: 12.4%). The Group believes that the risk
profiles relating to each business segment are not significantly different, hence the same WACC is universally applied across
all cash-generating units; and
●
a long-term growth rate of 0% has been used as a prudent growth assumption.
Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible an impairment would be identified if any of the above key
assumptions were changed significantly. For instance, factors which could cause impairment are:
●
significant underperformance relative to the forecast results;
●
a further deterioration in the wider economy; and
●
an increase in the Group’s WACC.
The value-in-use is based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows. Management believe the assumptions used are
appropriate, but in addition have conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the changes in assumptions that would result in an
impairment.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the Managed Procurement CGU is £5.5m. Management
have identified two key assumptions where a change could conceivably cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable
amount.
The following table shows the amount by which these assumptions would need to change individually in order for the estimated
recoverable amount of the Managed Procurement CGU to be equal to the carrying amount.
2013
Discount rate increases by 30%
EBIT for next five years decreases by 20%
Having performed its impairment test on the Managed Procurement CGU and having analysed the various sensitivities to this
test, management believe that no reasonable change in the above key assumptions will cause the carrying value of the Managed
Procurement CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Based on the results of the current period impairment review, no impairment charges have been recognised by the Group in the
year ended 31 December 2013.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for tax losses and short term timing differences to the extent that the
realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset relating to non-trade losses of £393,000 (2012: £452,000) as there are no
expected changes in the operating characteristics of the subsidiary to which they relate that would permit utilisation in future
periods.
Company
The Company had no provided or unprovided deferred tax balances in either year.

Business Services Limited of £4,300,000 upon which interest is charged at a rate of 1.75% (2012: 1.75%) per annum above
Bank of England base rate. Interest is not charged on the other balances.
Credit risk in respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s customers being predominantly comprised of large
companies and public sector entities. As a result, the Directors consider that no further credit risk provision is required in excess
of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

Trade receivables that are not past due, amounting to £19,883,000 (2012: £16,863,000) are not considered impaired as
amounts within this category generally relate to a number of independent customers for which there is no recent history of
default. As of 31 December 2013, trade receivables of £6,994,000 (2012: £13,009,000) were past due but not impaired. The

Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013
As of 31 December 2013, trade receivables of £1,170,000 (2012: £1,436,000) were impaired and partially provided for. The
amount of the provision against such impaired trade receivables was £637,000 as of 31 December 2013 (2012: £797,000).
The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to issues arising from the current economic climate. These receivables are
aged as follows:
2013 2012

The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in ‘revenue’ in the consolidated income
statement. Amounts charged to the provision are written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. The other
classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting
date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group does not hold any collateral as security .
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and management consider the credit quality
of these assets as good – pre-existing customers with no defaults in the previous six months.

Total borrowings (23,676) (30,757)
The Company does not have any borrowings (2012: £nil).
Bank borrowings
Bank borrowings mature in 2015 and bear interest at a floating rate in the range of 200 to 325 basis points above LIBOR. Bank
borrowings are secured by an all assets debenture and a cross company guarantee on all assets of the Group. The Company forms
part of the cross guarantee structure.
The bank overdraft includes invoice discounting arrangements and cash book overdrafts. 
The repayment profile of bank borrowings (including overdrafts) is as follows: 
2013 2012
£000 £000
Within one year or on demand (12,708) (18,297)
Between one and two years (10,879) (3,828)
Between two and three years - (8,400)
(23,587) (30,525)
The borrowings are denominated in Sterling.
The carrying amounts and fair value of the non-current borrowings are as follows:

£000 £000 £000 £000
Bank borrowings (10,879) (12,228) (11,755) (13,722)
The fair value of the current borrowings equals their carrying amounts, as the impact of discounting is not significant. The fair
values of bank borrowings are based on cash flows discounted using a rate based on the market rate at 31 December 2013 of
4.3%. Included in the above are debt arrangement fees of £121,000 (2012: £272,000).
Finance leases
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations is not considered to be materially different to their carrying value.

24. Defined benefit obligation
Group
The Group is the contributing employer to a defined benefit pension scheme, The Banner Business Supplies Pension Scheme
(BBS scheme), all the members of which were formerly employed by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office and were members of the
Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme who first elected to transfer funds accrued to The Stationery Office Limited Scheme and
subsequently elected to transfer funds accrued to the BBS scheme. 
The BBS scheme commenced on 1 August 2000, when the funds were transferred in by The Stationery Office Pension Scheme
(TSOPS). The scheme is funded by the payment of contributions to a separately administered trust fund. The scheme was closed
to future accrual on 31 December 2011.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out on 31 July 2010 and updated to 31 December 2013 by Punter Southall
Limited, a qualified independent actuary. The pension costs have been determined on the basis of the results of this valuation. 
The fair value of the BBS scheme assets at 31 December 2013 amounted to £14,684,000 (2012: £13,101,000).
Group contributions in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme for the period were £307,000 (2012: £361,000). Group
contributions in 2014 are expected to be approximately £300,000.
The Group also incurred £840,000 (2012: £816,000) in respect of Group personal pension arrangements and employees’ own
personal pension arrangements for staff recruited by The Stationery Office Limited and Group companies since 30 September
1996 at rates varying between 6% and 15% of pensionable earnings.
The outstanding accrual in respect of defined contribution pension contributions at 31 December 2013 was £123,000
(2012: £166,000).

Characteristics of the Scheme and the risks associated with the Scheme:
a) Information about the characteristics the Scheme
i. The Scheme provides pensions in retirement and death benefits to members. Pension benefits are linked to a
member’s final salary at retirement or earlier withdrawal and their length of service. Since 31 December 2011 the
Scheme has been closed to future accrual.
ii. The Scheme is a registered scheme under UK legislation and has historically contracted out of the State Second
Pension. 
The Scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation. The last scheme funding valuation
of the Scheme was completed as at 30 July 2010 and revealed a deficit of £1.7m. In the recovery plan dated 11
October 2011 the Company has agreed to pay contributions of £300,000 per annum with the view to eliminating the
shortfall by 30 November 2018.
Under clause 28(5) of the Scheme’s trust deed and rules dated 31 July 2000, the Company has an unconditional right to
a refund of any surplus in the Scheme if the Scheme winds up, not as a result of Company insolvency. Therefore there is
no additional liability recognised on the balance sheet as a result of the recovery plan dated 11 October 2011.
iii. The Scheme was established from 1 August 2000 under trust and is governed by the Scheme’s trust deed and rules
dated 31 July 2000. The Trustees are responsible for the operation and the governance of the Scheme, including
making decisions regarding the Scheme’s funding and investment strategy in conjunction with the Company.
b) Information about the risks of the Scheme to the Company
The ultimate cost of the Scheme to the Company will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions
made. Many of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the Scheme may be
higher (or lower) than disclosed. 
5587-o2o_AReport_2013_pp40-88_v4_3973-o2o_AReport_2010_pp34–84  11/04/2014  16:05  Page 80 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 81
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013
In general, the risk to the Company is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the calculation of contribution
requirements are not borne out in practice and the cost to the Company is higher than expected. This could result in
higher contributions required from the Company and a higher deficit disclosed. This may also impact the Company’s
ability to grant discretionary benefits or other enhancements to members. 
More specifically, the assumptions not being borne out in practice could include:
i. The return on the Scheme’s assets being lower than assumed, resulting in an unaffordable increase in the required
Company contribution rate.
ii. Falls in asset values (particularly equities) not being matched by similar falls in the value of liabilities.
iii. Unanticipated future changes in mortality patterns leading to an increase in the Scheme’s liabilities. Future
mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty. This is especially so bearing in mind that the youngest Scheme
members could be expected to still be alive in 60 years or more and it is not possible to reliably predict what
medical advances may or may not have occurred by this time.
iv. The potential exercise (by members or others) of options against the Scheme for example taking early retirement or
exchanging a portion of pension for a cash lump sum.
v. The relatively small number of Scheme members is likely to lead to particular volatility in the deficit and the
Company contributions as the future demographic experience of such a group is more uncertain than would be the
case for a larger group.
c) Information about any amendments, curtailments and settlements
There has not been any amendments, curtailments or settlements over the year to 31 December 2013.
Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows
a) Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation as at 31
December 2013 is:
Change in assumption Impact on the Scheme’s
defined benefit obligation
Discount rate Increase by 0.25% Decrease by £0.9m
Rate of inflation (RPI) Increase by 0.25% Increase by £0.2m
Rate of inflation (CPI) Increase by 0.25% Increase by £0.9m
Assumed life expectancy at age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by £0.4m
Changes to the assumptions for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis are made in isolation.
Extrapolation of the sensitivity analysis beyond the ranges shown may not be appropriate.
b) Description of asset-liability matching strategies
The Scheme does not invest in swaps or insurance policies but does aim to match some of the liabilities by duration and
pension increase through investment in bonds.
c) The Scheme’s investment strategy
The Scheme’s investment strategy is to invest broadly 80% in return seeking assets and 20% in matching assets (mainly
government bonds). This strategy reflects the Scheme’s liability profile and the Trustees’ and Company’s attitude to risk.
d) Expected future cashflows to and from the Plan
In accordance with the schedule of contributions dated 11 October 2011 the Company is expected to pay contributions
of £300,000 in 2014. In addition, the Company is expected to directly meet the cost of administrative expenses for the
Scheme.
The liabilities of the Scheme are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cashflows to members of the
Scheme over the next 80 years. The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 25 years.
Company
The Company has no retirement benefit liabilities (2012: £nil).

Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013
At 31 December 2013, there were 14 members (2012: 16 members) with an average option holding of 162,385 (2012:
191,176) of the performance share plan and 226 members (2012: 135 members) with average holdings of 7,932 (2012: 3,887)
of the Save-As-Y ou-Earn (SA YE) scheme.
The performance share plan was introduced on 21 December 2005 to incentivise senior management relative to the long term
strategy of the Group. Financial performance conditions apply to exercise of the options, based on the Group’s earnings per share
growth and, for awards made up to 2010, a comparative measure of total shareholder return (TSR) against the companies in the
FTSE Small Cap Index. For awards made after 2010 the TSR measure has been replaced by growth in share price. On 4 April
2013, awards were granted over 214,670 shares based on a weighted average share price, of the three days prior to award, of
93.2p per share. No options were exercised during the year under review. The weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.1
years.
The SA YE scheme was first introduced in October 2004. The exercise price is determined at a 20% discount to the closing mid-
market price on the date of invitation. The schemes have either a three or five year vesting period. The weighted average
remaining contractual life is 3.3 years.
The summary of share options by expiry date in relation to the above schemes were as follows:
Exercise price Shares

Innovation
Designing and developing leading products
The launch of our hernia mesh fixation 
LiquiBand® Fix8™ device was an important 
development for the Group as it was our first 
approval for an internal application of tissue 
adhesives. 
It opens up potential new markets as we seek 
to extend the use of our tissue adhesives to 
other internal procedures.
LiquiBand® tissue adhesives
We’re extending our applications of tissue adhesives 
for internal use beyond that of hernia mesh fixation. 
LiquiBand® Fix8™ is approved for use in Europe and 
we are looking to get approval in the U.S., opening up 
the opportunity to the larger U.S. market.
We continue to work on improving our base formulations 
as well as our application to ensure our tissue adhesives 
meet the needs of our users.
Foam dressings
We are well advanced in extending our foam range to 
include both an antimicrobial and an atraumatic foam. 
Approvals are expected soon, with products launching 
later this year.
Collagens
We continue to improve the attributes of our collagens 
and are working on an enhanced collagen cone that 
brings benefits to oral surgery.
We are also developing new antibiotic haemostats that 
will have applications in surgical procedures.
CASE STUDY 
Hernia Mesh Fixation E.U.  
Expansion
“LiquiBand® Fix8™ was developed to enable a controlled delivery 
of an exact amount of adhesive where it is needed and to prevent 
unintentional dripping. Each click of the trigger sets 0.0125g of 
adhesive free. Altogether there are 33 ‘stamp-like’ drops. The 
property of the instrument tip material allows direct, atraumatic 
contact with mesh and underlying tissue when applying the glue 
without immediate polymerisation and obstruction of the tip. The 
simple instrument handling allows for a precise application, up 
to 105˚ angle. With a high viscosity of glue and an easy to use 
applicator, even a surgeon in his early learning curve can fix the 
hernia mesh fast and safely with LiquiBand® Fix8™.”

+8% on 2013
The demand for healthcare continues  
to increase worldwide. With ageing 
populations and the increased prevalence  
of chronic illness as well as greater 
expectation of an active lifestyle, healthcare 
budgets are continually being stretched.  
By offering cost-effective product solutions 
without compromising on clinical outcomes, 
our proposition is compelling.
ActivHeal®
ActivHeal® is our brand of advanced woundcare 
dressings that we sell to the NHS. Within this 
range are aquafibers, foams, alginates, hydrogels 
and hydrocolloids.
We provide support and education. Our free, 
on-line education modules are approved by the 
University of Chester and cover a variety of 
woundcare subjects.

“ActivHeal® offers a comprehensive range of 
products that have provided significant savings  
to the Trust, without compromising patient care. 
The clear and unambiguous packaging, together 
with the bespoke education and support

Strategic Review
Business Model
The Group is primarily involved in the 
design, development, manufacture 
and distribution of novel, high 
performance materials for use in 
advanced woundcare products and 
surgical dressings as well as medical 
adhesives and sutures for closing and 
sealing wounds. The Group distributes 
its products to the global device 
market by selling to healthcare 
companies and distributors as well as 
selling directly into the hospital and 
dental markets in Germany, Czech 
Republic, Russia and to the NHS in 
the U.K.
The Group’s strategy is to:
• Innovate, design and develop 
market leading products
• Leverage our existing routes as well 
as accessing new routes to market
• Grow both our OEM partner 
business and our own brands
• Not be over-reliant on any one 
partner or market
• Drive operational efficiency 
improvements and eliminate 
non-value added activities
• Make selective acquisitions 
that provide commercial and 
technological synergies
The Group operates through four 
Business Units: Branded Direct, 
Branded Distributed, OEM, and Bulk 
Materials which are each responsible 
for their respective sales, marketing 
and R&D activities and focus on a 
strategic route to market. The Business 
Units are supported by Operations, 
Regulatory and Quality, HR, Finance, 
Legal and IT which are Group 
functions. There are harmonised 
policies, processes and procedures, 
across the Group.
This business structure provides 
clarity on accountability and 
responsibility and clear lines for 
decision making that supports the 
growth of the Group. 
While each of the Business Units 
have objectives and risks specific to 
that Business Unit, there are some 
risks that are common throughout 
the Group. 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
for the Group 
Global Economic Conditions
The general economic conditions in 
a number of geographies, including 
the U.K. and Europe, are such that 
governments are looking to reduce 
spend on public services, including 
spend on healthcare, while other 
governments, such as in the U.S., 
are raising taxes from medical device 
companies to help pay for the services 
they are providing. Both of these 
actions have the potential to reduce 
demand. However, with ageing 
populations suffering from health 
problems and obesity leading to 
increased chronic illnesses, the 
incidence of chronic wounds which 
are treated with advanced woundcare 
products continues to increase. Both 
the developed world and developing 
economies are experiencing increasing 
demand for surgery to treat health 
problems as well as expecting to lead 
longer and more active lives increasing 
the need for surgical products. Overall, 
demographics are beneficial for the 
Group. The Group has a widespread 
geographical market coverage and a 
diverse customer base which helps to 
minimise the impact of any single one 
adverse event in any region or with 
any one customer.
Pricing Pressures and 
Commoditisation of Products
There are pricing pressure risks and 
continued competition from other 
products. The Group tries to provide 
differentiated products which are 
patented or covered by know-how 
whenever possible as well as 
providing a complete service to 
its customers to mitigate this risk. 
Regulatory Risk
The Group is subject to various 
regulatory requirements. With 
regulations becoming increasingly 
stringent there is always an element 
of compliance risk. Failure to achieve 
regulatory approval could result in 
the inability of the Group to supply 
goods into a market. To mitigate this 
risk the Group has a stringent 
compliance regime in place, is 
regularly audited by BSI (British 
Standards Institution) and TÜV 
(Technischer Überwachungsverein), 
as well as regulatory bodies in other 
countries. 12
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report 12
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
Product Quality Risk
The Group operates in highly 
regulated markets with strict quality 
requirements. Any quality failure 
involving the Group’s products could 
lead to the loss of reputation, loss of 
revenues, the loss of a customer, recall 
costs as well as sanctions from a 
regulator. To mitigate this, the Group 
operates within a strictly controlled 
Quality Management System. 
Development Risk
The Group continues to invest in R&D 
to develop its next generation of 
products. Not all research leads to 
successful new products but the 
Group believes that by monitoring 
progress against key milestones in a 
stage gate process it avoids 
excessive expenditure on projects 
that do not deliver a viable product. 
There is also a risk that the Group will 
not identify a new technology or 
opportunity before its competitors 
and will miss an opportunity to gain 
competitive advantage. The Business 
Unit structure provides focus on the 
market reducing the risk of missed 
opportunities.
Finance Risk
The Group is subject to various 
financial risks and the following are 
considered the most significant. 
Currently the Group has no 
borrowings and over £17m of cash, 
so does not consider liquidity or 
interest rates to be a significant risk. 
Currency
The Group’s main currency exposure 
is to the U.S. dollar and to the Euro. 
The Group’s policy is to hedge 
significant transaction exposure by 
using forward contracts and options. 
The Group aims to have 70% of its 
estimated transactional exposure for 
the next twelve months on a rolling 
basis hedged. Its currency exposure 
is reviewed regularly.
In 2014, 18% of the Group’s sales were 
in U.S. dollars and 34% of its sales 
were in Euros. If in 2014, the average 
U.S. dollar rate had depreciated 
against sterling by an additional 10%, 
there would have been a £1.2 million 
(2013: £1.0 million) adverse impact on 
revenue and the gross margin and 
profit would have been reduced by 
50bps (2013: 60bps).
In 2014, if the average Euro rate had 
depreciated against sterling by an 
additional 10%, there would have 
been a £2.2 million (2013: £2.2 
million) adverse impact on revenue 
and the gross margin and profit 
would have been reduced by 0bps 
(2013: 10bps).
Euro impact is minimal as a 
significant proportion of our 
revenues are naturally hedged 
against our Euro cost base.
Credit Risk
The Group assesses the risk of 
contracting with each customer and 
sets credit limits which are carefully 
monitored. If a significant risk is 
identified, credit facilities are 
withdrawn and transactions are 
carried out on a cash before delivery 
basis. If a key partner was 
significantly affected by a difficult 
trading environment this would have 
a short-term impact on the Group.
Cost Pressures
The Group estimates that if material 
prices had increased by a further 5% 
in 2014 and the Group had been 
unable to pass the increase on, there 
would have been a negative impact of 
£0.7 million (2013: £0.6 million) to the 
cost and the gross margin would have 
reduced by 110bps to (2013: 100bps).

Divisions
The Branded Direct Business Unit is 
responsible for driving sales of our 
own brands: ActivHeal®, LiquiBand® 
and RESORBA® to end users in the 
U.K., Germany and Czech Republic 
where the Group has its own sales 
teams. This Business Unit is also 
responsible for directing R&D for 
sutures and collagens which 
comprise the major part of this 
Business Unit’s revenues.
ActivHeal® is the Group’s brand of 
advanced woundcare dressings that 
it sells into the NHS in the UK. The 
proposition of this brand is that it 
provides a range of ‘good value’, 
advanced woundcare dressings that 
deliver cost savings to the NHS 
without compromising on clinical 
outcomes or patient care. The 
ActivHeal® range is supported by a 
dedicated team of experienced 
healthcare professionals and by 
online education modules that 
provide training on the treatment of 
wounds. With the NHS continuing to 
operate under budgetary constraints 
ActivHeal® provides a good growth 
opportunity for the Group.
The LiquiBand® range of medical 
adhesives and sealants, based on 
cyanoacrylate, is used to close and 
protect wounds in a safe and secure 
way. In the U.K., LiquiBand® is well 
recognised in the majority of 
Accident & Emergency (A&E) units 
where its high strength attribute 
makes it the product of first choice 
for closing trauma wounds. We are 
now also selling LiquiBand® into the 
Operating Room (OR) in the U.K. 
where it is used to make the final 
topical skin closure following the 
surgical procedure. LiquiBand® is 
sold for use in the OR in Germany. 
Until recently our LiquiBand® 
products have only been approved 
for topical use. In May 2014, however, 
we received approval to use 
LiquiBand® internally for hernia mesh 
fixation. We have now launched 
LiquiBand® Fix8™ with both our 
German and U.K. sales forces and 
expect to report further progress 
on this in 2015.
RESORBA®’s suture range includes 
several brands such as CAPROLON®, 
GLYCOLON®, MOPYLEN® and 
RESOPREN® that are sold into 
hospitals, private practices and 
to oral surgeons. RESORBA®’s 
haemostat range includes 
KOLLAGEN-resorb and GENTA-
COLL-resorb. The latter is a very 
pure collagen that includes the 
antibiotic gentamicin for use in 
wounds where there is a high risk of 
infection. Combining the suture and 
collagen technologies, RESORBA® 
has developed products and brands 
that are particularly applicable to  
the oral surgery market, e.g. 
PARASORB® Sombrero® is a 
collagen cone used for dental 
implants. Our model of providing 
‘good value’ ranges to the NHS is 
applicable to our RESORBA® suture 
range and we are actively working to 
promote our RESORBA® products 
within the NHS.
We are also aiming to extend the use 
of RESORBA®’s sutures within the 
German hospital system.

The Branded Distributed Business 
Unit is responsible for driving sales 
of our LiquiBand® and RESORBA® 
brands to all markets where the 
Group does not have its own sales 
teams and sales are made through 
distributors. This Business Unit also 
includes all sales made by our 
Russian subsidiary which are made 
both by the direct sales team in 
Moscow and by the distributor 
network that the Moscow sales 
team supports throughout the 
rest of Russia. This Business Unit 
is responsible for directing R&D 
for all of our medical adhesives 
and sealants. 
The Group works with distributors 
worldwide, accessing over 65 
countries.
The largest market for tissue 
adhesives is the U.S. which is 
estimated to be $220 million and 
this is the most significant 
opportunity for LiquiBand®. 
Approval to sell LiquiBand® in the 
U.S. was obtained in 2009. This 
Business Unit is also distributing 
LiquiBand® Fix8™ through some 
European distributors who have the 
expertise to support the product.
The RESORBA® suture and collagen 
ranges are sold throughout Europe 
and parts of Asia and the Middle 
East but do not yet have approval 
to be marketed in the U.S.

Risk Description Mitigating Actions
Developing new 
markets through 
partners and 
distributors is not 
successful
There is the risk that the Business Unit’s partners 
and distributors are not successful in developing 
new markets because the partner or distributor 
has underestimated the difficulty of accessing the 
market or the opportunity ceases to be a priority 
for them
Some countries are also actively encouraging 
locally manufactured products rather than 
imported products 
•  Contracts have agreed set minimas which allow 
terms to be renegotiated or agreements terminated.
•  The Group’s diversified approach with markets and 
products reduces the impact of any one project 
causing substantial risk to the business.
Regulatory approval 
is not achieved
There is a risk that the launch of products is 
delayed due to lack of regulatory approval in new 
markets outside Europe and the U.S. Increasingly, 
local regulatory approvals are taking longer to 
obtain 
•  The Group has an experienced regulatory team 
and works with partners and distributors where they 
have local expertise. In general, regulatory approval 
is taking longer to achieve and is becoming more 
complicated
Foreign exchange 
risk reduces 
profitability
This Business Unit has most exposure to foreign 
exchange risk through the U.S. dollar and 
potentially to the currencies of new export 
markets
•  The Group hedges significant transaction exposure by 
using forward contracts and options and aims to have 
70% of its estimated transactional exposure for the 
next twelve months hedged
Economic conditions Economic conditions in some markets deteriorate 
resulting in a decline of sales
•  The Group’s diversified approach to markets reduces 
the impact of any one geographical region
Strategy
The strategy of this Business Unit is to increase sales of the Group’s brands in all markets where the Group does not have a sales  
force by:
Increasing the market share of LiquiBand® 
in the U.S.:
•  Partner with key distributors that  
access the U.S. hospital and alternative  
site (non-hospital) segments
•  Provide new products
•  Help train and provide account  
support
Developing and launching new products:
•  Internal application of cyanoacrylate for 
the fixation of hernia mesh in Europe
Maximising opportunities across Europe, 
Middle East, Asia and South America: 
•  Leverage the combined existing 
distributor network for LiquiBand®  
and RESORBA®
Accessing new markets:
•  Gain regulatory approval 
for LiquiBand® in China
•  Gain regulatory approval for
 RESORBA® sutures in the U.S.
•  Gaining approval for LiquiBand®  
Fix8™ in the U.S.
•  Identify new market opportunities

The OEM Business Unit is 
responsible for supporting our 
business-to-business partners with 
a multi-product portfolio that is 
globally competitive, backed by 
intellectual property and know-
how. In addition to providing 
innovative products a key 
differential from our competitors is 
that a full service is provided. This 
includes design, development, 
manufacture and distribution of 
products supported by regulatory 
capabilities as well as clinical 
evidence and marketing support. 
AMS works with many of the 
world’s leading healthcare 
companies, supplying them 
with finished packed products. 
Our technologies include foams, 
fibres, collagens, hydrogels and 
hydrocolloids. In particular, silver 
alginate is a key growth driver for 
this Business Unit and we support 
our partners to access new

Industry 
consolidation and 
reliance on key 
customers
The healthcare sector continues to experience 
considerable business consolidation. This presents 
both opportunities and risk. There could be a loss 
of business if a partner was an acquired party. 
The loss of a key partner would have an adverse 
impact on this Business Unit’s revenues and profit 
in the short term
• Minimisation of over reliance on any one customer.
•  All customers have contracts with agreed 
termination clauses
New products are not 
successful
Lack of success in launching new products or 
identifying a new technology could lead to the 
loss of a partner
•  Strong links with partners reduce the risk of missed 
opportunities
•  R&D progress is monitored against the stage gate 
process to ensure projects are progressing to plan 
and action is taken if necessary
Increased global 
competition reduces 
profitability
There are increasing numbers of contract 
manufacturers across the world which may 
provide a low cost business case for partners
•  Offering a full service including a strong regulatory 
and quality assurance together with product 
development and clinical support mitigates a pure 
cost of supply proposition
Strategy
The strategy of this Business Unit is to support the Group’s partners to be successful with the products we supply and to increase 
their market share in our areas of technical expertise. This is the Group’s largest Business Unit. 
Its strategy is to foster increasingly strong 
partner relationships with existing 
customers by:
• Key account management
• Reliability of service and quality
• Expansion of product portfolio
•  Regulatory support for expansion into 
new markets
Secure new partners through: 
•  Reputation for quality, customer service 
and regulatory capability

Operations
Employee safety, product quality, regulatory 
compliance and cost-effectiveness are key to 
AMS’s operations. 
Safety
Measurable safety regimes have been implemented on all sites. 
Risks are identified at the earliest opportunity, near miss events 
are highlighted and a common All Incident Rate (AIR) reporting 
metric is used.
Quality
All manufacturing sites are compliant to ISO 13485 and use 
validated processes and process control techniques to ensure 
that the Group has an effective management system in place. 
The quality team has been strengthened and training extended 
across the Group. In 2014 the Group’s manufacturing sites were 
audited on several occasions by many different legislative bodies 
and found to be compliant.
Regulatory
To grow the business new products need regulatory approval 
and new territories require product registration. AMS 
successfully achieved new product approvals in the U.S. and 
Europe as well as extending regulatory registrations to new 
markets such as the Middle East. AMS works with its distributors 
and OEM partners to meet local regulatory requirements. The 
regulatory team has been strengthened to meet increasing 
regulatory requirements.
Cost
The management of cost is essential to improve the profitability 
of the Group. Cost reduction and waste elimination programmes 
help our products to be priced competitively.
Capacity
The Group aims to have sufficient capacity to meet its future 
growth. The focus is obtaining improvements in Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and identifying plant and 
equipment constraints before they are business critical. Lean 
manufacturing regimes are in place on all sites and continue to 
be extended to improve operational performance. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Company Overview

Corporate Social Responsibility
Health, Safety and Environment
The health and safety of our staff 
and visitors to our facilities is a 
priority for the business. AMS has 
established Health, Safety and 
Environment Committees at each 
site which meet monthly. These 
Committees report monthly to the 
Senior Management Team (SMT) and 
at each Board meeting. We focus on 
the prevention of accidents and 
incidents through proactive 
reporting of potential hazards. 
Ensuring that the Group maintains 
excellent environmental standards is 
integral to AMS. It is the Group’s 
policy to abide by all laws, directives 
and regulations pertinent to its field 
of operations and to act in a manner 
so as to minimise the effects of our 
operations on the environment. 
Employees
AMS is focused on attracting and 
retaining the right calibre of people, 
which is critical for the Company’s 
long-term success. We are 
committed to supporting and 
developing our employees through 
training and communication. 
We invest in our employees and 
build on their skills to benefit the 
business. We implemented a 
Leadership Development 
Programme in 2012 targeted at 
continuous improvement. Managers 
are encouraged to participate in a 
Management Development 
Programme to enhance their 
management skills and equip them 
to deliver the vision of the business. 
We have also rolled out a Lean 
Training Programme across the 
Group to improve skills at all levels 
and have implemented an 
apprenticeship scheme in 2014

Commenting on the sponsorship, 
race organiser Andy Wood said: 
“I am thrilled to have Advanced 
Medical Solutions Group on board; 
it demonstrates the quality of the 
race when we have industry leading 
companies like AMS, which employs 
more than 470 employees and sells 
products in over 65 countries, 
approaching us to sponsor the race. 
I really liked their approach to the 
race and I can confirm that it will be 
a headline sponsor of the Team 
Prize competition.”
which we are extending in 2015. 
Language lessons are also provided 
across our sites. 
Additionally, employees are 
encouraged to put forward their 
views to the Company through 
monthly briefing meetings and also 
through our annual employee survey. 
Ethical Standards
Our core Company values of 
‘Determination to Succeed, Drive for 
Results, Inspired Standards, Positive 
Outlook, Collaboration and Honesty’ 
are the values that set the culture of 
the organisation and we expect our 
employees to embrace.
We continue to review how we 
operate as a business to ensure that 
we act in a responsible and ethical 
way and to be respectful of others. 
The Company has policies and 
procedures in place covering Anti-
Corruption and Bribery, Gifts and 
Hospitality and Whistleblowing.
Community
We are developing our links with 
the local communities in which we 
operate. We consider involvement 
with both local and national 
charities to be important for the 
business. We sponsor a number of 
children in Africa and Asia through 
Plan International, a charity that 
promotes child rights and aims to 
end child poverty. 
We are a joint sponsor of the 2015 
Cheshire Classic Womens’ Road

2014 was another year of good 
growth across the business – both 
operationally and financially. AMS 
continues to progress as a leading, 
international provider of high quality, 
high value innovative and 
technologically advanced products 
for the woundcare and wound 
closure markets.
Operationally, the performance of 
LiquiBand® in the U.S. was 
particularly strong and we made 
considerable progress towards our 
goal of building a 20% market share. 
We also launched our LiquiBand® 
Fix8™ hernia mesh fixation device for 
use as a medical adhesive inside the 
body. This was an important 
development for the Group, opening 
up potential new markets as we seek 
to extend the application of our 
tissue adhesives to other internal 
procedures. 
Financially, we are pleased to  
report a 6% increase in revenue to 
£63.0 million (2013: £59.5 million), 
representing growth of 9% on a 
constant currency basis and an 
increase in adjusted profit
1
 before  
tax of 15% to £15.6 million  
(2013: £13.5 million). 
The Group continues to work on a 
number of significant opportunities 
to drive growth resulting from 
existing products and geographic 
markets as well as from new 
products in development.
The Group ended the year with  
net cash of £17.3 million (2013: £5.3 
million), and has taken advantage of 
the favourable terms available for 
borrowing to put in place a new, 
five-year, unsecured, multi-currency 
credit facility for £30 million. This 
facility is as yet unused. AMS 
continues to be in robust financial 
health and is well positioned to 
invest in internal development 
projects as well as potential licensing 
opportunities and acquisitions in line 
with the Group’s strategy. 
Dividend 
The Board is proposing a final 
dividend of 0.48p per share, making 
a total dividend for the year of 0.70p 
per share, a 16.7% increase on 2013.  
If approved at the Annual General 
Meeting on 21 May 2015, this will be 
paid on 29 May 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 8 May 2015.
People
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank all our employees, 
customers, suppliers, business 
partners and shareholders for their 
continued support over the past year.

I am pleased to report good growth 
across our major Business Units 
despite foreign exchange headwinds. 
With more than 75% of our sales 
outside the U.K., our business is truly 
international and therefore affected 
by currency fluctuations.
Branded Direct
The Branded Direct Business Unit 
reports sales of our branded 
products through our own sales 
forces in the U.K., Germany and 
Czech Republic. Its revenue grew 3% 
to £23.6 million (2013: £22.9 million) 
and by 6% at constant currency.
ActivHeal®
ActivHeal®, which delivers a range of 
woundcare dressings that offer 
significant cost savings without 
compromising on clinical outcomes 
or patient care, continues to be a 
compelling proposition for the NHS. 
Sales of our ActivHeal® range 
increased by 8% to £6.0 million (2013: 
£5.5 million). We are encouraged by 
the most recent data confirming that 
AMS had further increased its market 
share to 7.1% (2013: 5.5%) at the end 
of 2014. Encouragingly, ActivHeal® 
has had a strong start to 2015 with a 
number of tender and formulary wins 
from new NHS Hospital Trusts and 
we expect increased growth 
throughout the year. 
LiquiBand®
We continue to make good progress in 
the U.K. with LiquiBand®. In the 
Accident and Emergency Room (A&E) 
sales grew 8% to £2.6 million (2013: 
£2.5 million) and sales into the 
Operating Room (OR) increased 34% 
to £0.6 million (2013: £0.45 million).
AMS’s products have been used in 
A&E for a number of years and the 
good growth we have seen reflects 
the progress made by our focused 
sales team in this sector. The U.K. 
surgical sales team, now in its second 
year, is accessing the OR with a 
growing range of products that now 
includes sutures and haemostats. 
This team will also start selling 
LiquiBand® Fix8™, our hernia mesh 
fixation device.
Sales of LiquiBand® in Germany were 
flat at £1.4 million at a reported level, 
but increased by 5% at constant 
currency. Steady progress is 
expected to continue in Germany.
RESORBA®
Sales of RESORBA® branded 
products in Germany and the Czech 
Republic were slightly lower at £13.0 
million (2013: £13.1 million) at a 
reported level and increased by 4% 
at constant currency. Sales of 
haemostats increased by 12% at 
constant currency to £3.6 million 
(2013: £3.4 million) and sales of 
sutures and collagens into the dental 
market were unchanged at £3.8 
million, whilst sales of sutures into 
hospitals grew 2%, reversing the 
decline reported in 2013.
Although the German suture market 
continues to be challenging and is 
expected to remain so over the next 
year, we believe we are well placed to 
benefit from the competitive pressures 
in the market with our extensive range 
of competitively priced products. Our 
German commercial operations were 
strengthened by the appointment of a 
national sales manager in February 
2015. The introduction of the LiquiBand® 
Fix8™ device is also expected to 
support progress in 2015 and we are 
reviewing the optimal way to service 
the dental market in Germany which 
involves multiple call points.
In the U.K., we are actively working 
on a number of hospital tenders and 
evaluations with the goal of 
becoming the main suture supplier 
to those hospitals. We believe our 
ability to supply a comprehensive 
range of top quality sutures that 
provide cost savings to hospitals is 
compelling. Winning any one of 
these current evaluations would 
significantly increase the presence 
of our brand in the U.K..
In R&D, our focus is on extending 
the attributes of our collagens to 
meet the needs of dental 
practitioners and oral surgeons. 
We expect to obtain approval for 
an enhanced collagen cone in 2015 
as well as making good progress in 
including new antibiotics in our 
haemostats. 
Branded Distributed
The Branded Distributed Business 
Unit reports the sales of our brands 
through distributors in territories 
where we do not have a national 
sales team.
Branded Distributed revenue was 17% 
higher at £10.2 million (2013: £8.8 
million) and 24% higher at constant 
currency. The main contributor to 
this growth was LiquiBand® sales in 
the U.S., which totalled £4.1 million 
and accounted for 40% of total sales. 22
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report 22
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report > Chief Executive’s Statement
LiquiBand® in the U.S.
Sales of LiquiBand®in the U.S. 
increased by 36% to £4.1 million 
(2013: £3.0 million) and by 43% 
at constant currency. The new 
distribution partner added at the end 
of 2013 performed well throughout 
the year and contributed to the 
growth in sales alongside existing 
partners. Given the high level of sales 
in the second half of 2013, which 
included some pipeline filling at the 
end of the year, our sales growth 
performance in 2014 was particularly 
strong. The latest data for December 
2014 shows our volume market share 
increasing to 7%, up from 6% at July 
2014, in the U.S. hospital sector, while 
our volume market share in the U.S. 
non-hospital, or alternate site market 
is now estimated at 19%, up from 18% 
at July 2014. 
We launched our 2-octyl 
cyanoacrylate formulation with one 
of our existing distribution partners 
in the second half of 2014 and have 
already added additional partners 
since the start of 2015. A strength 
of the business is the range of 
formulations of cyanoacrylate on 
offer, including very fast setting 
formulations with applicators 
allowing for quick, precision closure, 
and film-forming formulations that 
provide a barrier layer over wounds 
as well as closing the wound itself. 
With formulations that have 
properties in between, we have 
products that can accommodate 
the full spectrum of wound closing 
needs. 
LiquiBand® in Europe and ROW
Elsewhere, within Europe and R.O.W, 
LiquiBand® sales through our 
distributors, continued to show good 
growth, with our distributors in 
France and Italy continuing to 
perform well. Overall sales increased 
by 15% to £1.5 million (2013: £1.3 
million) at reported currency and 
constant currency. 
The regulatory approval process for 
LiquiBand® in China is progressing, 
however, owing to changes in the 
regulatory pathway, we now expect 
approval later in 2015. 
Hernia Mesh Fixation Device – 
LiquiBand® Fix8™
We received approval to market this 
product in Europe on 29 May 2014 
and it has now been launched in the 
U.K. and Germany with our own sales 
teams as well as through some 
European distributors who are able 
to support the product. The initial 
response has been very positive, 
with a number of surgeons keen to 
endorse the product. We are also 
receiving valuable feedback about 
other possible applications suitable 
for this type of device which we are 
currently working on.
We do not anticipate significant sales 
in the first half of the year as 
surgeons are individually trained on 
how to use the device and we wait 
to see the outcome of their surgery. 
Following positive feedback, we 
are confident that the product will 
contribute to growth in the second 
half of 2015 and thereafter.
RESORBA®
Sales of RESORBA® products to all 
export markets other than Russia grew 
by 6% at reported currency to £2.9 
million (2013: £2.8 million) and by 10% 
at constant currency. Growth was seen 
across several territories, with our 
French, Italian and Chinese distributors 
performing strongly. Sales in Russia 
increased by 4% at constant currency 
but decreased 18% to £1.3 million 
(2013: £1.6 million) at reported 
currency, reflecting the weakening 
rouble. The Russian market is unlikely 
to grow in the forseeable future. 
Work continues to gain approval 
to supply RESORBA® sutures and 
haemostats into the U.S. We have 
received our first approval for the 
sale of one type of suture for the U.S. 
market and are still on target for the 
remainder of the suture range to be 
approved in the first half of 2015, 
with the expectation that we can 
launch the products in the second 
half of 2015.
In R&D our focus is on continuing to 
improve the formulations of the base 
monomers that are used in our 
adhesives as well as extending the 
applications of tissue adhesives for 
internal use.
OEM
The OEM Business Unit reports the 
sales of products that are sold under 
third parties’ brands.
OEM revenue increased by 7% at 
reported currency to £25.3 million 
(2013: £23.6 million) and by 9% at 
constant currency. 
Our silver alginate range of dressings 
continued to perform well, with sales 
increasing by 8% at reported 
currency and by 10% at constant 
currency to £13.1 million (2013: £12.1 
million). Our partners continue to 
do well with the range of silver fibre 
dressings we provide gaining market 
share as well as accessing new 
geographical markets. We continue 
to support them with regulatory 
approvals and marketing data.
Sales of our foam-based dressings 
were flat at £1.8 million. This was due 
to one of our partners launching a 
new product range last year with 
sales following the typical second 
year post launch sales pattern 
reduction. Adjusting for this, sales 
elsewhere were encouraging and up 
20% on a proforma basis. Our other 
woundcare and skin protectant 
products delivered good growth 
growing by 9% to £9.7 million (2013: 
£8.9 million), while the collagen OEM 
business acquired with RESORBA® 
was flat year-on-year at £0.8 million, 
with little change expected in 2015.
In R&D the focus is on further 
developing our foam range to 
include both an antimicrobial and 
an atraumatic foam. These products 
are well advanced and we expect 
approvals in the first half of 2015, 
with a launch later this year. 
Bulk Materials
The Bulk Materials Business Unit 
reports sales of bulk materials to 
third party convertors.
Bulk Materials revenue decreased 
by 7% at reported currency to £3.9 
million (2013: £4.2 million) and by 4% 
at constant currency.
Chief Executive’s Statement continued Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Company Overview
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014

Rollstock foam contributed around 
85% of Bulk Materials revenue and 
good growth was seen by one 
significant customer that had 
destocked in 2013. However, sales by 
some newer and smaller partners 
were disappointing. Until sufficient 
scale of revenue is achieved with the 
customer base, the Bulk Materials 
Unit will remain vulnerable to the 
ordering patterns of its partners 
and customers.
In R&D the focus is on developing 
new foam formulations with 
antimicrobials, working in 
conjunction with the OEM Business 
Unit. These products are expected 
to be launched in 2015.
Operations
Efficiency and Gross Margins
We continue to strive for operational 
improvements by reducing set-up 
times, eliminating non-value added 
activities and increasing outputs. 
These incremental efficiencies are 
helping to improve gross margins 
across the Group and have helped 
to generate an improvement of 
approximately 100 basis points in 
2014, offsetting some of the negative 
impact resulting from movements 
in currency. We have invested in 
improving our converting capability 
in Winsford. This equipment is still 
being commissioned. We expect to 
increase our operational flexibility 
and improve efficiency in 2015 as a 
result.
Capacity and Resource
We have also identified the need to 
increase the capacity of our collagen 
plant in Germany. We anticipate that 
£1.0 million of investment is required 
in the plant in the second half of 
2015. We continue to invest in 
improving our Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) management and 
reporting systems. Following the 
successful launch of our new ERP 
system at our Plymouth site, the 
system was launched in Winsford in 
February 2014 and in Etten Leur in 
the Netherlands in September 2014. 
We constantly monitor our systems 
across the Group and will invest in 
further improvements to systems 
in Germany. 
Regulatory and Quality Assurance
With the regulatory framework 
gaining in complexity, we have 
continued to invest in both 
regulatory and quality functions and 
systems to ensure that we are able to 
support our partners with winning 
approvals in new markets as well as 
obtaining approval for our own 
products. We anticipate that we  
will continue to invest in these areas 
in 2015. 
R&D
The Group continues to develop new 
products through its R&D teams. We 
are well advanced in the approval 
process for our antimicrobial and 
atraumatic foams and, whilst external 
regulatory pathways are out of our 
control resulting in unclear timings, 
we expect to obtain several product 
approvals in 2015, enabling these 
products to be launched thereafter. 
Summary and Outlook
We delivered revenue growth of 6% 
(at constant currency this would have 
been 9%) and significantly improved 
profitability and cash generation 
during the year. 
Our three largest Business Units all 
delivered solid performance despite 
challenging currency conditions. We 
were particularly encouraged by 
strong growth in the U.S., where the 
competitive quality, range and 
pricing helped to drive gains in our 
market share. The successful launch 
of the LiquiBand® Fix8™ hernia mesh 
fixation device demonstrates our 
continued commitment to investing 
in innovation and during the year 
ahead we expect further product 
launches and advancements in our 
R&D activities. 
With continuing growth across our 
major Business Units, due to the 
strong performance of our products, 
new products progressing well and 
our anticipated broadening into new 
geographies, we are confident that 
the Group is well placed to drive 
growth as well as continued 
improvements in efficiencies and we 
remain excited by the prospects for 
our future.

Financial Review
Group revenue increased by 6% to £63.0 million (2013: £59.5 million). At constant currency, revenue growth would 
have been 9%. 
Comparisons with 2013 are made on a pre-amortisation of acquired intangible asset cost basis, as we believe that 
this provides a more relevant representation of the Group’s trading performance. Amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets was £0.4 million in the year (2013: £0.4 million).
To aid comparison the Group’s adjusted income statement is summarised in Table 1 below.

Revenues were negatively impacted by approximately £1.8 million due to the effects of currency movements in the year. 
This also had an impact on Group gross margins which were reduced by 50bps as a result. Gross margins were also 
negatively impacted by a sales mix effect by 120bps, however, this was partially offset by the estimated 100bps 
improvement made from operational efficiencies.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 10% to £15.6 million (2013: £14.1 million) and the adjusted operating margin 
increased by 100bps to 24.7% (2013: 23.7%). At a reported level, administration costs were flat year-on-year, helped  
by currency effects. Adjusting for currency, administration costs would have increased by 5%. Within this, the Group 
expensed to the income statement £2.1 million on R&D (2013: £2.2 million). Spend as a percentage of sales reduced to 
3.3% (2013: 3.7%), mainly as a result of timing of projects. 
Profit before tax for the year was 16% higher at £15.2 million (2013: £13.1 million). 
The Group’s effective rate of tax for the year was 15.5% (2013: 13.5%). This is reflective of the utilisation of previously 
unrecognised, brought-forward tax losses in the U.K., together with patent box and R&D relief. It also reflects the impact  
of blending profits and losses from different countries and the different tax rates associated with these countries.  
The effective tax rate of the Group is expected to increase going forward as a result of the tax losses being used up.
A reconciliation between the standard rate of taxation in the U.K. and the Group’s effective rate is summarised in 
Table 2 below.

Loss utilisation and recognition (3.61)

Earnings (excluding amortisation of acquired intangible assets) increased by 13% to £13.3 million (2013: £11.8 million), 
resulting in a 12% increase in adjusted basic earnings per share to 6.39p (2013: 5.72p) and an 11% increase in diluted 
adjusted earnings per share to 6.26p (2013: 5.64p). 
Profit after tax increased by 13% to £12.9 million (2013: £11.4 million), resulting in a 12% increase in basic earnings per 
share to 6.20p (2013: 5.52p) and a 12% increase in diluted earnings per share to 6.08p (2013: 5.45p).
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.48p per share to be paid on 29 May 2015 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 8 May 2015. This follows the interim dividend of 0.22p per share that was paid on 31 October 
2014 and would make a total dividend for the year of 0.70p per share (2013: 0.60p), a 17% increase on 2013.
The operational performance of the Business Units is shown in Table 3 below. The adjusted profit from operations 
and the adjusted margin are shown after excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles. In determining, and to aid 
comparison of, the operational margins of the individual Business Units the revenue of the Bulk Materials Business 
Unit sales made to other Business Units of £0.7 million (2013: £0.8 million) are included.

Branded Direct
The adjusted operating margin of this Business Unit remained at a similar level to the prior year at 27.4% (2013: 
27.3%) and lower than the position at H1 2014 (29.6%). As indicated at the half year we are investing in sales and 
marketing in our increasing direct sales teams.
Branded Distributed 
The adjusted operating margin of this Business Unit increased to 28.3% (2013: 20.3%), reflecting the improved 
profitability from the increase in sales in this Business Unit and in particular from sales to the U.S. The growth in 
sales to the U.S. mitigated the impact in margin from sales made into Russia and improved the margin seen at H1 
2014 (18.7%). 
OEM 
The adjusted operating margin of this Business Unit was at the same level to the prior year at 24.7% (2013: 24.7%) 
and lower than the margin reported at H1 2014 (27.1%). Margins are dependent on the mix of business, which at the 
half year had a greater percentage of silver alginate sales than at the full year.
Bulk Materials 
The adjusted operating margin of this Business Unit decreased to 10.6% (2013: 13.5%) but improved from the position at 
H1 2014 (9.8%). Margins were affected by the lower volumes of production as well as the different sales mix.
Geographic Breakdown of Revenues
The geographic breakdown of Group revenues in 2014 is shown in Table 4 below:
Table 4
Geographic Breakdown of Group Revenues
£ millions 2014 % of total 2013 % of total

USA 13.8 21.9 11.8 19.9
Rest of World 1.1 1.8 1.4 2.4
Although nearly 52% of the Group’s sales are in Europe (excluding the U.K.) only around 34% of sales are denominated  
in Euros. Approximately 80% of all sales to the U.S. are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Group hedges significant 
transaction exposure by using forward currency contracts and options and aims to have 70% of its estimated 
transactional exposure for the next twelve months hedged. The foreign currency hedges put in place in 2013 mitigated 
the effect of the adverse effects of currency in 2014 by around £1 million.

EBITDA increased by 10% to £18.6 million (2013: £16.9 million).
Working capital reduced slightly in the year but this was mainly due to the effects of translating overseas working 
capital balances held in Euros into sterling. 4.2 months of supply of inventory was held across the Group, slightly 
increased compared with the prior year (2013: 4.0 months of supply). Trade debtor days remained at the same level 
to the prior year at 43 (2013: 43) while trade payable days decreased to 36 (2013: 42). 
The Group generated net cash from operating activities of £18.4 million (2013: £14.2 million) (see Table 5) and had 
net cash of £17.3 million (2013: £5.3 million) at the end of the year.
We invested £2.4 million in capital equipment, software and capitalised R&D in the year (2013: £2.0 million). We have 
also invested in equipment around the Group that improves converting and packaging as well as in business systems.
The Group generated a free cash flow of £14.2 million in the year (2013: £11.5 million). The conversion of adjusted 
operating profit into free cash flow was 91% (2013: 81%).
The Group paid its final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 of £0.85 million (2013: for the year ending 
2012, £0.71 million) on 28 May 2014 and its interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2014 of £0.46 million 
(2013: £0.40 million) on 31 October 2014.
In December 2014 the Group entered into a new, five-year, £30 million, multi-currency, revolving credit facility with 
an accordion option under which AMS can request up to an additional £20 million on the same terms. The previous 
facility for £4 million was due to expire in 2015. The Group chose to take advantage of favourable credit conditions 
to put in place a more suitable facility to support the Group’s growth ambitions. The new facility is provided jointly 
by the Group’s existing bank HSBC, as well as The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC. It is unsecured and has not been 
drawn down. This facility carries an annual interest rate of LIBOR or EURIBOR plus a margin that varies between 
0.65% and 1.75% depending on the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio.
At the end of the period, the Group had net cash of £17.3 million (2013: £5.3 million). The movement in net cash from 
the start of the year to net cash at the end of the year is reconciled in Table 6 below:

Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2014
The Directors present their report, incorporating the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Strategic Report including the 
Chief Executive’s Statement and the Financial Review, 
and the audited financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2014.
Business Review and Future Developments
The Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to 
include a Strategic Report. The information that fulfils 
the requirements of the Strategic Report can be found 
on pages 11 to 30 which are incorporated in this report 
by reference. This report details the strategy and key 
risks of the Group, the performance for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and its prospects for the future.
Share Listing
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are admitted to and 
traded on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock 
Exchange. Further information regarding the Company’s 
share capital, including movements during the year, are 
set out in note 29 to the financial statements.
Capital Structure
The Group is debt free. 
The Group agreed a new, five-year, £30 million, multi-
currency, revolving, credit facility in December 2014 with 
an accordion option under which AMS can request up to 
an additional £20 million on the same terms. The new 
facility is provided jointly by the Group’s existing bank 
HSBC, as well as The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and 
replaces the previous £4 million facility. It is unsecured 
on the assets of the Group and is currently undrawn.
Key Performance Indicators
The Directors have monitored the performance of the 
Group with particular reference to the relevant key 
performance indicators: revenue growth, operating 
margin, earnings per share growth and customer service 
(OTIF). The Group monitors progress on a regular basis. 
Performance against the key performance indicators can 
be found on page 23. 
Going Concern
After making enquiries and on the basis outlined in the 
Corporate Governance Report on pages 39 to 42, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and for this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the accounts.
Dividends
The Group made a profit before tax for the year to  
31 December 2014 of £15.2 million (2013: £13.1 million).  
The Directors are recommending payment of a final 
dividend of 0.48p per share. The final dividend will, 
subject to shareholders’ approval, be paid on 29 May 
2015 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 8 May 2015. This will make a total dividend  
of 0.70p for the full year (2013: 0.60p).
Research and Development
The Group has expensed to the income statement in the 
year ended 31 December 2014 £2,120,000 
(2013: £2,196,000) on research and development. In 
accordance with International Accounting Standards a 
further £581,000 (2013: £612,000) has been capitalised. 
Following a review of development, £92,000 
(2013: £337,000) of impairments were made in 2014. 
Share Capital and Issue of Ordinary Shares
The authorised and issued share capital of the Company is 
set out in note 29 to the financial statements on page 70.

Directors’ Report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2014
Employees
The Group depends on the skills and engagement of its employees in order to achieve its objectives. Staff at every level 
are encouraged to make the fullest possible contribution to the Group’s success. The Group is an equal opportunities 
employer. It is committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination and giving fair and equal treatment to all employees 
and job applicants in terms of recruitment, pay conditions, promotions, training and all employment matters regardless  
of their age, disability, race, sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, gender 
reassignment, religion or belief. An Equality Policy is in force which aims to ensure that all employees are selected, 
trained, compensated, promoted and transferred solely on the strength of their ability, skills, qualifications and merit.  
The Group also believes that all employees have a right to work in an environment free from harassment and bullying.
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through meetings, both formal and informal, those 
matters likely to affect employees’ interests. The Employees’ Consultative Committee in the U.K., which comprises 
representatives of employees and management and the Work’s Council in Germany meet regularly to discuss 
business issues and areas of concern. Management also communicates with staff through regular team briefs.
The Group’s aim is to recruit and retain sufficient skilled and motivated employees to meet the needs of the business.  
The Group operates to the internationally recognised medical device standard ISO 13485. Staff work within a defined 
quality system and, where appropriate, are trained in Lean Manufacturing Practices. Each line manager is responsible for 
implementing this approach. Employees are encouraged to become involved in the financial performance of the Group 
through participation in the Group’s share option plans and are incentivised directly through the Company’s bonus 
scheme, performance reviews and training and development opportunities.
Employee Share Schemes
Employees, except for participants in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (2014 LTIP), may be eligible after a period of service 
to be granted options over shares in the Company under the Company Share Option Plan or Executive Share Option 
Scheme. The Group received HMRC approval in 2009 to adopt a Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). Under the CSOP, 
employees are allowed to receive up to £30,000 of options in a tax-efficient manner. Options granted under these 
schemes are not offered at a discount. Further details are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 35 to 38.
The Company also operates a Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (DSB) in which employees are invited to participate. 
The DSB encourages employee share ownership which helps to align the employees’ interests with those of the 
shareholders. The details on the DSB Scheme are provided in the Remuneration Report on page 36. The existing 
DSB was set up in 2006 and is coming to the end of its ten-year life. The Directors are proposing that a new DSB 
scheme be introduced on the same terms as the existing scheme.
The Company no longer satisfies the requirements for granting tax-efficient options under its EMI scheme. Options 
already granted under this scheme will be allowed to vest in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
983,346 Ordinary Shares (2013: 2,251,507) were issued during the year to employees exercising their share options. 
Details are given in note 31 to the Group financial statements.
Health and Safety
The Group is committed to high standards in health, safety and environmental performance. It is the Group’s policy 
to abide by all laws, directives and regulations pertinent to its field of operations and to act in a manner so as to 
minimise the effects of its operations on the environment. The Group provides safe places and systems of work, safe 
plant and machinery, safe handling of materials and ensures appropriate information, instruction and training is 
given. Employees are encouraged to identify ‘near misses’ to ensure preventative actions are taken to avoid any 
unsafe work practices and a common All Incident Rate (AIR) reporting metric is used across the Group. Emphasis is 
placed on all employees having a responsibility to maintain a safe working environment. Health & Safety Committees 
at all sites assist with advice on safe working practices and ensure any corrective action is taken where necessary. 
Health and Safety reports are regularly received from Group sites and are reviewed by the Board. Regular audits are 
undertaken to evaluate compliance with Group policy.
Environment
Where possible, the Group aims to reduce its impact on the environment. The facility at Winsford has been built with a 
high level of thermal insulation to reduce the Group’s carbon footprint. It utilises a solar wall, a renewable energy source 
that captures the sun’s warmth and supplements the building’s heating system. Lighting is controlled by movement 
sensors to avoid wastage and the heating system is fully programmable. Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Company Overview

Further details of the Directors’ remuneration and benefits are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 35  
to 38.
The Board has agreed procedures for considering and, where appropriate, authorising Directors’ conflicts or 
potential conflicts of interest. Only independent Directors i.e. those who have no interest in the matter under 
consideration will be able to take the relevant decision. In taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they 
consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s success. Directors will be able to impose limits 
or conditions when giving authorisation if they believe it is appropriate. The Board will report annually on the 
Company’s procedures for ensuring that the Board’s power of authorisation in respect of conflicts of interest 
operated effectively and that procedures have been followed. None of the Directors had any interest during or at the 
end of the year in any contract relating to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance
Insurance cover is in force in respect of the personal liabilities which may be incurred by Directors and officers of the 
Company in the course of their service with the Group, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.
Directors
The names of the current Directors together with brief biographies are shown on pages 28 and 29.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, Chris Meredith and Steve Bellamy will retire by rotation and, being 
eligible, will be proposed for re-election.
The terms of the Directors’ service contracts and details of the Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company, 
together with details of share options granted and any other awards made to the Directors are disclosed in the 
Remuneration Report commencing on page 35.
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 34 34
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
Governance
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial

In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable

the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance; 
and 
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The 
Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement

the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true

whole;
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a 
fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of 
approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought 
to have taken as Director in order to make himself/
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of S418 of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Deloitte LLP has expressed their willingness to continue 
in office as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them 
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting.

would be to approve the amendments to the Advanced 
Medical Solutions Group plc 2006 Deferred Share  
Bonus Plan.
The effect of Resolution 8, to be proposed at the 
meeting would be to allow the Company to allot shares 
conferred by S551 of the Companies Act 2006.

Remuneration Report
The Board presents the Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2014.
As an AIM listed company, Advanced Medical Solutions 
Group plc is not required to comply with the Directors 
remuneration report requirements under Main Market UK 
Listing Rules or those aspects of the Companies Act 
applicable to quoted companies. The following 
disclosures are made voluntarily.
The Remuneration Committee comprises four Non-
Executive Directors of the Group: Penny Freer 
(Chairman), Peter Allen, Steve Bellamy and Peter 
Steinmann. They have no personal financial interest, 
other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. 
They have no conflict of interest arising from cross-
directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running 
the business. They do not participate in any bonus, share 
option or pension arrangements. The Committee met 
seven times during the year. All meetings were attended 
by all members.
The Board has accepted the Remuneration Committee’s 
recommendations in full.
The Remuneration Committee, on behalf of the Board 
and in consultation with the Chief Executive, determines 
the Group’s policy on executive remuneration, 
employment conditions and the individual remuneration 
packages of the Executive Directors of all Group 
companies and management earning in excess of 
£100,000 per annum. It administers the share option 
schemes, determines the design of performance-related 
pay schemes, sets the targets for such schemes and 
approves payment under such schemes. The Terms of 
Reference of the Remuneration Committee are reviewed 
each year and are available on the Company’s 
website ‘www.admedsol.com’.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy is based on the need to offer 
competitive packages to attract, retain and motivate 
Senior Executives of the highest calibre, whilst at the 
same time not paying more than is necessary for this 
purpose. A cohesive reward structure consistently 
applied with links to corporate performance is seen as 
crucial in ensuring attainment of the Group’s strategic 
goals. Regular reviews of the policy are carried out, 
supported by independent advice, to ensure that the 
range and level of emoluments and incentive schemes 
continue to match current market practice. Kepler 
Associates were engaged in February 2012 to advise the 
Remuneration Committee with regard to the 
remuneration of the Executives and Senior Management, 
and provided further guidance in 2013 and 2014. The 
Remuneration Committee took into account their 
recommendations which included the introduction of an 
Executive Shareholding Policy in 2014 requiring the 
Executive Directors and Senior Management Team to 
hold a minimum of 100% and 50% respectively, of their 
pre-tax annual salary in Company shares within five 
years of attaining office as well as a change to the 
existing bonus scheme for 2014. As a result of the 
Committee’s recommendations a Deferred Annual Bonus 
(DAB) Scheme was approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM.
Salary
The Remuneration Committee reviews the salaries of the 
Executive Directors and Senior Managers of all Group 
companies annually and compares them against 
performance and market medians. This review was last 
carried out in October 2014.
Annual Performance Bonus
Each of the Executive Directors is entitled under the terms 
of their service agreements to receive an annual bonus to 
be determined by the Remuneration Committee based on 
the Group’s financial performance and the achievement of 
specific targets set by the Remuneration Committee. In 
2014, the targets set were against Group revenue, Group 
profit before tax and Earnings Per Share. Each participant 
may receive up to 100% of their salary as a bonus. 85% of 
the award is dependent upon the financial performance of 
the Group and 15% is achievable for meeting personal 
objectives. Senior Management are also entitled to receive 
up to 50% of their salary in bonus, of which 86% of the 
award is dependent on financial performance targets and 
14% on personal objectives.
Deferred Annual Bonus
Following advice from Kepler, the Remuneration 
Committee introduced a Deferred Annual Bonus (2014 
DAB) Scheme after receiving shareholder approval at the 
2014 AGM whereby both Executive Directors and Senior 
Managers are required to defer up to 25% of their annual 
bonus into share awards that will vest after three years. 
Share Options
Employees, except for participants in the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP), may be granted options over 
shares in the Company under the Company Share Option 
Plan and Executive Share Option Scheme, under which 
either approved or unapproved options may be granted. 
Options granted under these schemes are not offered at 
a discount.
The exercising of options under these schemes is 
conditional on certain performance conditions which are 
pre-determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
Options are exercisable normally only after the third 
anniversary of the date of grant (or such later time as 
may be determined at the time of grant) and cannot in 
any event be exercised later than the tenth anniversary 
of the date of grant. Awards will not vest if the Group is 
not profitable at the end of the performance period. Full 
details are included in note 31 on pages 71 to 76. 36 36
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
Governance
Remuneration Report continued
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Company received approval for a Company Share 
Option Plan (CSOP) on 2 June 2010. This was adopted 
after HMRC approval on 13 August 2010. This Plan allows 
relevant employees to receive up to £30,000 of 
Company shares by reference to the market value of 
these shares on the grant date and to benefit from the 
growth in value of those shares.
2009 Executive Share Option Scheme
Options granted under this scheme are not offered at a 
discount. Up until 2010, the Company was able to offer 
options under an Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) 
Scheme. The Company no longer satisfies the 
requirements for operating this scheme, however, 
options already granted will be allowed to vest in 
accordance with the scheme rules. 
Long-Term Incentives
The Company introduced a new Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (2014 LTIP) at the 2014 AGM replacing the existing 
LTIP which was due to expire in 2015. Individuals who are 
entitled to awards under the 2014 LTIP are not eligible to 
receive options under the Company’s Share Option Plan 
or the Executive Share Option Scheme. The objectives of 
the LTIP are to align the interests of Executives with 
those of shareholders by making a part of remuneration 
dependent on the success of management in delivering 
superior returns to shareholders. 50% of the Award is 
determined based on the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance of the Company compared with the AIM 
Healthcare Share Index over the vesting period and 50% 
of the Award is determined by the growth in the average 
Earnings Per Share (EPS) per year of the Company over 
the three-year vesting period.
Of the 50% of the Award that is determined by reference 
to the AIM Healthcare Share Index, no shares will be 
awarded if the Company is ranked below the median. 
Awards will vest on a sliding scale from 25% to 100% for 
performance above median to upper quartile 
performance against the Index.
The performance measurement for EPS will be based on 
the percentage increase of the Company’s EPS over the 
vesting period. Awards will vest on a sliding scale from 
25% to 100% for an average increase of EPS over target 
EPS to an average increase of EPS of 20% over the 
vesting period. No awards will be made for an average 
increase of EPS below target EPS. In 2014 the EPS target 
was set at 5%. 
The Remuneration Committee has the flexibility to make 
appropriate adjustments to the performance conditions 
to ensure that the Award achieves its original purpose. 
Any vesting is also subject to the Remuneration 
Committee being satisfied that the Company’s 
performance on these measures is consistent with the 
underlying performance of the business.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The Company also has a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (the 
DSB) which is available to all employees. The DSB allows 
for the payment of bonus to be made in the form of 
shares. It also allows for the provision of additional 
matching shares if the bonus shares are held for a set 
period. The DSB encourages employees to acquire 
shares in the Company and retain those shares to receive 
additional free shares from the Company. It acts as a 
valuable retention tool and aligns the employees’ 
interests with those of shareholders. The first year that 
the DSB operated was in 2007. 
The DSB, originally introduced in 2006, is due to end on 
30 May 2016. It is being proposed at the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting that the existing DSB scheme be 
extended.
Pension
All employees are entitled to become members of the 
Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which was 
set up with effect from 1 February 1999. The Scheme 
entitles Executive Directors to contribute up to 10% of 
salary with the Group contributing 10%. All other 
employees contribute 3% of their salary which is 
matched by a 6% contribution from the Group. The 
Pension Plan is a money purchase scheme. In 2011, the 
Group made further arrangements allowing individuals 
to sacrifice their salary for pension contributions. 
Automatic enrolment was implemented in 2014.
Service Agreements
The service agreements for Chris Meredith and Mary 
Tavener are terminable by either party giving not less 
than 12 months’ notice in writing.
Private Healthcare
Executive Directors and other senior employees are 
entitled to private healthcare and permanent health 
insurance.
Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined 
by the Executive Directors. No Director or Senior 
Manager shall be involved in any decisions as to their 
own remuneration. Non-Executive Directors receive 
travel expenses but do not participate in any incentive 
arrangements. The Non-Executive Directors have 
entered into terms of appointment. The Non-Executive 
Directors’ appointments are terminable by either party 
upon six months’ notice in writing without any right to 
compensation on early termination. Don Evans retired as 
Chairman on 31 December 2013 and exercised all of his 
remaining LTIPs and DSBs during the year with the 
exception of 4,411 shares from the DSB Scheme which

Corporate Governance Report
UK Corporate Governance Code
The rules relating to AIM companies do not require the 
Company to report in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 (the Code). However, the Board is 
committed to the principles of good corporate 
governance and the Directors have applied the Code in a 
manner which they consider appropriate for the size of 
the Group. 
Board Composition and diversity
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, the 
Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and three 
Non-Executive Directors. The Directors’ biographies 
appear on pages 28 and 29 and detail their experience 
and suitability for leading and managing the Group. The 
Non-Executive Directors, all of whom are considered by 
the Board to be independent, bring a valuable range of 
expertise and experience in assisting the Group to 
achieve its strategic aims. The Chairman fosters a climate 
of debate and challenge in the boardroom. This is built 
on his challenging but supportive relationship with the 
Chief Executive which sets the tone for Board interaction 
and discussions.
We recognise the importance of diversity at Board level 
and our Board members comprise a number of different 
nationalities with a wide range of skills and experiences 
from a variety of business backgrounds. Our current 
female representation on the Board is 33.3%, already 
above the minimum representation level to be achieved 
by 2015. 
Peter Allen was appointed as Chairman on 1 January 
2014 following his appointment as a Non-Executive 
Director on 4 December 2013 and is considered to be 
independent. The size of the Board during 2014 was six. 
All Directors are required to stand for re-election at the 
first Annual General Meeting following their appointment 
and, as a minimum, every three years thereafter. 
Senior Independent Director
In 2010 Penny Freer was appointed as Senior 
Independent Director.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated specific authority to the Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee and the 
Nomination Committee.
Peter Allen, Penny Freer, Steve Bellamy and Peter 
Steinmann are members of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees. Chris Meredith is a member of 
the Nomination Committee. 
The Terms of Reference of all three Board Committees 
are available on our corporate website ‘www.admedsol.
com’.
Role of the Board
The Board retains full and effective control of the Group 
and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for its 
approval. The Board is responsible for formulating the 
Group’s corporate strategy, approval of budgets, 
monitoring financial performance, approval and review 
of major capital expenditure, corporate governance and 
risk management. Matters are delegated to the Board 
Committees, Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management Team where appropriate. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary and can take independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense. 
The Board approves the appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary. The Non-Executive Directors are 
able to contact the Executive Directors and Senior 
Managers at any time for further information.
Board and Committee meetings
The Board meets on a formal basis regularly, and met 
formally eleven times in 2014. Members are supplied with 
reports from Executive Directors in good time for review 
in advance of the meetings. Most Board Committee 
meetings are scheduled around Board meetings with 
Committee Reports issued well in advance of the 
meeting. 
During 2014 the Board met eleven times, the Audit 
Committee three, Remuneration Committee seven and 
the Nomination Committee twice.
The Directors attended the following meetings in the 
year ended 31 December 2014:

Board and Committee Evaluation
The performance evaluation of the Board, its 
Committees and Directors is undertaken by the 
Chairman annually and implemented in collaboration 
with the Committee Chairmen. The 2014 Board and 
Committee evaluations were conducted by way of each 
Director and Committee member completing 
comprehensive questionnaires. The results were collated, 
discussed and acted upon by the Board and Committees. 
The Board reviews the outcomes of the Committee 
evaluations and assesses their performance. The 
Chairman confirms that the performance of the Non-
Executive Directors continues to be effective. 40 40

Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
Professional Advice, Indemnities and Insurance
There is provision for Directors to take independent 
professional advice relating to the discharge of their 
responsibilities should they feel they need it. The 
Company has arranged Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance against certain liabilities and defence costs. 
However, the Directors’ insurance does not provide 
protection in the event of a Director being found to 
have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Investor Relations
The Board appreciates that effective communication 
with the Company’s shareholders and the investment 
community as a whole is a key objective. The views of 
both institutional and private shareholders are important, 
and these can be varied and wide-ranging, as is their 
interest in the Company’s strategy, reputation and 
performance. The Executive Directors have overall 
responsibility for ensuring effective communication 
and the Company maintains a regular dialogue with 
its shareholders, mainly in the periods following the 
announcement of the interim and final results, but also 
at other times during the year. The views of shareholders 
are sought through direct contact and via feedback from 
advisors and are communicated to the Board as a whole. 
The Board encourages the participation of shareholders 
at its Annual General Meeting, notice of which is sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
meeting. The AMS website ‘www.admedsol.com’ is 
regularly updated and provides additional information on 
the Group including information on the Group’s products 
and technology. 
Annual General Meeting
This year’s AGM will, as last year, include a presentation 
by the Chief Executive on the current progress of the 
business and allow the opportunity for questions on this 
or any of the resolutions before the meeting. The 
Company proposes separate resolutions for each issue 
and specifically relating to the reports and accounts. 
The Company ensures all proxy votes are counted and 
indicates the level of proxies on each resolution along 
with the abstentions after it has been dealt with on a 
show of hands.
After the meeting, shareholders will have the opportunity 
to talk informally to the Board and raise any further 
questions or issues they may have. The outcome of the 
AGM, a copy of the AGM presentation and details of the 
poll results will be posted on the Company’s website 
after the meeting.
Internal Control 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, taking 
guidance from the Audit Committee. In the context of 
the Group’s business any such system can only 
reasonably be expected to manage rather than eliminate 
risks arising from its operations. It can therefore only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material loss or misstatement.
Key features of the internal control system are as follows:
• the Group has an organisational structure with clear 
responsibilities and lines of accountability. The Group 
promotes the values of integrity and professionalism. 
The members of the Board are available to hear, in 
confidence, any individual’s concerns about 
improprieties; 
• the Board has a schedule of matters expressly 
reserved for its consideration. This schedule includes 
potential acquisitions, major capital projects, treasury, 
risk management policies, approval of budgets and 
health & safety;
• the Board monitors the activities of the Group through 
the management accounts, monthly forecasts and 
other reports on current activities and plans. The 
Senior Management Team regularly monitors financial 
and operational performance in detail; 
• the Group has set appropriate levels of authorisation 
which must be adhered to as the Group concludes its 
business;
• the Group operates a ‘whistle-blowing’ policy enabling 
any individual with a concern to approach the Non-
Executive Directors in confidence; and 
• the Group has appointed a third party to carry out 
internal audits on behalf of the Group which is 
managed by the Audit Committee.
Risk Management
The recent challenging business climate has resulted in a 
sustained focus on the approach to risk. The Directors 
consider risk management to be crucial to the Group’s 
success and give a high priority to ensuring that adequate 
systems are in place to evaluate and limit risk exposure. 
Management are responsible for the identification and 
evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of 
the business together with the design and operation of 
suitable internal controls. These risks have been 
discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 11 to 30, and 
are assessed on a continual basis, and may be associated 
with a variety of internal or external factors including 
financial and operational risks. Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Company Overview
41
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
41
Management report to the Audit Committee regularly on 
their review of risks and how they have managed the risks. 
The Audit Committee reviews the inherent risks, including 
the key risks and the system of control necessary to 
manage such risks. The Audit Committee also reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s procedure in managing risk 
and, therefore, believes it meets the requirements of the 
FRC guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting. The business 
risks and controls to mitigate the risks are formally 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board at least 
twice a year. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Steve Bellamy (Chairman), 
Penny Freer, Peter Steinmann and Peter Allen. 
Steve Bellamy, a qualified Chartered Accountant, chairs 
the Committee. The Committee has Terms of Reference 
that are reviewed at least annually and were updated at 
the end of 2014. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as 
Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met three times during the year. The 
Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance Director, Group 
Financial Controller, external audit partner and internal 
auditor attended a number of these meetings. The Audit 
Committee also met with the external audit partner 
without the Executives and Senior Managers present and 
the Audit Committee Chairman met with external audit 
partner separately. The role of the Committee is to:
• consider the nature and scope of the audit process 
(both internal and external) and its effectiveness;
• consider the appointment, fees, independence and 
effectiveness of the auditors and the audit process, 
and discuss the scope of the audits and their findings; 
• monitor the Group’s accounting policies;
• review and challenge the Group’s assessment of 
business risks and internal controls to mitigate these 
risks as well as reviewing the annual and interim 
statements prior to their submission for approval by 
the Board; 
• review and challenge the Going Concern assumptions 
for the Group; 
• review the Group’s Whistle-blowing, Bribery and Gifts 
policies; 
• review the internal audit plan and the reports of the 
internal auditors; and
• annually assess the performance of the external 
auditor.
It is the task of the Audit Committee to ensure that 
auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded 
when non-audit services are provided by the auditor. 
To ensure auditor objectivity and independence there 
is a process in place to approve any non-audit work.
The Audit Committee provides advice to the Board on 
whether the annual report is fair, balanced and provides 
the necessary information shareholders require to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy. In doing so, the following issues have been 
addressed specifically:
• review of key strategic risks – the Audit Committee 
conducts a review of the key strategic risks every six 
months. The review highlights the key risks based on a 
combination of likelihood and impact and then also 
considers what appropriate mitigants should be 
implemented. The results from this work are included 
in the Strategic Review.
• review of judgements made by management, 
including the discount rate used in determining 
whether there has been an impairment of goodwill.
• Going Concern – the conclusion of the review of the 
Going Concern assessment is included in Note 2.
Internal Audit
Following a review of the Group in 2012, the Audit 
Committee proposed, and the Board accepted, that a 
separate internal audit function be set up. This was 
achieved by outsourcing to Baker Tilly LLP. The Audit 
Committee have prepared the Terms of Reference and 
will continue to utilise Baker Tilly’s service as required 
in 2015. Findings and recommendations are received 
by the Audit Committee, who also review progress on 
corrective actions. The Audit Committee:
• approves the appointment of and the termination of 
the internal auditors;
• reviews and approves the charter of the internal audit 
function and ensures the function has the necessary 
resources and access to information to enable it to 
fulfil its mandate and is equipped to perform in 
accordance with appropriate professional standards 
for internal auditors;
• ensures the internal auditor has direct access to the 
Board Chairman and to the Committee Chairman and 
is accountable to the Committee;
• reviews and assesses the annual internal audit work 
plan;
• receives a report on the results of the internal auditors 
work on a periodic basis;
• reviews and monitors management’s responsiveness to 
the internal auditor’s findings and recommendations;
• meets with the internal auditor at least once a year 
without the presence of management; and
• monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the 
Company’s controls in the context of the Company’s 
overall risk management system.
All internal audit reports are discussed with the Audit 
Committee and the external auditor, and the 
recommendations considered and acted upon. Baker 
Tilly LLP attends Audit Committee meetings every six 
months and updates the Audit Committee in writing 
ahead of the Committee meetings. 42 42
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
The Group also calls on the services of external bodies to 
review the controls in certain areas of the Group. The 
quality assurance systems are reviewed by the Group’s 
notified bodies, the British Standards Institution (BSI) 
and TÜV Rheinland, on a regular basis.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Penny Freer 
(Chairman), Steve Bellamy, Peter Steinmann and 
Peter Allen.
The Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive, 
determines the Group’s policy on Executive 
remuneration, employment conditions and the individual 
remuneration packages of Executive Directors of all 
Group companies and all Management earning in excess 
of £100,000 per annum. It also approves all new 
incentive schemes, the grants of options under the 
Group’s share option schemes and the grant of shares 
under the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The 
Committee has Terms of Reference that are reviewed at 
least annually and were updated at the end of 2014. The 
Deputy Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Remuneration Committee met seven 
times in 2014. The report of the Committee is included 
on pages 35 to 38.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Peter Allen 
(Chairman), Penny Freer, Steve Bellamy, Chris Meredith 
and Peter Steinmann.
The Committee nominates and recommends the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board, considers 
succession planning for Directors, other Senior 
Management and membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. In making recommendations, 
the Committee takes into account the balance of skill, 
knowledge and experience of the Board and gives due 
regard to the benefits of diversity of the Board, including 
gender. The Committee has Terms of Reference that are 
reviewed at least annually and were updated at the end 
of 2014. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as 
Secretary to the Committee. The Committee met twice 
during the year.
Going Concern
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, 
the Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s 
financial position and cash flow forecasts for the next 
twelve months from signing of the accounts. These have 
been based on a comprehensive review of revenue, 
expenditure and cash flows, taking into account specific 
business risks and the current economic environment.
With regard to the Group’s financial position, it had cash 
and cash equivalents at the year end of £17.3 million 
(2013: £5.3 million) and was debt free (2013: debt free). 
The Group agreed a new, five-year, £30 million, multi-
currency, revolving credit facility in December 2014 with 
an accordion option under which AMS can request up to 
an additional £20 million on the same terms. The new 
facility is provided jointly by the Group’s existing bank 
HSBC, as well as The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and 
replaces the previous £4 million facility. It is unsecured 
on the assets of the Group and is currently undrawn.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, 
AMS operates in a market whose demographics are 
favourable, underpinned by an increasing need for 
products to treat chronic and acute wounds. 
Consequently, market growth is predicted. The Group 
has a number of long-term contracts with customers 
across different geographic regions and also with 
substantial financial resources, ranging from government 
agencies through to global healthcare companies.
Having taken the above into consideration, the Directors 
have reached the conclusion that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks in the current 
economic environment. Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc
We have audited the financial statements of Advanced 
Medical Solutions Group plc for the year ended

Statement, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash 
Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes 1 to 33, the Parent Company 
Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 8. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the group financial statements is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that 
is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information gven in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors· Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns, 
or
• certain disclosures of directors· remuneration 
specified by law are not made, or
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.

Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Reporting Entity
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc (the Company) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in 
England and Wales (registration number 2867684). The Company’s registered address is Premier Park, 33 Road 
One, Winsford Industrial Estate, Cheshire, CW7 3RT.
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company for the twelve months ended 31 December 2014 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group).
The Group is primarily involved in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of novel high performance 
polymers (both natural and synthetic) for use in advanced woundcare dressings, medical adhesives for closing and 
sealing tissue, and sutures and haemostats for sale into the global medical device market.
2 Basis of Preparation
The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as 
adopted by the E.U.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting except as disclosed in the 
accounting policies set out below.
The individual financial statements for each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s financial 
position and cash flow forecasts for the next twelve months. These have been based on a comprehensive review of 
revenue, expenditure and cash flows, taking into account specific business risks and the current economic environment. 
With regards to the Group’s financial position, it had cash and cash equivalents at the year end of £17.3 million. The 
Group also has in place a new five year, unsecured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility for £30 million which was 
undrawn during 2014.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, the Group operates in markets whose demographics are 
favourable underpinned by an increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. Consequently, 
market growth is predicted. The Group has a number of long-term contracts with customers across different 
geographic regions and also with substantial financial resources, ranging from government agencies through to 
global healthcare companies.
After taking the above into consideration, the Directors have reached a conclusion that the Group is well placed 
to manage its business risks in the current economic environment. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
The Group has adopted IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 28 Investments 
in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011), IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 Separate Financial 
Statements (2011), IAS 32 Amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32, Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, 
Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement, Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and 
IAS 27. These have had no significant impact on this set of financial information.
3 Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates and Judgments
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any 
future periods affected.
Impairment of Goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which the assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value. Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Company Overview
49
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
49
Capitalisation of Development Costs
In determining the development expenses to be capitalised, estimates and assumptions are required based on 
expected future economic benefits generated by products that are the result of these development costs. Other 
important estimates and assumptions in this assessment process are the required internal rate of return, the 
distinction between research and development and the estimated useful life.
Share-based Payment
The charge to the income statement in relation to options and incentive plans is based on either the Black-Scholes 
Merton or the Monte Carlo Option Pricing Model valuation technique. This technique requires a number of assumptions 
to be made such as those in relation to share price volatility, movement in interest rates, dividend yields and staff 
behavioural patterns.
Inventory Impairment Provisions
The Group makes provisions for inventory deemed to be obsolete or slow-moving. This provision is established on 
each individual stock keeping unit (SKU) based on the age of the stock, the forward order book, management’s 
experience and its assessment of the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Receivables Impairment Provisions
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Deferred Tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is judged probable that the Group will generate taxable profits which 
can be offset against tax losses.
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to retain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of 
the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of acquisition accounting, from 
the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated upon consolidation.
Business Combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, the 
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable 
to the issue of debt or equity. Acquisition related expenses are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the 
costs are incurred and the services rendered, with the exception of directly attributable costs incurred as a result of 
raising equity, which are off-set against share premium, and raising debt, which are capitalised and amortised over 
the term of the debt. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets 
(or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost 
of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date 
of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. 50 50

Revenue Recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of sales of the Group’s products to external customers at amounts excluding value 
added tax, and is recognised when the products have been delivered and title has passed. Revenue is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue from royalty income receivable under licence agreements from external customers at amounts excluding 
value added tax is recognised as the products under licence are sold and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Other Income
This represents non-refundable up-front licence payments received for the grant of rights for the development and 
marketing of products, and other sundry income. The income is recognised in the income statement, over the life of 
each development project, in proportion to the stage of completion of each project.
Finance Income
Finance income relates to interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest income is accrued on 
a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Finance Costs
Finance costs relate to finance payments associated with financial liabilities. They are recognised in the income 
statement as they accrue using the effective interest method.
Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are added to the cost 
of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on 
qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event. 
It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the 
income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the 
date the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, 
are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenue and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates 
at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognised in equity.
Hedging
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-
derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash 
flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various 
hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents 
whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged 
item. Note 25 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.  Governance Strategic Report Financial Statements Company Overview
51
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
51
Taxation
Taxation expense includes the amount of current income tax payable and the charge for the year in respect of 
deferred taxation.
The income tax payable is based on an estimation of the amount due on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable 
profit is different from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income 
or expenditure which are not taxable or deductible in the year as a result of either the nature of the item or the fact 
that it is taxable or deductible in another period. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on a basis of temporary differences except to the extent where it arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case it is dealt with within equity. It is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
Intangible Assets
Acquired Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property rights that are acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value. 
Intellectual property rights purchased outright are initially recognised at cost. Intellectual property rights are 
capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, usually not exceeding 18 years. In determining 
the useful economic life each asset is reviewed separately and consideration given to the period over which the 
Group expects to derive economic benefit from the asset.
Development Costs
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, 
is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new 
or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised once it can be demonstrated that the product or 
process is clearly identifiable, technically and commercially feasible, will generate future economic benefits, that the 
development costs of the asset can be measured reliably and the Group has sufficient resources to complete 
development. Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of materials and direct labour less accumulated amortisation.
Where development expenditure results in new or substantially improved products or processes and it is probable 
that recovery will take place, it is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the product’s useful life, 
starting from the date on which serial production commences, which is between one and ten years. Patents and 
trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives, which is between three and twenty years.
Software Intangibles
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and 
categorised as intangible assets. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its economic useful life, which 
is between three to ten years.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Land and buildings and plant and equipment held for use in the production of goods and services or for 
administrative purposes are carried in the balance sheet at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and 
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The Group elected to use the fair value as the deemed cost in respect of land and buildings at the date of transition 
to IFRS. Fair value was calculated by reference to their existing use at the date of transition. 52 52
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
Financial Statements
3 Accounting Policies continued
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment, 
over the expected useful life of the asset from the date that the asset is brought into use. It is calculated at the 
following rates:
• Freehold property and improvements    –   4% per annum on cost
• Leasehold improvements     –   over the length of the lease
• Plant and machinery     –   6.7% to 33.3% per annum on cost
• Fixtures and fittings     –   33.3% per annum on cost
• Motor vehicles     –   25% per annum on cost
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production are carried at cost, less any recognised 
impairment loss. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property, plant and equipment assets, 
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Excluding Goodwill
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds 
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated to reduce the carrying amount of 
the assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of Recoverable Amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of 
estimated future cash flows. As the Group’s receivables are of short duration they are not discounted.
Reversal of Impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in 
recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may 
no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where 
applicable, direct labour costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal.
The Group makes provision for inventory deemed to be irrecoverable or where the net realisable value is lower than 
cost. This provision is established on a stock keeping unit (SKU) basis by reference to the age of the stock, the forward 
order book, management’s experience and its assessment of the present value of estimated future cash flow.

Financial Instruments
Classification of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments are classified as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments.
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two 
conditions:
• They include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets that are 
potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
• Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative 
that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative 
that will be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of 
its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. 
Recognition and Valuation of Financial Assets
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and cash deposits and amounts under short-term 
guarantees, usually three months or less, that are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments 
and are subject to insignificant risk in change in value and which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
Investments
Cash held in accounts with more than 90 days’ notice that are not required to meet short-term cash commitments 
are shown as an investment. The Group invests funds which are surplus to requirements in fixed rate deposits 
operating within parameters for credit ratings and credit limits for individual institutions that are approved and 
monitored by the Board.
Under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments; recognition and measurement’, such investments are classified as loans and 
receivables and are recognised at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
Trade and Other Receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. 
An impairment is made when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered in full. The recoverable amount is 
calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are not discounted due 
to the relatively short period of time between recognition of trade receivables and receipt of cash.
Recognition and Valuation of Equity Instruments
Equity instruments are stated at par value. Any premium on issue is taken to the share premium account.
Recognition and Valuation of Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade Payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Other Loans
Other loans are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost.
Financial Liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)
A derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument is classified as held for trading. Financial 
liabilities are classified at FVTPL where the financial liabilities are held for trading.
FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Fair value is determined 
in the manner described in note 25. 54 54

The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. 
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 25 to the financial statements.Derivatives are 
initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss (administrative 
costs) immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the 
timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group currently 
designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk 
of firm commitments (cash flow hedges). A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset 
whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. 
Derivatives with remaining maturity of less than twelve months are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Leased Assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held as finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned 
between the reduction of the lease liability and finance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the 
shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly 
to the income statement. Lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are capitalised and 
spread over the period of the lease term on a straight line basis unless another systematic basis is more 
representative of the time pattern of the users’ benefit. Payments made to acquire operating leases are treated as 
prepaid lease expenses and amortised over the life of the lease.
Pensions
The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of 
the Group in an independently administered fund. The amount charged against the income statement represents 
the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Share-based Payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’. IFRS has been applied to all options 
granted after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The Group issues equity–settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value as determined at the grant date of equity–settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes Merton or Monte Carlo model. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.
Capital Management
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group had net funds with no borrowings. Capital is managed by 
maximising retained profits. Working capital is managed in order to generate maximum conversion of these profits 
into cash and cash equivalents thereby maintaining capital. 
Capital includes share capital, share premium, investment in own shares, share-based payments reserve, share-
based payments deferred tax reserve, other reserve, translation reserve and retained earnings reserve. There are no 
externally imposed capital requirements on the Group.

The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): ‘Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc UK Employee Benefit 
Trust’.

The Group records assets and liabilities of the Trust as its own.
In compliance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation Group’, shares held by the EBT are included in 
the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction in equity. Gains and losses on Group shares are recognised directly 
in reserves.

Acquired intellectual property rights were initially recognised on the acquisition of MedLogic Global Limited 
representing patents and on the acquisition of RESORBA® representing brand names, know-how and customer 
listings and contracts.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis and the amortisation is recognised within administration 
costs. The largest intangible asset being amortised is RESORBA® ‘know-how’ which is being amortised over 10 years 
with 7 years remaining. The only exception is the RESORBA® brand name, which the Directors believe has an 
unlimited useful economic life and has a carrying value of £8,083,000. In reaching this assessment, the Directors 
have considered that the RESORBA® brand has existed for over 80 years and is widely recognised as a market 
leader in the surgical market.

against future profits. A deferred tax asset of £1.7 million (2013: £2.1 million) has been recognised in respect of such 
losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £1.4 million (2013: £4.2 million) of such 
losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.

The recoverable amounts have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation on a cash generating unit basis, 
which uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Directors covering a twelve month 
period. These budgets have been adjusted for specific risk factors that take into account sensitivities of the 
projection. The base twelve month projection is extrapolated using reasonable growth rates specific to each cash 
generating unit up to year five, between 0% and 10%, and has not been inflated for years six to twenty which 
management believes does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry and forecast company 
growth; the growth rate would have to fall significantly in order for an impairment to be required. A discount rate of 
8% per annum (2013: 8%), being the Group’s current pre tax weighted average cost of capital, has been applied to 
these cash flows, being an estimation of current market risks and the time value of money. The Group has conducted 
a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test. The Directors believe that any reasonably possible further change in the 
key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause any of the carrying amounts to exceed 
the relevant recoverable amount.

Financial Statements
20 Trade and Other Receivables continued
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 43 days (2013 : 43 days). No interest is charged on the receivables 
within the contracted credit period. Thereafter, interest may be charged at 2% per month on the outstanding balance. 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited 
due to the Group’s large and unrelated customer base. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit 
provision required in excess of the allowance for impairments.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit 
limits by customer. Limits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and reflect current payment history.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the 
Group has not provided for, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still 
considered recoverable. A large proportion of debts overdue over 30 days were recovered post the balance sheet 
date. The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances. The carrying 
amount and ageing of these debtors are summarised below:

payables that are within pre-agreed credit terms. Thereafter, interest may be charged on the outstanding balances 
at various interest rates. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are 
paid within the pre-agreed credit terms. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

In December 2014 the Group entered into a multi-currency facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC. 
The principle features of the facility are:
• the committed value of the facility is £30 million
• there is an uncommitted accordion of an additional £20 million
• it is unsecured
• the facility expires in December 2019
• the interest payable on drawings under the loan is based on inter-bank interest (EURIBOR or, if sterling 
denominated LIBOR) plus a sliding scale margin determined by the Group’s leverage:
 – the margin is currently 0.65%
 – the facility has two convenants - interest cover (ratio of EBITDA to net finance charges) must be above 4:1 and 
leverage (ratio of Total Net Debt to adjusted EBITDA) should not exceed 3:1
• it was undrawn at the end of the year

Other Reserve
This represents Advanced Medical Solutions Limited’s share premium account arising from merger accounting.
Hedging Reserve
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed 
effective in cash flow hedges. The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit 
or loss only when the hedged transaction impacts the profit or loss, or is included as a basis adjustment to the 
non-financial hedged item, consistent with the applicable accounting policy.
Translation Reserve
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations which relate to 
subsidiaries only from their functional currency into the parents functional currency, being sterling, are recognised 
directly in the translation reserve. Gains and losses on hedging instruments that are designated as hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations are included in the translation reserve. A £4,200,000 loss has been recorded in 
the translation reserve during the period, which would otherwise have been recognised in administration costs 
(2013: £732,000 gain), if hedge accounting had not been adopted. 72 72

Under the terms of the Company’s Share Option Schemes, approved by Shareholders in 1999 and amended in 2001 
and 2002, the Board may offer options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company to all employees of the Company 
at the market price on a date to be determined prior to the date of the offer. Since 2005, individuals who are entitled to 
awards under the LTIP are no longer eligible to receive options under the Company’s Share Option Schemes.
Performance targets are assessed over a three-year period from the date of grant. Once options have vested they 
can be exercised during the period up to ten years from the date of grant.
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price over the 
previous three years.

Financial Statements
1 Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the 
year and the preceding year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption of FRS8 from disclosing transactions with other members of 
the Group and the exemption in FRS29 for making disclosures in relation to financial instruments.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, 
cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued. Any premium is ignored.
Financial Liabilities and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities.
Share-based Payments
The Group has applied the requirements of FRS20 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, FRS20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested 
as at 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value as determined at the grant date of equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes Merton model or the Monte-Carlo Option Pricing Model. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
2 Profit for the Year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and 
loss account for the year. AMS Group plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 of 
£5,691,000 (2013: profit of £6,606,000).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
The average number of employees in the year was 11 (2013: 10). The Directors’ remuneration is detailed in note 8 to 
the consolidated financial statements.

1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by the notice set out above may appoint a proxy 
to attend, speak and, on a poll, to vote in his place. A holder of more than one ordinary share may appoint 
different proxies in relation to each or any of those ordinary shares.

how to appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out at 
note 1 of the proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting you will need to appoint 
your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them. 
4. On a vote on a resolution on a show of hands at the meeting, a proxy has one vote for and one vote against if the 
proxy has been appointed by more than one member and the proxy has been instructed by one or more of the 
members to vote for the resolution and by one or more other member to vote against it. 
5. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its 
behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.

those shareholders registered in the Register of Members of the Company as at 6:00 p.m. on 19 May 2015 shall be 
entitled to attend or vote at the aforesaid Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered 
in their names at that time. Changes in the entries in the relevant register of Securities after 6:00 p.m. on 19 May 
2015 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 
9.  The existing and amended rules of the Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 2006 Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
will be available for inspection during normal business hours on Monday to Friday (excluding bank holidays) at

Notice of Meeting continued
Notes on special business
Resolution 7: Approval of the Advanced Medical Solutions 
Group plc 2006 Deferred Share Bonus Plan (the ‘Plan’)
The Company currently operates the Plan, which has both 
approved and unapproved parts. The approved part is an 
all-employee tax-advantaged share incentive plan and the 
unapproved part is an all-employee non-tax advantaged 
share ownership plan, both of which encourage employees 
to build a stake in the Company and create value for all 
shareholders.
It will not be possible to grant further awards under the 
Plan after 31 May 2016. Resolution 7 seeks shareholder 
approval, as an ordinary resolution, to extend the life of the 
Plan for a further ten years until 21 May 2025 to enable the 
Company to continue to operate the Plan.
Resolution 8: Authority to Allot Shares and other relevant 
securities
This resolution would give the Directors the authority to 
allot Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate nominal amount 
equal to £3,464,219 (representing 69,284,397 Ordinary 
Shares of 5p each). This amount represents approximately 
one-third of the issued Ordinary Share capital of the 
Company as at 31 March 2015, the latest practicable date 
prior to publication of this Notice.
The authority sought under this resolution will expire at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company 
held in 2016 or, if earlier, 15 months after the passing of the 
resolution.
While the Directors have no present intention of issuing 
any of the authorised but unissued share capital, it is 
considered prudent and appropriate to maintain the 
flexibility that this authority provides.
Resolution 9: Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights
Your Directors also require additional authority from 
shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares or 
sell treasury shares where they propose to do so for cash 
and otherwise than to existing shareholders in proportion 
to their existing holdings. Accordingly, Resolution 9 will be 
proposed as a special resolution to grant such authority. 
Apart from rights issues, open offers or any other pre-
emptive offer as mentioned the authority will be limited to 
the issue of shares and sales of treasury shares for cash up 
to an aggregate nominal value of £1,039,265 (being 10% of 
the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital at 31 March 
2015, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this 
Notice). This is in keeping with the extent for which such 
authority has been sought and given at each previous 
Annual General Meeting of the Company since 2006.
Allotments made under the authorisation in paragraph (a) 
of Resolution 9 would be limited to allotments by way of a 
rights issue only (subject to the right of the directors to 
impose necessary or appropriate limitations to deal with, 
for example, fractional entitlements and regulatory 
matters).
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2016 or, if 
earlier, 15 months after the passing of the resolution.
Resolution 10: Purchase by the Company of its own Shares
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the 
Company to purchase its own shares. Under Section 701 of 
the 2006 Act, the Directors of a company may make 
market purchases of that company’s shares if authorised to 
do so. Your Directors believe that granting such approval 
would be in the best interests of shareholders in allowing 
directors the flexibility to react promptly to circumstances 
requiring market purchases.
Accordingly, Resolution 10, which will be proposed as a 
special resolution, will give the Directors the authority to 
purchase issued shares of the Company under Section 701 
of the 2006 Act.
The authority contained in this resolution will be limited to 
an aggregate nominal value of £519,632 (representing 5% 
of the issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 
31 March 2015 the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of this Notice; representing 10,392,659 
Ordinary Shares of 5p each). The price which may be paid 
for those shares is also restricted as set out in the 
resolution.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company held in 2016 or, if earlier, 
15 months after the passing of the resolution.
The Board has no present intention of exercising this 
authority. However, this will be kept under review, and the 
Board will use this power only if and when, taking account 
of market conditions prevailing at the time, other 
investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and 
the overall financial position of the Group, they believe that 
the effect of such purchases will be in the best interests of 
shareholders generally and that they will result in an 
increase in earnings per share.
Shares purchased under this authority may be held as 
treasury shares. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting 
rights and no dividends will be paid on any such shares. 
Shares held in treasury in this way can be sold for cash or 
cancelled. This would allow the Company to manage its 
capital base more effectively and to increase its 
distributable reserves.
If and when the Board resolves to exercise its authority to 
make market purchases, it will at that time decide whether 
shares purchased are to be cancelled or held in treasury.
As at 31 March 2015, the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of this Notice, there were share options 
outstanding over ordinary shares, representing 31% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The Company 
has no warrants in issue in relation to its shares. If the 
buyback authority was to be exercised in full, these options 
would represent 3.1% of the Company’s ordinary issued 
share capital. Advisors

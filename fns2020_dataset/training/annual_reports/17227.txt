2008: 4.8p +21% In my first annual statement as Chairman, I am pleased that 
we are reporting another year of good progress for Morrisons.
These are challenging times for the UK economy, but whilst we
are not complacent, we are confident that Morrisons offer meets
and is in tune with the demands of our customers and the
economic background.
Results
Profit before tax was £655m compared with £612m last year. This included £2m of
property gains, compared with £32m last year. Underlying basic earnings per share
(EPS) increased by 16% to 16.7p, whilst statutory basic EPS decreased by 16% 
due to an abnormally low tax charge last year. The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 5.0p per share, to bring the total for the year to 5.8p – an increase of
21%. At this level, the dividend is covered 2.9 times, and we will continue our
progressive policy of increasing the dividend by underlying earnings and additionally
moving dividend cover towards the average for our sector, which is around 2.5 times,
by January 2010.
Cash generation was strong – with cash from operations of £964m, a year-on-year
increase of £208m, or 28%. The Group’s pace of investment picked up, with capital
expenditure in the year increasing to £678m following the opening of nine new
stores and the acquisition of the freehold of our new distribution centre at
Sittingbourne, in Kent. Additionally, we completed the planned second instalment
payment into our defined benefit pension schemes of £100m and bought back 58
million shares in the market for £146m, an average share price of 251p. Following
these investments, net debt increased from £543m to £642m. As previously
reported, new five year term debt facilities of £1.1bn were agreed in September
2007, and only £250m of this facility was drawn at the year end, leaving gearing 
at 14%.
Board changes
As previously announced, Roger Owen, the Group Property Director, retired at the
conclusion of the financial year after 34 years with the Group and 21 years’ service
on the Board. Roger played a major role in building the store estate which forms the
backbone of the business, and he goes with our thanks and best wishes for a long,
happy and well deserved retirement.
We are pleased to welcome Philip Cox to the Board as a Non-Executive Director, with
effect from 1 April 2009. Phil is Chief Executive of International Power plc, and a
previous CFO of Siebe plc. He will chair the Audit Committee after a suitable period
of induction, taking over from Paul Manduca who will continue in his role as Senior
Independent Director. The Board would like to record its thanks to Paul for his
assured steering of the Audit Committee over the past three and a half years.

Industry recognition
Morrisons success in the past year has been recognised with numerous industry
awards, including Retailer of the Year from Retail Week, the Grocer of the Year 
from The Grocer and Supermarket of the Year at the Retail Industry Awards. This 
is welcome recognition of the terrific efforts of all our 124,000 employees, and 
on behalf of the Board I want to express our thanks for their dedication, hard work 
and professionalism. I am pleased that our growth in the year will provide a profit 
share pool for them of £34m, a 13% increase on the previous year.
Charitable donations
Our colleagues across the business are always enthusiastic supporters of our
charitable activities. Our stores become involved in many initiatives in support of
their local communities, such as Remembrance Day collections, and national events
like Children in Need where we passed a cheque for £250,000 to the BBC again 
this year. Our own nominated charity of the year was Protecting Generations for
Generations, a partnership between Help the Aged and Childline, and we were
delighted to support them with funding of over £930,000 during the year.
Outlook
Your Board views both the short and the long term outlook for Morrisons positively.
The business is well on track to achieve its goal of being the food specialist for
everyone, and the Executive team continues to see opportunities to invest in the
business for further growth. We expect to open c.350,000 square feet of new retail
space in the coming year, on top of c.500,000 square feet that we have agreed to
acquire from the Co-operative Group, reflecting our confidence in the attractions 
of Morrisons core grocery business.
In the current economic environment we expect the competitive landscape to 
be extremely challenging. However, the Group’s balance sheet is strong, and our
financing arrangements are prudent. We will remain focused on delivering freshness
and value to our customers.

The Board has recommended a final
dividend of 5.0p per share, bringing
the total dividend for the year to 
5.8p per share. Our performance over the year confirms our broadening
customer appeal, successfully delivered in a wide range of 
stores from 11,000 to 40,000+ square feet. We have identified
significant potential to attract new customers and will focus 
on space growth in order to take us from a national to a
nationwide company.
Strategy update
Our three year strategy, as laid out in our 2007 Annual report, is to position the
business as the UK’s ‘food specialist for everyone’. This builds on our historic
strengths of value and fresh food quality, now applied to a national, bigger business
following the Safeway acquisition in 2004. As a food specialist, we are clearly
differentiated from our larger competitors, all of whom are seeking to expand their
non-food credentials. We also emphasise our deep understanding of food: through
being closer to source than other retailers, through our unique manufacturing and
packing facilities, through the amount of food preparation undertaken in our stores
and through the employment of more specialist butchers, fishmongers and bakers
than our competitors. We stress that our offer is for everyone, because our great
food is also always great value.
Our strategy builds on our strengths, and is in tune with our customers’ need for
excellent value and their increasing focus on the health, provenance, quality and
freshness of the food they buy. In order to deliver our strategy, we have previously
outlined the building blocks that need to be put in place, and our plans to do this 
by 2010. These include freshening up our stores and improving and developing the
infrastructure of the business in the key areas of manufacturing, distribution and
operating systems. The operating review of the year, set out on pages 6 to 8,
highlights our progress towards these goals.
Store estate development
From our position as the fourth largest grocery retailer in the UK, we see significant
opportunities to expand our store estate. As the food specialist for everyone, it is our
conviction that we offer a real difference in grocery retailing that is highly attractive
to a broad range of customers. However, there are many parts of the country where
we remain under-represented. We estimate there to be over eight million households
in the UK which are not located within a 15 minute drive of a current Morrisons
store. This represents a higher target customer base than any of our three larger
competitors. Our offer works well in a wide range of store sizes, from 11,000 to over
40,000 square feet, giving us flexibility in site selection. A key part of our strategy,
therefore, has been to grow the number of Morrisons stores, and in 2007 we
published a target of adding 1.0m square feet of new space by January 2010. Our
acquisition of Co-operative/Somerfield stores, completing in the coming year, will
see that target exceeded by 0.5m square feet, and we are confident that we will open
a further 0.5m square feet of retail space in the year to January 2011.
We believe that delivery of our strategy of expansion and further optimisation of the
operation of the business has resulted in strongly improved profit margins for our
shareholders, whilst also positioning the Group for long term growth.

Company 
financial statements Investor information Solid shareholder investment and returns
The Group is securely financed and has a strong balance sheet. We are confident 
that our planned investment requirements can be met from existing facilities. We
will continue to pursue a prudent approach to financial management which is based
on a number of principles:
• we wish to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet;
• operational control of our retail stores is fundamental to us;
• we are a prudent organisation and we structure our finances accordingly; and
• our defined benefit pension schemes’ assets and liabilities are effectively part 
of our balance sheet, and should be managed as such.
The Board concluded in March 2008 that surplus capital of £1bn should be returned
to shareholders during 2008 and 2009, with £500m of that to be delivered in the
first 12 months of the programme. Whilst £146m was returned in 2008 through
share buybacks, the Board also identified new investment opportunities for the
Group, over and above our original plans. These were the acquisition of stores 
from the Co-operative Group, the purchase of the freehold interest in our planned
distribution centre at Sittingbourne and the acquisition of the freehold interest 
of four existing stores which, combined, account for unplanned investments of
£460m. The Board believes these growth opportunities represent a more attractive
deployment of capital than the planned share buyback. The Board also believes that
further investment opportunities may arise in the medium term and has therefore
decided that the capital originally earmarked for share buybacks in the 2009/10
financial year should be retained within the business to give Morrisons maximum
financial flexibility.
We have targeted progressive dividend growth in 2008 and 2009, over and above
earnings growth, in order to bring dividend cover to a level in line with the average 
for our sector, which is around 2.5 times, by January 2010. Funding for this enhanced
return to shareholders will come from operating cash flow and committed facilities
available to the Group.
Operating review of the year
2008/09 was another good year for Morrisons – we made sure that we offered 
our customers great value every day, in a rapidly deteriorating economy, whilst 
still investing for the long term future of the business.
New retail space
We opened nine new stores in the year, at Giffnock, Gorleston, Whitefield,
Kidderminster, Granton, Northallerton, Blandford Forum, Clifton (Nottingham) and
Holyhead. Two of these (Giffnock and Kidderminster) were replacements of existing
stores and two (Blandford and Northallerton) were former Safeways, which had been
closed since the acquisition due to their small size. Our decision to reopen them
reflects our growing confidence in the operation of, and return from, smaller stores,
and we have been pleased with their performance. A further two of the stores
(Gorleston and Clifton) were previous Co-op/Somerfield stores that we acquired 
and converted to Morrisons. In both cases we saw very significant uplifts in sales
compared to those achieved under their former ownerships, and as a result we were
pleased, later in the year, to agree the acquisition of a further tranche of stores from
the Co-op/Somerfield that we will open in 2009/10.

retail space, growth of 2.7% on the start of the year.
Turnover growth
Turnover grew by £1.5bn to £14.5bn, a 12% increase. Part of this increase (c.3%)
was due to the very high prices of fuel seen in our forecourts business in the year
caused by a worldwide spike in oil prices, and this will unwind again in the coming
year as pump prices have come back down. We were pleased with our stores sales
growth, which was industry leading and broad based. Like-for-like sales, the measure
of growth in existing stores, increased by 7.9% with customer numbers up 4.2% 
and average basket spend up 3.6%.

Geographically, we grew in all regions, with the South particularly strong as the
Morrisons brand continued to become better known. Across our store estate, we
grew in all sizes of stores, with smaller stores below 25,000 square feet leading the
way. Our market research shows that we won customers from all major competitors
in the year. In-store, our Market Street ranges did well, responding to our strong
emphasis on fresh food preparation. Our own-label ranges all showed growth, albeit
the strong trends of the previous two years towards premium products slowed, with
Eat Smart up 13%, the Best up 5% and Organics up 10%. By contrast, the Value
range – relaunched in the year – saw 50% growth.
Industry leading offers
The growth of the Value range reflected the very difficult economic environment
experienced by consumers throughout the year. Commodity price inflation, which
began in 2007 but fed through strongly into products during 2008, meant that
customers were paying more for their weekly shopping basket for the first time in
some years. At the same time, disposable incomes were decreasing due to the
impact of high energy prices, reduced availability of mortgage credit, a rising tax
burden and increasing unemployment. We were quick to respond to the challenges
being faced by our customers. Whilst we maintained our focus on the quality,
healthiness and provenance of our food, we also delivered a year of innovative value
offers to our customers. We launched over 21,000 price cuts throughout the year,
and designed our promotions to help customers save money while eating well. Our
£4 meal deals proved very popular, and we switched more of our promotions into
‘half price’ rather than ‘buy one, get one free’ in response to customers’ need to
spend less each week. We helped customers to treat themselves too, with great
value deals such as 2 for 1 offers on party foods, the Mamma Mia DVD for £7 and 
a range of games for Nintendo Wii at £10. In the run-up to Christmas, we rewarded
our most loyal customers with a £20 shopping voucher through the Collector 
Card scheme.

Performance review Strategic review Governance
Group
financial statements
Company 
financial statements Investor information In addition to value messages, we continued to profile our unique food production
capabilities, in our factories and in Market Street, and our understanding of food
provenance. Our broad appeal and community involvement was well illustrated by
our new schools initiative, ‘Let’s Grow’, which is designed to help schools teach
children how to grow food. Over 18,000 schools registered for the scheme, well
beyond our expectations, and in February 2009 we began to dispatch free planting
and gardening equipment including over 30,000 tools, 29,000 pairs of gardening
gloves, 13,000 bags of compost and over 10,000 growing kits.
Operating results
Our forecourts business grew strongly in the year. As fuel prices moved above £1 per
litre, consumers became highly price conscious and shopped around for value. We
made sure that our pricing was always highly competitive, and indeed led the market
back down below the key £1 price point when oil prices again began to fall. Average
unleaded pump prices were 103.5p in the year, compared with 94.9p the previous
year. Litreage grew by 11%, in a declining market.

Gross profit grew in line with the level of turnover growth. The gross profit margin 
of 6.3% was level with the previous year, although lower than it would have been
due to the dilutive effect of high fuel sales, which have a very low margin. The impact
of this, we estimate, was a 20bps reduction in margin. Offsetting this was the release 
of a provision first taken in 2005/06 relating to the rationalisation of our distribution
infrastructure. The original provision was £75m, and after taking all final costs
associated with this restructuring we were left with a balance to release of £8m,
which is included in gross profit. The details of this can be found on page 71 of 
the accounts. Adjusting for these two effects, our gross profit increased by 0.1%
despite the headwind effect of high energy costs in our stores and supply chain. 
We successfully mitigated these costs through continued delivery of our
Optimisation Plan.
The Group’s two biggest costs, after cost of goods sold, are store wages and
distribution costs. After a number of years of strong improvement in store labour
productivity, the year under review saw us investing in customer service to support
our sales growth. Despite this, labour costs as a proportion of sales improved by
0.5%. The cost to deliver each case through our distribution network continued 
to fall, despite higher fuel costs, with a further reduction of 2.5% year-on-year. 
We gained good benefits from new systems that improved the efficiency of our
delivery schedules.
Our administrative expenses were up by 5%, below the rate of the turnover increase,
reflecting tight control of our overheads. Marketing costs, which account for over
one-third of administrative expenses, increased in line with turnover, as we continued
to seek, with success, to articulate the Morrisons story to a wider audience.

Key Performance Indicators
(pence) Optimisation Plan progress
Our aim is to become the ‘Food Specialist for Everyone’, and that means:
Our Optimisation Plan, originally communicated in 2007, set out a number of
programmes designed to deliver by our financial year ending January 2010, and 
we remain well on track. Key elements of the Plan included:
• refreshed and rebranded stores;
• range extension and product innovation;
• investment in further manufacturing capacity;
• an increase in distribution capacity in the South;
• in-store efficiency initiatives;
• replacement of our systems; and
• Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives.
Progress in each of these areas is outlined below.
Refreshed and rebranded stores
Customers visiting Morrisons today experience a modern and unique food specialist,
following the successful completion of the programme to freshen-up our stores and
brand. The programme covered the exterior and interior signage of the stores, our
Market Street counters, our trucks and our filling stations. All work was completed,
on time, at an average cost per store of £0.5m – a very cost effective new design
scheme when compared to similar programmes elsewhere. Alongside the physical
work, all staff were fitted with uniforms carrying the new brand and over 3,000 own-
brand Morrison products received new packaging. 
Range extension and product innovation
Our product ranges, too, have been extensively reinvigorated. Range development
has been particularly strong in ‘Value’ lines but value and freshness are not
incompatible, as seen in the launch of our innovative ‘Fresh Ideas’ ready-to-cook
fresh meals, which offer a great value alternative to dining out.
Our control of the fresh food supply chain, through our bakeries, fruit and vegetable
packing facilities, meat and cheese processing plant and abattoirs gives us great
flexibility to respond to changing customer needs and priorities. The value conscious
behaviour that came to the fore in 2008 provided us with the opportunity to use this
flexibility to great effect. We led the industry with great value deals on fresh foods,
such as our £4 family meal deals which comprised eight fresh food items for 50
pence each. Such deals, when advertised, create great demand, and it was only our
close control of the supply chain that allowed us to cope with the volumes generated

• we know where it comes from
• we pack it and make it in our factories
• we make it in our stores
• we employ craft skills in every store

butchery operations are designed to use the whole animal, with minimal food waste.
We have long sold lower priced cuts of meat such as brisket and neck fillet, which
make delicious meals at bargain prices. These cuts are once again popular, and
Morrisons is best placed to provide such variety and value. Equally, by being close to
the source of supply, by being in the livestock markets every day and by only offering
fresh fish on our counters, our fresh meat and fish quality cannot be matched even 
by much more expensive competitors.
Our advertising campaigns built on the previous year’s success, with a continuation
of the ‘Fresh Choice for You’ message placing emphasis on freshness, in-store
production, in-season food and our food provenance knowledge. We continued 
to use down-to-earth, approachable personalities including Helen Baxendale and
Richard Hammond – the campaign produced the highest consumer recall in 2008

.
Our research has confirmed that the campaign has significantly increased consumer
awareness of Morrisons and what we stand for. To balance the ‘Fresh’ message, we
launched a high impact ‘Price Crunch’ campaign in April, which ran through the rest
of the year and was used to highlight our great value offers and everyday prices. 
This too, struck a chord with our customers.
Distribution network investment
We continued to invest in our infrastructure as part of our Optimisation Plan. The
new distribution centre at Sittingbourne, in Kent, is well under way. It will manage
the growing volumes of our business in London and the South East and will open by
the end of 2009. We took the opportunity to acquire the freehold of the site during
the year, at a cost of £80m, in order to ensure maximum flexibility for the future. 
We were pleased to open our new abattoir at Spalding during the summer of 2008,
and it is already producing at high volumes and very good levels of efficiency. This
extra capacity has been key to ensuring that we can offer fresh pork, beef and lamb
that is all UK sourced and all processed by us – something unique in British
supermarket retailing.
In-store efficiency initiatives
We continue to invest in ways to improve customer service whilst also becoming
more efficient in our stores. Following a successful trial, self-scan checkouts are now
rolling-out to over half our stores. Queue management software, which predicts very
accurately the number of tills required to be open to serve the customers in store, 
is also at an advanced stage of roll-out.
Replacement of our systems
The Group’s major programme of systems renewal continued to make good progress
during the year, with detailed planning completed and Wipro, one of the world’s
premier computer services companies, selected as our implementation partner. 
As previously announced, the implementation programme began in late 2008 with
the pilot phase of our new human resources and payroll system, which will go fully
live during 2009. The coming year will see the implementation of financial systems,
depot systems and the start of the roll-out of the new point of sale systems into
stores. In 2010 we will begin to replace systems in our manufacturing facilities,
throughout the supply chain and the product masterfile.

We were proud to win all 
three major industry titles 
in the same year.
Retailer of the Y ear
2008 & 2009
Retail Week
We are the only retailer to have 
won this prestigious award for two
consecutive years, being commended
for the use of imaginative and
extensive marketing to highlight our
traditional strengths in fresh produce
and our competitive stance on price.
Supermarket 
of the Y ear 2008
Retail Industry Awards
The judges commented that we won
the award because we came back
stronger following a challenging
period; they also noted the efforts 
we had made in refreshing our 
product ranges. 
Grocer of the Y ear
2008
The Grocer Gold Awards
The Grocer judges praised Morrisons
for the success of its stores’ refresh
programme and our focus on the fresh
food offering of Market Street. Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives
Much of our investment, whilst improving the business, has also improved our
carbon emissions. In the past two years we have invested £66m in new, efficient
refrigeration capacity in our stores and £18m in new trucks and trailers. These
measures have improved our chill chain, and also significantly reduced our
emissions. A similar programme to replace all our petrol pumps with new, low
emission technology, is well advanced, with 220 out of 287 filling stations having
been re-pumped at the year end. As a result of these and other initiatives, our target
to reduce our carbon footprint by 36% from 2005 levels has been achieved one year
early. We are delighted to be the only grocery retailer to have been awarded the new
Carbon Trust Standard for carbon reduction.
Long term growth
The overall investment requirements for the Optimisation Plan, outlined last year,
are £450m over and above the normal run-rate of capital investment, and the
programme will run to January 2010. In 2008, £182m of this was invested, bringing
the cumulative total to £250m.
Alongside the Optimisation Plan, our new space programme laid out a target of
opening an additional 1.0m square feet of retail space in the three years to January
2010. We are well on course to achieve that through our normal pipeline of new
stores and store extensions, but over and above this target, the acquisition,
announced in November, of smaller Co-op and Somerfield stores, which will
complete in 2009, will add around a further 500,000 square feet to our estate 
to bring the total at 31 January 2010 to approximately 12m square feet.

Key Performance Indicators
Performance review Strategic review Governance
Group
financial statements
Company 
financial statements Investor information The Operating review of the year in the Chief Executive’s
review provides commentary on the performance of the Group
over the past year. The volatility in the financial markets
impacted the economy as a whole and we are pleased that our
results remained strong during this time. We have improved
operating cash flows during the year and continue to have 
a strong balance sheet supported by long term financing.
Underlying earnings
Underlying earnings is a measure we use to assess normal
underlying business performance and trends. The Group’s
earnings are adjusted to remove highly volatile or one-off
costs. A reconciliation of underlying earnings is provided 
in note 1 of the Group financial statements.
Underlying earnings before tax increased by £73m to £636m,
driven primarily by the strong like-for-like sales performance.
The Chief Executive’s review contains further information on
turnover, customer numbers and retail space. 
Savings from Phase 2 of the Optimisation Plan have helped 
to mitigate input price inflation pressures and energy 
cost increases. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying earnings per share is the EPS measure we use to
remove the potentially volatile impact of property gains and
net pension interest income and consequently underlying EPS
provides a better measure of the normal underlying business.
Basic underlying earnings per share increased from 14.38p 
to 16.67p. 
The share buyback contributed 0.14p (6%) to the increase 
(see below) but the primary reason was the year-on-year
underlying profit growth.

Cash generated from operations
Cash from operating activities increased by £208m (24%)
reflecting the strong profit generation of the Group from
increased turnover and good profit conversion, combined with
cost control throughout the business and improved working
capital management. 
Interest and tax
Interest received fell £21m from last year as the continuing 
fall in bank interest rates during the year adversely impacted
our interest receivable on cash on deposit. 
Interest paid remained at £70m for the year. The revolving
credit facility was utilised for the first time in October 2008,
resulting in a small increase in floating-rate bank interest
payable. Interest paid to bondholders is at fixed rates, and 
this cost reduced by £8m this year following the maturity 
of a £250m bond in August 2007. 
Corporation tax payable in the year was £104m. This 
cash outflow represented 50% of the tax bill for the year 
to 3 February 2008, and 50% of the tax for the year to 
1 February 2009, as well as repayments received for 
prior years.
12 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009
Financial review
The Group’s results for 2008/09 have been strong once again, building on long term growth and
strong cash flow generation.
Cash generated by our operations continue to fund capital expenditure, reduce the pension deficit
and reward our shareholders by surplus capital returns and dividends. The effective rate of tax for the year was 30% which is 2%
above the prevailing corporate tax rate of 28%. The higher rate
is mainly a result of non-qualifying depreciation and expenses
where the Group is unable to obtain tax deductions. 
The principal objective of the in-house tax department
continues to be to pay the appropriate level of tax at the right
time. We actively engage with the UK tax authorities and aim
to be transparent in all of our activities. The Group is
predominantly UK-based, operates a simple business model,
and does not engage in sophisticated tax planning structures. 
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure cash outflow was £678m, an increase from
£402m last year, reflecting additional focus on growing the
estate and supporting the Optimisation Plan as well as taking
advantage of opportunities arising from the weakening of the
commercial property market.
Normal planned capital expenditure 
We opened nine new stores and extended a further 18 stores,
as well as a number of projects strengthening the retail estate
and the supply chain.
Optimisation Plan investment 
The rebranding programme was completed throughout the
estate, at an average cost per store of £0.5m. A new abattoir
was developed and opened in the year, and a vegetable
packhouse extended in order to increase capacity. A Group-
wide programme to replace our IT systems entered the design
phase and we began work on our new distribution centre in the
South East of England. Total Optimisation Plan investment in
the year was £182m.
Unplanned investments
During the year, we took advantage of the weakness of the
commercial property market by acquiring the freehold of four
stores that were previously leaseholds, as well as the freehold
of our planned new distribution centre at Sittingbourne in
Kent. The total cost of these investments in the year was
£120m. As a result, the proportion of freehold to leasehold
properties in the estate grew to 95%, and we regard this as 
a key strength of the Group’s balance sheet.

Net pension deficit at 1 February 2009 (49)
The continuing volatility in the financial markets does not
change our view that, on completion of the actions arising
from the Pension Review announced last year, these schemes
are adequately funded for the long term. The markets will have
to be continually monitored for emerging trends to ensure this
continues to be the case. The move from a final salary basis to
one of Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) is the final
action planned from the review, and is intended to make the
schemes affordable for the future. If, following the consultation,
the proposals are adopted, then it is anticipated that the
valuation of the liability will decrease by c.£90m.
Scheme valuations for accounts purposes were inevitably
impacted by the turmoil in the financial markets, which had 
an effect on both the asset values and the liabilities of the
schemes. The return on scheme assets was £425m worse 
than actuarially expected, due mainly to falls in the equity
markets. This was offset by the reduced long term value of
scheme liabilities resulting from a rise in the long term real
discount rate. 
The injection, as planned, of £100m of additional funding in
the year combined with the move to CARE for future benefit
accrual will leave the schemes well funded for the long term
and in a small surplus position on current actuarial
assumptions. 
Financing
The Group has a £1.1bn revolving credit facility which is not
due to mature until September 2012. At the year end £250m
had recently been drawn, allowing significant headroom for 
the Group’s activities and investments. 
The Group’s bonds, originally issued by Safeway plc, were
retained in the acquisition of the Safeway Group in 2004. The
next bond repayment is due April 2010 for €250m. Moody’s
rating of these bonds was upgraded to Baa1 in March 2008.

Performance review Strategic review Governance
Group
financial statements
Company 
financial statements Investor information Net debt
Net debt at the year end increased slightly from £543m to
£642m. Increases in capital expenditure, additional pension
funding, and the share buyback have required significant 
cash funds. Much of this was funded by cash generated from
operations, demonstrating our solid underlying cash flow.
Despite this high level of investment, we were pleased to 
have utilised only £250m of the revolving credit facilities 
at the year end.
Returns to shareholders
Returning surplus capital to our shareholders
In March 2008, we announced a two year share buyback
programme to return £1bn of surplus capital to shareholders
with a target of £500m in the first year. By the end of 2008, 
we had repurchased and cancelled 57.8 million shares costing
£146m. In view of the acquisition of the Co-op stores, the
purchase of a number of freeholds and the possibility that
further attractive investment opportunities may arise in the
medium term, the Board has decided that the capital originally
earmarked for share buybacks in the 2009/10 financial year
should be retained within the business to give Morrisons
maximum financial flexibility.
Progressive dividend growth
The final dividend is proposed at 5.0 pence per share, making
the total dividend for the year 5.8 pence per share, an increase
of 21% on last year. 
We have targeted progressive dividend growth in 2008 and
2009, over and above earnings growth, in order to bring
dividend cover to a level in line with the average for our sector,
which is around 2.5 times. Funding for this enhanced return 
to shareholders will come from operating cash flow and
committed facilities available to the Group.
14 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009
The Optimisation Plan was announced in March 2006 as a
medium term plan to bring profitability back in line with sector
standards after the integration of Safeway. The objectives were
simple – to apply the Morrisons philosophy to the new bigger
business while adapting it where necessary. The plan identified
areas where savings could be made, or margins improved, 
as well as areas where investments were necessary to shape 
the business for growth. 
Savings from Phase 1 were achieved in the prior year.
Optimisation Plan 
Our Optimisation Plan is to strongly improve operating margins, whilst shaping for growth.

sector over the same period.

Key judgements and assumptions
Judgements and assumptions made in the financial statements
are continually reviewed. Whilst some outcomes have been
affected by the volatility in the financial markets, all
judgements and assumptions in the accounting policies remain
consistent with previous years. Consideration of impairment to
the carrying values of assets has been made and we concluded
that the individual carrying values of stores and other
operating assets are supportable either by value in use or
market values. The impact of the current economic conditions
on the assessment of going concern has been considered in 
the general information section of the Directors’ report and
business review.
Provisions
The property provision of £112m (note 21) includes £75m 
for onerous leases relating to sublet properties to cover the
shortfall between expected rent received and the rent payable,
taking into account the vacant tenancy periods during the
terms of the lease. The provision assumptions were reviewed
in the last quarter in the light of worsening market conditions.
This resulted in a charge of £5m to cover the additional
anticipated risk over the life of the leases. 
Store acquisitions
In December 2008, we agreed to purchase a number of stores
from the Co-operative Group, subject to Office of Fair Trading
(OFT) approval. The stores have an average retail square foot
size of c.14,000 and will fit very well within our existing
portfolio of around 150 smaller stores.
The acquisition was agreed at a price of £223m, of which a
refundable deposit of £22m had been paid by the year end.
Should the purchase obtain full OFT approval, the remaining
£201m will be paid by instalments during 2009, and a store
refurbishment programme costing a further £98m will
commence in spring 2009.

Commodity prices
Although commodity prices
were easing off at the start 
of 2009, during the year 
prices increased significantly
for a number of basic
commodities.
Commodity price increases
caused food price inflation
across all food groups.
Consumer confidence
UK consumer confidence is at the lowest ever recorded. It is four points
lower now than in March 1990, which was just ahead of the last recession
and at an historic low.
Consumers are switching retailers in search of cheaper prices and value,
and switching brands from premium and organic to standard and value
ranges. The combination of lower consumer confidence, rising food and
fuel prices and the deterioration of the economy had the result that, by
May 2008, there was real evidence of a change in consumer behaviour.
Consumers are eating out less and are generally looking for cheaper forms
of entertainment, to a large extent based in the home. Cook at home
ranges have seen strong sales growth as customers are dining out at home.

Consumer trends 
Despite the current economic
environment, consumers are
still interested in where their
food comes from. Health,
quality and provenance 
remain important factors 
in food choice.
Regulatory change
The government reduced the
rate of Value Added Tax to 15%
with effect from 1 December
2008 in order to help boost
retail sales during the current
economic downturn. It is due
to increase to the previous rate
of 17.5% on 1 January 2010.
This rate change has a relatively
small impact as a large
proportion of food sales 
are zero rated.
Our market position
Although the market environment remains difficult for the
consumer, we continue to provide value and a unique fresh offer 
with great service. The success of our strategy shows we have the
capability to manage the business during this difficult time, as
reflected in our increase in market share year-on-year. The purchase
of a number of Co-op stores, 22 of which are in the South, will
further increase our market share in our three southern regions.

Our vision is to be the ‘Food Specialist for Everyone’.
Fresh

Fresh in-store preparation.
We aim to offer more freshly
prepared food than any other

more staff preparing food than 
any other supermarket. We are

and distribution network. With 
these facilities we can get food 
to our stores faster so that it’s
always fresher.
Value

our prices are competitive.
Great value across our ranges.
Value is key to our vision and is
especially important in the current

We don’t just offer value on a few
items – our prices are great value

By having our own distribution

by helpful, friendly, well-trained
people. With our commitment to
great selling and service we aim 
to get it right for our customers
every time.
Success at Morrisons relies on our 124,000 people delivering great 
service to our customers each and every day by living our values.
We measure customer perceptions against the other top four grocery retailers based on exit interviews 
and on-line surveys, the latest of which was taken in January 2009. This survey indicated that our

From

delivered 
to...
all our 
stores.
Being closer to source means we can better control 
the provenance and quality of our food. Ethical and
sustainable sourcing is important to us and we work
with the producers to develop a relationship that is
reasonable and fair to all parties.
We own all our manufacturing facilities, which means
we reduce our supply chain lead times allowing us to
maximise the freshness in-store and reduce waste and
costs. Many of these facilities are situated close to our
distribution centres, enabling us to also reduce our
food miles. The vast majority of our fresh food is
prepared by our production plants providing us with
security of supply. 
We own and operate a very modern transport fleet,
ensuring freshness and cost control. We believe we
have the quickest turnaround time between order 
and delivery compared to any other supermarket. 
Because we prepare food in-store, we can react to
customer trends throughout the day, only producing
what the customer wants. This reduces waste, makes
us cost efficient and keeps our prices low to the
customer, as well as ensuring our products are always
freshly made.
What makes Morrisons different from other supermarkets is that we control our supply chain – 
we are closer to source by ‘cutting out the middleman’. The advantages of this business model are:
• our customers get great value for money and fresh food at great prices; and
• we can react earlier to consumer trends and bring seasonal food in-store quicker than 
other supermarkets. www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreport09

Performance review Strategic review Governance
Group
financial statements
Company 
financial statements Investor information Like all businesses, our business faces risks and uncertainties
that could impact on the Group’s achievement of its
objectives. Risk is accepted as being a part of doing business
and within the Group, responsibility for risk management and
internal control lies with the Board. Through the application 
of reasoned judgement and consideration of the likelihood and
consequence of events, the Board believes a successful risk
management framework balances risk and reward.
The list below sets out the most significant risks to the
achievement of the Group’s business goals. The list does not
include all risks that the Group faces and it does not list the
risks in any order of priority.
Business strategy
In the long term, effectively managing the strategic risks that
the Group faces will deliver benefits to all our stakeholders.
The Board understands that if the strategy and vision are not
properly formulated or communicated then the business may
suffer. The strategy is developed by the Chief Executive and
senior executives and is considered and approved by the Board,
which takes time each year to review and monitor its delivery.
To ensure that our strategy is communicated and understood,
the Group engages with a wide range of stakeholders including
shareholders, employees, suppliers and other groups. This
continual process helps to ensure that the strategy remains
relevant and improves the likelihood of success. 
The Board is conscious of the difficult economic environment
in which it operates, with rising unemployment, reduced
spending power and high levels of anxiety amongst customers.
The Group’s operating plans have been developed with this
backdrop in mind, ensuring that there is a strong emphasis on
value in our product offering and a focus on cost control 
in the business.
Financial and treasury
The Group’s financial results may be subject to volatility arising
from movements in commodity prices, foreign currencies,
interest rates and the availability of sources of funding. 
See note 18 on page 64.
Product quality and safety
We recognise that the quality and safety of our products is 
of critical importance to us and that any failure in this regard
would affect the confidence of our customers in us. We work
with our suppliers to ensure the integrity of the products
supplied. Also, as a manufacturer of food products, we
maintain strict standards and monitoring processes to manage
the risks associated with food safety throughout our Group
and its supply chain. Food hygiene practices are taken very
seriously throughout our Group, and are monitored both
through internal audit procedures and external bodies such 
as environmental health departments. We have well prepared
procedures for crisis management in order to act quickly 
when required. 
We are aware that if we fail or are perceived to have failed to
deliver, to our customers’ satisfaction, the expected standards
of quality and safety in our products this has the potential 
to impact on their loyalty to us. This in turn could adversely
impact on our market share and our financial results.
Regulation
The Group operates in an environment governed by strict
regulations to ensure the safety and protection of customers,
shareholders, staff and other stakeholders and the operation 
of an open and competitive market. These regulations include
food hygiene, health and safety, the handling of hazardous
materials, data protection, the rules of the stock exchange and
competition law. In all cases, the Board takes its responsibilities
very seriously, and recognises that any breach of regulation
could cause reputational and financial damage to the Group.
There is clear, ultimate accountability with Directors for
compliance with all areas of regulation.
The grocery sector continues to be under close focus from 
the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) despite the Competition
Commission’s findings that the sector is highly competitive.
The OFT has issued ‘Statements of Objection’ in relation 
to conduct in the milk and tobacco categories in the early 
part of the millennium. We always fully co-operate with 
such enquiries. In the case of milk, we believe strongly 
that Morrisons has no case to answer and have made
representations in detail to this effect. In the case of 
tobacco, there is a complex legal question as to whether 
well established industry practices represented a breach 
of competition law. It is likely that this can only be settled
through a formal judicial process.
Corporate Social Responsibility
In line with our commercial objectives we have identified three
areas, Environment, Society and Business where by ‘doing the
right thing’, we protect valuable resources, meet demand for
sustainable products and make our business more efficient.
Morrisons is committed to taking good care of our environment
and if we fail to meet our commitments this could damage our
reputation and possibly lose the trust of our stakeholders.
22 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009
Risks and uncertainties Therefore, reporting to the Board is a cross functional steering
group of senior executives that ensures that the appropriate
management, evaluation and verification systems are
integrated into operational management activities. Delivery
against targets and key performance indicators is regularly
monitored and reported. Further information is available in 
our Corporate Social Responsibility summary on page 24.
Business interruption
Our distribution and systems infrastructures are fundamental
to ensuring the normal continuity of trading in our stores. If a
major incident occurred to this infrastructure or another key
facility this would have a detrimental impact on the business’
ability to operate effectively. To reduce the chances of this
happening and also to reduce the impact of such an event 
if it were to happen, we have developed recovery plans and
invested in the creation of a remote IT disaster recovery site. 
The current challenging economic environment increases the
risk that one of our key suppliers is adversely impacted by the
recession and is unable to supply our stores. We mitigate the
potential impact of this on our business by seeking several
sources of supply for products wherever possible.
Property
The business is growing the size of its retail space through
acquisition and by modernising and extending existing stores
and facilities. In this context there is a possibility that the
business fails to deliver an acceptable return on this investment
or that there is damage to the business’ reputation if this is not
done in a safe and timely manner. The business mitigates
against these risks through: 
• a property strategy that develops stores to a well 
proven format;
• the application of a formal capital approval process; and
• long-standing relationships and agreements with contractors
with a track record of achieving the required quality, safety
and cost standards.
Systems and infrastructure
The Board has identified that many of the Group’s existing
systems are approaching the end of their useful lives and that 
a comprehensive programme of replacement is required. The
Board is aware of the risks faced by any organisation seeking 
to successfully implement new systems, and has established 
a programme and assurance structure to manage these. 
Our business, like other similar businesses, has a capacity 
to absorb a level of change without this having a detrimental
impact on continuing business operations. The change
programmes within the Group have been designed with this
capacity in mind, and are structured and governed in a manner
that allows the Board to monitor their impact. Most of the
Group’s systems projects are in the design and development
phases, with implementation activities starting more
significantly in 2010.
Employee engagement and retention
The continued success of the Group relies heavily on the
investment in the training and development of our 124,000
employees. The Group’s employment policies, remuneration
and benefits packages are designed to be competitive, as well
as providing colleagues with fulfilling career opportunities. The
Group continually engages with colleagues across the business
to ensure that we keep strengthening our team at every level.

Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme is aligned
with our vision to be the food specialist for everyone. We are
committed to acting sustainably, protecting and nurturing the
valuable resources on which we all depend. We believe that by
taking good care of what we do today, we can make a real
difference for tomorrow.
Go to www.morrisons.co.uk/today to view our full 2008/09 CSR report.
Managing CSR
Championed by our Chief Executive, Marc Bolland, the CSR programme is governed
by a Project Team of senior Directors reporting into the Board. It is structured
around three principal areas:
Environment
Taking good care of our planet. Carbon, waste and sustainability.
Society
Taking good care of our shoppers, our colleagues and their communities. 
Work, communities and healthy, balanced lifestyles.
Business
Taking good care as we go about our business. Sourcing, supply and engagement 
with stakeholders.
Each area has a cross functional Steering Group, chaired by a member of the 
CSR Project Team, which is supported by a number of working groups.
Identifying issues and managing CSR risks
Processes are in place to capture and address issues important to our key
stakeholders. Each issue is considered for material risk or opportunity to our
business, and how best to meet our responsibilities. The key issues for our business
have been rated in terms of strategic and business impact. The issues with the
highest impact rating are therefore most important to our business and are the
prime focus of our programme.
Policies
We have a range of policies, available to all stakeholders, relating to aspects 
of responsible business practice. They are regularly reviewed through our CSR
governance structure to ensure they remain accurate, relevant and up to date. 
Our CSR policies are available on our website at www.morrisons.co.uk/today
Stakeholder satisfaction
Stakeholder engagement is vital in ensuring our CSR programme remains relevant
and effective. It enables us to identify issues and be responsive to changing needs 
by incorporating views and feedback into the development of our programme.
Let’s Grow
In September 2008, we launched our ‘Let’s Grow’ campaign. Aiming to help
schoolchildren learn more about fresh produce, the scheme ties into the national
curriculum and supports the government’s ‘Growing Schools’ initiative. Let’s Grow
inspires children to follow a healthier lifestyle through learning about growing fresh
fruit and vegetables at their own school. Vouchers were given to shoppers for every
£10 they spent with us, which could then be redeemed by schools for new gardening
equipment. The campaign was an outstanding success with over 18,000 schools
enrolling nationwide.

Local and seasonal sourcing 
We are dedicated to providing the very best fresh produce, at great value. Following
research indicating that 74% of our customers wanted opportunities to buy more
regional produce in store, in 2008 we introduced the new ‘From My Farm’ range.
The products available change with the seasons. All produce is grown and packed
within the East of England and the range is labelled with the name and location 
of every grower. Packaging is minimised, by using small tags, or is recyclable 
and compostable. A penny from each pack purchased is donated to the Growing
Trust, with the money raised going towards selected good causes within the East 
of England.
100% British
In 2007, we were the first of the top four supermarket chains to commit to selling
100% British fresh meat throughout the year. In 2008, we extended our commitment
to British farmers by ensuring all our own-brand fresh milk is sourced regionally. 
We already sell Scottish and Welsh own-label standard fresh milk. We also began to
establish producer groups for dairy, beef and poultry farmers, to develop closer links
with those farmers. Through the producer groups, we aim to share and increase
knowledge and understanding across our supply chain, driving quality and efficiency,
and helping secure the long term viability of British farming.
Reducing waste
We work hard to prevent waste. This year, we have reduced the volume of our waste
to landfill by a further 2,886 tonnes, achieving a cumulative reduction of 17% since
2006. In 2008, we trialled a new waste segregation project at two stores, which, if
successfully rolled out to all stores, could result in further significant reductions in
waste sent to landfill. We are also investigating the best means of generating
renewable energy from our waste.
Carrier bags
In May 2008, and again in December, we urged our customers to help reduce carrier
bag use by giving a free reusable carrier bag to every shopper. On each occasion we
gave away 10 million reusable bags (one for each of our customers), made from
100% recycled material and larger than standard bags. We encouraged our
customers to use the reusable bags on every shop. We have achieved a 32%
reduction since 2006 (4,502 tonnes), the equivalent of 505 million bag units.

Company 
financial statements Investor information Our people are our most valuable asset and our success relies 
on our people delivering great service to our customers each 
and every day. 
Our aim is to attract, motivate and develop skilled people to
ensure that Morrisons becomes the food specialist for everyone. 
At the end of 2006, Morrisons conducted its first colleague attitude survey (Climate
Survey) which showed that whilst we had strengths in a number of areas, we could still
improve. In 2007, we set out a programme of activity designed to support the business
optimisation and growth agenda, focused on four areas: Values, Leadership, Talent and
Performance. We have implemented a structured set of policies in each area.
Values
Our values define what we expect of our employees and what our customers can
expect from us. This year has seen a large scale education programme to fully
integrate these values into every day behaviours at Morrisons. In total, over 120,000
employees have taken part in the interactive Vision and Values workshops.
Additionally, every new employee experiences our Vision and Values programme as
part of their induction. Focusing forward, we want to ensure that our values sit at the
heart of everything we do by integrating them into our recognition programmes and
education frameworks.
Leadership
Great leadership is critical to us ‘bringing the best out of our people’. We involved a
cross section of senior managers in a number of steering groups, who helped shape
how our values could be mapped onto our leadership agenda. A set of leadership
profiles, outlining leadership styles and what leadership actually looks like in action,
was one of the primary outputs of this exercise.
Our leadership development initiatives, such as the ‘Leading the Morrisons Way’
programme, aim to further develop and enhance the future of our business and
senior leadership careers. 
Talent
We strongly believe that everyone has talent and we actively look to develop people
from within to meet the growing demands of the business. 
The Fresh Food Academy, launched in 2009, will strengthen Morrisons position as 
the UK’s leading proponent of retail craft food skills; skills which help people build a
career, and help Morrisons further increase the quality, value and service we provide
to our customers. Over the coming year, as part of its store expansion, Morrisons will
create 5,000 new jobs. The jobs will be created across the business in a variety of
positions including butchery, fishmonger and bakery. The Academy will play a key
role in developing people in these roles. 
The Fresh is Best programme focuses on engaging and training managers around
consistently delivering market leading availability, product presentation and quality,
preparing the freshest product, maintaining standards, reducing wastage and giving
great selling and service. By demonstrating what ‘good and fresh’ is we are helping
managers to maintain and improve standards. 
The ‘I Want a Fresh Start’ campaign, launched in 2008, completely redefined our
approach to attracting and recruiting fresh talent into the business. Our new dedicated
recruitment website, www.iwantafreshstart.com, allows candidates to apply online for
careers at Morrisons. National advertising has raised the profile of Morrisons as an

employer, evidenced by the high interest and number of applications for our
management positions. Our revised attraction strategy has, so far, resulted in over
4,500 applications and the appointment of 50 key retail managers.
Performance
Setting clear expectations sets the benchmark for a high performing culture. In this
respect we have started a general role evaluation programme across the business to
enhance career advancement. The output of workshops held across all sectors of the
business is being used to create ‘live documents’ that give greater clarity around role
requirements, and how we expect people to focus not only on what they deliver but
also on how they deliver it. 
Communication is also playing a key role in the delivery of our high performance
culture. In November 2008, we launched Gimme 5 briefings to strengthen our
communication across the business and create a more committed and productive
workplace. These are five minute, face-to-face monthly departmental briefings and
are based on messages cascaded down through the business, starting with Marc
Bolland. Colleagues are encouraged to ask questions and provide feedback on the
topics covered. 
Employee relations
Morrisons is an equal opportunities employer. Equal opportunities are offered to all,
regardless of race, colour, nationality, religion, sex, marital status, disability or age. 
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment made 
by people with disabilities. The policy is to offer equal opportunity to all disabled
candidates and employees who have a disability, or who become disabled during 
the course of their employment. A full assessment of the individual’s needs is
undertaken and, where practical, modifications are made to the work environment 
or business practices in order to assist those with disabilities.
All candidates and employees are treated equally in respect of recruitment,
promotion, training, pay and other employment policies and practices. All decisions
are based on merit. 
Employee engagement
Engaged and involved employees are important to the success of our business 
and values. Employees are encouraged to give their opinions through the Climate
Surveys. The Climate Survey conducted at the end of 2008 covered all colleagues
across all areas of the business, seeking opinion on a range of areas such as job
satisfaction, team environment and management. From the survey we have
identified four key indicators of engagement centring on employee pride, loyalty,
satisfaction and commitment. These key indicators have provided us with a summary
of the progress and shows a net improvement of 12% from our last survey. We will
continue to track these four areas in our next Climate Survey. 
Other ways in which we involve our employees are through the development and
communication of the Values principles, and through the Gimme 5 briefings where
employees are encouraged to give feedback. All employees participate in either the
Profit Share Scheme or Management Bonus Plan, ensuring that everyone feels a part
of the challenges and successes of the organisation.
Our employee turnover rate has improved and our employee stability has risen 2% 
to 78%. Moreover, some 33% of our employees have been with us for at least five
years, with 164 celebrating 25 years service in 2009. This is a clear sign that we
create an environment where colleagues feel proud to work for us.

Combined Code
The Board has prepared this report with reference to the UK Combined Code of Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting
Council as revised in June 2006.
The Board
a) Membership
On 1 February 2009, the Board comprised of a Non-Executive
Chairman, four Executive Directors and four Non-Executive
Directors. On 13 March 2008, Sir Ken Morrison retired as Chairman
and Director of the Company. Sir Ian Gibson, previously Deputy
Chairman was appointed Non-Executive Chairman on this date. 
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Non-
Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive (CEO), which has been
set out in writing and agreed by the Board.
On 1 February 2009, Roger Owen retired as a Director and on 
1 April 2009, Philip Cox will join the Group as a Non-Executive
Director. With these changes, the majority of the Board will consist
of Non-Executive independent Directors. Details of appointments,
roles and backgrounds of the Directors are set out on page 28.
b) Performance evaluation
The performance of the Board, its committees and its Directors 
is assessed and appraised throughout the year. The Chairman is
responsible for the monitoring of the performance of the Executive
Directors. In January 2009, the Chairman conducted an evaluation,
without external assistance, of the performance of the Board and
the results were shared with the other Directors. The Board was
satisfied with its performance and it agreed to act on those areas 
for which it believed improved processes could be implemented.
c) Senior Independent Director
Paul Manduca, the Senior Independent Director (SID) is available 
to shareholders as an alternative to the Chairman, CEO and the
Group Finance Director. The SID ensures that he is available to meet
shareholders during the year and reports any relevant findings to
the Board or Chairman.
d) Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors provide a varied range of skills and
experience to the Group. The Board is satisfied that all Non-
Executive Directors, including the Non-Executive Chairman remain
independent according to the definition contained in the Combined
Code. No Non-Executive Director:
• has previously been employed by the Group within the last 
five years;
• has had a material business relationship with the Group within 
the last three years;
• receives remuneration other than Director’s fees;
• has close family ties with any of the Group’s advisors, Directors 
or senior employees;
• holds cross-directorships or has significant links with other
Directors through involvement in other companies or bodies;
• represents a significant shareholder; or
• has served on the Board for more than nine years.
All Non-Executive Directors are provided with a comprehensive,
formal and tailored induction to the business. The minimum time
commitment expected of the Non-Executive Directors is one day 
per month attendance at meetings, together with attendance at 
the Annual General Meeting, Board away days and site visits, plus
adequate preparation time. The Board is satisfied that each of the
Non-Executive Directors commits sufficient time to the business 
of the Group and contributes to the governance and operations 
of the Group.

Full terms of reference of the Committees are available on request
and on the Group’s website www.morrisons.co.uk
a) Nomination Committee
During the year, the activities of the Committee were focused on
recruiting a Non-Executive Director with recent and relevant
financial experience. 
The project culminated in the appointment of Philip Cox, who will
take up his position as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 
1 April 2009.
The Committee employed executive search agency, MWM
Consulting to identify candidates who were then interviewed by
members of the Committee. Meetings also took place with other
Executive Directors as appropriate. Following this process, the
Nomination Committee recommended the appointment of Philip
Cox to the Board on 19 February 2009.
b) Remuneration Committee
The objective of the Group’s remuneration policy is to encourage a
strong performance culture and emphasise long term shareholder
value creation. The intention is to position remuneration
arrangements competitively against the market, with a clear reward
structure to enable the Group to attract, retain and motivate the
best talent, who are key to the Group’s recent and future success. 
The Human Resources Director has advised the Group on all
remuneration related matters, including pensions and Executive
Directors’ contracts. Where necessary, this advice was
supplemented by external advisors.
The Committee also receives advice from its appointed advisors
Hewitt New Bridge Street on remuneration matters, Jardine Lloyd
Thompson in respect of pensions, and Ashursts in respect of
Executive Directors’ contracts.

c) Audit Committee
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the responsibility
for reviewing on its behalf:
• the integrity of financial reports;
• the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk
management system; and
• the independence of the external auditors.
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities have not changed during 
the year. 
The Audit Committee regularly considers the professional
development needs of its members, and whether adequate technical
information is being provided. Where necessary, it will seek
independent external advice at the Group’s expense, with such
arrangements made through the Company Secretary. Whilst the
Audit Committee was short of a member with recent and relevant
financial experience, the Company Secretary had retained, at 
the request of the Audit Committee Chairman, the services of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to advise the Audit Committee 
at relevant times during the year.
There has been no change in the composition of the Audit
Committee during the year and the roles of the members also
remained unchanged. It is intended that Philip Cox will chair the
Audit Committee after an appropriate period of induction. The
Chairman, the CEO, the Group Finance Director, the Head of Risk
and Internal Audit and other finance department representatives
have attended meetings by invitation.
i) Overview of actions taken by the Audit Committee in
discharging its duties
The Committee has received and reviewed reports and
presentations from senior management to fulfil its terms 
of reference. To meet its responsibilities in this respect, the
Committee considered:
• interim and preliminary announcements, together with any other
formal announcements relating to financial performance;
• the accounting principles, policies and procedures adopted in 
the Group’s financial statements including, where necessary,
challenging the judgements made; and
• the potential effects of tax and pensions accounting and other
significant judgemental and complex accounting issues dealt
within the financial statements.
The Audit Committee oversees the Group’s relationship with the
external auditors. Private meetings are held with the external
auditors, without management present. The purpose of these
meetings is to understand their views on the control and governance
environment and management’s effectiveness within it. To fulfil its
responsibilities in respect of the independence and effectiveness of
the external auditors, the Committee reviewed:
• the terms, areas of responsibility, duties and scope of the external
auditors as set out in the engagement letter;
• the external auditors work plan for the Group and its subsidiaries;
• the detailed findings of the audit, including a discussion of any
major issues that arose during the audit;
• the letter from KPMG Audit Plc confirming its independence and
objectivity; and
• the audit fee and the extent of non-audit services provided by the
external auditors. 
In this period the external auditors have provided a significant level
of non-audit work, primarily to provide the Board with independent
assurance in respect of the IT systems replacement. The Board
believes that this activity is a reasonable extension of their statutory
audit work and that there are safeguards in place to avoid a threat 
to their independence or objectivity. The Board has a policy on the
engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services
and the Committee has reviewed the scope of non-audit services
provided by the external auditors to ensure that there was no
impairment of objectivity. 
ii) Internal control
The Board is responsible for setting a system of internal controls 
for the Group and reviewing its effectiveness. The control system 
is intended to manage rather than eliminate the risk of not meeting
the Group’s strategic objectives, whilst recognising that certain
inherent risks may be outside the Group’s control. Any system of
internal control can only seek to provide reasonable, not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board delegates to the Audit Committee the review of the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and risk management
systems. During the year, the Committee discharged this
responsibility by:
• receiving and considering regular reports from the internal audit
function on the status of internal control and risk management
systems across the Group. The Committee also reviewed the
department’s findings, annual plan and the resources available 
to it to perform its work;
• reviewing the external auditor’s management letters on internal
financial control;
• seeking reports from senior management on the effectiveness 
of the management of key risk areas; and
• monitoring the adequacy and timeliness of management’s
response to identified audit issues.
During the year, a Group-wide process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks faced by the business was
initiated. This process consisted of various workshops, facilitated by
the Head of Risk and Internal Audit, designed to identify formally
and document the key risks faced by various business operations in
achieving their business objectives. Risks identified as part of this
process are evaluated based on the likelihood and potential impact
of each risk and where necessary, actions to mitigate the risks were
also identified. www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreport09
33
In order to further strengthen the internal control environment, 
the Group introduced whistle-blowing procedures in February 2008
in order to enable colleagues to raise concerns about possible
malpractice or wrongdoing. The Audit Committee receives regular
reports from the Head of Risk and Internal Audit on any whistle-
blowing activity. Whilst there were no significant concerns raised 
by colleagues, all actions required were discussed and agreed with
the Committee.
The Board is satisfied that a continual process for identifying,
evaluating and managing significant risks has been in place for the
financial year and up to the date of this Annual report. To date, no
material financial problems have been identified that would affect
the results reported in these financial statements. The Board
confirms that if significant weaknesses had been identified during
this review the Board would have taken the necessary steps to
remedy them.
Shareholder relations
The Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director meet regularly
with analysts and institutional shareholders. The Investor Relations
Director also maintains a programme of work that reports to the
Board the requirements and information needs of institutional and
major investors. This is part of the regular contact that the Group
maintains with its institutional shareholders. All Directors, Executive
and Non-Executive, attend the AGM. The Chairs of the Audit,
Nomination and Remuneration Committees are available to answer
any questions. Additionally, the Group’s brokers sought independent
feedback from investors following the annual and interim results in
2008. This feedback was reported to the Board.

The Group is required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare a
Directors’ remuneration report for the 52 weeks ended 1 February
2009 and put that report to a shareholder vote. A resolution to
approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
of the Company to be held on 4 June 2009. 
The auditor is required to report on part of the Directors’
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part
of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for unaudited and audited information. 
Unaudited information
The members of, and advisors to the Remuneration Committee 
are laid out in the Corporate governance report on page 31, in the
section titled Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee considers that the Company’s
remuneration policies should encourage a strong performance
culture and emphasise long-term shareholder value creation, with
clear links between executive performance goals and business
strategy. The Committee also believes that there should be a clear
reward structure to enable the Company to attract, retain and
motivate the best talent who have been and will continue to be 
key to the Company’s recent success and future performance by:
• positioning base salaries around the mid-market; and
• operating annual and long-term incentives, so that a substantial
proportion of total remuneration is subject to performance 
and so that executives are aligned with shareholders through 
share ownership.
Fixed versus variable remuneration
A substantial proportion of the Executive Directors’ pay is
performance-related. The chart below demonstrates the balance
between fixed and performance-related pay for the Chief Executive
at target and maximum performance levels. Maximum performance
assumes the achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of
shares under the LTIP .
Base salary and benefits
Base salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly in arrears. In order
to set the right balance in Executive Directors’ packages, the policy
is generally to set salaries around mid-market levels with a
substantial proportion being subject to the performance of the
business and individuals. The Remuneration Committee has regard
to the following when reviewing salary levels:
Fixed pay (base salary and pension, excluding benefits)

• the rates for similar roles in comparator companies, both in
FTSE100 retailers, including the Company’s major competitors,
and more generally in UK-based companies of a similar size and
complexity (specifically FTSE companies ranked 20 to 60 by
market capitalisation excluding those with significant overseas
turnover/operations);
• the performance of the individual concerned, together with any
change in responsibilities that may have occurred;
• avoiding the automatic ratcheting effects of following ‘median’ or
‘upper quartile’ levels of salary derived from comparator company
analyses; and
• pay quantum and structure throughout the Company.
During the year, base salaries were reviewed in the light of
benchmark data, internal relativities and personal performance. 
As a result, increases were approved for certain Directors.
Current base salaries for the financial year, together with the
previous year’s salaries, are set out below:
2009/10 2008/09
Marc Bolland £850,000 £757,050
Mark Gunter £540,750 £540,750
Richard Pennycook £540,750 £519,120
Martyn Jones £450,000 £425,000
The increase to Marc Bolland’s base salary, which became 
effective from 1 August 2008, followed a review carried out 
by the Remuneration Committee around the time of the 
second anniversary of his appointment. The review included a
comprehensive benchmarking exercise which identified that base
salary was significantly below mid-market. Given the base salary
positioning, and following consideration of Marc Bolland’s
performance during his first two years in role, a mid-year review 
was deemed appropriate in these exceptional circumstances. Marc
Bolland did not receive any further increase in February 2009.
Richard Pennycook’s base salary was increased from £519,120 to
£540,750 effective from the normal review date of 1 February
2009. Martyn Jones’ base salary was increased with effect from 
1 February 2009 from £425,000 to £450,000 reflecting his greater
experience since promotion to the Board. Mark Gunter’s base salary,
as a result of already being positioned at the mid-market level, was
left unchanged. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that these
increases were necessary to enable the Company to pay competitive
base salaries and are reasonable in the context of the Directors’ total
remuneration packages. 
Benefits include health insurance, transport costs and 
telephone expenses.
Annual bonus 
The Remuneration Committee operated an annual bonus plan for
Executive Directors and other senior managers during 2008/09.
For 2008/09 the maximum bonus was 100% of base salary, with
measurement based upon profit before taxation (excluding
exceptionals) and personal objectives, as set out below:
Directors’ remuneration report www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreport09
35
Measures % of bonus potential 
Profit before tax, excluding exceptionals 80%
Personal objectives 20%
No bonus was payable for the achievement of personal objectives
unless the minimum profit targets had been achieved.
Details of the actual amounts paid for 2008/09 are set out in the
Directors’ emoluments table on page 37.
For the 2009/10 annual bonus plan, maximum bonus potential will
remain at 100% of base salary. 
In addition to profit before tax (excluding exceptionals) and personal
objectives, strategic corporate scorecard measures structured
around financial objectives, operational excellence, customers and
employees have been introduced, as set out below:
Measures % of bonus potential 
Profit before tax, excluding exceptionals 65%
Strategic corporate scorecard measures 20%
Personal objectives 15%
No bonus will be payable for the achievement of strategic corporate
scorecard measures or personal objectives unless the minimum
profit target has been achieved.
Specific performance targets have not been disclosed as they are
considered to be commercially confidential but they will be demanding
and require performance significantly better than plan for full payout.
The arrangements will be operated for other senior managers on
similar terms to the above but at reduced levels.
All Employee Sharesave Scheme 
The Group operates a Sharesave Scheme which is approved by 
HM Revenue & Customs. All eligible employees, including Executive
Directors, may be invited to participate on similar terms to save up
to a maximum of £250 each month for a fixed period of three years.
At the end of the savings period, individuals may use their savings
plus a tax-free bonus to buy ordinary shares in the Group at a
discount capped at up to 20% of the market price, set at the launch
of each Scheme.
Long T erm Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), approved by shareholders in
2007, is designed to reward management for achieving the Group’s
strategic objectives and to provide an appropriate level of long-term
performance pay.
Each year, participants receive conditional awards of shares in the
Group which will normally vest three years after they are awarded,
subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over
a three-year period and continued service. The plan’s individual
annual limit is 300% of salary (face value of shares).
In 2008, awards were made to 740 participants, including Executive
Directors, their direct reports and management tiers below (including
supermarket store managers). An award of shares worth 250% of
salary was made to the Chief Executive, with 200% of salary for the
other Executive Directors in April 2008. A further award of shares
worth an additional 50% of salary was made to the Chief Executive in
October 2008 to reflect his personal contribution since appointment
and act as a further incentivisation and retention mechanism over
and above his existing awards. This award was made within the
individual limit of 300% of salary contained in the LTIP rules. The
current intention is that for the Chief Executive, future award levels
from April 2009 will revert back to 250% of salary per annum.
Other Executive Directors currently receive a 200% of salary award
level. For tiers below Executive Director, awards were made in April
2008 at the 100% or lower levels, dependent upon seniority. It is
intended that the next awards will be granted in April 2009 shortly
after the 2008/09 Preliminary announcement.
Performance under the plan is measured over three years.
Performance measures are 75% based on earnings per share and
25% based on like-for-like non-fuel sales growth. These
performance metrics were selected for the following reasons:
• they are directly linked to the objectives set out in the Group’s
strategy – improving EPS and sales performance reflects the need
for basic profit growth and should flow through to increased
shareholder value;
• there is a clear line of sight between performance and reward; and
• they are relatively easy to understand and communicate.
To guard against the possibility of individuals receiving value from
the LTIP as a result of sales targets being hit but EPS targets being
missed, no awards can vest under the sales targets unless threshold
EPS targets have been met. 
For the awards intended to be granted in April 2009, details of the
three year EPS and sales targets are set out below.
25% of the EPS-related component of the award will vest if the
Group’s Underlying EPS grows in line with the growth in the Retail
Prices Index plus an average of 4% per annum, rising on a pro rata
basis until 100% vests for outperforming the Index by at least 10%
per annum. Underlying EPS will be as defined in note 7 to the
financial statements. The Group will report EPS in this way in its
Annual report.
In light of food price unpredictability, the Remuneration Committee
reviewed the best way of measuring sales growth and has made a
revision to ensure that performance continues to be measured in 
a robust way. Instead of setting absolute like-for-like sales growth
targets, the Remuneration Committee considers that it is preferable
to measure the Group’s like-for-like grocery sales growth against the
IGD (Institute of Grocery Distribution) Index, which measures market
growth in like-for-like sales (excluding fuel). This independently
audited index, which includes all of the Company’s major competitors,
is considered to be the most reliable method of measuring market
growth. 25% of the sales growth-related component of the award
will vest if the Group’s like-for-like sales match the IGD Index, rising
on a pro rata basis until 100% vests for outperforming the Index by
at least 2% over the three years ending with the 2011/12 financial
year. Like-for-like sales is defined as the reported sales from existing
space (excluding VAT), less total fuel sales. As has been the previous
practice, no part of the award relating to sales growth can vest
unless the minimum EPS target is achieved.

Company 
financial statements Investor information 36 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009
The Remuneration Committee considers that the targets set out
above are demanding in the context of the Group’s circumstances
and take into account the prospects for growth. The targets are
considered to be at least as challenging in the circumstances as 
the targets set for awards made in prior years.
Share ownership guidelines
The Group operates share ownership guidelines for Executive
Directors. Under the guidelines, Directors are expected to retain
50% of vested LTIP awards (net of tax) until such time as they own
shares worth 100% of their salary after which point they will be
expected to retain, as a minimum, this level of holding.
Pension arrangements 
The Executive Directors, with the exception of Marc Bolland,
participate in the Group’s Defined Benefit Pension Scheme. Pension
entitlements accrue at the rate of 1/30th for each year, with a
maximum pension of 2/3 pensionable salary at age 62. Pensionable
pay for the Executive Directors is annual salary as at 6 April each year.
In the case of members joining the pension scheme prior to 1 June
1989, the pension payable is currently based on final pensionable
pay calculated as the average of the highest three years pensionable
pay in the Director’s last 10 years of employment. For members
joining the scheme after 31 May 1989, final pensionable pay 
is currently the lower of the average of the highest three years
pensionable pay in the Director’s last 10 years of employment 
and the maximum earnings limit which in 2008/09 is £117,600.
Mark Gunter, Richard Pennycook and Martyn Jones became members
of the pension scheme subsequent to 1 June 1989. Sir Kenneth
Morrison is in receipt of a pension from the scheme, in addition to
his emoluments up to retirement shown on page 37. His pension
amounted to £33,997 in the period up until cessation of employment.
The expected cost of providing retirement benefits to the Directors
is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified
actuaries. The pension arrangements include life assurance cover
whilst in employment, an entitlement to a pension in the event of ill
health or disability and a pension for the spouse and any dependant
children on death. 
No contributions were paid or are payable by any Directors under
the terms of the scheme. There are no enhanced early retirement
rights. Post-retirement pensions increase in line with the annual
increase in the retail price index or by 5% per annum compound,
whichever is the lower. 
Richard Pennycook, Mark Gunter and Martyn Jones, who were all
subject to the earnings cap in place before April 2006 which has
been retained for benefits accruing thereafter, received a cash
supplement of 10% of salary in excess of the cap in 2008/09.
Following a review of this pension provision against the market, 
it was determined that the salary supplement should be increased
from 10% to 15%  for 2009/10 onwards. Marc Bolland is not in the
pension scheme but instead receives a salary supplement of 30% 
of salary which will remain unchanged.
On 25 February 2009, the Group commenced consultation with
active members of the Group’s two defined benefit pension
schemes and, where appropriate, their trade union representative
bodies. As part of the agreement in principle with the Trustee of
each scheme announced in last year’s Annual report, the Group is
proposing to change the basis of future pension accrual from final
salary to one based on career average revalued earnings (CARE).
Subject to the outcome of consultation, the change to CARE will be
made in the third quarter of 2009. Under the proposals, benefits
that have been earned under final salary arrangements will be
preserved and increased in line with the Retail Price Index from date
of conversion until retirement. The financial impact of this proposed
change is described on page 13 of the Financial review. 
Performance graph 
The following graph shows the Company’s total shareholder return
(TSR) compared against the TSR of the FTSE100 and FTSE Food &
Drug Retailers indices over the five year period to 1 February 2009.
These indices have been selected as being appropriate in giving a
broad equity view and the Company is a constituent of both indices.
Directors’ contracts 
a) Executive Directors 
All Executive Directors have a service agreement without expiry
dates. These contracts can be terminated by either the Group or
Director giving 12 months’ notice.
The Remuneration Committee has in place a model contract which
provides that any compensation provisions for termination without
notice will only extend to 12 months’ of salary, benefits and pension
(which may be payable in instalments and subject to mitigation).
Going forward, all new Director contracts will be on that basis. The
model contract does not contain change of control provisions. This
policy was applied to Marc Bolland at the time of his recruitment
and to Mark Gunter and Martyn Jones from 2007. Richard
Pennycook’s contract provides that he has an obligation to mitigate
his loss in the event of termination in breach of contract.

Roger Owen tendered his resignation on 18 October 2007 and left
the business on 1 February 2009. On the basis that full notice was
served, there was no termination payment made in relation to his
contract. Roger Owen participated in the Annual Bonus Plan for
2008/09 and received an award under the LTIP in April 2008.
Consistent with best practice, the two sets of LTIP awards granted 
to Roger Owen will continue to vest three years from the relevant
grant date, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions,
with amounts pro-rated to reflect the period of time between the
grant date and the leaving date.

1 Following shareholder approval at the 2007 AGM, Marc Bolland received a one-off LTIP reflecting the five months worked from appointment in 2006/07, with the value of shares
equal to 5/12ths of 250% of £700,000 (his salary on 1 September 2006) based on the average closing share prices on the day of the announcement of the interim results for
2006/07 (declared on 21 September 2006) and the following four business days (247.80p). This award was treated as having been made on 1 September 2006 (when Marc Bolland
joined the Company) and it vests, subject to performance and continued employment, on 1 September 2009 (i.e. three years after it was deemed to have been awarded). This award 
is not pensionable.
Vesting of the award on 1 September 2009 will be based on performance over the period ending with 2008/09, to reflect the position which would have applied had he received an
award during the 2006/07 financial year. Performance measures are 75% based on EPS and 25% based on like-for-like non-fuel sales growth. 25% of the EPS related part of the
award will vest if the Group’s EPS is 13.3p per share in 2008/09, rising on a pro rata basis until full vesting is achieved at 16p per share. 25% of the sales growth related part of the
award will vest if the Group’s like-for-like non-fuel sales grow at 3% per annum compound over 2007/08 and 2008/09, rising on a pro rata basis until full vesting is achieved for
growth of 5% p.a. compound. No awards can vest under the sales targets unless threshold EPS targets have been met.
2 LTIP awards granted on 24 May 2007 and 24 October 2007 are subject to three year performance targets. Performance measures are 75% based on EPS and 25% based on like-for-
like non-fuel sales growth. 25% of the EPS related component of the award will vest if the Group’s EPS in 2009/10 is 15.8p per share rising on a pro rata basis until 100% vests for an
EPS of 19p per share. 25% of the sales growth related component will vest if the Group’s like-for-like non-fuel sales grow by 3% p.a. compound rising on a pro rata basis until there is
100% vesting for growth of 5% p.a. compound. No awards can vest under the sales targets unless threshold EPS targets have been met.
3 LTIP awards granted on 14 April 2008 and 14 October 2008 are subject to three year performance targets. Performance measures are 75% based on EPS and 25% based on like-for-
like non-fuel sales growth. 25% of the EPS related component of the award will vest if the Group’s EPS in 2010/11 is 19.6p per share rising on a pro rata basis until 100% vests for an
EPS of 23.5p per share. 25% of the sales growth related component will vest if the Group’s like-for-like non-fuel sales grow by 3% p.a. compound rising on a pro rata basis until there
is 100% vesting for growth of 5% p.a. compound. No awards can vest under the sales targets unless threshold EPS targets have been met.
4 Marc Bolland received an additional LTIP award of 175,547 shares in October 2008 to reflect his personal contribution since appointment and act as a further incentivisation and
retention mechanism over and above his existing awards. In the future, it is currently intended that the Chief Executive will normally receive a 250% of salary LTIP award per annum. 
5 Martyn Jones received an additional LTIP award of 78,553 shares in October 2007 to reflect an increase in salary upon joining the Board.
6 Following Roger Owen’s retirement on 1 February 2009, LTIP awards will vest three years from grant, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and time pro-rating to
reflect the shorter period of time between grant date and leaving date.
7 To fulfil promises made to Richard Pennycook at the time of his recruitment, as reported in last year’s Remuneration Report, the annual bonus award made to him for 2006/07
included, in addition to the cash element, a deferred share award as a result of no LTIP being adopted by shareholders in the 2006/07 financial year. That award was in shares of the
Group with a value equal to £950,400 (two times the amount of the cash bonus earned for the 2006/07 financial year) with the number of shares calculated by reference to the
average share price over the five dealing days prior to the deemed date of the award (1 April 2007) which was 307.5p. The deferred share award will vest on 1 April 2009, provided
Richard Pennycook is still an employee of the Group at this time. Upon vesting, a payment will also be made in cash or shares, as determined by the Remuneration Committee,
equivalent to the dividends which would have been payable on the shares over the two-year deferral period (or such shorter period if awards vest earlier). This award is not pensionable.

1 Options granted under the Sharesave scheme.
The 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme terminated at the end of its 10-year life on 25 May 2005 and no grants have been made
under it since November 2004.
The ordinary share mid-market price ranged from 220p to 306p and averaged 271.7p during the period. The price on 1 February 2009 was
270.75p compared to 299.0p on 3 February 2008. 
The performance condition attached to options under the Executive Share Option Scheme (which has been satisfied) is as follows:
• The operating profit of the Group, as detailed in the audited report and financial statements, must increase by at least 20% between the
base year and its third or succeeding anniversary. Once an option is exercisable it will remain so until it lapses (in accordance with the rules
of the Scheme) even if on a future anniversary the operating profit does not exceed the base year by 20%. www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreport09
41
Dilution and share usage
Awards under the Group’s share option and SAYE schemes are satisfied by the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders
when the plans were approved. These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers’ guidelines restricting dilution from employee
share plans. The overall limits under the guidelines are that no more than 10% of a Group’s issued share capital may be used in any 10 year
period. Up to 5% may be used for executive share plans. As at 1 February 2009, the Group’s share usage against these limits was 3.11% and
0.72% respectively.
It is currently intended that LTIP awards be satisfied by market purchased shares which are held in an Employee Benefit Trust.
Directors’ interests

financial statements Investor information The Directors’ report and business review
Pages 2 to 44 inclusive of this Annual report consist of a Directors’
report and business review that has been drawn up and presented 
in accordance with, and in reliance on, English company law. 
The liabilities of the Directors in connection with that Directors’
report and business review shall be subject to the limitations 
and restrictions provided by the Companies Act 2006. 
There are no persons with whom the Group has contractual or other
arrangements which are essential to the business of the Group.
Forward-looking statements 
The Directors’ report and business review is prepared for the
members of the Company and should not be relied upon by any
other party or for any other purpose. Where the Directors’ report
and business review includes forward-looking statements, these are
made by the Directors in good faith based on the information
available to them at the time of their approval of this report.
Consequently, such statements should be treated with caution 
due to the inherent uncertainties, including both economic and
business risk factors, underlying such forward-looking statements
and information.
Result and dividend 
The profit for the period after taxation amounted to £460m. The
Directors have declared and recommended the following dividends:
£m
Paid interim dividend of 0.8p per share 
(2008: 0.675p) 21
Recommended final dividend of 5.0p per share 
(2008: 4.125p) 131
The final dividend, if approved by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting (AGM), is to be paid on 10 June 2009 to ordinary
shareholders on the register of members at close of business on 
8 May 2009. If the final dividend is approved by shareholders, 
the total ordinary dividend for the year will be 5.8p per share.
Auditor 
A resolution to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditor and to
authorise the Directors to set their remuneration is to be proposed
at the forthcoming AGM.
Annual General Meeting 
The notice of the 2009 AGM of the Company (to be held at the
Company’s headquarters at Gain Lane in Bradford on 4 June 2009)
is sent to shareholders with an accompanying explanatory letter
from the Chairman. The Directors believe each of the resolutions 
to be proposed at the AGM is in the best interests of the Group 
and recommend shareholders to vote in favour of each of them.
Shareholders will also receive notification of the availability of the
results to view on the Group’s website, unless they have elected to
receive a printed version.
Share capital 
The authorised and called-up share capital of the Company, together
with details of shares allotted during the year, is shown in note 22 
of the financial statements.
At the AGM of the Company held in 2008, a special resolution was
passed to renew the authority given at the AGM held on 24 May
2007 to the purchase by the Company of up to 268,361,042
ordinary shares representing approximately 10% of the issued
ordinary share capital at that time. This authority remained valid 
on 1 February 2009. During the period, the Company purchased
and cancelled 57,788,600 of its ordinary shares pursuant to that
authority which will expire at the close of the 2009 AGM. Further
details appear in note 41 of the financial statements.
In addition, 1,530,738 ordinary shares were issued during the
period to employees exercising share options.
Borrowing powers 
The Articles of Association of the Company restrict the borrowings
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to a maximum
amount equal to twice the share capital and consolidated reserves.

Beneficial owners of shares who have been nominated by the
registered holder of those shares to receive information rights

their shares rather than to the Company’s registrar, Capita
Registrars, or to the Group directly.

General information
42 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009 www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreport09
43
The interests of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company and their immediate families in the shares of the
Company, along with share options, are contained in the Directors’
remuneration report set out on pages 34 to 41.
At no time during the year did any of the Directors have a material
interest in any significant contract with the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries.
Political and charitable donations 
During the period the Group made charitable donations amounting
to £0.3m. In addition, the Group sponsored various charities and in
the year over £0.9m was raised by customers and staff. No political
donations were made, which is Group policy.
Disclosure of information to auditors 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this
Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditor is
unaware; and each Director has taken all steps that he or she ought
to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditor
is aware of that information.
Going concern 
The Directors’ assessment of the Group and Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern has taken into consideration the effect
that the current economic climate has on the Group. 
The Group’s ability to borrow cash has not been adversely affected
by the lack of liquidity in the financial markets and the Group has
already negotiated and has available committed, competitive
facilities that will meet the Group’s needs in the medium term.
The principal risks that the Group are challenged with have been 
set out on page 22 to 23 including such risks as the loss of a key
supplier, along with how the Directors mitigate these risks in the
current economic climate.
After reviewing the Group’s Optimisation Plan, financial forecasts
including an assessment of working capital and other medium 
term plans, the Directors are confident that the Company and the
Group have adequate financial resources available to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The going concern
basis has continued to be adopted in the preparation of the 
financial statements.
Payment to creditors 
Supplier credit is an important factor in the success of the business.
The Group works within the spirit and letter of the supermarkets’
code of practice. It is Group policy to ensure all payments are made
within mutually agreed credit terms. Where disputes arise, the
Group attempts to sort these out promptly and amicably to ensure
delays in payment are kept to a minimum. Trade creditors for the
Group at the financial year end represented 33 days of purchases
(2008: 34 days).
Health and safety policy 
It is the Group’s intention, so far as is reasonably practicable, 
to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all its employees,
customers and visitors to its premises. In order to achieve this, a
comprehensive health and safety manual is in place for each division
of the Company and subsidiary companies within the Group. Each
health and safety manual contains the policy and procedures for
complying with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, including
the provision, based on risk assessment, of safe working practices
for all work activities across the Group. The Group’s health and
safety policy is approved by the Executive Board. The Group has
adopted the national targets set by the Health and Safety
Commission for the reduction of workplace accidents and work-
related ill health, and is on course to meet or exceed these targets.
Health and safety performance is monitored to ensure continuous
improvement in all areas.
Additional shareholder information
Additional information for shareholders is required by the
implementation of the EU Takeover Directive into UK Law.
Pursuant to Part VII of Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1985 and
section 992 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is required 
to disclose certain additional information. Such disclosures, which
are not covered elsewhere in this report, include the following
paragraphs. Where reference is made to the Company’s Articles of
Association, this refers to the existing set of Articles, although the
changes proposed to be made at the Company’s 2009 AGM will not
change the relevant sections. The disclosures below are in some
cases a summary of the relevant provisions of the Company’s
Articles of Association and the relevant full provisions can be found
in the Articles which are available for inspection at the Company’s
registered office.
Share capital and rights attaching to the Company’s shares
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, any share in the
Company may be issued with such rights or restrictions, whether 
in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise as the
Company may from time-to-time by ordinary resolution determine
(or, in the absence of any such determination, as the Directors 
may determine).
At a general meeting of the Company, every member has one vote
on a show of hands and on a poll, one vote for each share held. The
notice of general meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting
rights either by proxy or present in person in relation to resolutions
to be passed at a general meeting. 
No member is, unless the Board decides otherwise, entitled to 
attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general meeting 
or to exercise any other right conferred by being a shareholder if 
he or any person with an interest in shares has been sent a notice
under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon
public companies the power to require information with respect to
interests in their voting shares) and he or any interested person
failed to supply the Company with the information requested within
14 days after delivery of that notice. The Board may also decide that

no dividend is payable in respect of those default shares and that no
transfer of any default shares shall be registered. These restrictions
end seven days after receipt by the Company of a notice of an
approved transfer of the shares or all the information required 
by the relevant section 793 notice, whichever is the earlier.
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer of any share which
is not a fully-paid share, although such discretion may not be
exercised in a way which the Financial Services Authority regards 
as preventing dealings in the shares of the relevant class or classes
from taking place on an open or proper basis. The Directors may
likewise refuse to register any transfer of a share in favour of more
than four persons jointly.
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions on the transfer
of shares in the Company other than certain restrictions that may
from time-to-time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example,
insider trading laws).
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
voting rights.
Appointment and powers of Directors
Directors are appointed by ordinary resolution at a general meeting
of ordinary shareholders. The Directors have the power to appoint 
a Director during the year but any person so appointed must be put
up for appointment at the next AGM. 
Subject to its Articles of Association and relevant statutory law 
and to such direction as may be given by the Company in general
meeting by special resolution, the business of the Company shall 
be managed by the Directors, who may exercise all powers of the
Company which are not required to be exercised by the Company 
in general meeting.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by 
a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. At the
Company’s AGM to be held on 4 June 2009, a resolution will be 
put to shareholders proposing amendments to the existing Articles
of Association to incorporate changes introduced by the new
Companies Act 2006.
Other disclosures
The Company is not party to any significant arrangements which
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the
Company following a takeover bid. 
The Company does not have any employee share schemes where 
the shares to which the scheme relates have rights with regard to
the control of the Company which are not exercisable by employees.

Annual report and financial statements
www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreport09

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and
have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and the
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in
relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant
part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view
are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Parent Company financial statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Parent Company.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent
Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration
report and Corporate governance statement that comply with that
law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair review
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the
Company and its subsidiaries included in the consolidation as a
whole; and
• the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development of
the business and the position of the Company and its subsidiaries
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Company 
financial statements Investor information We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Wm Morrison Supermarkets
PLC for the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2009 which comprise the
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated and Parent
Company balance sheets, the Consolidated cash flow statement, 
the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense and
the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited
the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is
described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Group Annual
report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the EU, and for preparing the Parent Company financial
statements and the Directors’ remuneration report in accordance
with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ responsibilities on page 45.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ report and business review 
is consistent with the financial statements. 
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual report and
financial statements and consider whether it is consistent with 
the audited financial statements. We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 1 February 2009 and of its profit for the 
year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation;
• the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of
the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 1 February 2009;
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report and business review
is consistent with the financial statements.

Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC
46 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009 Accounting policies
General information
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC is a public limited company
incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985
(Registration number 358949). The Company is domiciled in the
United Kingdom and its registered address is Hilmore House, Gain
Lane, Bradford, BD3 7DL, United Kingdom.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared for the 52 weeks
ended 1 February 2009 (2008: 3 February 2008) in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International
Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee interpretations
(IFRIC) as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of
the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS. IFRS and IFRIC are issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (the IASB) and must be adopted into European
Union law, referred to as endorsement, before they become
mandatory under the IAS Regulation. Shown below are recent
standards and interpretations that have been issued by the IASB,
indicating their status of endorsement.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis. The Directors’ assessment of going concern has been
considered within the general information section of the Directors’
report and business review.
The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, rounded
to the nearest million, except in some instances, where it is deemed
relevant to disclose the amounts up to one decimal place. They have
been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, except for
share-based payments and derivative financial instruments, which
are measured at fair value, and pension scheme liabilities that are
measured using actuarial valuations.
The Group’s accounting policies are set out below and have, unless
otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented
in these consolidated financial statements.
The endorsement of IFRIC 14 IAS19 – The limit on a defined benefit
asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction, has no
material impact on the Group’s financial statements. The accounting
policy for Retirement benefits has been updated to cover the
recognition of an asset if one should exist in the future.
There have been no further alterations made to the accounting
policies as a result of considering all amendments to IFRS and IFRIC
interpretations that became effective during the financial period as
these were considered to be immaterial to the Group’s operations or
were not relevant.
New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for
financial statements after this reporting period. The following have
not been adopted by the Group:
Effective for accounting
International Financial Reporting Standards periods starting on or after
IAS 1* Presentation of financial statements: 
A revised presentation 1 January 2009
IFRS 2* Share-based payment:

IFRS 3 Business combinations 1 July 2009
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
IFRIC 13* Customer loyalty programmes 1 July 2008
* These standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the European Union.
The application of these standards and interpretations are not
anticipated to have a material effect on the Group’s financial
statements except for additional disclosure.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, being those
undertakings that it controls. Control is achieved where the
Company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policy of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries used in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared
for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and are 
based on consistent accounting policies. The results of subsidiaries
acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the effective date of
acquisition up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income
and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated
in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Significant accounting policies
The Directors consider the following to be significant accounting
policies in the context of the Group’s operations:
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred to the buyer, there is reasonable
certainty of recovery of the consideration and the amount of
revenue, associated costs and possible return of goods can be
estimated reliably.
a) Sale of goods in-store and fuel
Sale of goods in-store is recorded net of value added tax, staff
discounts, coupons, vouchers and the free element of multi-save
transactions. Sale of fuel is recognised net of value added tax and
Morrisons Miles award points. Revenue is recognised when
transactions are completed in-store.

Performance review Strategic review Governance
Group
financial statements
Company 
financial statements Investor information b) Manufacturing sales
Manufacturing sales are made direct to third-party customers 
from our manufacturing companies and are recognised on 
despatch of goods. Sales are recorded net of value added tax 
and intra-group transactions.
c) Income from concessions and commissions
Income from concessions and commissions is based on the terms 
of the contract. Revenue collected on behalf of others is not
recognised as turnover, other than the related commission.
Other operating income
Other operating income consists of income not directly related to
the operating of supermarkets and mainly comprises rental income
from investment properties. Other categories of income included
within ‘Other operating income’ are backhaul income and credits
earned from the recycling of waste and packaging materials. Details
of rental income from investment property are provided in note 10.
a) Rental income from investment property
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties
is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Segmental reporting
Based on the nature of risks and returns impacting the Group’s
activities, the Directors consider that the primary reporting format
is by business segment. The Directors consider that there is only 
one business segment, being grocery and related retailing. The
disclosures for the primary segment are therefore given by the
primary financial statements and related notes.
The Group’s business operations are conducted almost exclusively 
in the UK so a geographical segment report is not required.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of all costs to the point of sale including
manufacturing, warehouse and transportation costs. Store
depreciation and a proportion of employee costs are also allocated 
to cost of sales.
Supplier income
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are collectively referred
to as supplier income in the retail industry. Supplier income is
recognised as a deduction from cost of sales on an accruals basis
based on the expected entitlement which has been earned up to the
balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract. The accrued
incentives, rebates and discounts receivable at year end are included
within prepayments and accrued income. Where amounts received
are in the expectation of future business, these are recognised in
line with that future business.
Property transactions
Property includes the balance sheet headings of property, plant and
equipment, investment property, lease prepayments and non-
current assets classified as held for sale. The results of transactions
relating to disposal of property are reported in the income
statement under ‘Profit arising on property transactions’.
Depreciation and any impairment charges or reversals are
recognised in cost of sales or administrative expenses, as appropriate.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the Group’s income statement
on an effective interest rate basis except for interest costs that are
directly attributable to the construction of buildings which are
capitalised and included within the initial cost of a building.
Capitalisation of interest cost ceases when the property is ready 
for use.
Deferred and current tax
Current tax payable is based on the taxable profit for the period,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting
date and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous
periods. Taxable profit differs from the profit as reported in the
income statement as it is adjusted both for items that will never 
be taxable or deductible and temporary differences. Current tax is
charged in the income statement, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly in equity in which case the current tax 
is reflected in equity.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method. Provision
is made for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for taxation purposes. No deferred tax is recognised
for temporary differences that arise on the initial recognition of
goodwill or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that is not a
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable
profits. Deferred tax is calculated based on tax law that is enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date and provided at rates
expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse. Deferred
tax is charged or credited in the income statement except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case
the deferred tax is reflected in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be
utilised. Deferred tax assets recognised are reviewed at each
reporting date as judgement is required to estimate the availability
of future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not
discounted and are offset where amounts will be settled on a net
basis as there is a legally enforceable right to offset.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make
judgements and estimates of ultimate exposures in relation to tax
compliance issues. All accruals are included in current liabilities.
Business combinations and goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the
purchase method.
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of subsidiaries are
measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess
of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill in respect of the acquisition of Safeway was fully
impaired in 2006.
Accounting policies continued
48 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009 Property, plant and equipment
a) Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include directly attributable costs. Annual reviews are made 
of estimated useful lives and material residual values.
b) Depreciation rates used to write off cost less residual value on 
a straight line basis are:
Freehold land 0%
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2.5%
Short lease buildings Over lease period
Plant, equipment, fixtures and vehicles 14-33%
Assets held under a finance lease Shorter of life of lease or asset
Assets under construction 0%
Investment property
Property held to earn rental income rather than for the purpose of
the Group’s principal activities is classified as Investment property.
Investment property is recorded at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. The depreciation
policy is consistent with those described for other Group properties.
Income from investment properties is disclosed in ‘Other operating
income’ and details are shown in note 10 ‘Investment property’. 
The related operating costs are immaterial and are included within
Administrative expenses.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Property, plant and equipment and investment property are annually
reviewed for indications of impairment, or when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. This is performed for each cash generating unit, which
in the case of a supermarket is an individual retail outlet. If there are
indications of possible impairment then a test is performed on the
asset affected to assess its recoverable amount against carrying
value. An asset impaired is written down to its recoverable amount
which is the higher of value in use or its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset.
If there is indication of an increase in fair value of an asset that had
been previously impaired, then this is recognised by reversing the
impairment, but only to the extent that the recoverable amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset.
Stocks
Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis and comprises
purchase price, import duties and other non-recoverable taxes, 
less rebates. Stocks are primarily goods for resale.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make 
the sale.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying
amount will be recovered through sale rather than continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly
probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate
sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to
the sale and it should be expected to be completed within one year
from the date of classification.
On reclassification, non-current assets held for sale are recognised 
at the lower of carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are
included in the income statement, as are gains or losses on
subsequent remeasurement. The depreciation of the asset ceases 
on reclassification. Assets are reclassified from non-current assets
held for sale when the above criteria cease to be met.
Leases
Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases; all other
leases are classified as finance leases.
Lessor accounting
a) Operating leases
Assets acquired and held for use under operating leases are recorded
as property, plant and equipment and are depreciated on a straight
line basis to their estimated residual values over their estimated
useful lives. Operating lease income is recognised on a straight 
line basis to the date of the next rent review.
b) Finance leases
The Group does not lease any assets on a finance lease basis.
Lessee accounting
a) Operating leases
Rental payments are taken to the income statement on a straight
line basis over the life of the lease.
Property leases are analysed into separate components for land 
and buildings and tested to establish whether the components 
are operating leases or finance leases. Premiums paid for land are
treated as a prepayment of an operating lease rental and recognised
on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
b) Finance leases
The present value, calculated using the interest rate implicit in the
lease, of the future minimum lease payments is included within fixed
assets and financial liabilities as an obligation to pay future rentals.
Depreciation is provided at the same rates as for owned assets, 
or over the lease period, if shorter.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance charge and
the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of
finance charge on the remaining balance.
Provisions
Provisions are created where the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is
probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits to
settle the obligation from the Group, and where it can be reliably
measured. The nature of these provisions are:

Performance review Strategic review Governance
Group
financial statements
Company 
financial statements Investor information a) Property provisions
Provisions made in respect of individual properties where there 
are obligations for onerous contracts, dilapidations and certain
decommissioning obligations for petrol filling stations. The amounts
provided are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely
committed outflow to the Group. Where material, these estimated
outflows are discounted to net present value.
b) Restructuring provisions
Provisions are established for announced and ongoing restructuring
programmes planned and controlled by management where there 
is an obligation to make changes to the scope of the business
undertaken by the Group or the manner in which business is
conducted. The provision includes costs of severance to the affected
employees, costs of property closure, and other direct expenditures
not associated with ongoing activities.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
exchange at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in foreign currency are retranslated at the rates of
exchange at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on
retranslation are included in the income statement for the period.
Retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution
schemes. A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
A defined benefit scheme is one that is not a defined contribution
scheme. Pension benefits under defined benefit schemes are
defined on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years 
of service and a formula using either the employee’s compensation
package or career average earnings.
The Group operates two defined benefit retirement schemes which
are funded by contributions from the Group and members. The
defined benefit schemes are not open to new members. Pension
scheme assets, which are held in separate trustee administered
funds, are valued at market rates. Pension scheme obligations are
measured on a discounted present value basis using assumptions as
shown in note 20. The operating and financing costs of the scheme
are recognised separately in the income statement in the period in
which they arise. Death-in-service costs are recognised on a straight
line basis over their vesting period. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income 
and expense.
The Group has a right to recognise an asset, should one arise, in
respect of the Group’s net obligations to the pension schemes.
Therefore, either an asset or a liability is recognised in the balance
sheet, calculated separately for each scheme.
Payments by the Group to the defined contribution scheme are
charged to the income statement as they arise.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain
employees in exchange for services rendered by them. The fair value
of the share-based award is calculated at the date of grant and is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period with a
corresponding increase in equity. This is based on the Group’s
estimate of share options that will eventually vest. This takes 
into account movement of non-market conditions, being service
conditions and financial performance, if relevant. The fair value 
of equity-settled awards granted is not subsequently revisited.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial stochastic model. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group has applied fair values to all grants of equity instruments
after 7 November 2002 which were unvested as of 1 January 2005, 
at each balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
a) Financial assets
i) Trade and other debtors
Trade and other debtors are carried at the lower of their original
invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is made when
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover
balances in full, with the charge being recognised in administrative
expenses in the income statement. Balances are written off when
the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents for cash flow purposes includes cash-in-
hand, cash-at-bank and bank overdrafts together with short term,
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known
amounts of cash, with an insignificant risk of a change in value,
within three months from the date of acquisition. In the balance
sheet, bank overdrafts are presented within current liabilities.
b) Financial liabilities
i) Trade and other creditors
Trade and other creditors are stated at cost.
ii) Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at
fair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial
recognition, any difference between the redemption value and the
initial carrying amount is recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
c) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value,
which normally equates to cost, and are remeasured at fair value
through profit or loss.
Cash flow hedges
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges
when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that
are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised
asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
Accounting policies continued
50 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009 The Group has a cross-currency swap which has been designated 
as a cash flow hedge. This derivative financial instrument is used 
to match or minimise risk from potential movements in foreign
exchange rates inherent in the cash flows of certain financial
liabilities. To minimise the risk from potential movements in
commodity prices, the Group has fuel price contracts which are 
also designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness. Where a
derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the
variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly
probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss
on the movement in fair value of the derivative financial instrument
is recognised directly in equity through SoRIE. The gain or loss on
any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the
income statement within finance income/costs in relation to the
cross-currency swap and within cost of sales in relation to the fuel
price contracts. If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently
results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the
associated cumulative gains or losses that were recognised directly
in equity are reclassified into the income statement when the
transaction occurs.
Net debt
Net debt is cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit,
bank and other current loans, bonds and derivative financial
instruments (stated at current fair value).
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share
capital, the consideration paid, including directly attributable
incremental costs, is deducted from retained earnings until the
shares are cancelled. On cancellation, the nominal value of the
shares is deducted from share capital and the amount is transferred
to the capital redemption reserve.
Treasury shares
The Group has an employee trust for the granting of Group shares
to executives and members of the employee share plans. Shares in
the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury
shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from
retained earnings.
The finance and administration costs relating to the Executive Share
Option Scheme are charged to the income statement. The shares
are deducted for the purpose of calculating the Group’s earnings 
per share.
Use of critical accounting assumptions and estimates
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
value of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
a) Property provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations and
decommissioning costs. These provisions are estimates based on
the condition of each property and market conditions in the relevant
location. The actual costs and timing of future cash flows are
dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations
and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period
when such determination is made.
b) Pension scheme assumptions and mortality table
The carrying value of defined benefit pension schemes is valued
using actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on
assumptions including the selection of the correct mortality tables
for the profile of members in each scheme. All these are estimates
of future events. The mortality experience study conducted as part
of the Safeway scheme triennial valuation is statistically significant
and the longevity assumption is adjusted to reflect its results. As
both of the Group’s schemes have a similar composition and type 
of members, this adjustment is also made to the Morrisons scheme.
The mortality assumptions, financial assumptions and mortality
experience study are based on advice received from the schemes’
actuaries. Where appropriate, these are corroborated from time 
to time with benchmark surveys and ad hoc analysis.
c) Assumptions relating to tax 
The Group recognises expected liabilities for tax based on an
estimation of the likely taxes due, which requires significant
judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items.
Where the actual liability arising from these issues differs from 
these estimates, such differences will have an impact on income 
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period when such
determination is made.
d) Determination of useful lives, residual values and carry values 
of property, plant and equipment, investment property and long
leasehold land prepayments
Depreciation is provided so as to write down the assets to their
residual values over their estimated useful lives as set out in the
accounting policies for property, plant and equipment, investment
property and long leasehold land prepayments. The selection of
these residual values and estimated lives requires the exercise 
of judgement.
The Group is required to assess whether there is indication 
of impairment to the carrying value of assets. In making that
assessment, judgements are made in estimating value in use. 
The Directors consider that the individual carrying values of stores
and other operating assets are supportable either by value in use 
or market values.

54 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009 1 Underlying earnings
The Directors consider that underlying earnings per share measures referred to in the Chairman’s statement, CEO’s review and Financial
review provide additional useful information for shareholders on underlying trends and performance. The adjustments are made to 
reported profit to (a) remove potential income statement volatility within net pension interest; (b) remove profits arising on property
transactions since these profits do not form part of the Group’s principal activities; and (c) normalise the tax charge as required. 
In the current period, we have used the actual tax charge as the difference between the actual tax charge and a normalised charge is not
significant. In the prior period, an effective tax rate of 32% was applied, being an estimated normalised tax rate, since the prior period’s
effective tax rate was considerably lower than the prevailing rate due to the reasons set out in note 6.

7 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially
dilutive ordinary shares. The Company has two (2008: two) classes of financial instruments that are potentially dilutive: those share options
granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the period and
contingently issuable shares under the Group’s long term incentive plan.

a) Financial risk management
The Group’s treasury operations are controlled centrally by the Treasury Committee in accordance with clearly defined policies and
procedures that have been authorised by the Board. There is an amount of delegated authority to the Treasury Committee, but all activities
are summarised in half yearly treasury reports which are presented to the Audit Committee.
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, other borrowings, finance leases and
trade and other creditors. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various
financial assets such as trade debtors and cash and short term deposits which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, in the form of forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and diesel and electricity 
price contracts. The purpose of these derivative instruments is to manage risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
The financial derivatives relating to commitments entered into during the year are to manage the risks arising from its usage of diesel and
electricity. It remains the Group’s policy not to engage in speculative trading of financial instruments.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, which remain unchanged from the prior year are stated below:
i) Foreign currency risk
The Group makes the majority of its purchases in Sterling. However, it incurs currency exposure in respect of overseas trade purchases 
made in currencies other than Sterling, primarily the Euro and US dollar. The Group’s objective is to reduce risk to short term profits from
exchange rate fluctuations. It is Group policy that any transactional currency exposures recognised to have a material impact on short term
profits will be hedged through the use of derivative financial instruments. As at the balance sheet date, the Group had entered into forward
foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure on up to 50% of its forecasted purchases within the next six months.
Exposure on debt denominated in a foreign currency is fully hedged using cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change (+/–20%) in the US dollar/Euro exchange rate has been determined as being immaterial.
ii) Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain a balance of funding with a range of maturities and a sufficient level of undrawn committed borrowing
facilities to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities. Short term cash balances, together with undrawn committed facilities,
enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk. The Group finances its operations with a combination of bank credit facilities and bonds.
The Treasury Committee monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve on a quarterly basis, which comprises committed and
uncommitted borrowing facilities on the basis of expected cash flow. At the year end, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of £850m
(note 17); these facilities remain available to the Group.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s primary non-current financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted
payments, which includes interest payments. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is
not significant.
As the amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these amounts do not agree to the amounts disclosed 
on the balance sheet for borrowings. Where borrowings are subject to a floating rate, an estimate for interest has been taken.

iii) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banking groups as well as credit
exposures from tenants of investment properties.
The Group maintains deposits with banks and financial institutions with an acceptable credit rating for a period not exceeding six months.
Further, the Group has specified limits that can be deposited with any banking group or financial institution at any point. The maximum
exposure on cash and cash equivalents and deposits is equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The Group does not expect any
significant performance losses from counterparties.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that tenants of investment properties who wish to
trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with
the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 14.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
iv) Other risk
Pricing risk: The Group manages the risks associated with the purchase of electricity, gas and diesel consumed by its activities. This does not
include fuel purchased for resale to customers. The Treasury Committee reviews the Group’s market price exposure to these commodities on
a quarterly basis and determines a strategy for utilising derivative financial products in order to mitigate the volatility of the commodity prices.
The Group intends to hold derivatives to maintain cover of its energy purchases of up to 75% over an appropriate timescale.
Cash flow interest rate risk: The Group’s long term policy is to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates by maintaining up 
to 60% of its consolidated total net debt in fixed rate borrowings over a four year horizon. As at the balance sheet date, 74% of the Group’s
borrowings are at fixed rate, thereby substantially mitigating the Group’s exposure to adverse movements in interest rate.
Cash and cash equivalents is a significant interest-bearing asset held by the Group. At year end, a 1% movement in interest rates would have
had a £2m (2008: £5m) impact on the Group’s annual finance income. There are no other significant interest-bearing assets held by the Group.

b) Capital management
The Group’s objectives are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern providing returns to shareholders, through the optimisation
of the debt and equity balance, and to maintain a strong credit rating and headroom. The Group manages its capital structure and makes
appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group. The Group has completed a share
buyback programme in the period, see note 23.
A key objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the revolving credit facility.
The Group’s policy is to maintain both a gearing ratio and interest cover, which represents headroom of at least 10% over and above the
requirements laid down in the revolving credit facility. Throughout the year, the Group has comfortably complied with this policy.
There has been no change in the objectives, policies or processes with regards to capital management during the years ended 1 February
2009 and 3 February 2008.
c) Fair values
i) Financial assets
All financial derivatives are held at fair value which has been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the
instruments are traded.
Cash and cash equivalents and Debtors are held at book value which equals the fair value. The values of the financial assets are disclosed
within note 12.
ii) Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost. The Euro bonds are retranslated at balance sheet date spot rates. The fair value of the
Sterling and Euro bonds are measured using closing market prices. These compare to carrying values as follows:
2009 2008
Amortised Fair Amortised Fair
cost value cost value
£m £m £m £m
Total Sterling and Euro bonds – non-current 784 781 758 693
The fair value of other items within current and non-current borrowing equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not
significant.
d) Hedging activities
i) Cash flow hedge
At 1 February 2009, the Company held a cross-currency swap which has been designated as a cash flow hedge. This derivative financial
instrument is used to minimise risk from potential movements in foreign exchange rates inherent in cash flow of certain liabilities. To
minimise the risk from potential movements in commodity prices, the Group has fuel price contracts which are also designated as cash 
flow hedges.
The hedged forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next two years. Gains and
losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity (note 23) on cross-currency swaps as at 1 February 2009 are recognised in the income
statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally once every
year over the course of the next two (2008: three) years.
ii) Forward contracts
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company. The hedging instruments are primarily used to
hedge purchases in Euro and US dollars. The cash flows hedged will occur within one year of the balance sheet date.
At 1 February 2009, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed was
£53m (2008: £45m). The fair value of these outstanding forward exchange contracts at the balance sheet date was £3.4m (2008: £0.2m).

20 Pensions
a) Defined benefit pension scheme
The Group operates two pension schemes, the ‘Morrison’ and ‘Safeway’ schemes, providing benefits based on pensionable pay of the final
years of membership. The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds; no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2007 and 1 April 2007 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes
respectively, were updated for IAS 19 purposes for the periods to 1 February 2009, 3 February 2008, 4 February 2007 and 29 January 2006
by a qualified independent actuary.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Pension Scheme gives the trustees power to set the level of contributions. In the Safeway Scheme this
power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 2 February 2009 is £44m (2008: £138m, including
a special contribution of £100m).
b) Assumptions
The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes’ defined benefit obligation were as follows:
i) Financial
2009 2008 2007
Rate of increases in salaries 4.75-5.75% 5.00-6.00% 4.45-5.45%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.50% 3.75% 3.20%
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.25% 5.75% 5.00%
Inflation assumption 3.50% 3.75% 3.20%

ii) Longevity
The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows:
2009 2008 2007
Male 23.5 23.5 19.9
Female 25.8 25.8 22.8
The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows:
2009 2008 2007
Male 22.2 22.2 19.9
Female 24.7 24.7 22.8
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics. The
longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement. Amongst the UK population there is 
a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption. 
This means that a 45 year old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year old today. This particular adjustment, described 
in the mortality tables below, is known as ‘Long Cohort’ and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up to date tables are used in each period. The current mortality table used is PNX00 YOB LC (2008: PNX00 YOB LC and 2007:
PA92 C2020). As disclosed in the critical accounting assumptions on page 51, the results of the experience study conducted for the Safeway
Scheme have been used to adjust the longevity assumption for both schemes.
iii) Expected return on assets
The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes’ assets, were as follows:
2009 2008 2007
Long term rate of return on:
Equities 7.00% 7.00% 7.00%
Corporate bonds 6.00% 6.00% 5.00%
Gilts 4.25-4.50% 4.25-4.50% –
Property-related funds 6.00% 6.00% 6.00%
Active currency management assets – – 5.25%
Cash 2.50% 5.50% 5.25%
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the
timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectation at 
the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
c) Valuations
Assets of the schemes are held in order to generate cash to be used to satisfy the schemes’ obligations, and are not necessarily intended to
be realised in the short term. The allocation of assets between category is governed by the Investment Principles of each scheme and is the
responsibility of the trustees of each respective scheme. The trustees should take due consideration of the Group’s views and a representative
of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committee meetings. The fair value of the schemes’ assets, which may be subject to significant
change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long
periods and are inherently uncertain, are as follows:
2009 2008 2007

Equities 592 1,040 1,208

Actuarial gain recognised in the SoRIE 324 77 92
Benefits paid 37 41 47
Defined benefit obligation at end of period (1,807) (2,007) (1,972)
The cost of buying out pension benefits with an insurer was estimated in the recent actuarial valuations to be £2,300m at April 2007, versus
assets of £1,939m at February 2008. This is a deficit of £361m or solvency funding ratio of 84%.
The cost of providing pensions equivalent to the level of compensation paid by the Pension Protection Fund was estimated to be £1,633m at
April 2007, compared with assets of £1,939m at February 2008. This is a Pension Protection Fund surplus of £306m or a funding ratio of 119%.

a) Restructuring
The restructuring of the Group’s distribution centres, begun in 2006, concluded in the year. The original provision made, of £75m, was not
fully utilised and an unspent balance of £8m was therefore reversed in the period. The remaining provision at the start of the year, relating 
to the Group’s change in corporate logo, was fully utilised in the year.
b) Property provisions
Property provisions comprise onerous leases provision, petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and provisions for dilapidations 
on leased buildings.
Onerous leases relate to sublet and vacant properties. Where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, a provision
based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall. The lease commitments range from 1 to 65 years. Market
conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision
made where necessary. As noted in the financial review, adjustments have been made to reflect the change in market conditions and the
legislative changes in respect of rates charges for empty properties.
Other property provisions comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and dilapidations cost. Provision is made for
decommissioning costs for when the petrol filling station tanks reach the end of their useful life or when they become redundant and is based 
on the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks. Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back 
to the condition in which it was originally leased. Provision is made for these costs, which are incurred on termination of the lease.

a) Potential issues of ordinary shares
Certain eligible employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the Company at prices ranging from 0p to 247p under the share option
schemes approved by shareholders. Options on two million shares (2008: nine million) were exercised in the current financial year.
b) Preference shares
The 282,666 5¼% cumulative preference shares with nominal amount of £1, amounting to £0.3m have been classified as a current financial
liability in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures. These preference shares do not carry any voting rights.

Included in retained earnings is a deduction of £44m (2008: £44m) in respect of treasury shares held at the balance sheet date. This
represents the cost of 17,641,448 (2008: 17,641,448) of the Company’s ordinary shares (nominal value of £1.8m). These shares are held by
a trust using funds provided by the Group and were acquired to meet obligations under the share option schemes. The costs of funding and
administering the schemes are charged to the income statement of the Company in the period to which they relate. The market value of the
shares at 1 February 2009 was £48m (2008: £53m). The trust has waived its rights to dividends. These shares are not treasury shares as
defined by the London Stock Exchange or the Companies Act 2006.
a) Share buyback
The Company purchased 57,788,600 of its own shares in the open market for cancellation between 31 March 2008 and 21 November 2008
at a cost of £146m. The shares repurchased represent 2.15% of the ordinary share capital at 3 February 2008.
b) Merger reserve
The merger reserve represents the reserve in the Company’s balance sheet arising on the acquisition in 2004 of Safeway Limited. In the
opinion of the Directors, this reserve is not distributable and accordingly it will be carried forward as a capital reserve.
c) Hedging reserve
This represents the gains and losses arising on the cash flow hedge from the Group’s cross-currency swaps, see note 18.

26 Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of share-based payments schemes; (i) the Executive share option scheme, (ii) the Sharesave scheme and (iii) 
an equity-settled Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). In line with IFRS 2 Share-based payment, the Group has fair valued all grants of equity
instruments issued after 7 November 2002 which were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was £14m (2008: £9m), all of which related to equity-settled
share-based payment transactions. After corporation and deferred tax, the total charge in the income statement was £11m (2008: £7m).
a) Share option schemes
i) Executive share option scheme
In May 1995, the Group adopted the 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme which was made available to Directors and other senior
employees. The scheme was terminated on 25 May 2005. The scheme offered options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the
grant which are normally exercisable between three and 10 years from the date of grant. The maximum exercise value of the ordinary shares
subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and £100,000. The exercise of options under the
scheme is subject to performance criteria broadly requiring an increase in Group operating profits of at least 20% between the year prior to
the date of the grant and its third or any succeeding anniversary. The scheme is equity-settled.

necessary service requirements have been met. The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of £250 each month for a fixed
period of three years. Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are
exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract. The exercise of options under this
scheme is only subject to service conditions and is equity-settled.

introduced. The awards are free share-based awards, with non-market vesting conditions attached, that accrue the value of dividends over
the vesting period.

76 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009 28 Contingent liabilities
In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) issued a Statement of Objections to a number of grocery retailers and milk producers,
alleging collusion in the setting of prices for certain dairy products in 2002 and 2003. Morrisons was accused in relation to one infringement
in 2002, and has vigorously denied this. Based on the evidence put forward, the Board does not consider it probable that the Company will
ultimately incur a fine and, accordingly, the Company has made no provision for any such liability.
The OFT have also raised a legal issue regarding the sale of tobacco and whether established industry practices represented a breach 
of competition law. It is likely that this can only be settled through a formal judicial process. The Board has not made a provision for 
such a liability.
29 Post-balance sheet events
The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ending 1 February 2009 of 5.0p per share which will absorb an
estimated £131m of shareholders’ funds. Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, it will be paid on 10 June 2009 to shareholders
who are on the register of members on 8 May 2009.
A dividend reinvestment plan is available in respect of the final dividend.
The Group have entered into further commodity price contracts since the period end to reduce the Group’s exposure to pricing risk arising 
on the volatility of commodity prices purchased for the Group’s own consumption.

Performance review Strategic review Governance
Group
financial statements
Company 
financial statements Investor information Company accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These separate financial statements of Wm Morrison Supermarkets
PLC (the Company) have been prepared on a going concern basis
under the historic cost convention, except for share-based payments
and derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair
value, and pension scheme liabilities that are measured using
actuarial valuations and in accordance with applicable accounting
standards under UK GAAP and the Companies Act 1985.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the
Company’s financial statements.
Accounting reference date
The accounting period of the Company ends on the Sunday falling
between 29 January and 4 February each year.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less
provision for impairment. 
Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses. Costs include directly attributable
costs. Annual reviews are made of estimated useful lives and
material residual values.
Depreciation
The policy of the Company is to provide depreciation at rates which
are calculated to write off the cost less residual value of tangible
fixed assets on a straight line basis. The rates applied are:
Freehold land 0%
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2.5%
Short leasehold improvements Over lease period
Plant, equipment, fixtures and vehicles 14- 33%
Assets under construction 0%
Fixed assets are reviewed for indications of impairment when events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. This is performed for each income generating
unit, which in the case of a supermarket is an individual retail outlet.
If there are indications of possible impairment then a test is
performed on the asset affected to assess its recoverable amount
against carrying value. An asset impaired is written down to its
recoverable amount which is the higher of value in use or its net
realisable value. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset.
If there is indication of an increase in fair value of an asset that had
been previously impaired, then this is recognised by reversing the
impairment, but only to the extent that the recoverable amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s
balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
a) Financial assets
i) Trade and other debtors: Trade and other debtors are carried at
the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the
Company will not be able to recover balances in full, with the charge
being recognised in the profit and loss account. Balances are written
off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
ii) Cash: Cash includes cash-in-hand, cash-at-bank and bank
overdrafts together with short term, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, with an
insignificant risk of a change in value, within three months from 
the date of acquisition. In the balance sheet bank overdrafts are
presented within current liabilities.
b) Financial liabilities
Trade and other creditors: Trade and other creditors are stated 
at cost.
c) Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value,
which normally equates to cost, and are remeasured at fair value
through profit or loss.
Cash flow hedges: Derivative financial instruments are classified 
as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Company’s exposure to
variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular
risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly
probable forecasted transaction.
To minimise the risk from potential movements in commodity
prices, the Company has fuel price contracts which are designated
as cash flow hedges.
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness. Where a
derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the
variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly
probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss
on the movement in fair value of the derivative financial instrument
is recognised directly in equity through the Statement of recognised
gains and losses (STRGL).
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately
recognised in the profit and loss account within cost of sales. 
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the
recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative
gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified
into the profit and loss account when the transaction occurs.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the Company’s profit and loss
account on an accruals basis except for interest costs that are directly
attributable to the construction of buildings which are capitalised
and included within the initial cost of a building. Capitalisation of
interest cost ceases when the property is ready for use.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Company financial statements
under UK GAAP
78 Morrisons  Annual report and financial statements 2009 Pension costs 
The Company operates defined benefit and defined contribution
schemes. The defined benefit scheme is no longer open to new
members. A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under
which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
A defined benefit scheme is one that is not a defined contribution
scheme. Pension benefits under defined benefit schemes are
defined on retirement based on age at the date of retirement, 
years of service and employee’s final compensation package.
The Company’s defined benefit retirement scheme is funded by
contributions from the Company and members. Pension scheme
assets, which are held in separate trustee administered funds, are
valued at market rates. Pension scheme obligations are measured on
a discounted present value basis using assumptions set out in note
39. The operating and financing costs of the scheme are recognised 
in the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise. 
Death-in-service costs are recognised on a straight line basis over
their vesting period. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised
immediately in the statement of recognised gains and losses.
A liability or asset is recognised in the balance sheet in respect 
of the Company’s net obligations to the scheme and is stated 
net of deferred tax.
The Company also operates a stakeholder pension scheme and
contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they arise.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
exchange at the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currency are retranslated at the rates of exchange at the balance
sheet date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included 
in the profit and loss account for the period.
Provisions
Provisions are created where the Company has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable
that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits to settle the
obligation from the Company, and where it can be reliably measured.
The nature of these provisions are:
a) Property provisions: Provisions made in respect of individual
properties where there are obligations for onerous contracts,
dilapidations and certain decommissioning obligations for petrol
filling stations. The amounts provided are based on the Company’s
best estimate of the likely committed outflow to the Company. 
Where material, these estimated outflows are discounted to net
present value.
b) Restructuring provisions: Provisions are established for
announced and ongoing restructuring programmes planned and
controlled by management where there is an obligation to make
changes to the scope of the business undertaken by the Company 
or the manner in which business is conducted. The provision
includes costs of severance to the affected employees, costs of
property closure, and other direct expenditures not associated 
with ongoing activities.
Leases
Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases; all other
leases are classified as finance leases.
Lessor accounting – operating leases
Assets acquired and held for use under operating leases are
recorded as fixed assets and are depreciated on a straight line basis
to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Operating lease income is recognised on a straight line basis to the
date of the next rent review.
Lessee accounting – operating leases
Rental payments are taken to the profit and loss account on 
a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Deferred and current taxation
Current tax payable is based on the taxable profit for the year using
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Taxable profit differs from the profit as reported in the profit and
loss account as it is adjusted both for items that will never be
taxable or deductible and timing differences.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences between the
accounting and tax cost bases that result in an obligation at the
balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a
future date. Deferred tax is calculated based on tax law enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is provided at
rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is more likely
than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not discounted.
Stocks
Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis and comprises
purchase price, import duties and other non-recoverable taxes, 
less rebates. Stocks are primarily goods for resale.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain
employees in exchange for services rendered by them. The fair value
of the share-based award is calculated at the date of grant and is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period with a
corresponding increase in equity. This is based on the Company’s
estimate of share options that will eventually vest. This takes into
account movement of non-market conditions, being service
conditions and financial performance, if relevant. The fair value 
of equity-settled awards granted is not subsequently revisited.
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial stochastic model. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The cost of the share-based award relating to each subsidiary is
calculated, based on an appropriate apportionment, at the date of
grant and recharged through an intercompany account. The charge
to reserves is retained within the Company’s retained earnings.

financial statements
Company 
financial statements Investor information Financial contracts
Where the Company enters into financial contracts to guarantee 
the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for
them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes
probable that the Company will be required to make a payment
under the guarantee.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company has purchased its own equity share capital, the
consideration paid, including directly attributable incremental costs, 
is deducted from retained earnings until the shares are cancelled. 
On cancellation, the nominal value of the shares is deducted from
share capital and the amount is transferred to the capital 
redemption reserve.
Exemptions
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from
preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Cash Flow
Statement and exemption from the disclosure requirements of FRS

and financial instruments disclosures are included in the

financial statements Investor information 39 Pensions
a) Defined benefit pension scheme
The Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate
trustee administered fund. The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at 6 April 2007 and were updated for FRS 17 purposes for the
periods to 1 February 2009 by a qualified independent actuary.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 2 February 2009 is £25m (2008: £50m).
b) Assumptions
The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the scheme’s liabilities were as follows:
2009 2008 2007
Rate of increases in salaries 4.75-5.75% 5.00-6.00% 4.25-5.45%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.50% 3.75% 3.20%
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.25% 5.75% 5.00%
Inflation assumption 3.50% 3.75% 3.20%
i) Longevity
The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows:
2009 2008 2007
Male 23.5 23.5 19.9
Female 25.8 25.8 22.8
The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows:
2009 2008 2007
Male 22.2 22.2 19.9
Female 24.7 24.7 22.8
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice in accordance with published statistics. The current mortality
table used is PNX00 YOB LC (2008: PNX00 YOB LC).
The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the scheme’s assets, were as follows:
2009 2008 2007
Long term rate of return on:
Equities 7.00% 7.00% 7.00%
Bonds 6.00% 6.00% 5.00%
Property 6.00% 6.00% 6.00%
Cash 2.50% 5.50% 5.25%
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the
timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
c) Valuations
The fair value of the scheme’s assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before
they are realised, and the present value of the scheme’s liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are
inherently uncertain, were as follows:

The expected return on scheme’s assets was determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current
investment policy. Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date. Expected
returns on equity and property investments reflect long term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.

During the period, Morrisons entered into an agreement with the Co-operative Group to acquire over half a million square feet of additional
selling space through the purchase of a number of Co-operative Group and former Somerfield stores, at a cost of £223m. A deposit of £22m
was paid during the year and has been classified within debtors. 
The completion is dependent on obtaining certain approvals and the transaction and associated payments are expected to complete in the
next financial year.

46 Contingent liabilities
The Company has given an unlimited guarantee in respect of the overdraft of all the subsidiary undertakings. At 1 February 2009, there 
was a credit balance of £0.5m including uncleared banking items (2008: £0.4m).
The Company has also provided a guarantee in respect of Sterling and Euro Bonds, amounting to £784m (2008: £758m) in respect of 
a subsidiary undertaking.
Where the Company enters into financial contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other Companies within its Group, the Company
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract 
as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) issued a Statement of Objections to a number of grocery retailers and milk producers,
alleging collusion in the setting of prices for certain dairy products in 2002 and 2003. Morrisons was accused in relation to one infringement
in 2002, and has vigorously denied this. Based on the evidence put forward, the Board does not consider it probable that the Company will
ultimately incur a fine and, accordingly, has made no provision for any such liability. 
The OFT have also raised a legal issue regarding the sale of tobacco and whether established industry practices represented a breach 
of competition law. It is likely that this can only be settled through a formal judicial process. The Board has not made a provision for 
such a liability.
47 Post-balance sheet events
The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ending 1 February 2009 of 5.0p per share which will absorb 
an estimated £131m of shareholders’ funds. Subject to approval at the AGM, it will be paid on 10 June 2009 to shareholders who are on the
register of members on 8 May 2009.
A dividend reinvestment plan is available in respect of the final dividend.
The Company has entered into further commodity price contracts since the year end to reduce the Company’s exposure to pricing risk arising
on the volatility of commodity prices purchased for the Company’s own consumption.

The effect of our business on the environment is something that

Shareholders receive notification of the availability of the results 
to view on the Group’s website, www.morrisons.co.uk, unless 
they have elected to receive a printed version of the results. 
The full Annual report is available for viewing or downloading 
from the corporate website www.morrisons.co.uk
Shareholders are encouraged to view the report on the website
which is exactly the same as the printed version, but using the
internet has clear advantages such as lowering costs and reducing
the environmental impact.
b) Carbon offset
The Annual report and financial statements, the Annual review and
summary financial statement and the Corporate social responsibility
report have been assessed with the assistance of the Carbon Trust
for the amount of carbon emissions that will be generated in their
preparation, printing and delivery. To offset these carbon emissions
a donation has been made to PURE, The Clean Planet Trust, the first
UK registered charity dedicated to combating climate change by
offsetting. More information about PURE can be found on their
website, www.puretrust.org.uk

burgers and sausage rolls in our meat processing plant.
We supply direct to stores
We have 12 distribution centres and our own transport fleet working
around the clock to deliver the freshest food to our stores.

Chairman’s message
Sir Ian Gibson
In my first annual statement as Chairman, I am pleased that we are reporting
another year of good progress for Morrisons. These are challenging times for
the UK economy, but whilst we are not complacent, we are confident that
Morrisons offer meets and is in tune with the demands of our customers and 
the economic background. 
Results
Profit before tax was £655m compared with £612m last year. This included £2m of
property gains, compared with £32m last year. Underlying basic earnings per share
(EPS) increased by 16% to 16.7p, whilst statutory basic EPS decreased by 16% 
due to an abnormally low tax charge last year. The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 5.0p per share, to bring the total for the year to 5.8p – an increase of
21%. At this level, the dividend is covered 2.9 times, and we will continue our
progressive policy of increasing the dividend by underlying earnings and additionally
moving dividend cover toward the average for our sector, which is around 2.5 times,
by January 2010.
Cash generation was strong – with cash from operations of £964m, a year-on-year
increase of £208m, or 28%. The Group’s pace of investment picked up, with capital
expenditure in the year increasing to £678m following the opening of nine new
stores and the acquisition of the freehold of our new distribution centre at
Sittingbourne, in Kent. Additionally, we completed the planned second instalment
payment into our defined benefit pension schemes of £100m and bought back 
58 million shares in the market for £146m, an average share price of 251p. Following
these investments, net debt increased from £543m to £642m. As previously reported,
new five year term debt facilities of £1.1bn were agreed in September 2007, and
only £250m of this facility was drawn at the year end, leaving gearing at 14%.
Industry recognition
Morrisons success in the past year has been recognised with numerous industry
awards, including Retailer of the Year from Retail Week, The Grocer of the Year 
from The Grocer and Supermarket of the Year at the Retail Industry Awards. This 
is welcome recognition of the terrific efforts of all our 124,000 employees, and 
on behalf of the Board I want to express our thanks for their dedication, hard work 
and professionalism. I am pleased that our growth in the year will provide a profit 
share pool for them of £34m, a 13% increase on the previous year.
Charitable donations
Our colleagues across the business are always enthusiastic supporters of our
charitable activities. Our own nominated charity of the year was Protecting Generations
for Generations, a partnership between Help the Aged and Childline, and we were
delighted to support them with funding of over £930,000 during the year.
Outlook
Your Board views both the short and the long term outlook for Morrisons positively.
The business is well on track to achieve its goal of being the food specialist for
everyone, and the Executive team continues to see opportunities to invest in the
business for further growth. We expect to open c.350,000 square feet of new retail
space in the coming year, on top of c.500,000 square feet that we have agreed to
acquire from the Co-operative Group, reflecting our confidence in the attractions 
of Morrisons core grocery business.
In the current economic environment we expect the competitive landscape to 
be extremely challenging. However, the Group’s balance sheet is strong, and our
financing arrangements are prudent. We will remain focused on delivering freshness
and value to our customers.
This was another year of good
progress for Morrisons as we
continued to grow sales, 
profits and dividends, whilst 
also investing to generate 
future growth.

value appeals to shoppers

”
Strategy update
Our three year strategy is to position the business as the UK’s ‘food specialist for
everyone’. This builds on our historic strengths of value and fresh food quality, now
applied to a national, bigger business following the Safeway acquisition in 2004. 
As a food specialist, we are clearly differentiated from our larger competitors, all of
whom are seeking to expand their non-food credentials. We also emphasise our deep
understanding of food: through being closer to source than other retailers, through
our unique manufacturing and packing facilities, through the amount of food
preparation undertaken in our stores and through the employment of more specialist
butchers, fishmongers and bakers than our competitors. We stress that our offer is
for everyone, because our great food is also always great value.
Our strategy builds on our strengths, and is in tune with our customers’ need for
excellent value and their increasing focus on the health, provenance, quality and
freshness of the food they buy. In order to deliver our strategy, we have previously
outlined the building blocks that need to be put in place, and our plans to do this 
by 2010. These are described in the Optimisation Plan progress section below. 
Store estate development
From our position as the fourth largest grocery retailer in the UK, we see significant
opportunities to expand our store estate. Our offer works well in a wide range of
store sizes, giving us flexibility in site selection and there are many parts of the
country where we remain under-represented. A key part of our strategy, therefore,
has been to grow the number of Morrisons stores. Our acquisition of Co-operative/
Somerfield stores, completing in the coming year, will contribute to this, and we are
confident that we will open a further 0.5m square feet of retail space in the year to
January 2011.
Solid shareholder investment and returns 
The Group is securely financed and has a strong balance sheet. We are confident 
that our planned investment requirements can be met from existing facilities. We
will continue to pursue a prudent approach to financial management which is based
on a number of principles:
• we wish to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet;
• operational control of our retail stores is fundamental to us;
• we are a prudent organisation and we structure our finances accordingly; and
• our defined benefit pension schemes’ assets and liabilities are effectively part 
of our balance sheet, and should be managed as such.
The Board concluded in March 2008 that surplus capital of £1bn should be returned
to shareholders during 2008 and 2009, with £500m of that to be delivered in the
first 12 months of the programme. Whilst £146m was returned in 2008 through
share buybacks, the Board also identified new investment opportunities for the
Group, over and above our original plans. The Board believes these growth
opportunities represent a more attractive deployment of capital than the planned
share buyback. The Board also believes that further investment opportunities may
arise in the medium term and has therefore decided that the capital originally
earmarked for share buybacks in the 2009/10 financial year should be retained
within the business to give Morrisons maximum financial flexibility.
We have targeted progressive dividend growth in 2008 and 2009, over and above
earnings growth, in order to bring dividend cover to a level in line with the average
for our sector, which is around 2.5 times, by January 2010. Funding for this
enhanced return to shareholders will come from operating cash flow and committed
facilities which are available to the Group.
“ 4 Morrisons  Annual review 2009
Chief Executive’s review continued
Operating review of the year
2008/09 was another good year for Morrisons – we made sure that we offered our
customers great value every day, in a rapidly deteriorating economy, whilst still
investing for the long term future of the business.
New retail space
We opened nine new stores in the year, of which two were former Co-operative/
Somerfield stores that we acquired and converted to Morrisons. We saw very
significant uplifts in sales compared to those achieved under their former ownerships,
and as a result we were pleased, later in the year, to agree the acquisition of a further
tranche of stores from the Co-operative/Somerfield that we will open in 2009/10.
We continued our programme of store extensions, with 90,000 square feet added 
in the year, and ended the year with 382 stores and a total of 11.1m square feet of
retail space, growth of 2.7% on the start of the year.
Sales and market share growth
We were pleased with our stores sales growth, which was industry leading and broad
based. Like-for-like sales, the measure of growth in existing stores, increased by
7.9% with customer numbers up 4.2% and average basket spend up 3.6%.
Based on TNS market research data, we believe our grocery market share grew from
12.1% to 12.3% in the year. Geographically, we grew in all regions, with the South
particularly strong as the Morrisons brand continued to become better known.
Across our store estate, we grew in all sizes of stores, with smaller stores below
25,000 square feet leading the way. Our market research shows that we won
customers from all major competitors in the year. 
In-store, our Market Street ranges did well, responding to our strong emphasis on
fresh food preparation. 
We continued to profile our unique food production capabilities, in our factories and
in Market Street, and our understanding of food provenance. Our broad appeal and
community involvement was well illustrated by our new schools initiative, ‘Let’s
Grow’, which is designed to help schools teach children how to grow food.

Key Performance Indicators
The Value range saw 50% growth,
reflecting the very difficult economic
environment experienced by consumers
throughout the year. Whilst we
maintained our focus on the quality,
healthiness and provenance of our food,
we also delivered a year of innovative
value offers to our customers. We
launched over 21,000 price cuts
throughout the year, and designed our
promotions to help customers save money
while eating well. Our £4 meal deals
proved very popular, and we switched
more of our promotions into ‘half price’
rather than ‘buy one, get one free’ in
response to customers’ need to spend 
less each week. We helped customers 
to treat themselves too, with great 
value deals such as 2 for 1 offers on party
foods, the Mamma Mia DVD for £7 and a
range of games for Nintendo Wii at £10. 
In the run-up to Christmas, we rewarded
our most loyal customers with a £20
shopping voucher through the Collector
Card scheme.
Industry leading offer
(%) Operating results
Turnover grew by £1.5bn to £14.5bn, a 12% increase. Part of this increase (c.3%)
was due to the very high prices of fuel seen in our forecourts business in the year
caused by the worldwide spike in oil prices, and this will unwind again in the coming
year as pump prices have come back down. Our forecourts business grew strongly 
in the year. As fuel prices moved above £1 per litre, consumers became highly price
conscious and shopped around for value. We made sure that our pricing was always
highly competitive, and indeed led the market back down below the key £1 price
point when oil prices again began to fall. 
Gross profit grew in line with the level of turnover growth. The gross profit margin 
of 6.3% was level with the previous year, although lower than it would have been
due to the dilutive effect of high fuel sales, which have a very low margin. Offsetting
this was the release of a provision first taken in 2005/06 relating to the rationalisation
of our distribution infrastructure. Adjusting for these two effects, our gross profit
increased by 0.1% despite the headwind effect of high energy costs in our stores and
supply chain. We successfully mitigated these costs through continued delivery of
our Optimisation Plan.
The Group’s two biggest costs, after cost of goods sold, are store wages and
distribution costs. After a number of years of strong improvement in store labour
productivity, the year under review saw us investing in customer service to support 
our sales growth. Despite this, labour costs as a proportion of sales improved by 
0.5%. The cost to deliver each case through our distribution network continued to fall,
despite higher fuel costs, with a further reduction of 2.5% year-on-year. We gained
good benefits from new systems that improved the efficiency of our delivery schedules.
Our administrative expenses were up by 5%, below the rate of the turnover increase,
reflecting tight control of our overheads. Marketing costs, which account for over
one-third of administrative expenses, increased in line with turnover, as we continued
to seek, with success, to articulate the Morrisons story to a wider audience.
Our advertising campaigns built on the previous year’s success, with a continuation
of the ‘Fresh Choice for You’ message placing emphasis on freshness, in-store
production, in-season food and our food provenance knowledge. To balance the
‘Fresh’ message, we launched a high impact ‘Price Crunch’ campaign in April, which
ran through the rest of the year and was used to highlight our great value offers and
everyday prices.
Optimisation Plan progress
Our Optimisation Plan, originally communicated in 2007, set out a number of
programmes designed to deliver by our financial year ending January 2010, and 
we remain well on track. 
Progress in each of these areas is outlined below.
Refreshed and rebranded stores
Customers visiting Morrisons today experience a modern and unique food specialist,
following the successful completion of the programme to freshen-up our stores and
brand. The programme covered the exterior and interior signage of the stores, our
Market Street counters, our trucks and our filling stations. Alongside the physical
work, all staff were fitted with uniforms carrying the new brand and over 3,000 
own-brand Morrison products received new packaging. 
Range extension and product innovation
Our product ranges, too, have been extensively reinvigorated. Range development
has been particularly strong in ‘Value’ lines but value and freshness are not
incompatible, as seen in the launch of our innovative ‘Fresh Ideas’ ready-to-cook
fresh meals, which offer a great value alternative to dining out.

Chief Executive’s review continued
Manufacturing facilities
Our control of the fresh food supply chain, through our bakeries, fruit and vegetable
packing facilities, meat and cheese processing plant and abattoirs gives us great
flexibility to respond to changing customer needs and priorities. The value conscious
behaviour that came to the fore in 2008 provided us with the opportunity to use this
flexibility to great effect. By being close to the source of supply, our fresh meat and
fish quality cannot be matched even by much more expensive competitors.
Distribution network investment
We continued to invest in our infrastructure as part of our Optimisation Plan. 
The new distribution centre at Sittingbourne, in Kent, is well underway. We took the
opportunity to acquire the freehold of the site during the year, at a cost of £80m, in
order to ensure maximum flexibility for the future. We were pleased to open our new
abattoir at Spalding during the summer of 2008, and it is already producing at high
volumes and very good levels of efficiency. 
In-store efficiency initiatives and replacement of our systems
We continue to invest in ways to improve customer service whilst also becoming
more efficient in our stores. Following a successful trial, self-scan checkouts are now
rolling-out to over half our stores. 
The Group’s major programme of systems renewal continued to make good progress
during the year. The implementation programme began in late 2008 with the pilot
phase of our new human resources and payroll system, which will go fully live during
2009. The coming year will see the implementation of financial systems, depot
systems and the start of the roll-out of the new point of sale systems into stores. 
In 2010 we will begin to replace systems in our manufacturing facilities, throughout
the supply chain and the product masterfile.
Long term growth
The overall investment requirements for the Optimisation Plan, outlined last year,
are £450m over and above the normal run-rate of capital investment, and the
programme will run to January 2010. In 2008, £182m of this was invested, bringing
the cumulative total to £250m.
Alongside the Optimisation Plan, our new space programme laid out a target of
opening an additional 1m square feet of retail space in the three years to January
2010. We are well on course to achieve that through our normal pipeline of new
stores and store extensions but, over and above this target, the acquisition of smaller
Co-operative and Somerfield stores, which will complete in 2009, will add around 
a further 0.5m square feet to our estate to bring the total at 31 January 2010 to
approximately 12m square feet.
We believe that delivery of 
our strategy of expansion and
further optimisation of the
operation of the business has
resulted in strongly improved
profit margins for our
shareholders, whilst also
positioning the Group for 
long term growth.
”
“
Much of our investment, whilst improving 
the business, has also improved our carbon
emissions. In the past two years we have
invested £66m in new, efficient refrigeration
capacity in our stores and £18m in new trucks
and trailers. A similar programme to replace 
all our petrol pumps with new, low emission 
technology, is well advanced. As a result of these
and other initiatives, our target to reduce our
carbon footprint by 36% from 2005 levels has
been achieved one year early. We are delighted
to be the only grocery retailer to have been
awarded the new Carbon Trust Standard for
carbon reduction.
Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives
Our aim is to become the 
‘Food Specialist for Everyone’, 
and that means:
Food specialist
We really understand food:
• we know where it comes from
• we pack it and make it in our factories
• we make it in our stores
• we employ craft skills in every store
For everyone
Great food which is also:
• great value
• for every day, not just special days. www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreview09

At Morrisons, we’re passionate about supporting British farmers. We’re the
only top supermarket in the UK selling beef, lamb and pork that is 100%
British sourced. This year we have extended our commitment to British
farmers by ensuring that all our own-brand fresh milk is sourced locally. 
We have also introduced a producer group to develop closer links with dairy
farmers with the aim of reducing costs for them and to help share and
increase knowledge and understanding across our supply chain.This year, we
were awarded the Multiple Retailer of the Year 2008 award at the ‘re:fresh
Awards’ acknowledging our long running relationship with British producers
and our efforts to source local and seasonal produce wherever possible.
Morrisons fresh food offer is unique among the major supermarkets. We care deeply about
food: its provenance, its freshness, its quality and its cost. We are closer to the source of the
food we sell than any other retailer, nurturing direct relationships with farmers, and running 
our own factories, production facilities and distribution network.
Our unique ‘Market Street’ offering features trained professionals making and preparing food
throughout the day, every day. We offer more freshly prepared food than any other retailer
because we have more people preparing food in-store than any other supermarket. 
Let’s Grow
In September we launched our Let’s Grow scheme 
to get children excited about growing and eating 
fresh food. 
The scheme helped schools capture the imagination
of children and show them that food doesn’t just
come from supermarkets. It gave the children an
opportunity to grow their own fruit and vegetables in
the school grounds whilst providing the kids with inspiration to follow a healthier lifestyle. Let’s Grow
vouchers were collected in-store by our customers and redeemed by the schools for brand new
gardening equipment including seeds, spades and greenhouses. 
In November, celebrity gardener Diarmuid Gavin visited schools with the help of a number of
community gardeners to talk to the children about growing produce. With over 18,000 schools taking
part in the 2008 scheme, we will continue to help educate the younger generation in our 2009 scheme.
100% committed to British
Market Street – Greengrocer
We want our customers to be able to buy the freshest fruit
and vegetables any time they want, whether it’s first thing 
in the morning or just before the store shuts. We achieve 
this by keeping a consistently high standard in the produce
department of Market Street. 
We present our fresh fruit and vegetables in a slightly
different way, for example, we hang up all bunches of bananas
to ensure they don’t get bruised, and arrange melons in shies
to keep them from being damaged. The way in which the fruit
and vegetables are presented is taken very seriously with the
aim of retaining freshness.

We offer quality and freshness at a price people like. The industry appreciates this too, and 
we have been awarded Retailer of the Y ear for the second year running, and commended both
for our strength on fresh produce and competitive stance on price. 
We can deliver these achievements because our unique business model and in-store food
preparation means that we can provide great value for money across all our ranges. 
Value product range relaunched
Carrier bags 
usage reduced
Target exceeded!
We set a target to reduce plastic carrier
bag usage by 25% by the end of 2008.
We achieved a 32% reduction, the
equivalent to 505 million bags, exceeding
our target by 7%. In May 2008, and again
in December, we urged our customers 
to help reduce single use carrier bags 
by giving a free reusable carrier bag to
every shopper. On each occasion we 
gave away 10m reusable bags (one for
each of our customers), made from 100%
recycled material and larger than standard
bags. We encouraged our customers to
use the reusable bags on every shop. 
In 2008, we also introduced a new
reusable wine carrier made of 100%
recycled PET bottles. 
All our own label ranges have shown growth in the year, none more so than our Value range, which 
following a relaunch has grown by 50%. With over 300 everyday essentials like bread, baked beans, soup 
and bacon all in simple, yellow and white packaging, the Value range is an easy way to reduce the cost 
of our customers’ weekly shop.
Closer to source for
better value and quality
What makes Morrisons different from other
supermarkets is that we control our supply chain. 
By ‘cutting out the middleman’ we can keep costs 
lower and deliver good value to our customers.
Our control of the fresh food supply chain gives us great
flexibility to respond to changing customer needs and
priorities. This flexibility means we can lead the industry
with great value and fresh food. 
Our abattoir and butchery operations are designed to
use the whole animal, with minimal food waste. We have
a long heritage of selling lower priced cuts of meat such
as brisket and neck fillet, which make delicious meals at
bargain prices. These cuts are once again popular, and
we are best placed to provide such variety and value.
Equally, by being close to the source of supply, our fresh
meat and fish quality cannot be matched even by more
expensive competitors.

We are famous for great service and our friendly employees are experts in their trade. 
We aim to always have the products our customers want, available at all times of the day.
Service
Our customers 
tell us about the
great service they
have received
“There can be no better
trained staff than those at
your Derby store. Nothing
is too much trouble for
these workers, from 
shelf-fillers to upper

informative, considerate,
and a pleasure to talk to.”

Surveys tell us that our customers appreciate the service they get at our stores and that it 
is better than the service they receive at other supermarkets. Our employees are skilled and
knowledgeable in their trade and they give our customers what they want – fresh food served
by helpful, friendly, well-trained people. With our commitment to great selling and service we
aim to get it right for our customers every time. 
Great service is also about making the products available so our customers can get the things
they want when they visit our stores. By having our own distribution network, we can ensure
the right products are always available when our customers need them. 
Leading the way in
availability
The Fresh Food Academy 
Launched in 2009, the
Academy will help increase
the quality, value and 
service we provide to our
customers. Over the coming
year, as part of its store
expansion, Morrisons will
create 5,000 new jobs. The
jobs will be created across
the business in a variety of
departments including butchery, fishmongery and
bakery. The Academy will play a key role in developing
people in these areas. 
The Fresh is Best programme is designed to help us
achieve our vision. Engaging and training managers 
in consistently delivering market leading availability,
product presentation and quality, preparing the freshest
product, maintaining standards, reducing wastage and
giving great selling and service. By demonstrating what
‘good and fresh’ is, we help managers to maintain and
improve standards. It establishes our core operational
basics as well as putting our values into action in a
way that impacts the customer. So far we have run
116 courses training 2,338 managers.
We were proud to win all three major industry titles 
in the same year

Retail Week
We are the only retailer to have won this prestigious award 
for two consecutive years, being commended for the use 
of imaginative and extensive marketing to highlight our
traditional strengths in fresh produce and our competitive
stance on price.
Our in-house distribution network
allows us to cater to our customers’
needs in quick time, ensuring availability
is strong. For instance, on Christmas 
Eve our customers could still buy fresh
bread and Brussels sprouts up to 4pm 
in our stores. Our vertical integration
means we have security of supply 
into our stores, unlike some of our
competitors. It also delivers speed 
and flexibility by bringing in new lines
in response to changing customer
demands. We can do this because 
we are in control of our supply chain.

As a food specialist, we are different from our larger competitors. We emphasise our deep
understanding of food, through being closer to source, through our unique manufacturing,
packing and distribution facilities, and through the amount of food preparation in our stores.
Our business model
Closer to source
Our buyers deal directly
with producers, whilst
other retailers may deal
through wholesalers. 
We operate ‘whole 
crop purchasing’ which
gives the producer a 
fairer deal and provides 
good value and good
quality to our customers. www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreview09

From

all our 
stores.
Being closer to source means we can
better control the provenance and
quality of our food. Ethical and
sustainable sourcing is important 
to us and we work with the producers
to develop a relationship that is
reasonable and fair to all parties.
We own all our manufacturing
facilities, which means we reduce our
supply chain lead times allowing us to
maximise the freshness in-store and
reduce waste and costs. The vast
majority of our fresh food is prepared
by our production plants providing us
with security of supply. 
We own and operate a very modern
transport fleet, ensuring freshness 
and cost control. We believe we 
have the quickest turnaround time
between order and delivery compared
to any other supermarket. 
Because we prepare food in-store, 
we can react to customer trends
throughout the day, only producing
what the customer wants. This reduces
waste, makes us price efficient and
keeps our costs low to the customer.
What makes Morrisons different from other supermarkets is that we control our supply chain – 
we are closer to source by ‘cutting out the middleman’. The advantages of this business model are: 
• our customers get great value for money and fresh food at great prices; and 
• we can react earlier to consumer trends and bring seasonal food in-store quicker than 
other supermarkets. 16 Morrisons  Annual review 2009
Meet the experts around ‘Market
Street’, where our customers will find
fresh food prepared by our expertly
trained staff. We pride ourselves on
providing our customers with fresh
food just the way they like it.
In Market Street we have more people
preparing food than any other retailer
and we employ more specialist
butchers, fishmongers and bakers 
than our competitors.
At Morrisons fish counters around the country, our 800
fully trained fishmongers can prepare more than 50 kinds
of the highest quality fish and they can answer any
questions on choosing or cooking fish. All our fish is from
sustainable sources and we only sell fresh fish from our
counter which has never been frozen. 
Our Deli staff prepare a wide range of products fresh
throughout the day and can cut as much or as little as the
customer wants. They can help our customers select the
perfect cheeses for their cheeseboard and then prepare it
fresh straightaway.
Our Fresh To Go staff make a great range of sandwiches,
pizzas and salads throughout each and every day. We only
sell our in-store produced sandwiches on the day they are
made to give the freshest possible product. Our pizzas
are freshly prepared in-store using the finest ingredients
and carefully topped by hand. www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreview09
17
Our crusty bread and soft roll ranges are made from
scratch in-store, every day. We have 2,000 bakers trained
in baking craft skills. We bake 127 different kinds of
bread, all on the premises and our recently introduced
‘Bakers table’ ensures our customers have a different
artisan offering every month.
The Oven Baked department offers the largest selection
of British whole chicken and chicken portions available,
which are cooked fresh throughout the day. We also bake
in-store the widest range of savoury pies to suit all tastes.
Our cake experts hand finish our cakes with freshly
whipped cream ensuring our customers purchase cakes 
at their very best. They can produce, at customer request,
one of our cakes within minutes. The layout of our Cake
shop enables our skills to be viewed by our customers. 
Morrisons has over 1,500 trained butchers in-store who
cut and prepare over 120 different cuts of British beef,
pork, lamb, and poultry each day. 
Our butchers can cut steaks, joints, or chops to customer
requirements for that special meal. 18 Morrisons  Annual review 2009
Summary financial statement
The Summary financial statement on pages 23 to 24, the
Summary Directors’ remuneration report on pages 19 to 22 
and the Summary corporate governance report below, are
summaries of the information contained in the Annual report
and financial statements 2009.
The aim of the Annual review is to provide shareholders with 
the key financial information in a clear and concise manner.
Therefore the Annual review and Summary financial statement
does not contain sufficient information to allow as full an
understanding of the results of the Group, its state of affairs 
or the policies and arrangements concerning Directors’
remuneration, as is provided in the Annual report and financial
statements. Copies of the Annual report and financial
statements may be obtained free of charge from the Company
as noted in the Investor information section at the back of 
this report.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the Group is the operation of retail
supermarket stores and associated activities.
Result and dividend
The profit for the period after tax amounted to £460m (2008:
£554m). The Directors propose to pay a final dividend for the 
period of 5.0p on 10 June 2009 to shareholders who are on the
register of members on 8 May 2009, making a total dividend of
5.8p (2008: 4.8p).

General information
Summary corporate governance report
Auditors 
The auditors have reported on the full Annual report and
financial statements. Their report was unqualified and did not
include a reference to any matters to which the auditors drew
attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report,
and did not contain a statement under section 235(3), section
237(2) or section 273(3) Companies Act 1985.
The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no
relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware
and that each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors and 
to authorise the Directors to set their remuneration is to be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM).
Annual General Meeting
Notice of the 2009 AGM of the Company (to be held at the
Company’s Head Office at Gain lane in Bradford on 4 June
2009) is sent to shareholders. Shareholders will also receive
notification of the availability of the results to view on the
Group’s website, unless they have elected to receive a printed
version of the results. The Directors believe each of the
resolutions to be proposed at the AGM is in the best interests 
of the Group and recommend shareholders to vote in favour 
of each of them.
Throughout 2008/09, the Group has complied with the
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code and
applied its principles with the exceptions that at the beginning
of the year, the Board did not comprise at least half Non-
Executive Directors and the Audit Committee did not have a
member with recent relevant financial experience. With the
retirements of Sir Ken Morrison and Roger Owen in the past year
plus the recruitment of Philip Cox as a Non-Executive Director
from April 2009, the Board will comprise of a majority of
independent Non-Executive Directors; Philip Cox will also
provide recent and relevant financial experience.
The Group implemented revised whistle-blowing procedures
during February 2008 following the year end; therefore the
procedures did not exist throughout the whole period.
A report explaining our governance policies and practices is
given in the Annual report. The full terms of reference of the

Remuneration policy 
The Company’s remuneration policies are designed to encourage
a strong performance culture and emphasise long-term
shareholder value creation, with clear links between executive
performance goals and business strategy. The reward structure
should enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate 
the best talent who have been and will continue to be key to 
the Company’s recent success and future performance by
positioning base salaries around the mid-market and operating
annual and long-term incentives, so that a substantial proportion
of total remuneration is subject to performance and so that
executives are aligned with shareholders through share
ownership. The chart below demonstrates the balance between
fixed and performance-related pay for the Chief Executive at
target and maximum performance levels.
Base salary and benefits
During the year, base salaries were reviewed in the light of
benchmark data, internal relativities and personal performance.
The factors used for this review are detailed in the full Directors’
remuneration report.
Current base salary rates for the financial year, together with the
previous year’s salaries, are set out below:
2009/10 2008/09
Marc Bolland £850,000 £757,050

Mark Gunter £540,750 £540,750
Richard Pennycook £540,750 £519,120
Martyn Jones £450,000 £425,000
1 £850,000 effective from 1 August 2008. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the increases
shown above were necessary to enable the Company to pay
competitive base salaries and are reasonable in the context 
of the Directors’ total remuneration packages.
Benefits include health insurance, transport costs and 
telephone expenses.

Annual bonus 
The Remuneration Committee operated an annual bonus plan
for Executive Directors and other senior managers during
2008/09. The maximum bonus was 100% of base salary, with
measurement based upon profit before taxation (excluding
exceptionals) and personal objectives, as set out below:
Measures % of bonus potential 
Profit before tax, excluding exceptionals 80%
Personal objectives 20%
No bonus was payable for the achievement of personal
objectives unless the minimum profit targets had been achieved.
Details of the actual amounts paid for 2008/09 are set out in
the Directors’ emoluments table on page 21.
For the 2009/10 annual bonus plan, maximum bonus potential
will remain at 100% of base salary. In addition to profit before
tax (excluding exceptionals) and personal objectives, strategic
corporate scorecard measures structured around financial
objectives, operational excellence, customers and employees
have been introduced, as set out below:
Measures % of bonus potential 
Profit before tax, excluding exceptionals 65%
Strategic corporate scorecard measures 20%
Personal objectives 15%
No bonus will be payable for the achievement of strategic
corporate scorecard measures or personal objectives unless the
minimum profit target has been achieved.
Long T erm Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), approved by shareholders 
in 2007, is designed to reward management for achieving the
Group’s strategic objectives and to provide an appropriate level
of long-term performance pay. Each year, participants receive
conditional awards of shares in the Group which will normally
vest three years after they are awarded, subject to the
satisfaction of performance conditions measured over a three-
year period and continued service. The plan’s individual annual
limit is 300% of salary (face value of shares). In 2008, awards
were made at the 300% level to Marc Bolland and at the 200%
level to the other Executive Directors. The current intention is
that Marc Bolland’s future award levels from April 2009 will
revert back to 250%. Performance measures are 75% based on
earnings per share and 25% based on like-for-like non-fuel sales
growth. These performance metrics were selected for the
following reasons:
• they are directly linked to the objectives set out in the Group’s
strategy – improving EPS and sales performance reflects the
need for basic profit growth and should flow through to
increased shareholder value;
• there is a clear line of sight between performance and reward;
• they are relatively easy to understand and communicate. 20 Morrisons  Annual review 2009
Summary Directors’ remuneration report continued
No awards can vest under the sales targets unless the threshold
EPS target has been met. 
For the awards intended to be granted in April 2009, details 
of the three-year EPS and sales targets are set out below.
25% of the EPS related component of the award will vest if the
Group’s Underlying EPS grows in line with the growth in the
Retail Prices Index plus an average of 4% per annum, rising on 
a pro rata basis until 100% vests for outperforming the Index 
by at least 10% per annum. Underlying EPS will be as defined 
in the notes to the financial statements. 
In light of food price unpredictability, the Remuneration
Committee reviewed the best way of measuring sales growth
and has made a revision to ensure that performance continues
to be measured in a robust way. Instead of setting absolute 
like-for-like sales growth targets, the Remuneration Committee
considers that it is preferable to measure the Group’s like-for-
like grocery sales growth against the Institute of Grocery
Distribution (IGD) Index, which measures market growth in 
like-for-like sales (excluding fuel). This independently audited
index, which includes all of the Company’s major competitors, 
is considered to be the most reliable method of measuring
market growth.
25% of the sales growth related component of the award will
vest if the Group’s like-for-like sales matches the IGD Index,
rising on a pro rata basis until 100% vests for outperforming 
the Index by at least 2% over the three years ending with the
2011/12 financial year. Like-for-like sales is defined as the
reported sales from existing space (excluding VAT), less total 
fuel sales. As has been the previous practice, no part of the
award relating to sales growth can vest unless the minimum 
EPS target is achieved.
Share ownership guidelines
The Group operates share ownership guidelines for Executive
Directors. Under the guidelines, Directors are expected to retain
50% of vested LTIP awards (net of tax) until such time as they
own shares worth 100% of their salary after which point they
will be expected to retain, as a minimum, this level of holding.
Pension arrangements 
The Executive Directors, with the exception of Marc Bolland,
participate in the Group’s Defined Benefit Pension Scheme.
Pension entitlements accrue at the rate of 1/30th for each year,
with a maximum pension of 2/3rds pensionable salary at age
62. For members joining after 31 May 1989, final pensionable
pay is the lower of the average of the highest three years
pensionable pay in the Directors’ last 10 years of employment
and the maximum earnings limit which in 2008/09 is £117,600. 
Mark Gunter, Richard Pennycook, and Martyn Jones, who were
all subject to the earnings cap in place before April 2006 which
has been retained for benefits accruing thereafter, received a
cash supplement of 10% of salary in excess of the cap in
2008/09. Following a review of this provision against the
market, it was determined that the salary supplement should be
increased from 10% to 15% for 2009/10 onwards. Marc Bolland
is not in the pension scheme but instead receives a salary
supplement of 30% of salary which will remain unchanged.
On 25th February 2009 the Group commenced consultation
with all active members of the Group’s two defined benefit
schemes. The proposals change the basis of pensions from final
salary to career average revalued earnings.
Executive Directors contracts
All Executive Directors have a service agreement without expiry
dates. These contracts can be terminated by either the Group 
or Director giving 12 months’ notice.
The Remuneration Committee has in place a model contract
which provides that any compensation provisions for
termination without notice will only extend to 12 months 
of salary, benefits and pension (which may be payable in
instalments and subject to mitigation). Going forward, all new
Director contracts will be on that basis. The model contract does
not contain change of control provisions. This policy was applied
to Marc Bolland at the time of his recruitment and to Mark
Gunter and Martyn Jones from 2007. Richard Pennycook’s
contract provides that he has an obligation to mitigate his loss 
in the event of termination in breach of contract.
All Executive Directors have rolling contracts with a 12-month
notice period.
Roger Owen tendered his resignation on 18 October 2007 and
left the business on 1 February 2009. On the basis that full
notice was served, there was no termination payment made in
relation to his contract. Roger Owen participated in the Annual
Bonus Plan for 2008/09 and received an award under the LTIP in
April 2008. Consistent with best practice, the two sets of LTIP
awards granted to Roger Owen will continue to vest three years
from the relevant grant date, subject to the satisfaction of
performance conditions, with amounts pro-rated to reflect the
period of time between the grant date and the leaving date.
Non-Executive Directors contracts
Brian Flanagan, Paul Manduca, Susan Murray and Nigel
Robertson were appointed for a three-year period from their
original dates of appointment in 2005. Following the expiry 
of this initial period, each has been reappointed for a further 
three-year term, unless otherwise terminated earlier by, and at
the discretion of, either party upon one month’s written notice.
Following the retirement of Sir Kenneth Morrison as Chairman
on 13 March 2008, Sir Ian Gibson was appointed as Non-
Executive Chairman. Sir Ian Gibson was appointed to the Board
for a three-year period from 1 September 2007 unless otherwise
terminated earlier by, and at the discretion of, either party upon
12 months’ written notice. www.morrisons.co.uk/annualreview09

3 Underlying earnings
The adjustments made to reported profit are:
(a) remove potential income statement volatility within net pension interest;
(b) remove profits arising on property transactions since these profits do not form part of the Group’s principal activities; and
(c) normalise the tax charge as required. 
In the current period, we have used the actual tax charge as the difference between the actual tax charge and a normalised charge is not
significant. In the prior period an effective tax rate of 32% was applied, being an estimated normalised tax rate, since the prior period’s
effective tax rate was considerably lower than the prevailing rate.

Morrisons website
Shareholders are encouraged to visit our website,

corporate and investor. 
Environmental matters
The effect of our business on the environment is something that
Morrisons takes very seriously. In the production of the Annual
report and financial statements 2009, we have contributed to
the reduction in environmental damage in the following ways:
a) Website
Morrison shareholders receive a printed copy of the Annual
review and summary financial statement. The full Annual report
is available for viewing or downloading from the corporate
website, www.morrisons.co.uk
Shareholders are encouraged to view the report on the website
which is exactly the same as the printed version, but using the
internet has clear advantages such as lowering costs and
reducing the environmental impact.
b) Carbon offset
The Annual report and financial statements, the Annual review
and summary financial statement and the Corporate Social
Responsibility report have been assessed with the assistance of
the Carbon Trust for the amount of carbon emissions that will
be generated in their preparation, printing and delivery. To
offset these carbon emissions a donation has been made to
PURE, The Clean Planet Trust, the first UK registered charity
dedicated to combating climate change by offsetting. More
information about PURE can be found on their website,
www.puretrust.org.uk
Further information about other ways in which the Group 
is helping with environmental change can be found in the
Corporate Social Responsibility report 2008/09 which can be
viewed on the Morrisons website.

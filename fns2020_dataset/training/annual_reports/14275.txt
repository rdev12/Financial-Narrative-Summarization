Strategic report
1
To focus the business on 
commercialising
fewer, larger assets and developing single brand  
names globally, whilst reducing the number of  
non-core products
2
To push aggressively into  
emerging markets
with global partners who can provide muscle to help  
us achieve rapid growth
3
To reduce spend on general overheads 
and in-house product development and to increase 
expenditure on commercialising and developing our global 
brands, supported by line extensions, to increase the 
breadth and penetration of these brands
4
To drive profits from the operating 
leverage 
provided by our high quality sales platform by increasing 
sales volumes and identifying compatible product 
acquisitions and licensing opportunities
Chairman’s statement
This was achieved despite currency 
headwinds and the hesitant post economic 
crisis recovery within our core European 
markets which restricted LFL growth to 
4%.
We continue to pursue the core elements of 
a strategy outlined upon the arrival of Chris 
Spooner as Chief Executive Officer four 
years ago:
The consistent prioritisation of these 
strategic goals has resulted in steadily 
increasing profitability in recent years. In 
particular, improving operating leverage has 
resulted in a strong increase in our adjusted 
EBITDA margin, up to 16% from 13% last 
year and 1 1% in 201 1/12. We expect to 
continue to improve margins in the current 
year and beyond. The fixed costs of a high 
quality, fully integrated pan European sales 
force are significant, but as major new 
products are added to the platform a 
significant part of the incremental gross 
margin falls to the bottom line. In 2013/14 
the most important contributor to our 
improved EBITDA margin was the first full 
year of Sculptra
®
.
During the year the Board reviewed a 
number of opportunities to exploit our 
platform further. We concluded that the 
fastest growing part of our business is 
aesthetics, where we came into the last 
financial year with a capable well trained 
sales force but lacking critical mass in 
product offering. Aesthetics is a higher 
growth segment than our traditional derma 
markets and minimally invasive, medicinal 
quality aesthetics is a natural adjunct to our 
existing high quality derma franchise.
Your Company again delivered a result in line with 
Board and City expectations, albeit with a slightly 
greater than expected second half weighting, with 
sales up by 15% to £63.6m and adjusted EBITDA 
up by 39% to £10.0m.
Grahame Cook
Chairman Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
07
We decided during the year to seize this 
opportunity and we were delighted to  
be able to persuade the owners and 
management of three very exciting and 
innovative aesthetics companies that 
Sinclair’s distribution platform would 
provide the most effective and dynamic 
way for their products rapidly to reach a 
global market. 
In January 2014 we completed the 
acquisition of Obvieline SAS (Perfectha
®
); 
followed in March 2014 by AQTIS Medical 
BV (Ellansé™); and in May 2014 by 
Silhouette Lift SL. Three differentiated, fast 
growing aesthetics companies which now 
give us the ability to create a unique and 
compelling patent lifecycle approach to 
non-invasive facial rejuvenation. The 
majority of dermal filler procedures in our 
key territories involve the use of hyaluronic 
acid (‘HA’) gel, and as a differentiated 
biphasic HA the Perfectha
®
 range 
addresses this demand. Ellansé™ 
(resorbable PCL microspheres) is a unique 
next-generation collagen stimulator and 
Silhouette
®
 is the only cone-on-suture lift/
volumiser in the industry.
All three acquired companies have now 
been integrated into the global operations 
of Sinclair. They contributed an aggregate 
of nearly £6.0m of sales in their  
respective post acquisition periods and  
we expect them to be significant profit 
contributors in the coming year. Ellansé™ 
and Perfectha
®
 use a distributor-only 
model with 90% of sales in emerging 
markets; we expect to capture higher 
margins on higher sales using our direct 
sales forces in Europe.
We believe in a ‘mixed’ dermatology 
model; in our view, Sinclair’s heritage and 
pharmaceutical standards in medicinal 
dermatology have been a key success 
factor in quickly creating a trusted 
reputation in a less-regulated aesthetics 
industry. Commercially however, a higher 
proportion of aesthetics sales have 
buoyed Sinclair’s move into higher 
growth, non-reimbursable products 
where we and our distribution partners 
can be price-setters with beneficial 
effects on our gross margin. 
We paid particular care to the structuring 
and financing of these transactions to limit 
dilution and manage risk. We raised 
£59.5m of debt through a new five year 
debt facility and £20.0m of equity during 
the year in order to finance the acquisitions. 
Sinclair ended the year with net debt of 
£40.2m – a multiple of 2.8x pro-forma 
EBITDA, and below expectations set at the 
time of the placing. A significant part of the 
consideration for each acquisition will only 
be paid upon the achievement of specific 
milestones. This will make the majority of 
stage payments self-financing and means 
that each acquisition has been earnings 
accretive from the date of acquisition.
The Company’s move to focus our portfolio 
has continued with the disposals of 
Effederm, Xclair, Salinum and SST. 
Subsequently, Cryogesic has been sold for 
£1.1m and further disposals are anticipated 
in FY15. We also remain alert for partnering 
and co-marketing opportunities, 
increasingly with fewer, larger partners and 
we are in particular, currently focusing on 
developing an appropriate strategy for the 
US, where opportunities for a number of 
our products are significant. We have 
announced the appointment to the Board of 
Jeff Thompson as a Non-executive Director 
who has many years’ experience of US 
dermatology markets gained through his 
time at Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. where he 
was Chief Operating Officer at the time  
it was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline plc  
for $2.9 billion. 
Your Company is now better placed than at 
any time in its history to increase revenues 
and profits substantially and we are 
confident about the current year. We have 
made three highly promising acquisitions 
during the year and now have six global 
brands with significant potential. We remain 
in the early stages of a comprehensive 
multi-country, multi-product strategy which 
we believe will deliver significant value  
for shareholders. I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support.

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review
“ Three game-changing acquisitions during FY14 have transformed 
Sinclair. With approximately half its revenue derived from aesthetics 
and international, Sinclair is recognised both as a leader in facial 
rejuvenation and a presence in emerging dermatology markets.  
We expect revenue and profitability to accelerate this year driven  
by demand for our innovative products and supplemented by  
new product registrations and the potential to consolidate  
recently acquired distribution agreements”.
Sinclair generated £10.0m adjusted 
EBITDA
1
 for FY14 on sales of £63.6m. 
Like-for-like (‘LFL ’) revenues (excluding 
product disposals, one-off license income 
and currency fluctuations) grew by 4.4% 
with strong H2 LFL growth of 13.1% after 
the 7.5% LFL decline in H1. EBITDA was at 
the upper end of expectations after a strong 
performance in aesthetics further helped by 
better than expected initial contributions 
from the three aesthetic brands, Perfectha
®
, 
Ellansé™ and Silhouette
®
 all acquired 
during the second half. 
The creation of a highly differentiated, fast 
growing aesthetics portfolio enabled 
Sinclair to make important strategic and 
operational advances during the year, and 
aesthetics in FY14 represented one third of 
Group revenues. The rapid expansion of the 
Group’s aesthetic business in high volume 
growth markets and the ability to set price 
continues to drive operating margins with 
73% of revenues in the year from private 
pay products (2013: 62%). This combined 
with Sinclair’s fully integrated pan European 
structure resulted in increased operating 
leverage and a fifth successive increase in 
EBITDA margin
2
 to 16% during the financial 
year. 
Aesthetics and acquisitions 
Sinclair’s aesthetics strategy is centred on 
facial rejuvenation through collagen 
stimulation products which have amongst 
the highest growth rates in the dermal filler 
sector and so far account for around 10% 
of procedures in Sinclair’s key markets. HA 
fillers currently dominate the market and the 
acquisition of the Perfectha
®
 range of HA 
fillers in January 2014 was the first of three 
significant new brands added to Sinclair’s 
aesthetic portfolio in FY14, providing critical 
mass for the Group in aesthetics. 
Perfectha
®
 contributed revenues of £3.9m 
in the second half, compared with £2.4m 
for H2 FY13 pre-acquisition and was ahead 
of management expectations. 
Ellansé™ and Silhouette
®
, both next-
generation collagen stimulators, 
complement Sculptra
®
 and strongly 
enhance Sinclair’s competitive position in 
the global aesthetics market. Ellansé™, 
which provides immediate volumisation,  
and Silhouette
®
 a unique patented product 
giving an instant facelift have continued 
their recent rapid growth in emerging 
markets, particularly Asia, with Ellansé™ 
contributing £1.3m to Group revenues in its 
first three months and Silhouette
®
 £0.8m 
since it was acquired in May. Sculptra
®
 
made good progress during the year with 
LFL sales growth of 1 1% as a result of the 
extensive doctor training programme which 
continued throughout the year.

The integration of Perfectha
®
, Ellansé™ and 
Silhouette
®
 was completed quickly and 
necessitated a number of organisational 
changes to reflect the increasing scale  
of the Group’s activities. In addition 
improvements have already been made to 
optimise manufacturing processes and 
reduce costs. Both Perfectha
®
 and 
Ellansé™ distribution has been taken 
in-house across Europe together with 
Silhouette
®
 in the UK. Silhouette
®
 Russian 
rights are expected to be acquired in Q4 
2014 in-line with initial guidance. Multiple 
new hires across Sinclair’s pan European 
sales force preceded intensive pre-launch 
technical sales training on the new brands. 
Sinclair has created a very significant 
commercial opportunity in aesthetics,  
in particular its dominant position in the 
future of facial rejuvenation through 
collagen stimulation, and as a result  
it is the focus of the Group’s marketing 
resource. The Board has ambitions  
to create direct affiliates in leading 
aesthetic markets, notably Korea, the  
US and potentially Brazil. Contractual 
rights in Korea will likely facilitate such  
a move during FY15, while the timing  
of any US move will be dictated by 
regulatory timelines. 
The Group continues its policy of focusing 
its portfolio on a smaller number of 
dermatology brands. Disposals of Effederm 
and Xclair were made during the year for 
aggregate consideration of £1.0m, in 
excess of a 2x sales multiple.
Development 
Sinclair’s development strategy is to focus 
on line extensions and the geographical 
development of its existing brands. The 
acquisitions of Ellansé™ and Silhouette 
during the year provide significant scope in 
the US. Silhouette Lift
®
 is already approved 
in the US and it is hoped that Silhouette 
Instalift
®
 will be approved relatively quickly 
via a 510K submission to the FDA made in 
July 2014. US clinical trials for Ellansé™ are 
expected to commence in 2015, whilst in 
Europe Ellansé™ and Perfectha
®
 lidocaine 
formulations are timetabled for submission 
in Q2 2015. 
Flammacerium
®
 was granted orphan drug 
designation in March 2014 by the US FDA 
for the treatment of patients with severe 
dermal burns. Sinclair is optimistic to 
receive US approval in an accelerated 
timeframe as a result of the large body of 
existing clinical data. US approval would  
be expected to provide material upside to 
Sinclair’s earnings in future. 
Atlean
®
 is a combined collagen stimulator 
and HA filler for the treatment of the lower 
face and was acquired from GSK during 
the period. It has been off-market for 
around two years and re-registration is 
slated for Q2 2015. 
The development of Aloclair Ultra
®
, 
potentially the first twice-per-day mouth 
ulcer treatment is complete, with launch 
targeted for Q2 2015. 
Outlook 
Operational objectives for this year are 
focused on revenue and profit delivery. In 
Europe, the build-out of dedicated aesthetic 
sales and marketing operations is complete 
alongside the introduction of new sales 
force incentive schemes and intensive 
physician training programmes. Aesthetic 
brands are expected to make up over  
50% of Sinclair’s revenues in FY15 with 
significant growth anticipated in all regions. 
Sinclair has enjoyed a strong start to FY15 
with a step-up in growth and profitability 
driven by both the acquired brands and 
operating leverage.

Review of operations
Country operations – revenue
(2013: £34.9m)
(2013: £12.3m)
£12.9m
France – revenue
£38.0m
A major improvement in LFL sales over the previous year in France 
and the UK, which together account for 60% of Western European 
revenues, was due to the growing importance of Sinclair’s distinctive 
aesthetics portfolio. 
Aesthetics accounted for over 40% of international sales in FY14 and 
this share is set to increase markedly over the next financial year as a 
result of the recent acquisitions.
Sinclair’s aesthetic portfolio now provides 
the core products for our operations.  
The Board and executive management 
continue to monitor performance on a 
regional basis with segments split into 
Country Operations (consisting of  
the Group’s direct sales capability in the  
top five EU markets) and International 
Operations where the Group sells 
through local distributors.
Country Operations
A major improvement in LFL sales over the 
previous year in France and the UK, which 
together account for 60% of Western 
European revenues, was due to the 
growing importance of Sinclair’s distinctive 
aesthetics portfolio. Aesthetics revenues 
grew over 80% in FY14 with the 
acquisitions during the year of Perfectha
®
, 
Ellansé™ and Silhouette
®
, and represented 
30% of Country Operations revenues. 
Problems with a distributor in Spain were 
solved and continued weakness in 
non-core products in Germany both 
masked the effect of the continued growth 
of Sculptra
®
 and encouraging launches of 
the acquired aesthetic brands.
France
The move to focus the Group’s marketing 
and sales strategy on aesthetics resulted 
in a 3% LFL sales improvement in France 
during the period against an 8% decline 
the previous year and despite the 
lacklustre French economy. Launches of 
Perfectha
®
 and Ellansé™ took place in  
H2 and it is intended to bring sales of 
Silhouette
®
 in-house during H1 FY15.

UK
UK operations returned to growth in FY14 
(+5% LFL) with Sculptra
®
 increasing sales 
by 13% LFL. The UK sales force was 
significantly improved by the addition of  
six experienced specialist aesthetic sales 
people. Full adoption of the Keogh report 
guidelines on doctor training generated 107 
Sculptra
®
 training workshops around the 
UK in the period. Sculptra
®
 will continue to 
be actively marketed alongside the three 
new aesthetic brands in FY15.
Perfectha
®
 was successfully launched in 
March 2014 initially targeting larger HA  
filler users in major clinics, with excellent 
feedback on range and ease of use from 
aesthetic doctors. Ellansé™ and Silhouette
®
 
were brought in-house from their existing 
distributors and re-launched just prior to the 
end of the financial year.
Variquel
®
 (+50% LFL) recovered from the 
threat of generic competition in the previous 
year and the launch of a pre-mixed solution 
led to a successful tender outcome with 
similar opportunities in FY15.
Germany
Sculptra
®
 sales reached £1.0m (+23% 
LFL) after a successful programme of 
training workshops for aesthetic doctors and 
dermatologists in the major German cities. 
Both sales and marketing teams were further 
improved with the addition of a number of 
key hires from major competitors. As a result 
both Perfectha
®
 and Ellansé™ were brought 
in-house and successfully launched prior to 
year end. Silhouette
®
 sales will continue to 
be managed by its established distributor in 
the immediate future.
Sculptra
®
 success was offset by continued 
weakness in non-core products, mainly 
Haemopressin (-12% LFL) due to ongoing 
price pressures in the German market.
Italy
Italy grew strongly in FY14 with sales of 
Kelo-cote
®
, Sculptra
®
 and Atopiclair
®
  
all ahead of expectations. The Group’s 
co-marketing deal for Atopiclair
®
 with 
Menarini resulted in sales of over £0.4m  
in the first nine months post launch. 
Additionally, Menarini will co-market 
Kelo-cote
®
 from this autumn and it is 
anticipated that its growth rate will 
accelerate as a result of Menarini’s 
significant Italian presence.
Silhouette
®
 is notably successful in Italy  
and marketed by Technolux. Going forward, 
Sinclair has elected to use Technolux to 
market the full Sinclair aesthetics portfolio  
in this territory. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Spain
Partnered OTC sales of Kelo-cote

, 
Flammazine
®
 and Bio-Taches
®
 were 
significantly below budget. This 
necessitated a change of distributor and 
strategy during the year with Flamma 
Spray
®
 particularly hard hit.
The disappointment in OTC revenues 
masked a strong performance from 
Sculptra
®
 where sales grew by 9% LFL to 
£1.5m following 75 training workshops held 
across Spain during the financial year. Both 
Perfectha

 and Ellansé™ are recognised 
brands in Spain and responded well to 
launches by Sinclair’s seven strong 
in-house sales team.
International Operations
In 201 1 Sinclair announced a target for 
International Operations to make up 40% of 
Group revenues, against 28% at that time. 
This target was met in 2014 and reflects the 
success of the Group’s strategy particularly 
in emerging markets. Aesthetics accounted 
for over 40% of international sales in FY14 
and this share is set to increase markedly 
over the next financial year as a result of the 
recent acquisitions.
APAC
Revenues from the APAC region grew 70% 
in H2 FY14 more than offsetting a 19% 
decline in H1. This was principally due to 
the resolution of various short-term factors 
affecting the Kelo franchise and in particular 
Glyderm
®
 (Kelo-stretch
®
). Glyderm
®
 sales 
for the full year were up 80% LFL to over 
£2.0m benefiting from launches in 
Singapore, Philippines and Vietnam. 
Kelo-cote
®
 sales made a good start in 
Japan after launch and ConBio, its Chinese 
distributor, increased marketing resource 
post negotiations to raise prices in China. 
Against a backdrop of strong dermatology 
growth, Atopiclair
®
 (+44% LFL) and 
Papulex
®
 (+39% LFL) continued to gain 
market share across the region.
Japan and Korea represent the Asia 
region’s second and third largest facial 
injectables market (by number of 
procedures), and Sinclair’s unique aesthetic 
portfolio is well placed to compete within 
these dynamic markets. Sinclair has 
recently strengthened its APAC 
management team based in Singapore, 
building on the successful relationship with 
Menarini in medicinal dermatology and 
extending it to several new distributors for 
Perfectha
®
, Ellansé™ and Silhouette
®
 
including Daewoong Pharmaceuticals in 
South Korea.

Financial review
In FY14 the Group continued its recent trend of increasing 
revenues and EBITDA margin with a very strong second half 
performance. EBITDA margin for the year improved further to 16% 
with the benefit of a full year contribution from Sculptra
®
, continued 
growth in international operations and initial contributions from 
Obvieline, AQTIS and Silhouette
®
.
Alan Olby 
Chief Financial 
Officer
2013. The sharp decline in gross margin 
for the year is a result of product mix,  
but is expected to be a temporary dip 
predominantly caused by strong sales of 
lower margin Kelo-stretch
®
 and Atopiclair
®
 
which grew by a combined 42% to  
£5.0m. A sharp gross margin recovery  
is expected in FY15 with the share of 
aesthetic products expected to exceed 
50% (FY14: 33%) combined with 
increased margin share revenues for 
Kelo-stretch
®
 and Atopiclair
®
.
Operating expenses
Selling, marketing, and distribution costs 
declined by 1.7% to £15.0m (2013: £15.3m) 
due to foreign exchange impacts. Underlying 
spend in constant currency terms increased 
by 3% as the Group supported the build-out 
of the aesthetics commercial infrastructure 
including the re-launch of Sculptra
®
.
Administrative expenses before exceptional 
items, of £19.3m (2013: £17.1m) increased 
due to a £2.6m increase in non-cash 
charges for depreciation, amortisation  
and share-based payments.
Exceptional items
Exceptional operating charges of £3.4m 
(2013: £16.8m) have been recorded in the 
year net of profits on disposal. The key 
components of exceptional items are:
 ■ Acquisition costs of £2.6m include 
legal and professional fees relating to 
the three acquisitions which were 
completed during the year.
 ■ Restructuring and integration costs  
of £1.6m include post acquisition 
restructuring and manufacturing 
write-offs, and other restructuring 
actions undertaken in the year.
 ■ A £0.6m profit on disposal was 
recognised on the sale of Effederm  
in France.
 ■ Impairment charges of £0.4m against 
intangible assets. Development of the 
Terbinafine Spray project was ceased 
during the year resulting in a write down 
of the licence fees paid to access the 
technology.
 ■ £0.8m reversal of impairment charges 
recorded against the Cryogesic 
trademark in the prior year following the 
agreement to dispose of these assets 
for a total consideration of £1.1m.
Finance costs
Finance costs increased to £2.7m from 
£1.6m. Within this charge, cash interest 
costs on borrowings increased to £2.0m 
from £0.7m reflecting the increased 
borrowings taken on over the second half of 
the year to finance acquisitions. Finance 
charges also include a £1.9m non-cash 
charge for the discount unwind on deferred 
consideration liabilities, offset by a £1.9m 
foreign exchange gain arising from the 
retranslation of US Dollar and Euro 
denominated borrowings.
Acquisitions contributed in part to the 
Group’s financial performance for the  
year but will make a more significant 
contribution to the future results of Sinclair. 
In FY14 the Group continued its recent 
trend of increasing revenues and EBITDA 
margin with a very strong second half 
performance. EBITDA margin for the year 
improved further to 16% with the benefit of 
a full year contribution from Sculptra
®
, 
continued growth in international 
operations and initial contributions from 
Obvieline, AQTIS and Silhouette
®
. The 
Group’s key performance indicators 
monitored by the Board are set out in the 
Directors’ Report on page 24.
Revenue
Revenues grew by 14.8% to £63.6m with a 
full year contribution from Sculptra
®
 and a 
strong initial contribution from Perfectha
®
 
(Obvieline, £3.9m six months), Ellansé™ 
AQTIS (£1.3m three months) and 
Silhouette
®
 (£0.8m under two months). 
Revenues were adversely affected by the 
strength of Sterling in the final quarter of the 
year, and on a constant currency basis, 
revenues for the year would have been 
£64.4m, £0.8m higher than reported.
Gross profit
Gross profits (excluding fair value 
adjustments on acquired inventory) 
increased 6.3% to £35.9m (2013: 
£33.8m) with a gross margin of 56.5% for 
the full year compared with 61.0% for  Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

been offset by amortisation and impairment 
charges of £5.8m, exchange adjustments 
of £3.8m, transfers to assets held for sale 
and disposals of £1.1m leaving a net 
increase in intangibles of £56.4m.
Current assets
Both inventories and trade and other 
receivables have increased as a result of 
acquisitions and underlying growth in the 
year. Inventories increased to £7.6m (2013: 
£4.8m) and trade and other receivables 
increased to £29.5m (2013: £19.9m). 
Assets held for sale represent the Cryogesic 
assets which were sold immediately post 
year end on 1 July 2014 for £1.1m.
Total liabilities
Non-current liabilities have increased to 
£141.9m from £21.5m last year, as a result 
of acquisitions in the year. Non-current 
borrowings increased by £44.8m to 
£53.3m, being the non-current portion of 
the Hayfin debt facility, less capitalised 
costs associated with entering into the 
facility. Deferred consideration payable 
(other financial liabilities) of £58.0m (2013: 
£1.5m) represents the discounted present 
value of future milestones and royalties 
payable in relation to the acquisitions of 
Obvieline, AQTIS and Silhouette
®
. 
Deferred tax liabilities have increased to 
£27.0m (2013: £10.9m) as a direct result 
of the acquisitions. These deferred tax 
liabilities are linked to the fair value of 
intangible assets recognised at acquisition 
and will be amortised to the income 
statement to offset the amortisation charge 
against intangible assets over the life of the 
related intangibles.
Current liabilities also increased to 
£42.9m (2013: £24.0m) primarily as a 
result of acquisitions with an increase in 
deferred consideration of £14.1m over 
June 2013. Total deferred consideration 
(other financial liabilities) expected to be 
settled within one year of £14.6m (2013: 
£0.5m) is mainly linked to regulatory 
milestones for Silhouette
®
.
Finance costs also include the write off of 
arrangement costs of £0.6m arising on the 
early settlement of the facilities with 
Clydesdale Bank plc.
Taxation
A tax credit of £0.3m (2013: credit of 
£1.1m) has been recorded for the year. 
This consists of current corporation tax 
charges of £0.5m (2013: £0.4m) and  
net deferred tax credits of £0.8m (2013: 
credit of £1.5m). Within deferred tax,  
a £0.1m (2013: £0.5m) charge arises  
on the utilisation of brought forward 
losses resulting in a reduction in  
deferred tax assets, offset by a deferred 
tax credit of £1.0m (2013: £2.4m) linked 
to the amortisation/impairment of 
intangible assets acquired through 
business combinations.
Discontinued operations
A loss on discontinued operations of £1.2m 
was recorded for the year (2013: £1.5m). 
This represents the final costs associated 
with the closure of the Group’s in-house 
manufacturing facility at Cléry, France which 
ceased production at the end of June 2013.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic EPS of increased by 28.6% 
to 0.9p from 0.7p in 2013. Basic loss per 
share reduced to 1.2p (2013: loss 4.1p) as 
a result of significantly reduced exceptional 
charges. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated 
after adjusting for exceptional items, losses 
from discontinued operations, amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and related deferred 
tax credits.
Cash flow and net debt
A £4.4m cash outflow from operations 
(FY13 inflow of £2.6m) was caused by 
£2.9m final cash closure costs associated 
with the Group’s former Cléry 
manufacturing facility, which ceased 
production in June 2013. These costs have 
now all been met with no impact on future 
cash flows anticipated. Cash flow from 
continuing activities was £4.9m lower than 
in 2013 as a result of increases in working 
capital and exceptional acquisition and 
restructuring costs.
In January 2014, the Group entered into a 
new senior secured debt facility agreement 
with Hayfin Capital Management Group 
(‘Hayfin’) in order to finance the acquisition 
of Obvieline SAS. As part of this re-
financing, the Group’s existing debt with 
Clydesdale Bank plc was repaid in full.  
The new debt facility was subsequently 
extended on two occasions as part of the 
acquisitions of AQTIS and Silhouette
®
.  
Total drawings under the facility amounted 
to £59.5m with £1 1.9m used to settle 
outstanding debt and the balance used to 
fund acquisition payments and associated 
costs of acquisition. The Group also raised 
£20.0m in new equity during the year  
in order to part fund the acquisition of 
Silhouette
®
 with remaining proceeds 
retained to fund future milestones relating  
to regulatory approvals for Silhouette
®
.
At 30 June 2014, cash and cash 
equivalents were £17.5m (2013: £5.1m) 
with net debt of £40.2m (2013: net debt of 
£6.9m). On a pro forma basis (including 
EBITDA from acquisitions for the full year) 
this equates to 2.8x EBITDA, below 
projections of 3.1x at the time of the 
Silhouette
®
 acquisition.
Balance sheet
Non-current assets
Non-current assets increased significantly 
to £246.9m at 30 June 2014 (2013: 
£126.2m) as a result of the acquisitions of 
Obvieline, AQTIS and Silhouette
®
. The 
acquisitions have resulted in gross 
additions to goodwill of £69.0m which are 
offset by foreign exchange adjustments of 
£5.1m and disposals of £0.1m leaving a net 
increase in goodwill of £63.8m. Additions 
to intangible assets, primarily resulting from 
the acquisitions were £67.1m. These have  Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Strategic Report
Sinclair IS Pharma plc is a business that 
depends on product revenues generated 
through its own sales force and marketing 
operations and marketing partners to achieve 
a successful pipeline to build future 
revenues. The Group’s performance and 
future prospects may be affected by risks 
and uncertainties relating to our business 
environment. Our internal controls include a 
risk management process to identify key 
risks and, where possible, manage those 
risks through systems and processes and by 
implementing specific mitigation strategies.
The most significant identified risks that 
could materially affect the Group’s ability to 
achieve its financial and operating 
objectives are summarised below.
Risk associated with commercialised 
success of products
The Group’s revenues are, and will be, 
principally from sales of its products. There 
can be no assurance that current product 
revenues can be maintained or increased in 
the future. Product sales may be affected 
by adverse market conditions or other 
factors including: pricing pressures from 
governments or other authorities, 
competition from other products, the 
withdrawal of a product because of a 
regulatory or other reason, or the financial 
or commercial failure of a marketing  
partner. The Company spreads risk by 
commercialising its products throughout 
the global markets. The Company maintains 
adequate insurance to mitigate the risks 
associated with product recall. 
Interruption to product supply
The Group relies on third-party 
manufacturers for the supply of the majority 
its products. Problems at manufacturers’ 
facilities may lead to delays and disruptions 
in the supply chain which could have 
significant negative impact on the Group. 
The Group maintains a close dialogue  
with key suppliers and rigorously monitors 
inventory levels and customer demand  
to ensure that any interruption to product 
supply can be managed, and back up 
sources of supply are maintained  
where possible. 
Product liability risk
The Group’s products may produce 
unanticipated adverse side effects that may 
hinder their marketability. Sinclair maintains 
product liability insurance and operates 
quality systems relating to the manufacture 
of its products and a pharmacovigilance 
system to monitor safety of its marketed 
products.
Competition and intellectual  
property risk
The position of Sinclair’s products in  
the market is dependent on its ability  
to obtain and maintain patent and/or 
trademark protection for its products, 
preserve its trade secrets, defend and 
enforce its rights against infringement and 
operate without infringing the proprietary 
or intellectual property rights of third 
parties. The validity and enforceability of 
patents and/or trademarks may involve 
complex legal and factual issues resulting 
in uncertainty as to the extent of the 
protection provided. The Group’s 
intellectual property may become  
invalid or expire before or during 
commercialisation of the product. The 
Group continuously seeks to develop its 
products to ensure they are competitive 
and monitors its intellectual property 
rights to identify and protect against  
any infringements. 
Principal risks and uncertainties Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
21
Foreign exchange risk
The Group has transactional currency 
exposures as the majority of revenues and 
expenditures, certain borrowings and 
deferred consideration liabilities are in 
Euros and US Dollars. Fluctuations in 
exchange rates between Sterling and Euro 
and US Dollars could adversely impact 
financial results. Sinclair seeks to match 
currency receipts and expenditure as far as 
possible with borrowings and deferred 
consideration liabilities denominated in the 
functional currency of the underlying 
businesses acquired. The Group may also 
engage in short-term hedging transactions 
in order to hedge against changes in 
exchange rates during the financial year.
Risk that net cash inflows may be 
insufficient to meet long-term debt 
obligations
The Group has obligations under its 
borrowing facility with Hayfin Capital 
Management Group and the acquisition 
agreements for Obvieline, AQTIS and 
Silhouette Lift to make interest payments, 
capital repayments and meet deferred 
contingent consideration liabilities, which, if 
not met, could result in default under those 
agreements, potentially triggering cross-
default under other agreements. Continued 
growth in sales of the recently acquired 
products (Perfectha
®
, Ellansé™ and 
Silhouette
®
) is key to the cash generative 
potential of the Group. While the Group 
has sufficient working capital for its present 
requirements, the ability of the Group to 
service its medium and long-term debt 
beyond 12 months is dependent on all 
factors which might affect the net cash 
generation including many of the factors  
set out in this risk section.
The Group regularly monitors its cash flow 
forecast, as well as reviewing the longer-
term plans and prospects for repaying 
borrowings and deferred contingent 
consideration liabilities. As a result of these 
reviews, potential mitigating actions are 
identified well ahead of relevant payment 
dates so that debt can be renegotiated or 
refinanced where necessary.

Corporate Governance
Directors’ Report
The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the Company and the Group, together with the audited consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2014. The strategic review of the business and the Company and its subsidiaries 
is given on pages 02 to 21. Certain information required for disclosure in this report is provided in other sections of this Annual 
Report. These include the Strategic Report, the Corporate Governance Report, the Remuneration Report and disclosures on 
financial risks included in note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, and these are, accordingly, incorporated into this 
report by reference.
Key performance indicators
The Board measures the Group’s performance according to a wide range of key performance indicators (‘KPIs’). The main KPIs 
at a Group level are as follows: 
KPI 2014 2013 Definition, method of calculation and analysis
Like-for-like 
revenue 
growth
+4.4% +4.3% Like-for-like (‘LFL’) revenues exclude product disposals, one-off licence fee income 
and currency fluctuations. LFL growth of 4.4% in the year was in line with the prior 
year performance following a strong second half and is expected to accelerate  
in FY15.
Revenue  £63.6m £55.4m Revenues grew by 14.8% to £63.6m with a full year contribution from Sculptra
®
  
and strong initial contributions from acquisitions completed in the year (Obvieline, 
£3.9m six months), AQTIS (£1.3m three months) and Silhouette
®
 (£0.8m under two 
months). Revenues were adversely affected by the strength of Sterling in the final 
quarter of the year, and on a constant currency basis, revenues for the year would 
have been £64.4m, £0.8m higher than reported.
Gross  
margin 
 56.3% 61.0% Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit after all direct costs to total revenue.
Sinclair aims to maximise gross margins for the Group. The decline in gross margin 
for the year is a result of product mix, but is expected to be a temporary dip 
predominantly caused by strong sales of lower margin Kelostretch
®
 and Atopiclair
®
 
which grew by a combined 42% to £5.0m. A recovery in gross margin is expected in 
FY15 with the share of aesthetic product revenues expected to reach 50% of Group 
sales (FY14 33%) combined with increased margin share revenues for Kelostretch
®
 
and Atopiclair
®
.
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
margin
£10.0m  
16% of 
revenue
£7.2m  
13% of 
revenue
Adjusted EBITDA is total earnings of the Group before interest income and 
expenses, tax charges and credits, depreciation, amortisation charges, share-based 
payment charges, exceptional items and loss on discontinued operations.
EBITDA was at the upper end of expectations after a strong performance in 
Aesthetics.
The rapid expansion of the Group’s aesthetic business in high volume growth 
markets, the ability to set price with 73% of revenues generated from private pay 
products, combined with Sinclair’s fully integrated pan-European structure resulted  
in an increase in EBITDA margin to 16%. Further EBITDA margin improvement is 
expected in FY15.
Results, earnings and dividends
The loss for the financial year was £5,301,000 (2013: £17,364,000). The Directors do not recommend a dividend (2013: £nil).
Going concern
The Group’s forecasts, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be 
able to operate within the level of its current debt facilities and to meet the required covenant measures. After making enquiries, 
and considering the covenants on the Group’s debt, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As a result, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing these financial statements. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company and Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
loss of the Group; 
• the Directors’ Report contained on pages 24 to 26 includes 
a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it 
faces; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess a company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors, in office at the date of this report, have 
confirmed that:
• so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
• each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This information is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board supports the ideals of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’), issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2012. This statement 
describes how the Company applies the principles of the 
Code and the Company’s compliance with the specific 
provisions of the Code. 
As a Company listed on AIM, the Company is not required  
to comply with the Code but the Board has voluntarily  
chosen to apply the provisions as if the Company were a  
fully listed company.
Board and Board Committees
The Board of Directors
The Board of the Company is responsible for the Group’s 
system of corporate governance. Throughout the year the 
Board comprised five Directors: an Executive Chief Executive 
Officer, Mr CP Spooner; a Chief Operating Officer, Mr CH 
Foucher and three Non-executive Directors including the 
Non-executive Chairman.
Mr G Cook is Non-executive Chairman and Mr J-C Tschudin  
is the Senior Independent Director.
Details of Directors’ service contracts are given in the 
Remuneration Report on page 41.
All the Directors have access to advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that 
Board procedures and applicable regulations under the 
Company’s Articles of Association or otherwise are complied 
with. Each Director is entitled, if necessary, to seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Board Meetings
The Board of Directors normally meets at least bi-monthly and 
has a defined schedule of matters reserved for its decision.  
It is responsible for the overall Group strategy, approval of 
major capital expenditure projects, and consideration of major 
financing matters of the Group. The Board held six formal 
meetings during the year. All Board members attended  
each meeting. 
Board Committees
The Board Committees, which are comprised solely of 
Non-executive Directors, operate within clearly defined terms 
of reference and report regularly to the Board. The terms of 
reference of the Board committees are available for inspection 
on the Company’s website (www.sinclairispharma.com) and at 
the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) (for 15 minutes prior to 
the meeting and during the meeting).
Audit Committee and auditors
The Audit Committee is composed entirely of independent 
Non-executive Directors and comprises Mr G Cook 
(Chairman), and Mr J-C Tschudin. The Board considers that 
the members of the Audit Committee possess recent and 
relevant financial experience. The Audit Committee has 
unrestricted access to the Group’s auditors. Meetings are  
also attended, by invitation, by the Chief Executive Officer,  
the Chief Financial Officer and representatives of the external 
auditors. The Audit Committee met three times during the year, 
and all audit committee members attended each meeting.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
During the year, and through to the approval of these financial 
statements, the Committee carried out the following reviews in 
line with its role and responsibilities:
• Reviewed and challenged with management and the 
external auditor the appropriateness of the Interim 
Statement and the Annual Report and Accounts, clarity and 
adequacy of disclosures and the material judgements made
• Reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts to ensure that 
they were fair, balanced and understandable
• Reviewed the reports produced by the external auditors 
setting out their approach for reviewing the interim and 
auditing the annual financial statements as well as their 
findings and recommendations, particularly the key audit 
areas relating to revenue recognition, acquisition 
accounting, going concern and covenant compliance and 
impairment reviews
• Reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process 
and the external auditors
• Reviewed draft regulatory news announcements in respect 
of the interim statement and annual accounts
The primary areas of judgement considered by the Committee 
in relation to the current year financial statements and how 
these were addressed are as follows:
Goodwill and intangibles impairment testing
The judgements in relation to asset impairment largely  
relate to the assumptions underlying the calculation of  
the value in use of the asset being tested for impairment, 
primarily the achievability of the long-term business plan  
and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation 
calculations. Business plans are Board approved. The 
Committee addresses these matters through discussions  
with management to review and challenge the basis for the 
assumptions which (including post-tax discount rates and 
growth assumptions) underlie the long-term business plan.  
In addition, the Committee considers the findings of the work 
of the auditors in this area.
Valuation of intangible assets created on acquisition and 
contingent consideration
Judgements in relation to the valuation of intangible assets 
recognised on acquisition, and the value of the contingent 
consideration are based on the assumptions underlying  
the forecast performance of the acquired businesses, and  
the timing of when various milestones are expected to be 
achieved. Business plans for each acquisition are approved  
by the Board at the time of each acquisition. The Committee 
addresses this matter through reviewing and challenging the 
assumptions underlying the approved business plan for each 
acquisition and also by reviewing both internal and externally 
prepared due diligence reports.  Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
29
The Group’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, provide 
non-audit services in addition to the provision of audit 
services. In the year ending 30 June 2014, non-audit services 
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP comprised advice 
with regard to taxation, remuneration matters and other 
miscellaneous services. Where appropriate the Partner 
managing the provision of non-audit services is different from 
the Partner managing audit services and as such the Board 
believes the auditors remain objective and independent.  
The Board also considers the level of fees charged by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not disproportionate or 
inappropriate to the size of the business and considers the 
Company therefore compliant with provision C3.7 of the Code 
with regard to independence and objectivity. The Audit 
Committee considers that the relationship with the Group’s 
auditors is working well and it remains satisfied with their 
effectiveness. Accordingly, it has not been considered 
necessary to perform a tender which was last performed in 
2005 when PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up entirely of 
independent Non-executive Directors and comprises Mr G 
Cook and Mr J-C Tschudin (Chairman). The Committee is 
responsible for making recommendations to the Board on 
remuneration policy for the Company’s Executive Directors 
and the terms of their service contracts, with the aim of 
ensuring that their remuneration, including awards under the 
share schemes, is based both on their own performance and 
that of the Group generally. The Remuneration Committee  
will also administer and establish performance targets for the 
share schemes and approve further grants or awards under 
them. In addition, it will advise on the remuneration policy for 
the Group’s employees. The Remuneration Committee met 
twice during the year, each meeting attended by all members.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr G Cook and 
comprises Mr RS Swanson (retired 18 September 2014) and 
Mr J-C Tschudin. The Committee is responsible to the full 
Board for determining the qualities and experience required of 
the Company’s Executive and Non-executive Directors and for 
identifying suitable candidates. The Committee is responsible 
for succession planning. Executive and Non-executive 
Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the  
first opportunity after their appointment and to re-election 
thereafter by the shareholders at least every three years. The 
Nomination Committee met during the year, all Committee 
members attended the meeting.
The Company does not impose a quota regarding gender 
balance and has not adopted a policy on diversity, although 
the Nomination Committee and Board remain fully cognisant 
of the need to ensure that the business reflects a diverse 
workforce, at all levels of seniority, when considering Board 
appointments and internal promotions, whilst always seeking 
to ensure that each post is offered strictly on merit to the best 
available candidate.
Appointments to the Board
Appointments to the Board are made on merit and against 
objective criteria. Care is taken to ensure that appointees  
have enough time to devote to the job. The Board keeps  
under review, and takes appropriate action, to ensure orderly 
succession for appointments to the Board and to senior 
management, so as to maintain an appropriate balance of  
skills and experience within the Company and on the Board. 
The Board considers the other significant commitments of 
Non-executive Directors prior to appointment, to ensure that 
they have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them,  
and keeps changes to these commitments under review. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours and at  
the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during  
the meeting).
Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Executive management, led by the 
Chief Executive Officer, are separated and clearly defined:
a. The Non-executive Chairman is responsible for leadership 
of the Board, ensuring effectiveness in all aspects of its 
role, setting the Board’s agenda and conducting Board 
meetings, and ensuring effective communication with 
shareholders and the conduct of shareholders meetings; 
and
b. Executive management are led by the Chief Executive 
Officer, who has been delegated responsibility by the 
Board for the day-to-day management of the Company 
within the control and authority framework set up by  
the Board. The levels of authority for management are 
periodically reviewed by the Board and are documented. 
The Chief Operating Officer and members of the Executive 
Management Team assist the Chief Executive Officer,  
in managing the business.
The division of responsibility between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive is clearly established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. 
Board balance and independence
The Board includes a balance of Executive and Non-executive 
Directors such that no individual or small group of individuals 
can dominate the Board’s decision taking. The size of the 
Board and balance of skills is considered appropriate for  
the requirements of the business. No one other than the 
Committee Chairman and members is entitled to be present  
at a meeting of the Audit, Nomination or Remuneration 
Committees, but others may attend at invitation of  
the Committee. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
30
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
As a smaller company, Code provision B1.2 requires the 
Company to have at least two independent Non-executive 
Directors. Mr G Cook has served on the Board for nine years. 
The Board considers that Mr G Cook, Mr J-C Tschudin,  
and Mr J S Thompson are independent for the reasons set  
out below. 
The Board has reviewed the independence of the Non-
executive Directors, including an assessment of their overall 
character and approach and concluded based on the 
following guiding principles that they are independent 
throughout the period of their appointment. They have not 
been previous employees of the Group, have no material 
business relationships with the Group, are not members of the 
Company’s pension scheme or share option schemes, have  
no close family ties with the Company’s advisors, Directors or 
senior employees, hold no cross Directorships linking them 
with the other Directors, and do not represent significant 
shareholders. All the Non-executive Directors have nominal 
shareholdings in the Company, which the Board considers 
appropriate without compromising independence. The Board 
consider that Mr G Cook remained independent even in his 
capacity as Chairman.
Information and professional development
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in  
a form and of quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its 
duties. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for ensuring 
the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information, 
which is provided by operational management and enhanced 
or clarified where necessary.
All Directors receive induction on joining the Board and the 
Chairman ensures that Directors continually update their skills 
and knowledge and familiarity with the Company required  
to undertake their role both on the Board and on Board 
committees. The Company provides the necessary resources 
for developing and updating its Directors’ knowledge and 
capabilities.
Under the direction of the Chairman, the Company Secretary’s 
responsibilities include good information flows within the 
Board and its committees and between senior management 
and Non-executive Directors, as well as facilitating induction 
and assisting with professional development as required. The 
Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, 
through the Chairman, on all governance matters and for 
ensuring that Board procedures are complied with and 
applicable rules and regulations are followed. The appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the 
Board as a whole.
The Directors have access to independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense where they judge it necessary  
to discharge their responsibilities as Directors. Committees 
are also provided with sufficient resources to undertake  
their duties. 
Announcements
All major announcements are approved by the Chairman, the 
Executive Directors and panel of senior executive management 
and then circulated to the Board prior to issue. The Group also 
has internal and external checks to guard against unauthorised 
release of information.
Performance evaluation
The Board conducts performance evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its Committees and of individual 
Directors through a process of regular dialogue and annual 
reviews. In respect of 2013–14, this was conducted by the 
Chairman holding individual discussions with each Director 
and providing regular feedback.
Re-election
All Directors are submitted for re-election at regular intervals, 
subject to continued satisfactory performance. The Board 
keeps under review the need for refreshing the Board and 
takes appropriate action.
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
AGM after their appointment and to re-election at least every 
three years. Non-executive Directors are appointed for 
specified terms subject to re-election and to Companies Act 
provisions relating to the removal of a Director.
Accountability
Financial reporting
The Board is responsible for presenting a fair, balanced  
and understandable assessment of the Company’s position 
and prospects, extending to interim reports and other  
price-sensitive public reports and reports to regulators as  
well as to information required to be presented by statutory 
requirements.
Internal control
The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, is responsible 
for regularly reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal controls. The internal control system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
assurance, and not absolute, assurance against material 
errors, losses or fraud. The Board is also responsible for 
ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to enable it to 
identify, assess and manage key risks.
The financial reporting process and control system (which 
includes the preparation of consolidated accounts) is 
monitored and maintained through the use of internal control 
frameworks which address key financial reporting risks, 
including risks arising from changes in the business or 
accounting standards. Effectiveness is assessed through 
self-certification and independent testing of the controls. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
31
The additional key procedures designed to provide an 
effective system of internal control are the:
• annual review of the control environment and procedures;
• review and update of the Group’s policy and procedures;
• review of external audit plans; 
• review of significant issues arising from the external audit; 
and
• discussions with management on risk areas identified by 
the management and the Board.
Control environment
The Group operates within a control framework developed and 
strengthened over a number of years and communicated as 
appropriate by a series of written procedures. These lay down 
accounting and financial control procedures, in addition to 
controls of a more operational nature. The key procedures that 
Directors have established with a view to providing internal 
control are as follows:
• the establishment of the organisational structure and the 
delegated responsibilities of operational management;
• the definition of authorisation limits, including matters 
reserved for the Board;
• the establishment of detailed operational budgets for each 
financial year;
• reporting and monitoring performance against budgets and 
rolling forecasts;
• the security of physical property and computer information;
• establishment and annual review of a Group wide  
insurance programme;
• detailed financial, legal and technical due-diligence  
on all acquisitions; and
• the establishment of in-house legal and human  
resource functions.
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function 
and based on advice from the Audit Committee and the 
relative size of the Group has concluded that for the time 
being it would not be appropriate to establish an internal  
audit function.
Relations with shareholders
The Directors place great importance on maintaining good 
communications with both institutional and private investors. 
The Company reports formally to shareholders twice a year 
with the publication of its Interim and Annual Reports. More 
regular communication is provided through the Company’s 
website (www.sinclairispharma.com) where all press releases 
are posted. The Executive Directors also present to 
institutional shareholders and analysts at the time of the 
interim and full year results. Feedback from these meetings is 
provided to the Board through the Company’s brokers. Mr J-C 
Tschudin, the Senior Independent Director, is available to 
shareholders if and when required. The AGM provides an 
opportunity to communicate with private and institutional 
shareholders and the Company welcomes their participation. 
Corporate social responsibility
The Group operates in the highly regulated pharmaceutical 
and medical devices sector. Hence every aspect of the 
products for which the Group owns the intellectual property 
and which are marketed or which are approved for marketing 
will have gone through an approval process overseen by  
EU, US or other national authorities to ensure their safety  
and efficacy.
The Group operates in a socially and environmentally 
responsible manner. Despite being in a relatively low-impact 
industry, the Group proactively seeks ways of reducing any 
adverse impact upon our surroundings through recycling 
schemes, making more efficient use of utilities and seeking 
ways to reduce waste. The Group adheres to relevant 
legislative, regulatory and environmental codes of practice.
Statement of compliance with the provisions of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code
As a Company listed on AIM, the Company is not required to 
comply with the Code but the Board has voluntarily chosen  
to apply the provisions as if the Company were a fully listed 
company. The Board confirms that throughout the year ended 
30 June 2014 the Company has complied with the provisions 
set out in the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code issued  
by the Financial Reporting Council, other than provision C.2.1 
(review of internal controls) where a formal review of internal 
controls has not been performed in the year due to resource 
constraints arising while negotiating and completing the three 
acquisitions completed during the year.

Remuneration Report
Part 1: Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 
2014. This report has been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) and approved by the Board. 
Although not required by a company listed on AIM, Sinclair  
IS Pharma plc (the ‘Company’) wishes where practicable  
to follow best practice disclosure for fully listed companies.  
This report has therefore been prepared with reference  
to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 
(the ‘Regulations’).
This Remuneration Report is split into two parts:
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy sets out the policy for 
2014–15 and the key factors that were taken into account  
in setting the policy. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy  
will be subject to an advisory vote at the Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) on 25 November 2014 for a period of 
three years.
• The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out payments and 
awards made to the Directors and details the link between 
Group performance and remuneration for the 2013–14 
financial year. The Annual Report on Remuneration together 
with this letter is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at 
the AGM on 25 November 2014.
Background
The Group delivered full year results in line with market 
expectations for revenue and adjusted EBITDA after a 
disappointing first half. This was achieved despite currency 
headwinds in the second half and the continuing tough 
economic environment in our core European markets. During 
the second half of the financial year, the Group completed 
three significant acquisitions creating a market leading 
aesthetics portfolio which has transformed the growth outlook 
for the Group. These acquisitions were quickly integrated into 
the Sinclair operations. 
Headlines
• The Executive Directors base salary was unchanged for 
2013–14 financial year over 2012–13. A 5% increase has 
been awarded for 2014–15;
• Base salary levels are effective from 1 July in each financial 
year. In reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors, 
the Committee has also taken account of the employment 
conditions and salary increases awarded to employees 
throughout the Group, which were on average 3.0%  
for 2013–14;
• Executive Directors earned bonuses for the 2013–14 
financial year as follows: Chris Spooner (CEO) 96.5% of 
maximum entitlement (145% of base salary); and 
Christophe Foucher (COO) 80.8% of maximum entitlement 
(113% of base salary); and
• The 2011 Sinclair Pharma Value Creation Plan has been 
relaunched from July 2014 with revised growth target of 
16% (from 20%) and with revised allocation of units to 
participants, CEO allocation reduced to 36% from 40% 
and COO allocation reduced to 22.5% from 25%; and
• Maximum annual bonus entitlements have been reduced  
for the 2014–15 financial year to 130% from 150% for  
the CEO and to 120% from 140% for the COO following 
the relaunch of the VCP.
Conclusion
I look forward to receiving your support for the resolution 
seeking approval of the Annual Report on Remuneration at  
our forthcoming AGM as well as on the Remuneration Policy 
applicable to our Directors which will apply from the 
forthcoming AGM on 25 November 2014.

Remuneration Report
Part 2: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section of the Remuneration Report contains details of 
the Group’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy that will govern 
the Group’s future remuneration payments. The policy will 
apply for three years. The policy described in this part, subject 
to approval by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 25 
November 2014, will apply from that date. The policy part will 
be displayed on the Company’s website, in the Investor 
Relations section, immediately after the 2014 AGM.
1. Remuneration policy
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors, Chairman and other senior executives for 
current and future years and this is reviewed on an annual 
basis. The remuneration policy is designed to support the 
strategic objectives of the Company and to allow the business 
to attract, retain and motivate the quality of senior 
management needed to shape and execute strategy and 
deliver shareholder value. 
The policy is designed around the following key principles:
• Ensure a strong link between reward and individual and 
Company performance to align the interests of senior 
executives with those of shareholders;
• Maintain a competitive package against businesses of a 
comparable size and comparable peer group businesses in 
the sector with reference to the breadth of the role and 
experience the role holder brings to the Company;
• Operate a consistent reward and performance philosophy 
throughout the business;
• Encourage a material, personal stake in the business and a 
long-term focus on sustained growth through long-term 
shareholding; 
• Provide a balanced package with a focus on variable pay; 
and
• Take into account the associated risks of each aspect of 
remuneration.
The Committee considers that a successful remuneration 
policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future 
changes in the Company’s business environment and in 
remuneration practice.  Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Fixed remuneration
Base salary
Core element of remuneration 
set at a level that can attract 
and retain Executive Directors 
and recognises the status and 
responsibility required to 
deliver the strategy.
Policy position: Median
An Executive Director’s base 
salary is considered by the 
Committee on their 
appointment and then 
reviewed periodically or when 
an individual changes position 
or responsibility.
Any changes normally take 
effect from 1 July each year.
The annual salaries for the 
Executive Directors for 
2014–15 are set out in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration on pages 46  
to 47.
Individuals who are recruited 
or promoted to the Board may, 
on occasion, have their 
salaries set below the targeted 
policy level until they become 
established in their role. In 
such cases subsequent 
increases in salary may be 
higher than the average  
until the target positioning  
is achieved.
None.
When making a determination 
as to the appropriate salary 
level, the Committee considers 
firstly remuneration practices 
within the Group as a whole 
and, where considered 
relevant, conducts objective 
research on companies within 
the Group’s peers.
The results of the 
benchmarking are only one of 
many factors taken into 
account by the Committee. 
Other factors include:
• the individual performance 
and experience of the 
Executive Director;
• pay and conditions for 
employees across the 
Group;
• the general performance of 
the Group; and
• the economic environment.
No recovery provisions apply 
to base salary.
Benefits
The Group provides a benefits 
package in line with standard 
market practice.
Policy position: Median
Executive Directors may 
receive a benefit package 
which includes:
• health insurance for 
themselves and their family; 
and
• other benefits as provided 
from time to time.
Benefits are reviewed 
periodically to ensure they 
remain market competitive.
No recovery provisions apply 
to benefits.

Awards may be made annually. 
The performance period is one 
financial year with pay-out 
determined by the Committee 
following the year end, based 
on achievement against a 
range of financial and  
strategic targets.
Payments are not pensionable. 
• Bonus contributions will  
be made for three years 
with payments made over 
four years.
• 50% of the value of a 
participant’s plan account 
will be paid out annually for 
three years (in the form of 
cash and/or shares as 
determined by the 
Remuneration Committee) 
with the balance carried 
over at the end of year three 
paid out at the end of year 
four (in the form of shares) 
but remaining subject to 
performance conditions.
• 50% of the unpaid balance 
of a participant’s plan 
account will be at risk of 
annual forfeiture.
The maximum annual bonus 
level for the Executive 
Directors is 150% of salary. At 
present the actual contribution 
available to the CEO is 130% 
of salary, and for the COO is 
120% of salary. 
Performance targets will be 
set by the Committee annually 
based on a range of financial 
and strategic measures, 
including but not limited to:
• Revenue;
• Gross margin;
• Adjusted EBITDA margin;
• Other strategic measures 
as set by the Remuneration 
Committee
As well as determining the 
measures and targets, the 
Committee will also determine 
the weighting of the various 
measures to ensure that  
they support the business 
strategy and objectives for  
the relevant year.
The Committee has the 
discretion to adjust weightings 
or targets for any exceptional 
events that may occur during 
the year.
The Committee is of the 
opinion that the performance 
targets for the bonus plan are 
commercially sensitive in 
respect of the Group, and that 
it would be detrimental to the 
interests of the Group to 
disclose them.

measures for 2014–15 are set

Value Creation Plan (‘VCP’)
The long-term incentive 
arrangements are structured 
so as to align the incentives of 
relevant participants with the 
long-term performance of the 
business and to motivate and 
retain key members of staff.
Policy position: Upper quartile
Executive Directors, and other 
eligible employees, are 
granted an award of 
performance units that have 
no value on grant, but which 
may convert into nil-cost 
options over shares provided 
the performance conditions 
have been achieved at five 
separate dates (known as 
Measurement Dates) over a 
five year performance period.
The overall effect of the VCP 
is that the Executive Directors 
and other participants will be 
able to earn shares equivalent 
to 15% of any total 
shareholder return created 
above pre-determined hurdle 
(Threshold Price) at the five 
Measurement Dates. 
The Measurement Date in 
each year is the date on which 
the Group’s annual results are 
announced. At each 
Measurement Date, a number 
of VCP units will convert into 
nil-cost options, equal in value 
to 15% of the value delivered 
to shareholders in excess of 
the 16% growth target.
50% of the nil cost options 
will become exercisable on the 
fifth Measurement Date, and 
the remainder will become 
exercisable on the first 
anniversary of the fifth 
Measurement Date. 
Following consultation with 
major shareholders in 2014, 
the Executive Directors were 
in July 2014 granted a number 
of performance units as set 
out in the following table:
 Percentage of total 
Executive  performance units
C Spooner 36.0%
C Foucher 22.5%
Total  58.5%
At each Measurement Date 
the Threshold Price will be the 
higher of the highest return 
achieved (Measurement Price) 
at any previous Measurement 
Date or 16% p.a. compound 
total shareholder return 
growth from the Base  
Price (37p). 
The Measurement Price at 
each Measurement Date  
will be calculated using the 
average share price over  
the 30 days following the 
announcement of the Group’s 
financial results for the 
relevant financial year plus  
the dividends paid per share.
Participants will be able to 
earn shares equivalent to  
15% of any total shareholder 
return created above the 
Threshold Price at each 
Measurement Date.
Note that if shareholders  
do not receive the 16% p.a. 
return in a performance year, 
the VCP will not pay out for 
that performance period.
The original VCP was 
approved by shareholders at  
a general meeting in January 
2011, and the recent 
amendments have been made 
in consultation with major 
shareholders.

Shareholding requirement
To ensure that Executive 
Directors’ interests are aligned 
with those of shareholders 
over a longer time horizon.
The Committee operates a 
system of shareholding 
guidelines to encourage 
long-term share ownership by 
the Executive Directors.
Executive Directors are 
encouraged to retain, as 
shares, all of the after-tax profit 
on the gains made on the 
vesting of share awards, until 
they have acquired the 
necessary shares to meet their 
requirement.
100% of salary. The 
Committee has discretion to 
increase the shareholding 
requirement.
Not applicable.
All Employee Plans
To encourage wide employee 
share ownership and thereby 
align employees’ interests with 
shareholders.
Currently the Company  
does not operate any All 
Employee Plans.
However, the Company retains 
the discretion to introduce 
such plans, and to make 
Directors eligible for these  
as appropriate.
3. Notes to the Executive Directors’ future policy table
3.1. Performance measures and targets
1. Rationale for the annual bonus plan
The annual bonus plan measures were selected as the Committee believes they provide direct alignment with the short-term 
operational targets of the Group. The deferral element of the 2013 Bonus Plan is designed to retain and motivate employees over 
the medium term.
The Committee is of the opinion that the performance targets are commercially sensitive and that prospective disclosure would 
not be in the shareholders’ interests. Except in circumstances where elements remain commercially sensitive, actual targets, 
performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully 
assess the basis for any payouts.
2. Rationale for the Sinclair Pharma 2011 Value Creation Plan
The Committee feels that the VCP is an appropriate incentive as it satisfies the following criteria:
• There is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the pay out for the Executive Directors;
• The greater the return to shareholders, the greater the pay-out to participants;
• Value creation is a measure that is comprehensively understood by the Executive Directors and other key management 
personnel and is something they have a direct line of sight over;
• Participants only derive value from the VCP where significant value is generated for the shareholders; and
• A number of shareholders expect at least some element of market-based measure in an equity incentive package for the 
Executive Directors.
Pay-out under the VCP is capped. This ensures that participants do not share in a disproportionate amount of the value created 
for shareholders.
3.2. Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational 
and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders. In addition, the Committee has the discretion 
to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, 
disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
38
Corporate Governance
3.3. Our peer group of companies
The Committee periodically uses data from external research 
into the remuneration paid by comparable companies. The 
peer group for benchmarking currently consists of the 
constituents of the FTSE Pharma & Biotech index. The 
Committee has within the policy the discretion to use an 
alternative comparator group or to amend the current 
comparator group. Where the Committee has selected a new 
comparator group or substantially amended a comparator 
group it will disclose the new comparators in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration for the year
3.4. Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
All employees are entitled to base salary, and may additionally 
be entitled to pension and benefits depending upon their role 
and position within the Group. Additionally, certain employees 
are eligible for annual bonuses and participation in the VCP. 
The maximum opportunity available is based on the seniority 
and responsibility of the role.
The general policy is to ensure workers with lower levels of 
total remuneration have greater certainty as to what they 
receive, whereas the compensation of executive employees  
is chiefly based on performance-related pay.
Remuneration Report
Part 2: Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
3.5. Changes to remuneration policy from previous policy
The growth targets for the VCP were altered for awards made 
in July 2014. The growth target, above which participants will 
receive a share of 15% of any value created for shareholders, 
was revised from 20% to 16%. In addition, the base price 
applicable to the awards (growth above which will generate a 
pay out) was increased from 28p to 37p.
The Company’s share price did not perform in line with the 
expectations at the time the 2011 VCP awards were made. 
The 2011 VCP awards were by 2014 no longer motivational. 
However, due to the clear link between the value to 
shareholders and the value to management through the VCP 
the Committee felt it was appropriate to relaunch the VCP  
with a new growth target. The amendments were made in 
consultation with key shareholders in the Company.
The allocation of performance units under the VCP was also 
adjusted to take into account the current position of the 
Company and roles within the management team.
While there has been no change to the maximum grant level 
under the 2013 Bonus Plan, maximum bonus awards for 
2014–15 will be reduced from 150% of salary for the CEO 
and 140% for the COO to 130% and 120% respectively to 
reflect the relaunch of the VCP in July 2014.
There have been no other changes to the operation, maximum 
or performance measures in relation to the salary, annual 
bonus, pension, other benefits or the VCP.

4. Future policy table – Non-executive Directors
 Objective and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures assessment
The Group sets fee levels 
necessary to attract and retain 
experienced and skilled 
Non-executive Directors to 
advise and assist with 
establishing and monitoring 
the strategic objectives of  
the Group. 
Fee levels are sufficient to 
attract individuals with 
appropriate knowledge  
and experience.
Non-executive Directors are 
paid a base fee and additional 
fees may be paid for 
chairmanship of Committees. 
In exceptional circumstances, 
fees may also be paid for 
additional time spent on the 
Group’s business outside of 
the normal duties. 
Fees are reviewed periodically 
with any changes generally 
effective from 1 July.
Any increases in fees will be 
determined based on time 
commitment and take into 
consideration level of 
responsibility and fees paid in 
other companies of 
comparable size and 
complexity.
Non-executive Directors do 
not receive any bonus, do not 
participate in awards under 
the Group’s share plans, and 
are not eligible to join the 
Group’s pension scheme.
The Non-executive Director 
fees for 2014–15 are set out in 
the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on pages 46.
The previous column sets out 
the factors that will be taken 
into consideration in 
determining the fees. 
Fees will be in line with the  
fee levels of comparable 
companies within the 
comparator group used  
for Executive Directors 
(described on page 38 
above). 
In the normal course of events, 
increases in the Non-executive 
Directors’ fees will not exceed 
the average increase for 
employees.
None.
5. Approach to recruitment remuneration and promotions
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the 
appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role. The remuneration package for any new recruit would be assessed 
following the same principles as for the Executive Directors, as set out in the remuneration policy table at section 2 above. 
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and 
will have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short or long-term incentive payments 
made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there 
would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. 
Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of  
the ongoing remuneration of the employee. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the following year’s Annual Report  
on Remuneration.  Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Corporate Governance
The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration:
 Objective and link to strategy Operation
Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors including market practice, 
the individual’s experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within Sinclair and will 
be consistent with the salary policy for existing Executive Directors.
The Executive Director shall be eligible to receive benefits in line with Sinclair’s benefits policy 
as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension The Executive Director will be entitled to receive a pension contribution under the Group’s 
defined contribution pension scheme, in accordance with the Company’s policy.
Annual bonus The Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the 2013 Bonus Plan as set out in the 
remuneration policy table.
Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable in the remuneration policy 
table at the Committee’s discretion.
Long-term incentives The Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the VCP as set out in the remuneration 
policy table.
Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable under the Plan rules at the 
Committee’s discretion.
Maximum variable 
remuneration
The maximum annual variable remuneration that an Executive Director can receive is limited to 
150% of salary under the 2013 Bonus Plan and a percentage of the value created under the 
VCP. Awards under the VCP have no value at grant but provide participants with the 
opportunity to receive a percentage of the value created for shareholders (see remuneration 
policy table). The maximum value available under the VCP is 15% of the value created for 
shareholders in excess of the 16% growth target.
Share buy-outs/ 
replacement awards
The Committee’s policy is not to provide buy-outs as a matter of course. However, should the 
Committee determine that the individual circumstances of recruitment justified the provision of 
a buy-out, the value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of a Director’s previous 
employment will be calculated taking into account the following:
• the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Director’s cessation 
of employment;
• the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of 
them being satisfied; 
• any other terms and condition having a material effect on their value (‘lapsed value’);
The Committee may then grant up to the equivalent value as the lapsed value, where possible, 
under the Group’s incentive plans. To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide 
the buy-out within the terms of the Group’s existing incentive plans, a bespoke arrangement 
would be used.
Relocation policies In instances where the new Executive is relocated from one work-base to another, the Group 
will provide one-off and if necessary, ongoing as part of the Director’s relocation benefits 
compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the Executive in cases where they are 
expected to spend significant time away from their country of domicile.
The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case by case basis but will take into 
consideration any cost of living differences.

6.1. Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors has a service contract with the Company which is terminable by the Company or the Director on 
12 months’ notice, extended to 18 months in certain circumstances. The Company’s practice is to appoint the Non-executive 
Directors, including the Chairman, for a term of three years subject to annual re-election by the shareholders, at the Company’s 
AGM. When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard for market practice and corporate governance best practice.

All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office.
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing Director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the 
Group whilst complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. The Committee 
reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal 
obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in 
connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment.
The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Group’s policy on payment for loss of office in respect of 
Executive Directors and any discretion available to the Committee. 
 Element Cessation of employment
Base salary, benefits and pension There will be no compensation for normal resignation or in the event of termination 
by the Company due to misconduct. In other circumstances, Executive Directors will 
be entitled to receive payment in lieu of notice.
Salary, benefits and pension contributions/salary supplement will normally be paid 
over the notice period. The Company has discretion to make a lump sum payment on 
termination of the salary, value of benefits and pension amounts payable during the 
notice period. In all cases the Company will seek to mitigate any payments due.

 Element Cessation of employment Change of control
2013 Bonus Plan Where an Executive Director’s 
employment is terminated after the end  
of a performance year but before the 
payment is made, the Executive may be 
eligible for an annual bonus award for 
that performance year subject to an 
assessment based on performance 
achieved over the period. No award will 
be made in the event of misconduct.
Where an Executive Director’s 
employment is terminated during a 
performance year, a pro rata annual 
bonus award for the period worked in 
that performance year may be payable  
at the Committee’s discretion subject to 
an assessment based on performance 
achieved over the period and provided 
the individual is a ‘good leaver’. 
No deferred bonus award can be made 
to an Executive Director who has ceased 
employment.
Where an Executive Director is a good 
leaver, any deferred element will be 
retained until the next Measurement 
Date, at which it will vest as normal. 
Otherwise, all his deferred bonus 
entitlements will lapse.
The good leaver definition is the same as 
for the VCP set out below.
Committee discretion
The Committee has discretion to 
determine whether an individual is a good 
leaver and therefore whether a pro rated 
bonus will be payable for the year of 
cessation and whether any deferred 
bonus will lapse.
The Committee has discretion to 
determine whether any deferred award 
will be made to an Executive Director 
who has given or received notice of 
termination of employment.
The Committee will only use its general 
discretion to determine that an Executive 
Director is a good leaver in exceptional 
circumstances and will provide a full 
explanation to shareholders, if possible in 
advance, of the basis for its determination.
The extent to which the performance 
requirements are satisfied will determine 
the annual bonus which is earned.
Any deferred awards will immediately 
vest on a change of control.
Excludes a reorganisation or 
reconstruction where ownership does 
not materially change
Committee discretion
The Committee will take into account 
such factors as it consider relevant in 
relation to the bonus plan payment for the 
year in which the event occurs, including 
the proportion of the bonus plan year 
elapsed at the date of the event.

 Element Cessation of employment Change of control
VCP
The treatment of awards granted 
under the VCP is governed by the 
rules, as approved by shareholders. 
On termination of employment before the 
Measurement Date, all unvested awards 
will lapse, unless the following 
circumstances apply:
• Death;
• Injury, ill-health or disability;
• Retirement;
• Redundancy; 
• Transfer of the business or part of the 
business to which the participant’s 
employment relates, to a person  
who is not a Group Company;
• Any other circumstances if the 
Committee decides in any  
particular case.
Where an Executive Director is deemed  
a good leaver prior to the Measurement 
Date, the Committee will have discretion, 
if it decides it is appropriate, to allow 
some or all of the awards to vest  
by deeming: 
• there to be a new Measurement Date 
at the date of cessation and the 
number of nil-cost options to be 
accrued will be calculated as at any 
other Measurement Date; or
• that the nearest normal Measurement 
Date to the date of cessation of 
employment can be used.
All accrued nil-cost options will then  
vest and be immediately exercisable 
(including any other vested nil-cost 
options) for a period of six months.
Anyone who is not a good leaver will be a 
bad leaver. Where a participant ceases 
to be employed prior to the awards 
becoming exercisable all awards will 
lapse (including accrued unvested 
nil-cost options).
Committee discretion
The Committee has discretion to 
determine whether an individual is a  
good leaver.
The Committee in its absolute discretion 
will determine the proportion of awards 
(i.e. performance units) that will be 
capable of converting into nil-cost 
options on cessation.
The Committee also has discretion to 
determine that the awards will convert  
on the date of cessation or continue  
until the nearest normal Measurement 
Date on which they would otherwise  
have converted.
On a change of control (takeover, 
reconstruction, amalgamation, winding-
up or demerger before the Measurement 
Date) there will be a new Measurement 
Date deemed to be the date of the 
change of control. 
In determining the value created, the 
Measurement Price will be the offer  
price for a share made by the acquirer, 
plus the appropriate amount per share  
of any dividends paid on the shares. 
The calculation of the number of 
Company shares to be allocated to  
a participant will be as at any other 
Measurement Date. 
All accrued nil-cost options will vest on  
a change of control and be exercisable 
together with any other vested nil-cost 
options immediately for a set period of  
up to six months.  Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

7. Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
The policy of the Committee is to align Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders and to give the Executive 
Directors incentives to perform at the highest levels. To achieve this it seeks to ensure that a significant proportion of the 
remuneration package varies with the performance of the Group and that targets are aligned with the Group’s stated business 
objectives.
The composition and total value of the Executive Directors’ remuneration package for the financial year 2014–15 at minimum, 
on-target and maximum performance scenarios are set out in the charts below.
Assumptions used in determining the level of pay-out under given scenarios are as follows:

growth target, subject to a new five year holding period. The maximum value represents 100% of the annualised IFRS 2 value of the award.

Part 2: Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

8. Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when developing policy
In setting the remuneration policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of Sinclair are taken into account, 
including any base salary increases awarded. The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for 
management level tiers below the Executive Directors, and uses this information to ensure consistency of approach throughout 
the Group. No comparison metrics were used.
Although the Committee takes into account the pay and conditions of other employees, the Company did not consult with 
employees when drawing up the policy report.
9. Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping remuneration 
policy and practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting remuneration strategy and the Committee 
commits to consulting with key shareholders prior to any significant changes to its remuneration policy – for example, the 
changes to the VCP outlined at section 3.5 above were discussed with key shareholders prior to implementation in July 2014.
10. External appointments
The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be inclined to take up Non-executive Directorships or public sector  
and not-for-profit appointments, and that these can broaden the experience, network and knowledge of the Director, from  
which the Group can benefit. Executive Directors may therefore accept such appointments only after they have obtained prior 
written approval of the Board and that the Board is satisfied that there is no conflict of interest and that the appointment will  
not detract from the Executives performance for the Company. Executive Directors are allowed to retain any fees paid under  
such appointments.
During the year under review, Chris Spooner held a Non-executive Directorship with Pirtsemit Limited, Chris did not receive any 
remuneration from this external appointment. Christophe Foucher did not hold any external appointments. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Part 3: Annual Report On Remuneration
This Annual Report on Remuneration contains details of how the Group’s remuneration policy for Directors was implemented 
during the financial year ended 30 June 2014. This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006, and (at the Group’s election) with reference to Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. An advisory resolution to approve this report will be put  
to shareholders at the AGM.

1 Taxable benefits include health insurance for the Executive Director and their family and use of a car.
2 It should be noted that the bonus disclosed is 50% of the bonus contribution earned for this financial year under the 2013 Bonus Plan (the balance is deferred and at risk  
of forfeiture). Mr C Spooner also received a discretionary bonus of £65,000 and Mr C Foucher £10,500 in respect of performance in the year, these amounts were paid 
outside the 2013 Bonus Plan.
3 The payment made under the 2013 Bonus Plan in this financial year related to deferred elements from previous years where the risk of forfeiture lapsed during this financial 
year and therefore in accordance with the Regulations, this is shown as a long-term incentive payment.

2. Additional details in respect of single total figure table (audited)
2.1. 2013–14 benefits
The Group provided the following benefits to the Executive Directors:
• Health insurance for the Executive Director and their family;
• Mr Foucher is provided with a car for private use.
2.2. 2013–14 annual bonus plan outcome
In determining the award for 2013–14, the Committee took into account the Group financial performance and achievement 
against the strategy. The maximum bonus entitlement was 150% of salary for Chris Spooner and 140% of salary for  
Christophe Foucher. The bonus objectives for the year related to revenues, gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and other  
strategic targets. Having reviewed the Group’s financial performance for the year and the delivery of other strategic targets,  
the Committee considered that a bonus award of 84% of maximum entitlement was appropriate for Chris Spooner and 77.8%  
for Christophe Foucher.
Chris Spooner therefore received a contribution to his bonus plan account of £436,726, 126% of base salary and Christophe 
Foucher received a contribution to his bonus plan account of £261,690, 109% of base salary. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
47
The Committee exercised its discretion during the year to change the performance conditions for Executive Directors in relation 
to the annual bonus. The Committee considered that a number of acquisitions made during the year significantly improved the 
long-term prospects of the Group, but were not reflected adequately in the original performance targets that were set at the start 
of the year. As a result, an additional discretionary bonus payment of £65,000 was made to Chris Spooner increasing his overall 
bonus to 96.5% of maximum annual entitlement, and 145% of salary for the year. A discretionary bonus of €12,500 was made  
to Christophe Foucher increasing his overall bonus to 80.9% of maximum annual entitlement, and 113% of salary for the year. 
These discretionary bonuses were paid outside the 2013 Bonus Plan with no element of the bonus being deferred. This was an 
exceptional event and the Committee would not in the normal course amend performance conditions during a bonus year.
2.3. 2013-14 annual bonus plan outcome
Under the 2013 Bonus Plan, the earned bonus for the year is added to each individual Executive Director’s plan account. 50% of 
the balance on the plan account at the end of the financial year is released and 50% deferred. See remuneration policy table in 
section 2 of part 2 of this report for details on the operation of the 2013 Bonus Plan. The deferred balances on each Executive 
Director’s plan account as at 30 June 2014 are set out below:

Maximum annual bonus entitlements have been reduced for 2014–15 from 150% and 140% of base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer respectively, to 130% and 120% of base salary respectively as a result of the 
relaunch of the VCP in July 2014 with revised growth targets.
The Committee is of the opinion that the performance targets for the bonus plan are commercially sensitive in respect of the 
Group, and that it would detrimental to the interests of the Group to disclose them. Actual awards made will be published at the 
end of the performance periods so shareholders can assess the basis for any payouts.
VCP
Existing VCP award holders (C Spooner and C Foucher) surrendered their existing VCP awards in exchange for new awards 
subject to the 16% target. These new awards were made subject to a new ‘base price’ from which growth will be measured 
(37p) and will be measured over a new performance period of five years, beginning on the date the new awards were made.
Pension and benefits
Neither Chris Spooner nor Christophe Foucher will receive payments in lieu of pension contributions. Benefits will be provided in 
line with the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy table.

Corporate Governance
The Committee held two formal meetings in the financial year; each meeting was attended by all Committee members. The 
Committee also held several other meetings and conversations with advisors and Executive Directors during the year in relation 
to changes to remuneration policy, in particular, revisions to the VCP.
12.2. Role of the Committee and activities
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the senior 
management and for setting the remuneration packages for each Executive Director. The Committee also has oversight of the 
remuneration policy and packages for other senior members of staff.
The written Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website.
The Committee’s main activities during the 2013–14 financial year included: 
• Determining bonus payments in relation to the 2012–13 financial year;
• Discussing revised terms for the VCP, implemented in July 2014; and
• Reviewing base salaries for executive Directors and senior management.
12.3. Advisors to the Committee
The Committee received external advice in 2013–14 from PwC, who were appointed by the Committee and are considered 
objective and independent. PwC are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operate under

PwC also provided the Group with advisory work during the year, mainly in relation to revisions to the VCP. The Committee 
reviewed the nature of the services provided and was satisfied that no conflict of interest exists or existed in the provision of 
these services.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends the meetings. 
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings but not on decisions relating to his own 
remuneration. In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning 
the other Executive Directors and employees. 
The total fees paid to PwC’s in respect of services to the Committee during the year were £43,500. Fees were determined 
based on the scope and nature of the projects carried out for the Committee during the year.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of 
Sinclair IS Pharma plc 
Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair 
view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs 
as at 30 June 2014 and of the group’s loss and the group’s 
and the company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the 
remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The group financial statements and company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared  
by Sinclair IS Pharma plc, comprise:
• the consolidated and company balance sheet as at  
30 June 2014;
• the consolidated income statement and consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year then 
ended;
• the consolidated and company cash flow statements for the 
year then ended;
• the consolidated and company statement of changes in 
shareholders’ equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting 
framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report 
and Accounts 2014 (the “Annual Report”), rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced 
from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & 
Ireland)”). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
group’s and the company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped  
us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements,  
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the group financial statements as a whole to  
be £645,000. This represents approximately 1% of revenue, 
which, in our view, is an appropriate benchmark given the 
group has historically been loss-making. We agreed with the 
Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements 
identified during our audit above £32,000 as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of the audit
The group is structured geographically across six global 
reporting segments, in addition to a segment capturing  
central corporate costs. The group financial statements are  
a consolidation of twenty seven reporting units, comprising  
the group’s operating businesses and centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at 
the reporting units by us, as the group engagement team, or 
component auditors from other PwC network firms operating 
under our instruction. Where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the level of involvement 
we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units  
to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
group financial statements as a whole.
Accordingly, of the twenty seven reporting units, we identified 
fourteen active units of which six, in our view, required an audit 
of their complete financial information due to their size and 
materiality to the group. These six reporting units constituted 
79% of the Group’s total revenue. Analytical review 
procedures were performed on the remaining reporting  
units to identify any unusual balances and transactions  
based on size. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Financial Statements
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a 
number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by 
assessing the directors’ judgements against available 
evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we 
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Valuation of goodwill and intangible
We focused on this area because of the magnitude of the 
goodwill and intangible asset balances, and the judgements 
involved in considering whether the balances are impaired. A 
goodwill impairment assessment is required annually by 
accounting standards.
The impairment models for goodwill and intangibles use 
value in use assessments which are based on discounted 
cash flow calculations. We challenged the key assumptions, 
including discount rates and sales growth, used in the 
models to support the valuations. Having ascertained the 
extent of change in those assumptions that either individually 
or collectively would be required for the goodwill and 
intangible assets to be impaired, we considered the 
likelihood of such a movement in those key assumptions 
arising and whether there was adequate disclosure of such 
sensitivities in the financial statements.
Fraud risk in revenue recognition
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure management may feel to 
achieve the planned results.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, 
including understanding and evaluating the process for 
recording revenue. We specifically focussed on any material 
non-standard manual revenue transactions identified during 
the year, and the cut-off of revenue pre year-end as this was 
where the risk was deemed to lie.
Valuation of intangible assets created on acquisition of 
Obvielines SAS, Aqtis Medical BV and Silhouette Lift SL
We focused on this area because of the magnitude of the 
intangible asset created on acquisition, and the judgements 
involved in valuing the balance.
We assessed the key assumptions, including the discount 
rate and sales growth projections, used in generating  
the intangible assets on acquisition, and challenged 
management to ensure a robust rationale supported the 
calculations. External evidence, including independent due 
diligence reports, and interviews with key employees were 
performed to support the assessments where appropriate.
Risk of management override of internal controls
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, 
including the arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” 
inappropriate actions, and interviewed senior management. 
We examined the significant accounting estimates and 
judgements relevant to the financial statements for evidence 
of bias by the directors that may represent a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. In particular, we focused on the 
accounting entries surrounding the acquisitions made during 
the year and the financing of these transactions, and the 
issue of share capital. We also tested journal entries by 
applying a risk-based approach. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report 
and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Independent Auditors’ Report continued
for the year ended 30 June 2014
considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to 
draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required 
particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list 
of all risks or areas of focus identified by our audit. We 
discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. 
Their report on those matters that they considered to be 
significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set 
out on page 20 to 21.
Opinion on additional disclosures
Corporate Governance Statement
The company voluntarily prepares a corporate governance 
statement that includes the information with respect to internal 
control and risk management systems and about share capital 
structures required by the Disclosure Rules and Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. The directors have 
requested that we report on the consistency of that 
information with the financial statements.  Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
53
In our opinion the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement set out on pages 28 to 31 with  
respect to internal control and risk management systems  
and about share capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
The directors have chosen to voluntarily comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) as if the company 
were a premium listed company. On page 27 of the Annual 
Report, as required by the Code Provision C.1.1, the directors 
state that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole  
to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for members to assess the group’s and 
company’s performance, business model and strategy. On 
page 20 to 21, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit 
Committee has set out the significant issues that it considered 
in relation to the financial statements, and how they were 
addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
• the explanation given by the directors as to why the  
Annual Report does not include a statement that the  
Annual Report is fair balanced and understandable is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and 
company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group and company 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Matter on which we have agreed to report by exception
Corporate governance statement
The company’s voluntary Corporate Governance Statement 
includes details of the company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The directors have requested 
that we review the parts of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified 
for auditor review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority as if the company were a premium listed company. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being  
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards  
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent  
in writing.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2014
1. General information
Sinclair IS Pharma plc (the ‘Company’) is an international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on Dermatology, in 
particular – Aesthetics, Wound care, and Skin care. The Group has a direct sales and marketing presence in the top five 
European markets and a rapidly growing International division concentrated on key emerging markets through long-term  
multi-product, multi-country, sales, marketing and distribution deals with key strategic partners.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and 
domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is Whitfield Court, 30–32 Whitfield Street, London W1T 2RQ.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention as modified to fair value for certain financial assets and liabilities.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, 
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from these estimates.
Under Section 479C of the Companies Act 2006, exemptions from an audit of the accounts for the financial year ending 30 June 
2014 have been taken by Sinclair Pharmaceuticals Limited (01007146); IS Pharmaceuticals Limited (02685820); IS Pharma 
Limited (03337415); Acorus Therapeutics Limited (03976183). As required, the Company guarantees all outstanding liabilities 
to which the subsidiary companies listed above are subject at the end of the financial year, until they are satisfied in full and the 
guarantee is enforceable against the parent undertaking by any person to whom the subsidiary companies listed above is liable  
in respect of those liabilities.
Going concern
The Group’s forecasts, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be 
able to operate within the level of its current debt facilities and to comply with the required covenants. After making enquiries, 
and considering the covenants on the Group’s debt, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As a result, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Control is achieved where the 
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.  
They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is applied to all business combinations made by the Group. The cost of an acquisition  
is measured, as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of 
exchange at the rate of exchange (where applicable) on the date of acquisition. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in a business combination are measured initially  
at their fair values on the date of acquisition, based on the rate of exchange (where applicable) on the date of acquisition, 
irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of identifiable net assets, including intangible assets acquired, is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition  
is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in  
the income statement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the Group. On consolidation, all intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are eliminated. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

2. Accounting policies continued
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the executive management team 
(who act as the chief operating decision maker). The executive management team has determined that there are the following 
reportable operating segments: International Operations, France, Italy, Germany, UK and Spain.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the functional currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s and the Group’s functional and presentation currency. Transactions in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
that date. Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the income statement. The results of operations that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period  
and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the date of the balance sheet. Exchange differences arising on translation from  
1 July 2005 are taken directly to a separate component of equity, the cumulative translation reserve included within ‘Other 
Reserves’. There is no tax impact on these transactions. Exchange differences on intra-group loan balances are taken to the 
income statement, unless they are considered long-term equity investments.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognised upon shipment to customers. Provisions for rebates, product returns and discounts to 
customers are provided for as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales occurred. Royalties receivable under 
licensing agreements are recognised as they are earned and are recorded within revenue. The recognition of other payments 
received and receivable, such as licence fees, upfront payments and milestones, is dependent on the terms of the related 
arrangement, having regard to the ongoing risks and rewards of the arrangement, and the existence of any performance or 
repayment obligations, if any, with the third party. Amounts received and receivable are recognised immediately as revenue where 
there are no substantial remaining risks, no ongoing performance obligations and amounts received are not refundable. Amounts 
are deferred over an appropriate period where these conditions are not met.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets, 
including intangible assets, of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount  
of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign 
entity denominated in foreign currency and translated at the balance sheet date according to the rate of exchange prevailing at 
that date.
Intangible assets
i) Licences and product rights
Licences and trademarks including product distribution rights and technical dossiers are recognised at their fair values at 
acquisition date (where acquired as part of a business combination) or cost (if acquired separately) and are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives (5 to 20 years) from the time they are available for use. Amortisation 
is included within Administrative expenses.
ii) Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development activities are recognised as 
intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, 
status of regulatory approval, and costs can be measured reliably. Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense 
as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. 
Development costs that have a finite useful life and that have been capitalised are amortised from the date of regulatory approval 
of the product on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit, not exceeding 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
62
Financial Statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are 
incurred. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the cost 
of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows:
• Freehold buildings over 15 to 45 years;
• Leasehold improvements expensed over period of lease; and
• Office and laboratory equipment depreciated at 15% to 50% per year.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or where 
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried at cost less impairment provision. Such investments are subject to review and 
any impairment is charged to the income statement.
Impairment
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and other intangible assets are tested where there is an indication of impairment. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if 
any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying value of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, provided that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior periods. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises materials, direct labour and a share of 
production overheads if appropriate at the relevant stage of production. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective 
items where appropriate. Net realisable value is determined at the balance sheet date on commercially saleable products based 
on estimated selling price less all further costs to completion and all relevant marketing, selling and distribution costs.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable 
profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income 
and expenses that are taxable and deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.

63
2. Accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or the initial recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leases
Leases, including hire purchase contracts, are classified as a finance lease whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held under finance 
leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value. Each asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its useful life. The obligations related to finance leases, net of finance charges in 
respect of future periods, are included, as appropriate, under current, or non-current liabilities. The interest element of a rental 
obligation charged to the income statement is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held in 
independently administered funds. Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable in accordance 
with the rules of the schemes.
Other employee benefits
The expected cost of compensated short-term absence (i.e. holidays) is recognised when employees provide services that 
increase their entitlement. An accrual is made for holidays earned but not taken.
Share-based payments
i) Options, warrants and performance share awards
The Group grants share options, warrants and performance share awards to Directors, employees and certain consultants. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the expected life of the option or warrant, based on the estimated number of options or warrants that will eventually vest. The 
share options or warrants granted have varying performance criteria required for the option or warrants to vest and these are 
considered in the method of measuring the fair value. Where it is considered appropriate, the fair value is measured using the 
Black-Scholes model. Where complex market performance criteria exist, a Monte Carlo model has been used to establish the  
fair value on grant.
ii) Value Creation Plan
The Group also operates a Value Creation Plan (‘VCP’) which grants VCP units to Executive Directors and certain employees  
of the Group. These VCP units are convertible into nil-cost options over Ordinary shares subject to the Group’s share price 
reaching certain targets. The fair value of the VCP units granted is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The fair value is initially recognised at the date of the award of the VCP units and is spread over the period during which 
the VCP units are convertible into Ordinary shares. The fair value of the VCP units is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation 
model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the grants are made.
iii) 2013 Bonus Plan
The Group also operates a bonus plan which requires 50% of the annual bonus awarded to Executives and certain employees  
to be deferred into a plan account. The deferred element of the annual contribution will be in shares, the number of which will  
be calculated based on the 30 day average share price at the end of the plan year and added to the deferred balance in the 
participant’s account. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
64
Financial Statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Participants are entitled to an annual payment of 50% of the balance of their plan account at the end of each financial year.  
This continues for three years with the remaining balance paid out in shares in year four when the bonus plan ends. The value 
held in a participant’s plan account may be reduced by 50% if certain Forfeiture Thresholds are not met.
Equity-settled share-based payments granted by the Company to employees of subsidiaries are recognised as an expense 
charged to the relevant subsidiary with an equal increase in the investment in the subsidiary undertaking.
Trade receivables and trade payables
Trade receivables and trade payables do not bear any interest and are stated at their book value as reduced where appropriate 
with allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities 
on the balance sheet.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent significant items of income and expense which due to their nature, size, or the expected infrequency 
of the events giving rise to them, are presented separately on the face of the income statements to give a better understanding to 
shareholders of the elements of the financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to 
better assess trends in financial performance.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets include non-current rent deposits paid on the property occupied in France.
New IFRSs standards and interpretations
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year ending 30 June 
2014 and have been applied by the Group, but have had no impact.
• IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ (effective annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013).
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, on ‘classification and measurement’ of financial assets and liabilities.
3. Financial risk management
Monitoring of financial risk is part of the Board’s ongoing risk assessment process. The Group does not use financial derivatives, 
other than an interest rate cap to manage interest rate risk on borrowings, and it is the Group’s policy not to undertake any 
trading in speculative financial instruments.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates or interest rates will affect the Group’s net 
income or value of its assets and liabilities.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures as the majority of the Group’s revenues, and certain expenditures, are in 
currencies other than the functional currency of the Group, mainly Euros and US Dollars. Certain of the Group’s bank borrowings 
are denominated in Euros and US Dollars, as disclosed in note 22.
The Group finances the majority of its activities in Europe and the US in the local currency, out of revenue receipts, excess 
currency receipts are then translated into Sterling either at the spot rate or through forward contracts. At 30 June 2014 and 
30 June 2013, the Group had no such forward contracts outstanding. Where subsidiaries are funded centrally, this is achieved 
by the use of long-term loans, on which exchange translation differences are taken to reserves.
The Group’s other financial liabilities include deferred and contingent consideration which is denominated in Euros and 
US Dollars. Cash reserves are held on deposit in US Dollars to hedge against the foreign exchange risk on items of deferred  
and contingent consideration payable in US Dollars which are expected to be settled over the next 12 months. Any future 
surpluses may be held on currency deposit to meet future contingent consideration liabilities.
At 30 June 2014, if the Euro had strengthened/weakened by 5% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, loss after 
tax would have been £(1,359,000)/£1,229,000 (higher)/lower (2013: £3,000/(£2,000)) lower/(higher). The impact on total 
equity would have been £4,052,000/(£3,666,000) higher/lower (2013: £2,686,000/ (£2,430,000)) higher/(lower)).

3. Financial risk management continued
At 30 June 2014, if the US Dollar had strengthened/weakened by 5% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, loss 
after tax would have been £(902,000)/£816,000 (higher)/lower (2013: £(266,000)/£240,000 (higher)/lower). The impact on 
total equity would have been £800,000/(£724,000) higher/(lower) (2013: £1,433,000/(£1,297,000) higher/(lower)).
Interest rate risk
The Group does not have significant interest-bearing assets and therefore the Group’s income and operating cash flows are 
substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from short and long-term borrowings. Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash 
flow interest rate risk. At 30 June 2014, if interest rates on floating borrowing rates had been 0.5% higher/lower with all other 
variables held constant, loss after tax would have been £133,000 (2013: £64,693) higher/lower.
It is the Group’s policy to cap the interest on two thirds of the borrowings over the term of the facility. The interest rate risk on the 
remaining uncapped facility is forecast to reduce in line with the facility as capital repayments are made.
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. The Group is exposed to credit risk through pre-wholesalers and marketing partners, 
such that if one or more of them is affected by financial difficulty, it could materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial 
results. Concentration of credit risk in relation to trade receivables is analysed in note 19.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed by reference to publicly available information, or information supplied by  
those customers.
Surplus cash deposits are invested with institutions which have a higher credit rating than A.
The Directors do not believe that the Group is exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk on other classes of  
financial instruments.
Price risk
The Group is not exposed to significant commodity or other market price risk. However like any trading company, the Group  
is exposed to the risk of unforeseen increases in the cost of goods purchased from suppliers. To mitigate this risk, the Group 
manages its relationships with suppliers closely such that pricing mechanism are controlled by contract, forecast demand is 
scheduled up to 12 months prior to delivery, and actual demand is confirmed in advance through purchase orders in accordance 
with pre-agreed pricing lists.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet  
its liabilities as they fall due and can generate sufficient cash flows to meet covenant targets, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Board reviews the forecast 
liquidity and covenant headroom at every Board meeting using cash flow forecasts which are updated on a regular basis in line 
with the business plan. The Group complied with the covenants on its borrowings throughout the year.
The Group has access to a £3,000,000 revolving credit facility which can be utilised to support short-term liquidity requirements.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total equity. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to 
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; to provide an adequate return to investors based on the levels of 
risk undertaken; to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future 
benefits and returns to investors; and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events 
together with ensuring compliance with the Group’s existing banking covenants on borrowings, which were complied with fully 
throughout the year.
The Group’s gearing ratio comparing net debt to enterprise value using the share price at 30 June 2014 is 20% (2013: 6%).
The Group believes it has sufficient ongoing cash and cash equivalents to meet its stated capital management objectives and the 
Directors believe that the capital management objectives have been met throughout the financial year. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Fair value estimation
The Group analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,  
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 30 June 2014.

There were no assets and liabilities measured at fair value at 30 June 2013.
(a) Financial instruments in Level 1
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. 
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry 
group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an 
arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. At 31 December 
2014 there are no financial instruments at Level 1.
(b) Financial instruments in Level 2
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is 
determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is 
available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are 
observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
• The fair value of interest rate caps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable 
yield curves;
• Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The interest rate cap is included in Level 2 and the contingent consideration in Level 3.

the reporting period 1,615
There were no assets and liabilities measured at fair value at 30 June 2013.
See note 23 for disclosures of the measurement of the contingent consideration.
Current assets held for sale
In accordance with IFRS 5, the assets and liabilities held for sale were written down to their fair value less costs to sell of 
£1,100,000. This is a non-recurring fair value which has been measured using observable inputs, being the prices for recent 
sales of similar businesses, and is therefore within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value has been measured by the 
selling price agreed when the asset was sold immediately post year end.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts  
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. The Board bases its estimates and judgements on historic 
experience and on various other assumptions that it considers reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under 
different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimates
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which 
goodwill or other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires estimation of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. There is a risk of a material 
adverse impact on the income statement should an impairment adjustment be required.
Valuation of intangibles acquired in business combinations
Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations requires estimation of the value of the cash 
flows related to the identified intangibles and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. The value of cash 
flows has been estimated by applying royalty rates on comparable products to forecast cash flows used at the time of the 
business combination. The estimates of the applicable discount rates for intangible assets are based on a capital asset pricing 
model-derived discount rate and the nature of the intangible asset being valued.
Valuation of contingent consideration
Determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires estimation of the probability and timing of future events such  
as regulatory approvals and sales milestones being achieved resulting in deferred consideration becoming payable. A suitable 
discount rate is then applied to the expected cash flows to calculate the present value. There is a risk of a material impact  
on the income statement in future periods should any key assumptions change which result in the expected value of the final 
consideration payable increasing or decreasing.  Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

5. Segment information
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the executive management team. This team reviews the Group’s 
internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments 
based on these reports.
The executive management team considers the business as being organised into the following reportable operating segments; 
Country Operations (including the Group’s operations in France, UK, Italy, Germany and Spain) where the Group has its 
proprietary sales infrastructure, and International Operations where the Group sells through a local distributor. The Group’s 
product portfolio is sold across all segments, with the exception of Sculptra
®
 which is only sold in Country Operations as the

6. Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent significant items of income and expense which due to their nature, size, or the expected infrequency 
of the events giving rise to them, are presented separately on the face of the income statement to give a better understanding to 
shareholders of the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better 
assess trends in financial performance.

Acquisition costs of £2,558,000 (2013: £74,000) include legal and professional expenses incurred in relation to the 
acquisitions of Obvieline SAS, AQTIS Holdings BV, and Silhouette Lift SL during the year and other business 
development projects.
Restructuring and integration costs of £1,632,000 (2013: £2,197,000) include post acquisition restructuring costs and 
manufacturing write offs incurred as a result of integrating the activities of acquired businesses into the Group, and other 
restructuring actions undertaken in the year; and in 2013 also included settlements paid to distributors in order to return certain 
product rights and resolve legacy contract disputes.
Impairment charges of £426,000 (2013: £15,151,000) include an impairment to the rights to the Terbinafine spray asset 
following the decision to halt further development work on this product and return the rights to the licensor. In 2013 impairment 
charges of £15,151,000 included £11,474,000 impairment to the product rights and £3,677,000 impairments to goodwill as a 
result of declining sales volumes and a reduction in average selling prices affecting the Variquel
®
 and Cryogesic products.
An impairment reversal of £820,000 has been recognised in the current year as a result of an agreement reached to dispose of 
the Cryogesic assets for total consideration of £1,100,000. The sale completed post period on 1 July 2014 and as a result the 
Cryogesic assets have been treated as an asset held for sale at 30 June 2014.
Exceptional cost of sales of £171,000 (2013: £158,000) represent the pass through of the fair value uplift applied, at acquisition, 
to the carrying value of the inventories acquired with the acquisition of Silhouette Lift SL and Obvieline SAS (2013 Advanced 
Bio-Technologies, Inc.). The fair value uplift was expensed through cost of sales as the inventory was sold  
to the market.
Profits on disposal of £600,000 were generated from the disposal of Effederm by the Group to Labaratoires Bailleul SA for a 
total consideration of €1,010,000 (£854,000) in November 2013. In 2013, £827,000 was generated from the disposal of Fazol 
G by the Group to Laboratories Majorelle for a total consideration of €1,150,000 (£990,000) in March 2013. The profit on 
disposal is the consideration net of the carrying value of the asset disposed and associated legal costs incurred.
After the exceptional cost of sales of £171,000 (2013: £158,000), the remaining £3,196,000 (2013: £16,595,000) of 
exceptional costs has been expensed through administration expenses. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

7. Discontinued operations
On 30 June 2013 the Group closed its manufacturing facility at Cléry in France and has fully outsourced its manufacturing 
arrangements. The Group makes significant cost savings through the outsourcing of these manufacturing arrangements to its 
manufacturing partners.
A loss for the year of £1,208,000 (2013: £1,515,000) has been recognised as the costs of discontinued operations.
A single amount is shown on the face of the income statement comprising the post-tax result of discontinued operations. The 
income and expenses of these operations are reported separately from the operations of the Group. Revenue from discontinued 
operations represents intra-group revenue of the Cléry site up to the point that stock from Cléry operations was exhausted, 
determined using third party rates for the products manufactured during the year. The table below provides further detail.

12. Loss for the financial year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s income statement has not been included in these 
financial statements. The Company’s loss for the financial year was £7,119,000 (2013: £19,206,000).
13. Loss per share
The basic loss per share has been calculated by dividing the loss for the year, by the weighted average number of shares in 
existence for the year. The loss and weighted average number of shares for the purpose of calculating the diluted loss per share 
are identical to those used for the basic loss per share at 30 June 2014, as the exercise of share options and warrants would 
have the effect of reducing the loss per share and therefore is not dilutive.

Loss from discontinued activities (£’000) (1,208) (1,515)
Basic and diluted loss per share (pence) from discontinued activities (0.3)p (0.4)p
Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by adding back exceptional charges, amortisation of acquired product rights 
and loss from discontinued operations to the loss for the year, together with related deferred tax movements resulting in an 
adjusted profit for the year.
A reconciliation of adjusted profit is as follows:

Additions in 2014 comprise the excess consideration paid over the fair value of assets acquired on the purchase of Obvieline 
SAS, Aqtis Medical BV, and Silhouette SL. 
Disposals in 2014 comprise £95,000 following the disposal of certain product rights.
Exchange adjustments arise as a result of the impact of the difference in the Sterling: Euro exchange rate and the Sterling: US 
Dollar exchange rate, at the beginning of the year or the date of acquisition and at end of the year on balances recorded in Euros 
and US Dollars.
Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units (‘CGU’s) in line with the Group’s segmental reporting structure. The 2013 
goodwill allocated to CGU’s has been re-evaluated and restated as a consequence of the significant additions in 2014. The 
goodwill arising from these acquisitions has been allocated according to the forecast cashflows of each operating segment that 
will benefit from the goodwill.
Goodwill has been provisionally allocated to the following CGUs:
2014 
£’000
2013
 £’000 
International operations 83,579 36,828
France country operations 16,571 13,787
Italy country operations 7,819 4,866
Spain country operations 8,243 3,110
Germany country operations 2,310 –
United Kingdom country operations 8,784 4,930
127,306 63,521
Goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that it may be impaired. 
Value in use calculations have been utilised to calculate recoverable amount. Value in use is calculated as the net present value 
of the projected post-tax cash flows of each CGU, discounted at 11.5% (2013: 10.5%), the Group’s estimated post-tax weighted 
average cost of capital. The same discount rate is applied to each CGU because the Group is centrally funded.
The cash flows, which have been approved by the Board, have been projected over five years for all CGUs, representing the 
Director’s best estimate of future product revenues and margins. Growth rate assumptions have been applied at an individual 
product and market levels and range from 0% for non-core products to 50% for certain key strategic products. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014
76
Financial Statements
14. Goodwill continued
Long-term growth rate assumptions beyond year five are 2% (2013: 2.0%) for all other CGUs, other than Sinclair UK, 0%, which 
consists mainly of non-core and un-promoted hospital products. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts used in 
industry reports.
France country operations and German country operations have the lowest headroom of recoverable amount over carrying value. 
The recoverable amounts of these CGUs are most sensitive to revenue forecasts. A 14% reduction in forecast sales in France 
and a 17% reduction in forecast sales in Germany would reduce the headrooms for each CGU to a minimum before an 
impairment would be necessary.
Values in use calculations generate significant headroom over recoverable amounts for all other CGUs. Whilst forecasts are 
sensitive to growth rates for specific products and territories, the Directors believe that any reasonably possible change in the 
key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts are based for all other CGUs would not cause the carrying amount to exceed 
their recoverable amount.
In 2013, Goodwill was impaired following new entrants in the market which primarily affected the Variquel

 and Cryogesic
®
 trademarks.

acquisition of Obvieline SAS as set out further in note 36.
Additions in the year include £3,605,000 payable for the purchase of the direct distribution rights for Silhouette in the UK.

Dollar exchange rate, at the beginning of the year or the date of acquisition and at end of the year on balances recorded in Euros 
and US Dollars.

At 30 June 2014, trade receivables of £9,405,000 (2013: £3,615,000) were past due, but not impaired. These relate to 
wholesalers and marketing partners for whom there is no recent history of default. All trade receivables, whether current or past 
due, are reviewed for impairment on a case by case basis to identify impairment taking into account the ageing of the debt, the 
likelihood of recoverability and other external factors. The aging analysis of trade receivables is as follows:

On 3 January 2014 the Group entered into a new term loan facility with Hayfin and consequently the Group’s existing loan facility 
with Clydesdale Bank was repaid in full. Drawings under the Hayfin facility amount to £57.7m and were used to fund the 
acquisition of Obvieline SAS, AQTIS Medical BV, and Silhouette Lift SL, repay existing borrowings, and to meet borrowing 
issuing expenses and the costs of acquisition. This includes drawdown denominated in £ of £8.6m, Euros of €38.5m (£30.8m) 
and $31.3m (£18.3m). 
Direct issue costs of £3.1m at June 2014 have been offset against the gross liability and are being amortised over the life of 
the facility. 
Foreign exchange gains of £1.7m arising from the difference in the Sterling: Euro and the Sterling: US Dollar exchange rates at 
the date of drawdown, and the end of the financial year, have been posted to net finance expenses.
The total available facility of £62.5m includes a revolving facility of £3.0m and a borrowing facility of up to £59.5m and expires 
on 3 January 2019. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

22. Borrowings continued
Interest is initially charged at LIBOR + 8.0% but will reduce to LIBOR + 7.0% and then 5.50% when the ratio of debt to EBITDA 
drops below 3.20:1 and then 2.00:1 but not before 2 May 2015. Interest payments are scheduled every quarter. Capital 
repayments, equivalent to 50% of the amount by which cash flows after debt service exceeds £0.5m, will be paid within  
130 days following the end of each financial year, starting in from June 2014. A final settlement payment will be made at the 
expiry of the facility. 
Drawings under the facility are secured by a debenture over all the Group’s assets.
The fair value of current borrowings equals their carrying amount, as the amounts are not discounted.
23. Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities include deferred purchase considerations due as follows:

Included within other financial liabilities is deferred and contingent consideration arising from business combinations completed 
in the year. This represents the Director’s estimate of the fair value of the assumed contractual minimum liabilities following 
business combinations discounted to their present value using a discount rate of 11.5% the Groups estimated weighted average 
cost of capital.
The items of deferred and contingent consideration relating to the acquisitions of Obvieline SAS, AQTIS Medical BV, and 
Silhouette Lift SL are described in note 36.
Deferred consideration payable to the previous owner of SEPI AG (a Swiss subsidiary acquired by IS Pharma in April 2008) 
which are payable to the original developers of Haemopressin

acquisition of Groupe CS Dermatologie SAS (now Sinclair Pharma France SAS) and the subsequent amortisation of the 
intangible assets and also on tax losses carried forward in certain entities which the Directors expect to be utilised in the 
foreseeable future.

Advanced Bio-Technologies, Inc. in December 2011 and IS Pharma plc in May 2011 and the subsequent disposal, amortisation, 
exchange movement or impairment of balances within this category of intangible assets.
The deferred tax liability arising on reinvestment reflects the taxable value of timing differences following the tax relief obtained 
through the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of assets. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

25. Deferred income tax continued
Foreign exchange differences of £643,000 arising on deferred tax liabilities from overseas business combinations are 
recognised as part of the movement in other reserves. All other movements are recognised in the income statement.
Unrecognised deferred tax
The Group has a potential deferred tax asset, which has not been recognised in the financial statements, due to uncertainties 
surrounding suitable future taxable profits. In the event that these assets are recognised in the future, planned reductions in the 
rate of corporation tax in the UK will reduce the potential value of these assets. This potential deferred tax asset is analysed as 
follows:
2014 
£’000
2013 
£’000 
Tax losses 7,710 7 ,718
Decelerated capital allowances 281 375
Future tax relief for share-based remuneration 137 53
Other temporary differences 67 176
Unrecognised deferred tax asset 8,195 8,322
No deferred tax is recognised on the distributed profits of subsidiaries as they are reinvested by the Group and no tax is 
expected to be payable on them for the foreseeable future. Since acquisition, subsidiaries have earned profits of £8,640,000 
(2013: 7,539,000) that have not been remitted to the Company and have been utilised against brought forward tax losses.
26. Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise: cash and cash equivalents, finance leases, borrowings and various trade and other 
receivables and trade and other payables that arise directly from its operations. The Group’s policies and additional disclosures 
relating to the management of foreign exchange, credit, cash flow and liquidity and pricing risk are set out in note 3.

embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for. There were no such derivatives at 30 June 2014 or

their book values, other than bank loans, as set out in note 22.

29. Potential issues of Ordinary shares
The Company has issued share options and warrants to Directors and employees of the Group. Share options have been issued 
from the Sinclair Pharma plc 2003 Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (‘2003 scheme’), approved by the Board on 
18 November 2003. Under this scheme the Company can grant both qualifying options (EMI options) and unapproved options 
over ordinary 1.0p shares in the Company. The Company has also issued Performance Share awards and Replacement options 
under the 2003 Executive Incentive Plan (‘EIP’).
Sinclair Pharma plc 2003 Executive Incentive Plan
The Company established the EIP pursuant to a resolution of the Board passed on 18 November 2003. The EIP is intended  
to allow the Company to make performance share awards and grant options, make restricted share awards, award stock 
appreciation rights and cash based long-term incentives, or a combination thereof to senior executives and key employees.
A performance share award is a promise to deliver Ordinary shares at the end of the performance period subject to the 
satisfaction of the performance conditions. The right will vest automatically and does not require any action by the award holder.
At the discretion of the Committee an award may be granted under the 2003 EIP to any Executive Director or employee of the 
Group who is required to devote the whole or substantially the whole of his working time to the Group. Awards may be made  
at any time other than a close period or other than at any time when a grant would be in breach of any other applicable laws or 
regulations. No awards will be made more than 10 years after the date of the adoption of the EIP. No consideration is payable  
for the grant of an award.
The performance criteria period will, in the absence of any other period determined by the Committee, be the three consecutive 
financial years commencing with the financial year in which the award is made.
The Committee will set performance conditions that they consider to be both relevant and stretching and designed to enhance 
the business having regard to the Code and the guidelines and standards of principles published from time to time by the 
Association of British Insurers relating to best practice on share incentive schemes. The performance conditions must be  
met at the end of the performance period for the award to vest.
The Company has also issued various warrants as follows:

29. Potential issues of Ordinary shares continued
Replacement Warrants and New Warrants
Replacement Warrants were issued on 2 December 2003 in exchange for an equivalent number of Old Warrants. Replacement 
Warrants provide the holder with a right to acquire such number of Ordinary shares as are equal in amount to a ‘target value’. 
Target value is calculated using the following formula:
Number of Old Warrants (or Unapproved Options) held by warrant holder multiplied by the IPO placing price per Ordinary 
share (115p).
Replacement Warrants are denominated in units. On the exercise of each unit of value a corresponding value of Ordinary shares 
in the Company may be acquired. The maximum number of Ordinary shares which can be acquired under the terms of the 
Replacement Warrants shall not exceed the number of Ordinary shares that may have been acquired under the terms of the Old 
Warrants. The acquisition price payable for Ordinary shares shall be between £0.01 and £0.33 per unit and shall, in aggregate, 
be equal to the acquisition price payable for Ordinary shares under the terms of the Old Warrants.
The Company and the holders of the Replacement Warrants also entered into a joint election under Section 4(4)(a) of the UK 
Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to transfer legal responsibility for payment of the employers’ national 
insurance contributions to the holders of the Replacement Warrants.
New Warrants were granted under the same terms and exercise prices as the Replacement Warrants to which they relate.
Replacement Warrants and New Warrants are exercisable in whole or in part at any time. They shall lapse on the earliest of the 
10th anniversary of the date of grant, or the bankruptcy of the warrant holder. There are no performance conditions relating to 
either Replacement Warrants or New Warrants.
GEM Warrants
The Company issued warrants to GEM Global Yield Fund Limited (‘GEM Warrants’) to subscribe for Ordinary 1.0p shares in the 
Company. GEM Warrants vested immediately on issue and expired during the year with no options exercised.
Octopus Warrants
The Company has also issued warrants to Octopus Capital Limited (‘Octopus Warrants’) to subscribe for Ordinary 1.0p shares 
in the Company. The Octopus Warrants vested immediately and can be exercised for a period of five years from the date of grant.

Value Creation Plan
The Sinclair Pharma 2011 VCP was approved by shareholders at a General Meeting held on 13 January 2011. Awards granted 
under the VCP have no value at grant but subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions can convert into nil-cost options 
at each measurement date. Further details of the plan are outlined in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
9,500 VCP units, out of a total pot of 10,000 were granted to Executive Directors and senior management on 12 May 2011 of 
which 7,800 remained outstanding at 30 June 2014.
The VCP awards are valued using a Monte Carlo model. The inputs into the model are as follows:
12 May 2011
Share price on award date 32.5p
Base price 28.0p
Number of simulations 10,000
Expected life of options 5 years
Dividend yield Nil
Risk free interest rate 1.09%
Sinclair IS Pharma share price volatility 35%
Share price hurdle per measurement period 20%
Pay-out over share price hurdle 15%
Shares in issue 2011 380,812,790
The charge for the year to the income statement in relation to these VCP awards amounted to £736,000 (2013: £600,000).
2013 Bonus Plan
Certain employees of the Group are eligible to participate in the 2013 Bonus Plan which is described in note 2.
At 30 June bonus awards with a value of £2,319,000 (2013: £845,000) have been deferred under the 2013 Bonus Plan. The 
fair value of £2,319,000 is based on the cash value at 30 June which is converted into 3,689,835 (2013: 3,061,564) notional 
1.0p Ordinary shares in the Company with a share value of 31.3p (2013: 27.6p), being the mid-market value of the Company’s 
shares for the 30 day period ending on the measurement date of 30 June 2014.
The fair value will be charged to the income statement over the next three years as the notional shares are converted into cash 
payments.
The total charge for the year relating to the bonus awards was £1,233,000 of which £968,000 is expected to be settled in cash 
and has been recognised in liabilities and £265,000 is expected to be converted into shares at the end of the scheme.
The 2013 Bonus Plan was established pursuant to a Board resolution on 10 June 2013 and as a result there was no share-based 
payment charge for the 2013 Bonus Plan in the year ended 30 June 2013 as the deferred balance is expensed over the full three 
year term of the Plan.
Options, Warrants and Performance Share Awards
Employees of the Group are awarded share options and awards subject to qualifying conditions. Options are granted to 
employees under the 2003 scheme, these Options have a fixed exercise price based on the market price at the date of the grant. 
The contractual life of all options and warrants is 10 years with the exception of the Octopus Warrants, five years. Options cannot 
normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of grant. Performance share awards are issued under the EIP and 
are converted into Ordinary shares subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria, usually on the third anniversary of grant.

30. Share-based payments continued
Options and performance share awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model where no market conditions are 
attached and the Monte Carlo model where market conditions are applied. Directors and other senior employees of the Group 
are normally granted options with market performance conditions. For each relevant option and award grant, individual valuation 
assumptions were assessed based upon conditions at the date of the grant. The range of assumptions in the calculations is  
as follows:

Obvieline SAS
The Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Obvieline SAS, on 3 January 2014 from Pharmavital SA. In April 
2014, the Group also completed the acquisition of distribution rights to Perfectha in Russia, Brazil and certain other territories 
from Pharmavital SA. Obvieline SAS owns the worldwide rights to Perfectha™, a range of hyaluronic acid based dermal fillers.
As a result of the acquisition, the Group expects to increase its presence in the global aesthetics market. The goodwill of 
£16,028,000 arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired customer base, and economies of scale expected from 
selling Perfectha

 directly through the Group’s direct sales forces in Europe. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be 
deductible for tax purposes.

Contingent consideration comprises a sales milestone of €2.0m payable when sales of Perfectha
®
 reach €17.0m on a trailing 
12 month basis, a milestone of €6.5m on the regulatory approval of the Perfectha Lidocaine line extension in Europe and royalties 
of up to €1.8m on sales of future line extensions. The contracted amounts in local currency, and Sterling equivalent translated at 
the date of acquisition, are expected to be settled as follows:

The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of £6.4m was estimated by applying the income approach. The fair 
value estimates are based on a discount rate of 11.5%, assumed future growth in the Perfectha

 trade, and regulatory approval 
for the use of Lidocaine in 2015 to 2016.
Acquisition related costs of £711,000 have been charged to exceptional administrative expenses in the income statement for the 
year ended 30 June 2014.
Obvieline SAS contributed £3.9m revenue and a profit of £0.8m to the Group’s loss for the year from the date of acquisition to 
30 June 2014.
If Obvieline SAS had been acquired on 1 July 2013 additional revenue of £2.9m and a profit before tax of £1.2m would have 
been included in the consolidated accounts.
AQTIS Medical BV
The Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of AQTIS Medical BV on 25 March 2014. AQTIS Medical BV owns the 
worldwide rights to Ellansé™, a range of collagen stimulating dermal fillers.
As a result of the acquisition, the Group expects to increase its presence in the global aesthetic market. The goodwill of £17,809,000 
arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired customer base and economies of scale expected from selling Ellansé™

The contingent consideration comprises sales milestones of €8.0m and €12.0m when sales of Ellansé™ reach €15m and €25m 
on a trailing 12 month basis, two milestones of €5.0m each when regulatory approval for two Ellansé™ products is achieved  
in the USA, and a royalty on sales in the USA which is capped by an earn out call option and which is not expected to exceed 
€8.1m. The contracted amounts in local currency, and Sterling equivalent translated at the date of acquisition, are expected  
to be settled as follows:
€’000 £’000
Within one year – –
Over one and under two years – –
Over two years and under five years 18,495 15,286
Over five years 19,564 16,169
Total contingent consideration 38,059 31,455
Contingent consideration included in the calculation of total consideration is calculated by discounting the contracted contingent 
consideration amounts in the table above to present value at the date of acquisition using a discount rate of 11.5%.
The potential undiscounted amount of all the future payments that the Group could be acquired to make is estimated to be  
up to €38.1m.
The fair value of the contingent consideration of £17.7m was estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value estimates 
are based on a discount rate of 11.5%, assumed future growth in the Ellansé™ trade, and based on obtaining the regulatory 
approval for the USA in 2018 and 2019.
Acquisition related costs of £659,000 have been charged to exceptional administrative expenses in the income statement for the 
year ended 30 June 2014.
AQTIS Medical BV contributed £1.3m revenue and a loss of £0.3m to the Group’s loss for the year from the date of acquisition 
to 30 June 2014.
If AQTIS Medical BV had been acquired on 1 July 2013 additional revenue of £3.6m and a profit before tax of £0.5m would have 
been included in the consolidated accounts.

Silhouette Lift SL
The Company acquired a controlling interest in Silhouette Lift SL on 2 May 2014. Silhouette Lift SL owns the worldwide  
rights to Silhouette Lift and Silhouette Soft, a range of collagen stimulating cones on threads complimentary to the Group’s 
aesthetic portfolio.
The acquisition is made in two steps with 75% of the shares purchased on 2 May 2014 and the remaining shares will transfer at 
a fixed price in January 2015. The payment for the remaining shares was also made on 2 May into an escrow account pending 
their transfer to the Group. These remaining shares do not carry voting rights and will not earn a dividend in the period from 
acquisition until transfer. Consequently the acquisition has been treated as a full business combination and there is no remaining 
minority interest.
As a result of the acquisition, the Group expects to increase its presence in the global aesthetic market. The goodwill of 
£35,167,000 arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired customer base and economies of scale expected  
from selling Silhouette directly through the Group’s direct sales forces in Europe and globally alongside the Group’s existing 
aesthetic portfolio.

Deferred consideration of €1,665,000 is payable on 12 January 2015.
Contingent consideration comprises:
• sales milestones of $15.0m when sales outside USA reach $14.0m in any 12 month trailing period;
• sales milestones of $2.5, $7.5m and $15.0m when USA sales reach $12.0m, $18.0m, and $30.0m in any 12 month  
trailing period;
• a royalty earned on sales which capped by an earn out call option and which is not expected to exceed $42.8m; and
• regulatory milestones totalling up to $23.0m which are payable when approval for the Silhouette Soft product is  
achieved in certain key markets including the USA. Sinclair IS Pharma plc Annual report and accounts 2014

Results
In another year of challenging conditions, we 
have once more delivered successful trading 
performances across our businesses. I am pleased 
to report that we have grown our revenue by 
3.1% to a record level of £984.1m. While our 
operating profit was 2.3% below last year at 
£211.3m*, our profit before tax and exceptional 
items was up 3.8% at £123.0m*. The earnings 
per share figure of 43.4p* is 18.7% below last 
year’s, principally because of the higher number 
of shares following the rights issue.
Dividend
Once again, our healthy cash generation has 
enabled the board to recommend a final dividend 
payment of 15.6p per share. This will take the 
total dividend for the year to 21.5p per share, 
2.4% ahead of the adjusted dividend per share 
for the period last year. The dividend cover of 
2.0x is in line with the board’s policy. The final 
dividend will be paid on 13 September 2010 to 
those shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 13 August 2010.
Acquisitions 
During the year we took the opportunity to 
purchase three small packages of high quality 
pubs, situated in attractive locations in England 
and Scotland. Altogether, including single sites, 
we acquired 28 properties, all of which are 
freehold and being run under management, 
for a total consideration of £67.4m. We are 
very pleased with their trading performance 
post-acquisition. Since the year end, we have 
acquired a further six outlets for £7.9m. 
Disposals
We have also continued to dispose of our 
non-core assets. During the year, we sold 
105 properties for £27.2m, against a combined 
book value of £26.2m. 
Board
After serving on our board for eleven years as 
managing director of Pub Partners, David Elliott 
left us at the end of January. The size and scope 
of our tenanted and leased pub business grew 
significantly under his responsibility and I would 
like to express my thanks to him for the contribution 
he made to the company. 
T owards the end of the year the board took the 
decision to reduce its size. This was precipitated 
by the fact that we had two managing directors 
who were members of the board and three 
who were not and we wanted to achieve parity 
in the management structure. Justin Adams and 
Jonathan Lawson agreed to step down from the 
board at the end of April, but their responsibilities 
for Brewing Company and Local Pubs remain 
exactly as they were. 
People
I would like to thank everyone for the role they 
have played in achieving another successful year. 
More customers have frequented our pubs and 
restaurants and enjoyed our own-brewed ales 
than ever before and this is testament to the 
dedication and drive of our people. 
Specifically, I would like to thank the many 
thousands of Greene King employees who work 
across the country in our pubs and restaurants, 
playing a vital role in demonstrating high quality 
standards in the marketplace. They should feel 
proud of their efforts in helping us to trade 
successfully through two difficult years of 
economic recession.

Greene King’s main businesses are the managed pubs (Local Pubs) and the managed food 
pubs, restaurants and hotels (Destination Division) of our Retail division, our tenanted and 
leased division, Pub Partners and the brewing and distribution of our world famous ales in our 
Brewing Company division. Our Scottish business, Belhaven, operates the same three profit 
streams as the rest of our UK operations. In total we operate over 2,400 pubs and restaurants, 
two breweries (Bury St Edmunds and Dunbar) and a number of regional depots. Our head 
office is in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and we have regional offices in Scotland.
ReTAil
Our Retail business includes our managed pubs, restaurants 
and hotels within England and Wales. At year-end, we had 
783 outlets. The instantly recognisable brands/formats of 
Hungry Horse, Hardy’s House, Old English Inns and Loch Fyne 
Restaurants all sit within our Retail division. These, together 
with the 436 pubs in our Local Pubs division, put us firmly 
in local communities across the country.
PuB P ARTneRS
Hungry Horse Every Hungry Horse pub is a friendly local that 
goes out to impress everyone with its quality family food offer, 
sense of fun and affordable prices.
This business operates all of our tenanted and leased pubs 
within England and Wales. There were 1,341 pubs within Pub 
Partners at the year end, split 20% leased and 80% tenancy . Pub 
Partners’ business model is based upon ensuring optimum profit 
achievement for both licensee and Greene King. Maintaining 
licensee viability and success is our main aim and, to help achieve 
that, we provide an innovative range of support, award winning 
training programmes and a fair and open partnership relationship.
T enancies Our tenanted model is based on a more hands-on 
approach to working with our licensees. Pub Partners tenancy 
agreements are for three years, with a shared repair liability 
between the tenant and Greene King. These tenancy agreements 
offer free of tie for wines, spirits and minerals and other flexible 
options. They are an excellent fit for first-time licensees and those 
who don’t wish to take on the extra responsibility of a lease.

Hardy’s House A Hardy’s House is the best choice for quality 
pub food, friendly atmosphere and personal touch in its locality 
– truly providing “something for everyone”.
Old English Inns Interesting and characterful hotels with 
great quality food and drink, where staff are passionate 
about providing friendly hospitality, whatever your occasion.
Loch Fyne Restaurants Loch Fyne Restaurants, the home 
of superb seafood and shellfish, has 44 restaurants in the UK, 
all renowned for their unique buildings and warm ambience. 
What sets Loch Fyne apart is its approach to environmental 
issues combined with its attention to detail and focus on quality. 
It now has sustainability ambassadors in each restaurant able 
to pass on the latest environmental thinking to customers 
and colleagues alike.
Leases Our leased model offers longer, assignable lease 
agreements with full repairing and insuring liability sitting with 
the lessee. Lease agreements are generally for a minimum 
of 10 years with options to increase in five-year periods to a 
maximum of 25 years, assignable after three years. These lease 
agreements attract the more entrepreneurial licensees who 
require more freedom to run the business as they would like.

Brewing Company, which brews, distributes, markets 
and sells our wide range of award-winning crafted ales has, 
for many years, been Britain’s leading cask brewer, investing 
more in cask beer than any other brewer. We now sport 
three of the country’s top 10 ale brands
1
, Greene King IPA, 
Abbot Ale and Old Speckled Hen, as well as a great range 
of best-quality permanent and seasonal ales, making us 
excellently-positioned to help licensees drive sales and 
take advantage of the current renaissance of cask ale. 
We also lead the booming off-trade premium ale market with 
our thriving take home business. Our quality range of ale brands 
includes Old Speckled Hen, Abbot Ale, Abbot Reserve, Greene 
King IPA, St Edmunds and the oak-aged Old Crafty Hen. 
Belhaven, our Scottish division, mirrors the Greene King 
model with managed and tenanted pubs operating as well 
as a brewing business. Its pubs division now comprises over 
300 tenanted, leased and managed pubs, from Stranraer in 
the South to Wick in the North, and its brewing business is 
conducted from Dunbar. Belhaven continues to be operated 
quite separately from the other Greene King businesses.
greene King iPA Award-winning Greene King IPA retains its top 
spot as the best-selling cask beer in Britain, contributing to the 
growing interest in real ale. Its new Cask Revolution dispense means 
that ‘serve’ is no longer hidden below the bar and that customers 
have a choice of beer styles. This, together with the high profile 
activity as the Official Beer of England Rugby and the sponsorship 
of Wasps, Harlequins and Sale Sharks, is driving sales up and 
down the country and attracting new drinkers to the category. 
Managed pubs Belhaven operates 105 managed pubs, the vast 
majority of which are not overtly branded. Food has become an 
increasingly important part of the operation, with sales growing 
by 40% in 2009/10 and now representing 28% of total managed 
pub turnover. Its food-led, destination, family restaurants, Eating 
Inns, have all shown substantial year on year sales growth. 
Old Speckled Hen Britain’s leading premium ale
3
, Old Speckled 
Hen, has had another year of record growth. Its impressive 
performance in the on and off trade, driven by the taste and quality 
of the beer and the reputation of the brand, has been well-supported 
by the success of the advertising campaign on TV channel Dave. 
Abbot Ale Universally recognised for its outstanding quality, 
award-winning Abbot Ale is the top selling premium cask ale 
in London and one of the top two in Britain. Brewed longer 
to a unique recipe that uses the finest barley from local farmers, 
this legendary ale bursts with flavour and retains its place as a 
favourite with the nation’s discerning beer drinkers.

to increase tenants’ cash flow and profitability.
Brewing Belhaven Belhaven Best consolidated its position as 
Scotland’s leading ale by increasing ale volume market share to 
26%* in 2009. Belhaven Best, the official beer of the Scottish 
Golf Union, has benefited from tightly targeted TV advertising 
endorsing it as “Scotland’s Best”. Other Belhaven brands include

CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S REvIEW
Greene King has delivered another strong 
performance. For the 52 weeks to 2 May 2010, 
we achieved record revenues of £984.1m, up 
3.1% on last year, despite the difficult trading 
environment. Operating profit* of £211.3m was 
2.3% below last year but profit before tax* was 
3.8% up on last year at £123.0m. Adjusted 
earnings per share was down 18.7% at 43.4p, 
due primarily to the higher number of shares 
following the rights issue. The board has 
recommended a final dividend of 15.6p per 
share, 3.3% ahead of last year. 
market and business overview
Our performance was delivered in another year 
of challenging market conditions. Although the 
UK consumer was better off than in the previous 
year following various government stimuli, bank 
lending remained low and the savings ratio grew. 
In addition, we had a tough winter, duty and VAT 
rises and the increasing consumer uncertainty 
over the election. The overall eating out market 
remained subdued and on-trade beer volumes 
again fell. 
Within this environment there were excellent 
achievements in all of our businesses; we delivered 
record revenues close to £1bn, strong Retail 
like-for-like-sales growth, second half profit 
per pub growth in Pub Partners, own-brewed 
volume growth and another record profit from 
Belhaven. We successfully balanced our revenue 
growth with effective cost mitigation and margin 
management to protect our margins and we 
generated sufficient cash to reduce our debt, pay 
an attractive dividend and increase our targeted 
investment in our assets, brands and people. 
We are operationally focused on delivering 
outstanding value, exceptional service and 
unbeatable quality throughout Greene King. 
We have consciously enhanced the value 
proposition to our customers over the last two 
years and while the UK consumer continues to 
demand exceptional value, we will deliver it, at 
the same time maintaining our commitment to 
generating healthy cash margins. 
Strategy update
Greene King has been providing its customers 
with authentic pub and beer experiences for 
over 200 years and central to this longevity is 
our ability to develop our business to reflect 
changing consumer preferences and economic 
conditions. This has been particularly true in the 
last three years as we successfully adapted to the 
challenges of the smoking ban, the banking crisis 
and the recession. 
We have a strong business which has been 
augmented in the last two years by two significant 
initiatives. Firstly, we have invested over £100m 
from our rights issue in high quality, freehold, 
retail outlet acquisitions from our competitors 
and below par debt buybacks. T o date, the 
average return on the capital invested in the 
acquisitions is 19.4%, as we use our operating 
expertise and brand strength to drive material 
uplifts in sales and profit. Secondly, we have 
continued investing in our estate, particularly 
in our leading pub restaurant brands, which has 
delivered exceptional returns in recent years. 
The success of these initiatives has enabled 
Greene King to emerge from the recession in a 
stronger position to take advantage of the further 
opportunities for growth and market share gains 
that exist. Whilst risks still remain, this success 
gives us confidence to accelerate the pace of 
change and growth at Greene King towards a 
more retail and branded focus.

Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
Business Review
The main elements of our strategy over the next 
three to five years are:
1. Expand branded retail
Drive growth through expanding our branded, 
food-led, retail estate. We are targeting 1,100 
outlets, from our current base of 888, through a 
combination of acquisitions and internal transfers 
from tenancy. We see opportunities for growth 
in our destination pubs and restaurants, pubs 
with rooms and traditional suburban pubs.
2. Improve quality and reduce size of 
tenanted estate
Generate sustainable and improved rates 
of cash returns from a higher quality, more 
customer focused, tenanted estate. As part of 
this process, we will reduce the estate from our 
current base of 1,584 outlets to c. 1,200 through 
a combination of disposals and transfers to retail. 
We will further leverage our purchasing scale and 
retail infrastructure to deliver higher returns for 
our licensees and our shareholders. 
3. Increase core beer brand investment
Deliver continued profitable growth in our 
branded beer business through additional 
investment in Greene King IPA, the UK’s leading 
cask ale, Old Speckled Hen, the UK’s leading 
premium ale and Belhaven Best, Scotland’s 
leading ale brand.
Overall, our aim is to be the best pub and 
beer business in Britain and we believe this retail 
expansion and brand investment strategy will help 
us achieve that over the next three to five years. 
It will generate faster, profitable sales growth, 
supported by enhanced purchasing and operating 
synergies, to deliver a step change in our focus on 
retail and increase our exposure to the long-term 
growth of the eating out market. This acceleration 
in our retail expansion will be financed through 
our existing funding headroom, the remaining 
rights issue proceeds and the accelerated tenanted 
disposal programme. We will continue to generate 
strong trading cash flows to maintain our ongoing 
investment requirements, meet our debt obligations 
and pay dividends to shareholders. 
Our focus in Retail is about 
delivering outstanding value, 
exceptional service and 
unbeatable quality across 
the different segments of our 
business – an approach that 
enables us to consistently 
deliver a compelling customer 
offer , whilst ensuring local fit. 
Our recent success 
gives us confidence 
to accelerate the pace 
of change and growth 
towards a more retail 
and branded focus. 08

CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S REvIEW
Greene King Retail
Greene King Retail achieved record revenue of 
£589.2m, 3.5% above last year, and operating 
profit of £106.4m, up 0.8% on last year . Like-for-like 
(LFL) sales were also strong at +3.5%. This was 
driven by the repositioning of the estate towards 
food, in which we achieved LFL sales growth of 
8.8%. As a result, food has grown a further 
200bps to 37% of sales. We also achieved full 
year growth in LFL drink sales and second half 
growth in machine income. Although operating 
margins fell 40bps in the year, due to mix and 
first half cost pressures, second half margins 
were in line with last year. A key element of our 
operational strategy in Retail is to reposition the 
business towards long-term growth categories 
and all of our target product categories achieved 
growth in the year. On a per pub basis, food sales 
were up 10%, wine sales were up 7%, soft drink 
sales were up 5% and coffee sales were up 2%. 
We direct the greatest share of our capital 
investment programme towards Retail as we 
focus on driving profitable sales growth via the 
expansion of our food-led pub restaurant brands. 
In the year, we invested £20.6m of expansionary 
capital, a further £24.4m was invested in maintaining 
our pubs and restaurants and £9.0m was spent 
on repairs from the revenue account. We invested 
£13.4m in 43 Hungry Horse outlets, taking the 
total number of Hungry Horse outlets to 147, 
and we invested over £2m in 12 Old English Inns 
outlets, as we step up the pace of our redevelopment 
programme. The Local Pubs ‘sparkle’ programme 
has now covered 160 outlets with an average 
investment of £49k per outlet. We have now 
invested in 54% of the Retail estate in the last 
three years, still leaving a significant opportunity 
for further investment and brand expansion. 
Our operational focus in Retail is on delivering 
outstanding value, exceptional service and unbeatable 
quality (VSQ) across the different segments of our 
business. Within both of our Retail divisions we have 
tailored our offer by brand or operating template. 
This approach enables us to consistently deliver 
a compelling customer offer, whilst ensuring local 
fit where necessary. 
Hungry Horse (147 outlets) 
Hungry Horse has had another exceptional year, 
in which the brand has grown from 119 outlets 
at the start of the year to 147 by the year-end. 
It has delivered LFL sales growth of 11.6% this 
year, following growth of 8.4% last year and the 
average weekly turnover (AWT) grew 7.7% to 
£18.3k. We have further improved our value 
offer this year, with ‘2 for £8’ meal deals in the

has helped to drive cover growth of 28%. Food 
is now almost 50% of the sales mix. We have 
introduced new technology to ensure consistent 
15 minutes food service time, which has helped 
to push Hungry Horse mystery guest scores 
above 90% for the first time, and we have 
continued to innovate our food offer with new, 
quality dishes such as the ‘Hell’s Chicken Burger’. 
Old English Inns (101 outlets) 
Old English Inns (OEI) has also performed 
well this year. Following our investment in 
‘beds, breakfasts and bathrooms’ within our 
accommodation sites, the introduction of a ‘2

redesign and redevelopment of the brand, OEI 
has delivered strong LFL sales growth of 4.6%.

standards by introducing a ‘part-table service’

quality of the specialist whisky and gin ranges. 
Loch Fyne Restaurants (44 outlets)
Midway through the first half of the year, 
we completed the integration of Loch Fyne 
Restaurants (LFR) into the Destination Division. 
LFR has performed in line with the UK restaurant 
sector this year with LFL covers down and spend 
per head up. In line with our other brands, we 
have selectively introduced additional value to 
our menu to drive cover growth at the planned 
expense of the average meal price, while ensuring 
we continue to deliver the high quality standards 
and service our customers expect from LFR.
Hardy’s House (37 outlets)
Hardy’s House is a suburban, destinational 
food-led brand, located predominantly in the 
Midlands and the north of England. As with our 
other destination pub brands, Hardy’s House 
grew its covers strongly, up 11.6%, with average 
spend per head in line with last year. Initiatives in 
the year included Fish and Chips ‘your way’, 
adding flexibility to the customer offer and free 
side dishes for customers who were not offered 
one when they ordered their meal, driving 
better service. 
Premium Locals (123 outlets)
Premium Locals achieved total sales growth 
of 9.0% in the year driven by LFL sales growth, 
a strong underlying performance in our London 
pubs and the acquisition of eight pubs from 
Punch T averns. LFL food sales grew 10.6% and 
food participation is now 27%. Food growth 
was due to both average cover growth of 5.7% 
and spend per head growth of 4.5% as we 
introduced better quality and targeted menus 
and incentivised employees on selling up starters, 
desserts and side orders. We improved our female 
appeal through a more attractive product range 
including Prosecco, sharing platters and our 
exclusive and award-winning wine list. 
Mainstream Locals (193 outlets)
Mainstream Locals achieved LFL food sales up 
and LFL drink sales down. Food participation is 
now 17.0%, up 1.5%pts on last year, and we 
grew both covers and spend per head in the year. 
Our Mainstream Locals segment benefits from its 
convenience to our customers with particularly 
strong community and high street locations. 
We introduced additional value through a food 
‘Rhythm of the Week’ offering daily meal deals 
and offering Carlsberg at £1.99 per pint during 
selected sports events and we completed a 
comprehensive upgrade of our television screens, 
both internally and externally, well ahead of the 
World Cup. 
value Locals (120 outlets)
During the year, we took the most successful 
elements of our Local Savers ‘Every Day Low 
Pricing’ promotion and extended them across 
the  whole Value Locals estate. For example, 
we introduced ‘known-value item’ pricing such 
as Carlsberg at £1.79 per pint, Ruddles at £1.59 
per pint and Blossom Hill at £5.99 per bottle. 
Machine income was much improved in the year, 
helped by the speed of our implementation and 
the quality of our merchandising around the £70

CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S REvIEW
Pub Partners
On an estate with 5.1% fewer pubs, revenue 
was down 6.5% at £145.1m and operating profit 
was down 8.9% to £64.6m. Average EBITDA 
per pub was down 3.2% but, in the second half 
of the year, due to better volume trends, tighter 
controls and the impact of the non-core disposal 
programme, average EBITDA per pub was +0.2%. 
During the year, £8.7m was invested in the 
estate, the majority in the second half, of which 
£4.7m was maintenance capex and £4.0m was 
expansionary capex, including our investment 
in Brulines’ i-draught technology. An additional 
£2.0m was spent on repairs through the revenue 
account. An average of 1,372 sites traded over 
the period. At the start of the financial year, 
1,391 sites were trading, nine were transferred 
to Retail and 65 were sold, of which 38 were 
closed. The closing balance was therefore 
1,355 sites. 
The inherent strengths of Pub Partners include: 
our geographic bias to the South East, which 
offers relative protection from economic 
downturns; our preference for tenancies over 
leases, which facilitated the changes required 
to stabilise the business; our high quality assets; 
our relationship with our beer brands and our 
corporate brand, which ensures a consistently 
high level of service and quality to our licensees; 
and our high standards of recruitment and 
training, which aims to ensure all of our pubs 
are run by talented, professional licensees. 
The simplicity and flexibility of our agreements 
is also an attraction to prospective licensees. 
We offer three substantive agreements: a one 
year foundation agreement for first-time licensees 
(20%); a three year rolling tenancy agreement 
with built-in tie flexibility (53%); and a ten to 
25 year assignable lease, free of all wine, spirits 
and minerals (WSM) ties (20%). As a result, 52% 
of all agreements are free of any WSM tie and 
only 55% of our licensees use a machine tie. 
Building on these strengths, we are now around 
halfway through our turnaround programme for 
Pub Partners, having made excellent progress, 
particularly in the last six months, and we believe 
Pub Partners is now leading the sector on 
performance and stability. There are clear 
indications of the business beginning to stabilise 
and this is directly linked to a number of key 
initiatives we have taken through the recession 
and in the last six months, including:
G  Creating the Independence Pub Company 
(IPC) to separate out those pubs that required 
a more flexible, focused and practical approach. 
There are currently 256 pubs in IPC, down 
from 404 at its launch, of which 83 have been 
disposed, eleven are closed for disposal and 
54 have returned to the core estate. We will 
re-integrate IPC back into the core estate 
during this year. 
G  Investing an industry-leading level of tenant 
financial support, totalling £5.1m or £3.7k per 
pub this year, split between our Crunch Time 
price initiative to drive licensee volume growth 
through enhanced value to their customers, 
and selective rent concessions and reductions 
to improve licensee profitability and cash flow. 
Further product enhancements to Crunch Time, 
which we have now rebranded ‘Love Y our 
Local’, have also been introduced, including an 
updated range of value-for-money food offers.

reopening at year-end, against 30 12 months ago, 
bad debts have reduced 40bps in 12 months to 
1.1% of sales and the average tenure of our licensees 
has grown to three years and nine months. 
Even though Pub Partners is now leading the 
industry in terms of performance and key licensee 
health measures, we believe there are still two 
specific challenges that Pub Partners is facing in 
common with the whole tenanted sector; the 
ongoing regulatory pressures on the tied model 
and the long-term viability of many tenanted and 
leased pubs, given their comparatively weak offer 
against managed pubs, branded restaurants and 
the supermarkets. We have therefore decided 
to implement two specific strategies to further 
cement Pub Partners’ position as the best 
tenanted and leased operator in the UK:
G  Use our new Code of Practice as a catalyst 
for organisational change within Pub Partners. 
Our aim is to create the most customer-focused 
  tenanted business with the strongest retail 
skills in the sector. We will drive significant 
improvements amongst our licensees, our 
offers and our pubs to enhance Pub Partners’ 
competitiveness through a repositioning 
towards a more retail-led approach. 
G  Accelerate the rate of disposals and transfers, 
across both Pub Partners and Belhaven, to retail 
to reduce the overall tenanted estate from 1,584 
outlets currently to c. 1,200 outlets, ensuring a 
capability to deliver sustainable cash returns for 
both our licensees and our shareholders.
We believe a smaller, more retail-focused 
business can ensure a profitable long-term future 
for Pub Partners, allowing it to take an active role 
in the development of Greene King. Our plan to 
only operate high quality, sustainable pubs run by 
customer-focused licensees and supported by 
better control and direction from Pub Partners, 
should see Pub Partners move back into 
sustainable per pub profit growth over the 
next 12 to 18 months.

Belhaven
In the last 18 months, there has been more 
change at Belhaven than in all the previous years 
of Greene King’s ownership combined, including 
senior management transition, the closure of the 
bottling plant and a critical back-office integration 
project. Y et, notwithstanding this, Belhaven again 
delivered a record result. Revenue was up 
11.7% to £151.9m with operating profit up 
8.3% to £32.7m. The operating margin was 
marginally behind last year in the second half of 
the year and ended the year at 21.5%, 70bps 
down on last year, entirely due to changes in the 
channel mix. Profits grew strongly in both retail 
and brewing with underlying profit per pub only 
marginally down in tenancies. The number of 
pubs trading grew from 325 to 334 and, on 
average, 331 were trading during the year.
Belhaven’s continued success in Scotland 
is built upon its unique focus on the Scottish 
market, operating a high quality pub estate in 
a fragmented market, supplemented by quality 
acquisitions, selling the leading ale and lager 
brands both within the Belhaven estate and to 
its free trade customers, a strong and stable 
management team, the ongoing support and 
investment from Greene King and, most 
crucially, a retention of its Scottishness in a 
market in which this is highly valued. 
In retail, Belhaven achieved LFL sales growth of 
5.5%. This was led by the strong performance from 
our destination food-led pub restaurant brand, 
Eating Inn. Both drink and food LFLs were positive, 
with food up 15% in the year taking food participation 
to 29% of sales. Including the impact of acquisitions, 
total sales grew 20% in the year, driven by 
strategically important categories such as food 
+28%, wine +29%, soft drinks +19% and 
coffee +21%. We made a total of fourteen 
acquisitions in the year including packages from 
Punch and Mitchells & Butlers. They are trading 
well and in line with our expectations. 
Our tenanted and leased business in Scotland 
has delivered a solid performance. Although LFL 
volumes were down, the wholesale margin per 
barrel and rent were both up, leading to gross 
profits in line with last year. We have shared 
many of the learnings from Pub Partners’ 
experiences since the recession hit and 
Belhaven’s tenanted business is well prepared 
for any further economic pressure in Scotland. 
Licensee health measures have remained stable 
throughout the year. 
Belhaven Best, Scotland’s no.1 ale brand, has 
again led a strong performance from Belhaven’s 
brewing division. Best volumes grew 15.4% in 
the year, whilst our other own-brewed volumes 
grew 28%. We therefore made significant market 
share gains and increased the awareness of the 
Belhaven Best brand. We grew the number of 
free trade accounts by 8% to over 2,100 and 
we again came first in the annual Dram customer 
service survey.

Brewing Company
Brewing Company has once again strongly 
outperformed the UK ale market over the 
last 12 months. Our own-brewed ale brands 
achieved volume growth of 3.6% against a 
market down 6.3%, according to the BBPA. 
As a result, our share of the ale market rose 
90bps to over 9%. Sales to external channels 
account for 80% of our own-brewed volumes 
and all channels achieved volume growth in the 
year, with particularly strong performances from 
Free T rade and T ake Home. Our volume growth 
translated into revenue of £97.9m, 4.3% above 
last year, and operating profit of £21.4m, 0.9% 
above last year. Margins fell 70bps due to mix 
and higher input prices from third party suppliers.
Our aim is to be the best branded beer company 
in England by delivering the best value, service and 
quality to our customers across all trade channels. 
Our success can be measured by the fact that we 
produce three of the top ten ales in the on trade* 
and three of the top ten premium ales in the off 
trade.** Additionally, we won Cask Brewer of the 
Y ear in the Morning Advertiser’s Supplier Awards, 
and more recently, we earned six Gold medals in 
the prestigious Monde Quality Awards.
We are strengthening our position through 
continued market-leading investment; our 
support of England Rugby; our focus on local 
provenance; and our advertising on Dave TV 
Channel. We concentrate brewing in one historic 
but highly efficient brewery in Bury St Edmunds 
and focus our brand investment in Greene King 
IPA, the country’s no.1 cask ale; Old Speckled 
Hen, the nation’s no.1 premium ale; and Abbot 
Ale, the UK’s no.2 premium cask ale. 
We are well positioned to capture the benefits 
of the increasing interest in provenance and 
quality given our historic and long-term commitment 
to best ingredients and traditional brewing. Over 
85% of our barley is grown locally and malted 
within two miles of the brewery; our water is 
drawn from artesian wells below the brew 
house; our unique yeasts are cultivated on site 
and 98% of the hops we use are English. We are 
the only brewer to have Red T ractor status across 
all of our brands.
Greene King IPA continues to expand its national 
footprint, whilst maintaining its traditional heartland 
in the south east of England. Our innovative Cask 
Revolution font is now installed in over 1,000 outlets 
and we are planning to double that number this 
year. It is generating a strong return on investment 
and, on average, increasing Greene King IPA 
outlet rate of sale by 9% over traditional fonts. 
The brand’s status as ‘Official Beer of England 
Rugby’ has been extended to 2012 and we 
continue to sponsor Sale Sharks, Wasps, 
Harlequins and grass roots rugby across 
the country. 
Old Speckled Hen, which last year celebrated 
its 30th anniversary, continues to strengthen 
its position, particularly through its advertising 
campaign on the Dave TV channel. It is ‘the 
brand that ale drinkers most want to see on the 
bar next time they go to the pub and on the 
shelves next time they go to the supermarket’***, 
and it achieved volume growth of over 7% this 
year. In T ake Home it has reached a 12% value 
share and the brand now accounts for two thirds 
of our exports, growing particularly strongly in the 
important US craft beer market.

Current trading and outlook
We have continued to trade strongly in the first 
eight weeks of the new financial year to 27 June, 
particularly in our retail operations. Retail LFL 
sales are +6.0% and Belhaven retail LFL sales 
are +1.5%. Pub Partners continues to stabilise 
with average EBITDA per pub broadly in line with 
last year. Brewing Company total volumes are 
+3.6%, own-brewed volumes are –2.7% and 
Belhaven Best volumes remain strong at +7.1%. 
The overall Greene King performance in the first

and ahead of our expectations for the period. 
Looking ahead, we are hopeful that the coalition 
government will be more supportive of our industry 
and look forward to working closely with them 
on responsible drinking, the tie and alcohol duty. 
Given the possible impact of the emergency 
budget on consumer spending, trading conditions 
are likely to remain challenging. However, we are 
confident that our current trading momentum 
and our plans for future growth, underpinned 
by our high quality assets, industry leading brands 
and talented people, will ensure that we deliver 
another successful year for Greene King and 
its shareholders.

FINANCIAL REvIEW
Group revenue grew 3.1% during the year 
to £984.1m, helped in particular by a 3.5% 
growth in our Retail businesses. This growth 
was achieved despite an estate 2.7% smaller 
in absolute size and in an environment that 
continued to be challenging. Our gross margins 
held up well and, through our consistent focus on 
costs and cash, we were able to more than offset 
the year-on-year increase of £11.8m non-wage 
costs and inflation, particularly in drinks and 
utilities. Operating margins were held to within 
1.1% of last year, with the change in mix across 
our business units, net inflation and share-based 
payment charge accounting for almost all of 
the change in margin. Operating profit before 
exceptionals of £211.3m was down 2.3% on last 
year, with H2 stronger than H1. Interest costs of 
£88.3m were 9.6% lower than last year, despite 
the inclusion of £3.3m of pension interest, reflecting 
our strong positive cash flows, net of capex, and 
the use of proceeds from our successful rights issue. 
Profit before tax and exceptionals was £123.0m, 
an increase of 3.8% on last year, delivering 
earnings per share of 43.4p per share, down 
18.7% on last year from the higher number 
of shares post rights issue.
Positive free cash flow maintained 
We again continued our focus on cash. The group 
delivered £264.4m EBITDA, down only 1% on 
last year from 2.7% fewer pubs. With another 
year of strong cash management, including £9.0m 
of working capital inflow, the group has a strong 
cash platform. We continued to invest in the core 
estate for both maintenance and expansionary 
purposes, to pay down debt (ahead of our normal 
amortisation) and to pay dividends to shareholders. 
This has been and remains a very consistent part 
of our long term financial strategy, particularly so 
in this challenging climate.
Continued investment and disposals 
£78.5m of capex was spent across the estate 
as part of an annual plan to keep capex broadly 
flat on a comparable estate year-over-year. This 
delivered returns ahead of our cost of capital 
across over 300 schemes in the year. We firmly 
believe that continued investment benefits our 
estate and the business in both the short and the 
longer term. We also disposed of 105 trading 
and non-trading assets, realising £27.2m net 
proceeds, £1.0m ahead of book value. 
As part of the use of the rights issue proceeds, 
we purchased 28 high quality, freehold, managed 
pubs during the year which were quickly integrated 
into our retail estates. They are trading well 
against our expectations.
Financing and treasury
We successfully completed a 3 for 5 rights issue 
in May 2009 and raised net proceeds of £207.2m 
to be used for both targeted acquisitions and the 
opportunistic repurchase of below-par securitised 
debt. We made total investments of £91.1m, which 
utilised 44% of the proceeds in under a year from 
receipt of funds. As well as purchasing pubs as 
outlined above, we also repurchased £30.3m 
aggregate principal amount of bonds, at a weighted 
average purchase price of £524 per £1,000. 
These bonds have now been cancelled.
Net debt at the year end stood at £1,348.1m, 
down £210.5m from the previous year end. 
There was no short term debt outstanding at 
the year end in relation to our £400m bank 
facility, which remains available until April 2012. 
Our high quality and primarily freehold assets 
support £1,380m of securitised bonds. These 
have a flat debt service profile, with £23.6m 
amortisation in the year. 
Summary of financial review
Group revenue grew 3.1% during the year 
to £984.1m
The group delivered £264.4m EBITDA, down 
only 1% on last year from 2.7% fewer pubs

During the year, there was a further 
improvement in our overall credit metrics, 
with interest rate hedges in place for 100% 
of the group’s floating rate debt at an overall 
blended interest rate of 6.1%. Fixed charge cover 
improved to 2.4x, up from 2.1x last year, and 
interest cover likewise improved to 2.5x from 
2.2x last year. Net debt/EBITDA was down to 
5.1x, in line with our targeted level, and this will 
continue to move slightly as proceeds are further 
invested ahead of the earnings stream they 
generate. Our securitised vehicle had a free 
cash flow debt service cover ratio of 1.5x at 
the year end, giving 27% headroom.
Dividend 
The proposed final dividend of 15.6p per share 
takes the full year dividend to 21.5p per share, 
an increase of 2.4% against the dividend of 21.0p 
per share last year, adjusted for the effect of the 
rights issue. The board continues to adopt a 
dividend policy targeting dividend cover of 
around two times underlying earnings.

£78.7m, compared with £91.6m at the previous 
balance sheet date. 
The majority of the group pension schemes 
have completed their triennial valuations since 
the year end. Following constructive dialogue 
with the schemes’ trustees, the group has 
increased its overall cash contribution from 
£6.6m to £13.6m per annum, comfortably 
within the cash flow expectations for the group.
exceptional items
We recorded £21.1m of exceptional charges 
during the year, as a result of their nature or size. 
We continue to review the pubs in the tail of our 
estate and recognised an impairment of £37.3m 
against the net book value of a small proportion 
of our estate. The cumulative impairment in 
the last two years represents 4.6% of NBV , 
demonstrating the quality of the vast majority of 
our estate, whilst recognising some adjustments 
around specific sites. We achieved a profit on 
disposed properties of £1.0m during the year.
We also recognised a net gain of £10.2m on the 
£30.3m aggregate principal of bonds purchased 
in the year and the cancellation of associated 
interest rate swaps.
In April 2010, the group received VAT repayments 
totalling £7.0m from HMRC following a ruling in 
the T ribunal/Court of Appeal hearings involving 
Rank plc in relation to the application of VAT on 
gaming machines. Questions raised during the 
Rank case have been referred to the European 
Court of Justice and are due to be heard in 2011. 
In the meantime, HMRC has issued protective 
assessments to recover these repayments in the 
event they are successful with their appeal. The 
group has appealed these protective assessments 
but, should HMRC be successful on appeal, the 
group would be required to repay the £7.0m of 
VAT with interest. An exceptional gain of £6.8m 
net of associated costs has been recognised.  
impact of the budget
The reduction in the rate of corporation tax by 
1% per year for the next four years is welcomed. 
We hope this is alongside continued support, 
via appropriate capital expenditure and other 
allowances, for businesses such as ours to be 
encouraged to maintain investment levels. 
Post balance sheet events
On 11 June we announced the purchase of 
four additional freehold managed sites from 
Punch T averns PLC for £5.3m, bringing the total 
number of pubs purchased with the rights issue 
proceeds to 34 sites. We have now invested 
a total of £103.3m, or 50%, of the right issue 
proceeds. We continue to focus on accretive 
opportunities in both acquiring pubs and 
repurchasing below-par debt.
Summary
The year was once again a challenging one, 
and it is pleasing to report a resilient performance 
both operationally and financially. We have strong 
operational cash flows from well managed and 
consistently invested freehold assets, backing long 
term finance at competitive rates. Our financial 
strategy allows us to pay down debt, continue to 
invest in our estate and increase dividend returns 
to shareholders, which all supports our continued 
focus on growth. Whilst the coming months and 
years may hold further uncertainty and challenge, 
our financial strength gives us confidence that we 
will continue to make further progress in what 
remains a difficult environment.

Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Greene King is exposed to a variety of economic, 
regulatory, operational and financial risks and 
uncertainties. Formal risk management processes 
are in place to identify and evaluate such risks, 
whether they are internal or external. The processes 
take into account the likelihood of their occurrence, 
the scale of their potential impact on the business 
and the impact of planned risk mitigation actions, 
so that risks can be ranked and actions suitably 
prioritised. Given that some risks are external and 
not fully within our control, the risk management 
processes are designed to manage risks which 
may have a material impact on our business, 
rather than to fully mitigate all risks.
Each business unit or function area regularly 
reviews the risks it faces and considers the extent 
of mitigation plans already in place. Where new 
risks or gaps in mitigation plans are identified, 
action plans are drawn up, with costings where 
appropriate, to ensure that the risks are appropriately 
managed. The senior management teams of 
each business unit monitor the progress of these 
risk implementation plans on a regular basis. 
A company-wide risk committee reviews in detail 
and monitors those risk mitigation plans, ensuring 
that plans work across the group as well as the 
sharing of best practice. 
At executive level, each of the risks has an 
identified owner to ensure senior management 
accountability for risk mitigation measures. Each 
business unit managing director is required to 
present a report to the audit committee once 
a year on the risk management processes for 
which he is responsible. The audit committee 
also reviews the company’s top risks, as set out 
on the group’s risk register, on an annual basis, 
prior to their submission to the board, which 
retains ultimate responsibility for the company’s 
risk management framework.
The paragraphs below highlight some of the key 
risks and uncertainties which affect Greene King 
but are not intended to be an exhaustive analysis 
of all risks facing the business. 
economic risks
Risks
The impact of the recession since 2009 and the 
continuing economic uncertainty and consequential 
impact on consumer expenditure have the potential 
to affect our business. Significant cuts in public 
spending have already been announced and 
the increase in VAT announced in the budget 
will have an impact on levels of consumer 
discretionary spend. Further changes to the 
inflation and cost environment will remain an 
ongoing risk to the business. Our licensees are 
also affected by the current economic climate, 
leading to the risk of more tenant defaults and 
business failures. 
Property values are also impacted by the 
economic uncertainty, and with it our ability to 
continue to make disposals at appropriate values.
Mitigation processes
The board and the senior management team 
regularly review the impact of the economic 
conditions on the group’s budget and strategic 
plans, to ensure that we maintain our competitive 
position in the market. By prioritising excellent 
quality, service, value for money and up-to-date 
product offers, we aim to broaden our appeal to 
customers. We try to foster mutually beneficial 
and long-term relationships with our suppliers 
whilst at the same time driving down costs in all 
areas. We constantly monitor the vital signs of our 
licensee health, and look to provide our licensees 
with additional operational and financial support 
wherever needed and appropriate. 
We continue to regularly assess the long term 
value of each of our sites and make decisions on 
a site by site basis around further improvements, 
operational focus for poorer performing sites, 
appropriate impairments where necessary and 
the active marketing of sites that no longer have 
long-term value for Greene King.
We have a diversified business encompassing 
pubs, restaurants, brewing and drinks distribution, 
as well as a broad geographic spread.
Regulatory risks
Risks
The last few years have seen an increased focus 
on alcohol consumption, in regard to both its 
impact on the health of drinkers and law and 
order issues. There is a risk of further legislation 
in these areas which may adversely impact 
our business. 
We also have to deal with increasing regulatory 
requirements and the costs that these bring with 
them across many parts of our business. We strive 
to comply with legislative requirements in areas 
such as licensing and health and safety, any or all 
of which may adversely affect our business or 
cause harm to employees, customers or our 
licensees if not attended to. 
Notwithstanding that the European Union has 
renewed the block exemption with regard to the 
beer tie for a further ten years, uncertainty remains 
as to the UK government’s intentions in this regard, 
following the pronouncements of the previous 
UK government and of the Business, Innovation 
and Skills Committee during the early part of 2010. 
Mitigation processes
Our strategy continues to address the need to 
diversify our business, with increasing emphasis 
on food within our pubs. We are committed to 
acting as a responsible retailer and are actively 
engaging with government to ensure that it 
recognises our belief that the safest and most 
responsible place to consume alcohol is in 
well-managed licensed on-trade premises.
Each business unit or function area regularly reviews 
the risks it faces and considers the extent of mitigation 
plans already in place. Where new risks or gaps in 
mitigation plans are identified, action plans are drawn 
up, with costings where appropriate, to ensure that 
the risks are appropriately managed. Business Review

Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
We have a range of policies and procedures 
in place, including training, improved reporting 
and regular monitoring, to ensure compliance 
with existing regulatory requirements, including 
in relation to health and safety, fire safety and 
food safety. We offer training and support to our 
licensees in many of these areas. We work closely 
with licensing authorities across the country to 
ensure licensing requirements are dealt with 
whenever appropriate.
We remain committed to the tied pub model 
and firmly believe that abolition of the tie would 
lead to accelerated pub closures due to the 
higher costs of entry and ongoing overheads for 
licensees. Whilst we are working hard to improve 
transparency in relations with our tenants we also 
intend to engage with the new government to 
ensure the benefits of the tied model are fully 
appreciated by it. 
Supply chain risks
Risks
Alongside the production and distribution of 
our own beers, we work with a number of key 
suppliers (particularly in relation to food, lager 
and wines, spirits and minerals) and third party 
distributors to supply our pubs and restaurants. 
There is therefore a risk of interruption of supply 
and of failure of such key suppliers or distributors.
Mitigation processes
We have detailed risk mitigation and risk 
management plans in our internal production 
and distribution activities, and are always looking 
to improve and learn from other best-in-class 
operators. We have an on-going programme of 
testing our disaster-recovery systems relating to 
our own brewing and distribution operations. 
We work closely with our third-party suppliers, 
producers and supply chain partners to ensure 
that our relationships with them are positive and 
constructive at all times. We regularly review the 
financial position of our major suppliers to assess 
the risk of them ceasing to be able to trade and 
with the help of external consultants we monitor 
the financial stability of those we regard as of 
highest risk. As well as reviewing the disaster 
recovery plans of key suppliers, we also continuously 
review our own back-up plans which are designed 
to ensure that we can cope in the event of the 
failure by or loss of a key supplier. 
Reputational risks
Risks
We are a consumer facing business with some 
well known national brands. Our reputation could 
be damaged by a failure to properly execute our 
branded models, litigation, regulatory intervention, 
major health and safety failures or poor handling 
of customer complaints. This in turn could lead to 
a loss of trade and a reduction in our perceived 
valuation by key stakeholders. 
Mitigation processes
We endeavour to maintain tight controls to 
protect and enhance our reputation and brand 
values. We focus constantly on consistency and 
quality, with staff training, targeted investment 
programmes and mystery guest visits all designed 
to help maintain standards, and have systems in 
place to escalate and respond to relevant incidents. 
Our health and safety policies and procedures 
are explained above. 
Financial and systems control risks
Risks
It is vital to the business that we continue to 
meet our financial covenants and to ensure that 
there is sufficient short term financing to meet 
our business needs. We are exposed to interest 
rate risk on the variable and floating rate 
components of our financing.
We are also reliant on maintaining sound systems 
of internal control and on our information 
systems and technology to ensure the smooth 
operation of our business without risk of fraud 
or material error. 
Mitigation processes
We constantly monitor our performance against 
our financial covenants and undertake detailed 
stress-testing of our performance against those 
covenants on a regular basis. Working capital is 
closely managed and carefully forecast. At the 
year end 100% of our securitised floating rate 
debt was hedged through the use of derivative 
financial instruments, more details of which can 
be found in note 23 to the financial statements.
We have during the last two years devoted 
considerable resources to the introduction 
of a new single platform financial accounting 
system which has unified the systems, processes 
and organisation of our finance teams, thereby 
enhancing our systems of internal control. 
A business continuity plan is in place to regularly 
review our critical business processes and ensure 
that we can continue to operate in the event of a 
major incident affecting our systems or technology.
People risks
Risks
We recognise the importance across all our 
managed and tenanted pubs, our brewing 
operations and our head office of attracting, 
retaining, developing and motivating the best 
people to help take our business forward and 
to ensure that we can deliver our operational 
and strategic objectives. 
Mitigation processes
We aim for an environment where we can 
recruit  the best people and then through training, 
development and progression ensure that we 
retain them. Our licensee recruitment and 
training programmes, and the variety of rental 
agreements on offer, are designed to attract 
and retain the best quality licensees. 20

Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
CORPORAtE sOCiAl REsPOnsiBility REPORt
With our position as a leading brewer and retailer 
in the UK, with over 2,400 pubs in over 1,800 
villages, towns and cities across mainland Britain, 
and as an employer of over 18,000 people, 
comes a responsibility to ensure that we conduct 
our business in an ethical and responsible manner. 
Building a sustainable business in which we 
create value for our customers and shareholders 
and maximise the potential of our staff and 
tenants whilst being a responsible corporate 
citizen is of paramount importance. 
The key CSR issues for our business are:
G Food safety and supply
G The environmental impacts of our business
G Providing a positive working environment
G  Retaining, developing and attracting talent 
with fair and rewarding terms and conditions
G  The health and safety of our staff and customers
G  Support for the communities in which we operate 
G Responsible retailing
G Support for our tenants
Food safety and supply
Food safety and the security of supply are 
of vital importance to us and our customers. 
We require all our suppliers to have either British 
Retail Consortium (BRC) or Safe and Local Supplier 
Approval (SALSA) accreditation. All food products 
supplied to us must meet our strict labelling 
requirements and our suppliers must be able 
to demonstrate full traceability of all products 
supplied and ensure that all products, labour 
and ingredients fall within ethical guidelines.
Palm oil has been in the headlines this year but 
we are pleased to report that our supplies are 
from ethical sources. Our supplier is a founder 
member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 
Oil and has actively worked to promote the 
sustainable production of palm oil for a number 
of years. They set up and support the Green Palm 
certificate trading programme, which pays a 
premium direct to those palm oil producers 
using sustainable methods.
Loch Fyne
With sustainable fishing and fish stocks also 
high on the agenda, our Loch Fyne Restaurants 
chain continues to lead the way in its approach 
to environmental issues and to share best 
practice across the organisation. Following 
the release of his film “The End of the Line” 
Charles Clover created a web site to rank the 
most sustainable restaurants – Loch Fyne topped 
the sustainable food tables on www.fish2fork.com 
and ‘set the online standard for information about 
the seafood it sells’.
Loch Fyne takes advice from respected marine 
bodies regarding the fish and seafood they serve. 
Where species are not plentiful they will find 
alternatives and will not source fish caught by 
methods deemed to be harmful to the marine 
ecosystem such as deep-sea trawlers, beam 
trawlers or industrial long-liners. The approach 
at Loch Fyne has been shared with the rest of 
our retail business as they lead the way on best 
practice in this area. This year all fish served in 
our Retail division was line-caught.
Scores on the Doors
Greene King continues to support the adoption 
of a national “Scores on the Doors” scheme to 
give clarity to customers on what standards to 
expect, and to enable all operators to achieve 
a recognised industry standard. In areas where 
this scheme does operate, we have regularly 
achieved 5 star excellent ratings and are now 
working, through our ‘Kitchens of Excellence’ 
training and mentoring scheme, to ensure all 
of our pubs exceed this standard. Greene King 
now has 22 pubs and restaurants ranked good 
to excellent across the UK.
healthy eating inn
In Scotland, our ‘Healthy Eating in Schools’ initiative 
came out of local contacts between our Lime Kiln 
Eating Inn and its local primary school. It began with 
schoolchildren designing birthday cards and cake 
decorating at the restaurant and has led to a healthy 
eating programme across the brand. 
After the success of the cake decorating the school 
asked us to come back during healthy eating week. 
Eating Inns set to work with their local fruit and vegetable 
suppliers to create a fun, educational experience for 
the children. During the day the children were given 
talks on the origins and benefits of different types of 
fruit and vegetables, which was accompanied 
by a tasting of some of the more exotic fruits 
such as kiwi fruit and mango. 
A treasure hunt for fruits followed along with a 
demonstration of kick boxing, from a member of 
staff at the Lime Kiln who is a kick boxing champion, 
to highlight the benefit of an active lifestyle. Fruit 
skewers were provided for break time and the children 
left with healthy lucky bags, which included vouchers 
for the local gym.
The model has now been replicated in other Eating 
Inn sites. 22

Going forward we have committed to the following:
G  Extending our work on publishing calorie, fat, 
salt and allergen information across our 
unbranded local pubs.
G  Working to reduce salt in 29 of our 
benchmarked products.
G  Increasing the range of healthier items on the 
children’s menu.
G  Working to better understand what customers 
want and need from calorie labelling on menus 
through research and testing.
environment
Our environmental impact is high on our 
agenda and our commitment to reduce that 
deeply embedded across our organisation. 
We have an energy champion for each pub 
and energy ambassadors for each area of the UK. 
Our ‘T urn it off’ and ‘Go Green’ campaigns aimed 
at all our staff have run successfully over the past 
three years, kept fresh and alive by our energy 
team. We have weekly telephone conferences 
with our energy champions and energy ambassadors. 
Our chief executive communicates regularly on 
progress and priorities in this area and invites 
feedback and suggestions through his monthly 
briefing, which goes to all 18,000 of our staff.
As a result of our work, we are the first brewer 
and pub operator in the UK to achieve the 
coveted Carbon T rust Standard after cutting 
carbon emissions by 7.8 per cent (11,941 tonnes) 
in the last three years. This reduction equates to 
the emissions produced by 35 million car miles, 
and would be enough to heat 3,834 average 
households for a year, or toast over 1.5 billion 
slices of bread.
The Carbon T rust Standard is the only 
independent award for companies that can 
verify they are cutting their carbon footprint and 
reducing their own direct impact on climate 
change year-on-year. Just 320 companies in 
the UK have been awarded the standard so far. 
The award is proof that we have taken real action 
on cutting our carbon emissions.
As we go forward and prepare to participate 
in the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme this year, 
much of the work carried out so far will put us 
in a good position, not only for the initial phase 
but, importantly, also for the subsequent phases 
where an ongoing carbon reduction programme 
is essential.
Last year we produced our first environment 
report and plan to continue to report our 
environmental progress separately in a more 
comprehensive report. However key data 
and key achievements are also reported above 
and below:
Key achievements this year include:
G  Reducing our overall CO
2
 emissions by 4.1% 
despite using more gas due to the winter snows.
G  Reducing our water use by 1.5% across the 
business and by 6% in our managed outlets, 
despite an increase in the numbers of outlets.
2
G  Collecting 891,373 litres of used cooking oil, 
6% more than the previous year, for recycling 
into biofuel.
Going forward we intend to:
G  Further reduce our CO
2
 emissions on a like 
for like basis by 2.5% in 2010/11.
G  Set out measures to reduce the amount 
of waste we send to landfill.
G  Install water meters across all our managed 
estate and set targets for water use reduction.
employee engagement
Our workforce is our greatest asset – our aim is 
to be an employer of choice. Greene King has a 
proud history of being a first-class employer. Our 
values of respect, honesty and courage, customer 
focus, results and execution underpin the way in 
which we do business.
We recruit, develop, reward and promote our 
staff on the basis of their skills and suitability for 
the role. We are committed to ensuring that all

Food safety and supply continued
Healthy eating 
Over the past year we have continued our 
work with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) 
on improving our menus and the nutritional 
information available to our diners. Our aim is to 
serve great tasting, quality food that provides our 
customers with choice through a wide range of 
menu options including fresh fruit, vegetables, fish 
and lean meat to support a healthy and balanced 
diet. We continue to develop lighter options and 
support our customers to make healthier choices. 
Our children’s menus offer fresh fruit, salad 
and fresh vegetables in line with the 5-a-day 
Government strategy on dealing with obesity. 
We have also introduced organic meals for 
children. In addition, as part of our community 
engagement, our Eating Inns in Scotland are 
working with suppliers and schools to encourage 
healthier eating through structured visits by 
local school children.
Baking and grilling are central cooking methods 
in our kitchens, where no salt is added in the 
cooking process. We now provide nutritional 
information to consumers across our branded 
outlets of Hungry Horse, Hardy’s House and 
Old English Inns. We are currently working on 
extending this work to all of our 436 unbranded 
managed pubs. In addition, we publish information 
for those suffering from Coeliac disease on these 
menus and have created gluten free menus for 
Hungry Horse and Hardy’s House.
Our progress in our Retail division this year:
G  Calorie, fat, salt and allergen information 
published via the web and in-house for 
Hungry Horse, Hardy’s and Old English Inns.
G  Children’s menus have had portion 
sizes reduced to bring them in line with 
Government nutritional guidelines.
G  We have begun work our suppliers on the 
FSA’s 2012 salt reduction targets to ensure 
they understand and work with us on our 
commitment to achieving these.
G  We have benchmarked 159 of our best 
selling products against salt targets. 23

trained to food safety standard Level T wo and in 
the past year over 650 staff have been trained to 
National Certificate for Personal License Holders 
(NCPLH) standard.
Recruitment
Recruitment is a key area for our business 
to help ensure we have the right people to 
deliver our vision. This year we entered into 
a partnership with Job Centre UK to offer job 
trials to people considering a career in one of 
our businesses. Greene King is proud to be 
‘BACKING YOUNG BRITAIN’ – the campaign 
to encourage businesses to provide more 
opportunities for young people through jobs, 
apprenticeships and work experience.
We also support people who might face barriers 
to employment to achieve their full potential 
and in one such case, at the Bradmore Arms in 
Wolverhampton, our work was recognised when 
we were runner-up in the Local Employment 
Partnership Awards. 
Future development 
With an eye on the future of our business and 
attracting the best talent, we have relaunched 
and improved our graduate training scheme. 
This year we are aiming to attract 50 managers 
of the future from universities across the UK. 
This investment in attracting and training the best 
personnel is a key strand of our business growth 
strategy and will see successful candidates running 
their own venues within the estate by the third 
year of the programme. 
health and safety
Greene King enjoys an excellent health and safety 
record and is committed to the promotion of a 
positive safety culture and to ensuring that we do 
all we can to protect our staff and customers. 
master Chef
Employee engagement goes beyond communication 
and staff surveys, it is also about involving our staff 
at every level in the organisation. 
In our Destination Division our chefs were invited, 
through our own ‘MasterChef’ competition, to create a 
new dish to be served in our pubs, and hotels. This year, 
the second year of the competition, 45 chefs across 38 
pubs vied for the title ‘MasterChef’. The ‘brief’ was to 
create a new home made dish that could be used in the 
spring/summer menu.
Competition was fierce and the standard of dishes 
extremely high. Four dishes went through to the final 
where they were judged by a panel of food experts, 
who rated them according to aroma, texture and taste, 
before being given an overall score. The winning dish of 
baked cod, crushed new potatoes with bacon and peas 
with roasted cherry tomatoes was created by Marc 
Henry from the Cross House, Liverpool.
The competition forms part of our drive for constant 
quality and innovation across our pub menus and, 
by involving members of our staff in the pursuit of 
innovation, we aim to ensure they feel engaged 
and empowered. 24

This year has seen our organisation again 
awarded a number of prestigious health and

G  The RoSPA Gold Award for Occupational

Community
Our pubs are at the heart of the community they 
serve and we are committed to being an active 
and positive contributor to local communities. 
Greene King is proud to sponsor, in partnership 
with The East Anglian Daily Times, the Suffolk 
Community Awards. The awards are designed 
to celebrate the success of local people, community 
groups and organisations that have made a difference 
in their community and to the lives of those 
around them.
Charity
We recognise the importance of establishing 
good relationships with the communities in 
which we operate, and work in partnership 
with a number of charitable organisations. 
We appreciate that a mix of financial support, 
as well as actual involvement with time, skills 
and donations in kind are all beneficial when 
investing in charities and communities. 
T o help either good local, national or international 
causes, many of our employees, licensees and 
customers across the UK get involved in raising 
money through a varied range of activities such 
as sports events, quizzes, raffles, auctions, and 
karaoke. Last year, our English managed pubs 
raised in excess of £200,000 for local and 
national charities and causes. 
Our largest single fund raising activity this year 
involved over 20 members of our team who joined 
Lawrence Dallaglio to cycle 417km from Paris to 
London for Sport Relief and the Dallaglio Foundation 
in a bid to raise a further £60,000 for charity.
By demonstrating to our employees that we are 
responsive to the charities and organisations they 
most care about, we facilitate their giving in 
a variety of ways including product donations, 
old Speckled hen serves 
those who serve us
Servicemen and women on their flight back from 
Afghanistan were treated to a well-deserved taste 
of home when, in support of the Beer for the Boys 
campaign, our distribution centre in Abingdon donated 
thousands of cans and bottles of Old Speckled Hen to 
Brize Norton and to local barracks in Dalton. 
Our beer helped to quench the thirst of those returning 
from active service. Both bases play a very important 
 
role in the local community and our team at the depot 
wanted to do something to show their appreciation. 
Beer for the Boys is the brainchild of Wing Commander

payroll giving and volunteering. An example of 
product giving this year is highlighted through 
our involvement with ‘Beer for the Boys’. 
Responsible retailing
We strive to ensure that alcohol produced or 
sold by us is consumed responsibly. We were 
one of the founding members of the industry-led 
‘Why let the good times go bad’ Campaign for 
Smarter Drinking. Conceived in response to the 
Government’s challenge to the drinks industry 
to take action on binge drinking, the campaign 
was aimed at 18 – 30 year olds who drink 
irresponsibly more than once a month but no 
more than once a week. The aim was to provide 
practical information and advice in a non-patronising 
and intelligent way. We lent our support both 
financially and in promoting the campaign throughout 
our managed and tenanted divisions. 
This year we have undertaken an audit of all 
of our managed pubs in England and Scotland 
to ensure we comply fully with all legislation 
and with a view to producing a responsible 
retailing code across our managed business. 
Encouragingly, when benchmarked against our 
competitors’ published information, our standards 
are among the highest in the industry. 
All of our pubs operate Challenge 21 and, if you 
are lucky enough to appear under 21, you can 
expect to be asked to prove your age. Research 
shows that pubs turn away over one million 
customers each month who, when challenged, 
are unable to provide acceptable proof of age – 
indicating that the trade is making a huge effort 
to enforce the law and prevent underage sales.
T o help us in our efforts, this year we 
programmed all of our tills to challenge bar 
staff to check the age of the purchaser before 
completing the transaction. This prompt ensures 
that not selling alcohol to underage customers is 
always front of mind with front of house teams. 
T o continue this work we are talking to industry 
colleagues and encouraging them to join us in 
developing software which would display on the 
tills the latest year in which a customer would 
have to be born to be 18 or over.
Our promotional materials carry clear and 
concise messages encouraging sensible drinking 
and all bottles, cans and outer packaging for all 
our beers specify the number of units of alcohol 
and we have been an active participant in the 
Government’s consultation on drinks labelling.
We also support the Government’s anti-drink 
drive Christmas campaigns and last year 900 
Greene King pubs supported the Driver Friendly 
campaign, which offered free soft drinks to drivers.
Last year we donated £9,550 to The GREaT 
Foundation. Formerly known as the Responsibility 
in Gambling T rust, the GREaT Foundation was 
established as a charity in 2002 as Britain’s largest 
funding body responsible for tackling problem 
gambling through the funding of research, education 
and treatment from voluntary donations. 
Best Bar None
We support initiatives such as Best Bar None, 
the Home Office endorsed award scheme that 
accredits licensed premises for operating their 
business in an exemplary manner. In areas where 
the scheme operates we have now have 20 pubs 
with this accreditation.
Licensing in Scotland
Over the past year, Belhaven has successfully 
navigated through the transitional changes from 
the previous regime under the 1976 Act to the 
new system under the 2005 Act. In support 
of each application Belhaven has prepared 
documented evidence as to how it will support 
the five licensing objectives of:
G preventing crime and disorder;
G securing public safety;
G preventing public nuisance;
G protecting and improving public health; and
G protecting children from harm. 
As part of the new Licensing Act, each board region 
is required to establish a licensing forum which is a 
body consisting of all relevant stakeholders (police, 
community councils, licensing standards officers and 
trade representatives). Belhaven is represented in 
each of the licensing forums where they hold a 
premises licence and see this as an important factor 
in supporting each of the licensing objectives. 
T op team at 
Shamblehurst Barn
A Greene King pub in Hedge End believes it now has 
the most highly-trained staff in the country. The team 
of 16 at the Shamblehurst Barn has undergone extensive 
training in alcohol retailing and the law as part of their 
National Certificate for Personal Licence Holders 
(NCPLH) qualification. 
Normally, pubs would have two or three senior staff 
holding the personal licence qualification but at The 
Shamblehurst everyone from the door supervisors 
through to bar and waiting staff now holds the certificate. 
The team also undertook drugs awareness training as 
part of their development. 
 
Manager Michael Wells explains: “I wanted every 
one of my team to be trained to the highest level. 
The Shamblehurst is a community family pub where 
all ages can come and enjoy themselves in a safe and 
secure environment. 
“With everyone in the team having undergone this training 
I believe I now have the best trained team in the country 
and our customers can be confident that alcohol will be 
sold responsibly and that we can spot, and put a stop to, 
any untoward behaviour immediately.” 26

BID schemes
Greene King was instrumental in setting up the 
Nottingham Business Improvement District (BID), 
the only BID nationally that is solely for the licensed 
economy, and is still an active member three 
years on. The BID’s aims are to improve safety 
in, the trading environment of, access to and the 
promotion of the core of Nottingham over and 
above the services already being provided by 
the city.
Working with our licensees
At Greene King we take a partnership approach 
to working with our licensees. We can and do 
support good businesses.
Go for Growth 
This year, as part of our support for new tenants 
taking on one of our pubs, we introduced mandatory 
training for all new licensees. We believe that it is vital 
in our industry to retain the good quality licensees 
and that to do that we need to give them the best 
start. Go for Growth ensures everyone has the right 
level of skills to operate one of our pubs and, equally 
importantly, the best platform to build their businesses 
in the long term. Last year 638 licensees went 
through the course and the results have been 
dramatic both in terms of business success and 
retention of licensees. 
Research carried out by Oxford Brookes 
University found that of the licensees who 
attended the induction programme:
G  96% plan for growth of their business rather 
than just working in it
G  96% review customer care as part of their 
ongoing strategy
G  96% developed and managed their staff 
more effectively
At Greene King we take 
a partnership approach 
to working with our 
licensees. We can and do 
support good businesses.
Green shoots
Prasong Suppadungchon is the licensee of the Old T om in Oxford and comes from a background in restaurants. 
Since attending the Go for Growth training course he has increased gross profits by 50% and reduced overheads 
by 10%. He had been so busy running the business and making it a great place for his customers to visit that he 
had completely forgotten about profit. Prasong felt the course totally boosted his confidence and focused 
his attention. 
After attending a second day some six months later, he would definitely recommend the course to others saying: 
“It makes you focus on what’s important to the business and spend time planning the way forward”.  27

1 Accounting policies
Corporate information 
The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 2 May 2010 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 
30 June 2010. Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s shares are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance 
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU as they 
apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 2 May 2010 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, Greene King Finance plc. 
Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring 
their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated, from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year with the exceptions noted below: 
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
The amended standard changes the definition of vesting conditions and prescribes the accounting treatment of an award that is effectively cancelled due 
to non-vesting conditions not being satisfied. The adoption of the amendment has had no material impact on the group’s results or financial position.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure 
The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. These disclosures have been incorporated in the 
consolidated accounts for the year ended 2 May 2010.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
The standard includes revised requirements for the identification, measurement and disclosure of segment information. The group has determined that 
its operating segments are the same as had previously been disclosed in accordance with IAS 14. The revised disclosures are included within note 2.
IAS 1 (Revised) Presentation of Financial Statements 
The revised standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income which presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single 
statement, or in two linked statements. The group has elected to present two statements, showing profit for the period and total comprehensive income 
respectively. Changes in total equity which are attributable to the owners of the parent company in their capacity as such are shown directly in the 
statement of changes in equity outside total comprehensive income.
IAS 23 (Revised) Borrowing Costs
The revised standard requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to an asset that necessarily takes a substantial amount of time 
to get ready for its intended use or sale. The adoption of the revised standard has had no impact on the group’s results or financial position.
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the assets (including previously unrecognised intangible assets) and 
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, and is stated at cost less any impairment in value. 
For the purposes of impairment testing goodwill is allocated at operating segment level which is the lowest group of cash-generating units where goodwill 
is monitored by management. Allocation is based on expectations of where benefits from the synergies of the combination will result. On disposal of a 
subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been 
carried forward as the carrying value. Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves. Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining profit or loss on disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, and 
short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. 
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to 20 years. financial Statements
37
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
1 Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment continued
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, if appropriate, 
at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Profit or loss 
on de-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is included in the income 
statement in the year of de-recognition. 
impairment 
Property, plant and equipment 
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash 
inflows of other groups of assets. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment. If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of 
the recoverable amount of each asset group, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated using the identified 
cash flows of the asset groups. 
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill. If there is an indication 
that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying amount of the asset 
is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years.  
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement. 
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment. Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating segment an 
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
finance costs and income 
Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method. Finance income is recognised in the income statement using 
the effective interest method.
inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw materials are valued at average cost. Finished goods and work in progress 
comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less. For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts. 
financial instruments 
Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de-recognised when the 
group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the 
instrument are passed to an independent third party. 
financial assets 
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale 
financial assets. The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at 
each financial year end. 
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the group’s beer. T rade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and 
have therefore been designated as ‘Loans and receivables’, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in income when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired. If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been 
incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loan’s carrying amount and the expected future receipts, (excluding future 
credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in operating profit. 
T rade receivables 
T rade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer 
considered probable. 
T rade payables 
T rade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.  38

noteS to the A ccountS
for the 52 weeks ended 2 may 2010
1 Accounting policies continued
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent measurement is at fair 
value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on 
the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting 
T o qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the group’s risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. The group also documents 
how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue 
to be, highly effective. 
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the variability in cash 
flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. 
Cash flow hedge accounting 
The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised immediately 
in the income statement. 
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless the hedged 
transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised in 
equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
Defined benefit pension schemes 
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds. 
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an 
annual basis.  
The current service cost is charged to operating profit. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur. 
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested. When 
a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement in the same period. 
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount on the face of the group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes’ obligations, less past service costs not 
yet recognised, and less the fair value of scheme assets. Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable. 
Defined contribution pension schemes  
The cost of the group’s defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made. Contributions are charged to the income 
statement as they become payable. 
Post-employment healthcare benefit 
The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded. The cost of providing these benefits 
is determined on the same basis as the defined benefit pension schemes. 
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares. 
The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted. No account is 
taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions (performance linked to the price 
of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are 
considered non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date 
fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over 
the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. 
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period. financial Statements
39
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
1 Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments continued
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non-vesting conditions. The dilutive 
effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures. 
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the above 
schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS. However later modifications of such equity instruments 
are measured using IFRS 2.
own shares 
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares 
to applicable employees.  
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares. 
Revenue 
Generally, revenue represents external sales (excluding taxes) of goods and services, net of discounts. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, 
and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products. Revenue principally consists of drink, food and accommodation sales, 
which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term 
and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
operating leases 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease payments are recognised as 
an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current 
(the portion relating to the next financial period) or non-current prepayments. These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Taxes 
Income tax 
The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax. It is calculated using taxation rates 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying values in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss 
or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences 
can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance 
sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate presentation to 
allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.  40

1 Accounting policies continued
new standards and interpretations not applied 
A number of standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which 
have not been early adopted by the group. These are expected to be applied as follows: 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised) effective 1 July 2009 
The revisions to the standard will result in significant changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring in future accounting periods. 
Changes affect how transactions costs are accounted for, the valuation of non-controlling interests, the initial and subsequent measurement of contingent 
consideration and business combinations achieved in stages. The changes will impact the level of goodwill recognised, the results reported in the period 
of acquisition and future reported results. 
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Amendment) effective 1 July 2009 
The amendments to the standard require that a change in ownership interest of a subsidiary, that does not result in a loss of control, is accounted for 
as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners. Such transaction will no longer therefore give rise to goodwill, or give rise to a gain or loss. 
Significant accounting judgments and estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that 
affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other 
factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below: 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment. This requires an estimation of 
the value-in-use of the cash-generating unit that the assets are grouped within. Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the 
expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes 
in key assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill 
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 13.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Value-in-use calculations require assumptions 
to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
value of those cash flows. If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary. 
Residual values 
Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends. If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment 
of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required. Useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or 
reduction in depreciation accordingly. 
Pension liabilities 
The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 9. 
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities. Note 9 describes the key assumptions used in the accounting 
for retirement benefit obligations. 
T axation 
Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal 
resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. T ax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. T ax provisions 
are made if it is possible that a liability will arise. The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments 
Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the group’s share-based payment plans. Note 8 describes the key assumptions 
and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values. In addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, 
judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees 
in the plans.  financial Statements

5 Exceptional items continued
Exceptional operating costs 
Exceptional divisional restructuring and financial systems integration costs are items of one-off expenditure incurred in connection with the restructuring 
of certain trading segments within the group and the review of group-wide financial systems.
During the year the group received a refund of £7m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines which has been recognised as exceptional 
income. The decisions that resulted in this refund have been referred to the European Court of Justice and should HMRC be successful in their appeal the 
group would be required to repay the refund with interest, and as such this represents a contingent liability. An exceptional gain of £6.8m net of associated 
costs has been recognised.
The share-based payments credit results from the reversal of the previously recognised expense of share-based payment schemes which are no longer 
expected to meet their performance criteria.
The net profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of £1.0m (2009: £3.7m) comprises a total profit on disposal of £5.0m (2009: £11.1m) 
and a total loss on disposal of £4.0m (2009: £7.4m).
Exceptional finance costs 
During the year ended 2 May 2010 the group repurchased securitised debt with a nominal value of £30.3m recognising a net gain of £13.5m.
Following the receipt of the proceeds of the rights issue and the subsequent repurchase of securitised debt certain interest swaps were no longer deemed 
to be effective hedges. 
An exceptional cost of £12.1m was recognised in the prior period in respect of the fair value of interest rate swaps no longer qualifying for hedge 
accounting at 3 May 2009. All ineffective swaps were cancelled during the period to 2 May 2010 resulting in an exceptional charge of £3.3m. 
Exceptional tax 
The tax (credit)/charge on indexation of properties represents the tax impact of movements in RPI during the period on the tax base cost of properties.
The Finance Act 2008 abolished allowances on industrial buildings and hotels on a phased basis which resulted in an exceptional deferred tax credit of £0.7m 
in the prior period.

8 Share-based payment plans
The group operates three types of share-based payment arrangements: a senior management long-term incentive plan (LTIP), general employee share 
option plan (SAYE) and a share incentive plan (SIP). In the prior period executive share option plans (ESOS) have also been operated. 
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 78 to 81. All are equity-settled. 
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions is £1.7m (2009: credit of £3.1m), all of which relates to 
equity-settled transactions. This includes a charge of £1.7m (2009: £0.6m) included within operating costs and an exceptional credit of £nil (2009: £3.7m).
The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the grants and 
model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows:
2010          LTIP  SAYE

Exercise price          –  349p

Expected life (years)         3.0 6.5 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year       416p 66p 110p
Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life. Expected volatility is based on 
historical volatility of the company’s share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends. Expected life of 
options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period. This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.
The SIP shares are issued to employees after the period end at the market price ruling at the date of grant. As such, this is their fair value and the 
assumptions stated above are not relevant for this scheme. 46

The options and shares granted under the LTIP are at nil cost. Therefore, the weighted average exercise price for rights outstanding at the beginning 
and end of the period, granted, forfeited and exercised during the period is £nil (2009: £nil).
ESOS, SAYE and LTIP
Options were exercised on a range of dates. The weighted average share price through the period was 431p in 2010 and 454p in 2009.
The rights outstanding at 2 May 2010 under the LTIP had an exercise price of £nil (2009: £nil) and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.9 years 
(2009: 1.8 years). 
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 370p and 1087p (2009: 370p and1087p) and for the SAYE scheme 
between 274p and 694p (2009: 341p and 865p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 6.3 years for the ESOS (2009: 7.3 years) and 3.1 years for the SAYE scheme (2009: 3.3 years). financial Statements

9 Pensions
The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, and a number of defined benefit schemes.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs after 
employment. The benefit is no longer given to new employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme
Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company. The total cost recognised in 
operating profit for the period was £1.6m (2009: £1.5m).
Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits
The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and have had full actuarial valuations in the last four years: 
Greene King Pension Scheme (closed 2 May 1997, last valued 5 April 2006), Morland Pension Scheme (closed 12 December 2000, last valued 5 April 2006), 
Belhaven Pension Scheme (closed 31 October 2005, last valued 4 May 2008), and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme (closed 1 July 2003, 
last valued 30 April 2006). During the prior period the T olly Cobbold Pension Scheme (closed 29 July 2002, last valued 1 December 2004) merged 
with the Greene King Pension Scheme.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group’s finances and are administered by pension trustees. 
Pension benefits are related to members’ final salary at retirement and their length of service. The group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and 
losses immediately via the statement of comprehensive income.
The total cost recognised in the income statement was:

The total contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes in the following period are expected to be £7.6m (2009: £7.7m) for the group.
The values of the schemes’ liabilities have been determined by a qualified actuary based on the results of the last actuarial valuation, updated to 2 May 2010 
using the following principal actuarial assumptions:
           2010 2009
Discount rate          5.5% 6.0%
Expected rates of salary increases          4.5% 4.2%
Expected pension payment increases         3.4% 3.1%
Rate of inflation          3.4% 3.2%
Healthcare cost increase          9.0% 9.0%
The mortality assumptions imply the following expectations of years of life from age 65:
Man currently aged 40           23.4   23.3 
Woman currently aged 40           26.0   26.0 
Man currently aged 65           21.0   20.9 
Woman currently aged 65           23.8   23.7 
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy. 
Overall expected rate of return on assets is established by applying brokers’ forecasts to each category of scheme asset. 48

There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by Greene King plc to its shareholders.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
On 22 June 2010 the Government announced a reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011 and a 1% 
reduction each year thereafter to 24% from 1 April 2014. It is estimated that this will result in a reduction in the deferred tax liability of approximately 
£4.5m in next year’s financial statements.
The Government also announced a reduction in the rate of capital allowances from 20% to 18% (and from 10% to 8% on fixtures). The changes 
to capital allowances will have no impact on the total tax charge in the financial statements. financial Statements

Dividends on own shares have been waived.
12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of £79.9m (2009: £39.5m) by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the period (excluding own shares held) of 211.3m (2009: 166.6m).
The weighted average number of shares in issue for the prior period of 133.7m has been restated to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue that 
occurred in the period using a bonus factor of 1.246.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 0.9m (2009: 0.7m) dilutive potential shares under option, giving a 
weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 212.2m (2009: 167.5m). Where the average share price during the year 
is lower than the option price or the performance conditions of the option had not been met at the balance sheet date the options become anti-dilutive 
and are excluded from the calculation. The number of options where the average share price was lower than the option price was 2.4m (2009: 2.6m), 
the number of options that were anti-dilutive as a result of performance conditions not being met was 2.5m (2009: 2.5m).
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group on both a basic 
and dilutive basis.

At 4 May 2008 and 3 May 2009           673.8 
Acquired through business combinations (note 17)         5.9 
At 2 may 2010           679.7 
All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations. As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but 
is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, 
based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated £259.5m (2009: £236.4m) to Retail, £152.3m (2009: £172.3m) to Pub Partners, £138.7m 
(2009: £138.7m) to Brewing Company, and £129.2m (2009: £126.4m) to Belhaven.
During the year the classification of goodwill between operating segments was adjusted to reflect how assets, to which the goodwill relates, have been 
reorganised between cash generating units.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount. 
The key assumptions used for all operating segments are: the pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9.0% (2009: 9.0%), which is based 
on the group’s weighted average cost of capital and is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted cost of capital of the relevant operating segment; and 
the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets are extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2.0% (2009: 2.0%) which is below the long-term 
average growth rate for the industry. Other commercial assumptions relating to market growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on 
historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects. The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for pre-tax 
discount rate and growth rate. Neither a 1% decrease in assumed growth rate nor a 1% increase in the discount rate applied would have led to an 
impairment of goodwill in the current period. 52

valuation
The licensed estate properties were valued by the group’s own professionally qualified chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, on the basis 
of existing use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Appraisal and Valuation Standards. A representative sample of 
properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent 
with their appraisal. Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided. 
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value. These valuations have been 
retained but they have not been updated. Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
charges over assets
Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of £1,448.1m (2009: £1,475.3m) over which there is a first charge in favour of the 
securitised debt holders as detailed in note 22. financial Statements

Corporate           2.5  3.0 
           37.3  53.5 
The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. When 
indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the 
CGU’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 
9% (2009: 9%) and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% (2009: 2%) which is below the long-term average growth 
rate for the industry. Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management’s 
estimates of medium-term trading prospects.
The impairment recognised in the Retail, Pub Partners and Belhaven estates is primarily the result of the reduced trading performance of a relatively small 
number of pubs due to a combination of site specific trading circumstances and the general weakening of the UK consumer environment seen in the year. 
The impairment losses recognised within the Corporate estate are primarily as a result of the reduction in the fair value less costs to sell of unlicensed 
properties acquired as part of business combinations in previous years.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to 
cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used to calculate cash flow projections 
and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows:

T rade loans are net of provisions of £4.6m (2009: £4.7m), which represents the totality of impaired debt. During the year £0.4m (2009: £1.2m) of the 
provision was utilised and £0.3m (2009: £2.0m) of new provision created. All trade loans, net of any provision recognised, are considered to be neither 
past due nor impaired.
T rade loans are advanced to customers on terms linked to supply terms such that returns are greater than interest income. The fixed rate trade loans 
amounted to £29.2m (2009: £28.4m) and variable rate trade loans amounted to £15.7m (2009: £15.3m). Included in fixed rate loans are £13.0m 
of loans with settlement related to purchase levels (2009: £14.1m). The write-down of these loans has been taken on a straight-line basis over the 
remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the settlement.
The fixed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 2.44% (2009: 1.91%) and a weighted average period of 6.45 years (2009: 6.69 years). 
Interest rates on variable rate trade loans are linked to base rate.

Bank overdrafts
Overdrafts are utilised for the day-to-day management of cash. The group has facilities of £25m (2009: £25m) available with interest linked to base rate.
bank loans – unsecured
The group has a five-year revolving credit facility, signed on 26 April 2008 and amended on 30 June 2008, of £400m (2009: £400m), of which £nil 
(2009: £245m) was drawn at the year end. Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the 
undrawn portions. Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity. Although any individual draw-downs are repayable within twelve 
months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding. Immediate renewal is available under the £400m facility until April 2012. 
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
The interest rate for the 2009 drawings of £245m was 4.45%, after the effect of swaps.
Securitised debt
The group has issued various tranches of bonds totalling £1,500.0m, in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the group’s pubs held in Greene King 
Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap. The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by 
Greene King Finance plc.

The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group 
company. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other 
group companies.
loan notes – unsecured
The group issued loan notes during 2006 in connection with the Hardys & Hansons acquisition. These have a maturity date of September 2011 and 
bear interest at a margin below LIBOR, payable semi-annually. The effective interest rate of the loan notes is 0.30% (2009: 4.58%) after taking into 
consideration the effect of interest rate swaps.
These loan notes are redeemable on demand of the holders on any of the interest payment dates and as such have been classified as current debt.
During 2008 the group issued £14.4m of new loan notes with a maturity date of August 2009 in connection with the Loch Fyne acquisition. During the 
year all of the loan notes were redeemed and therefore at the year end £nil were outstanding (2009: £0.3m).
23 Financial instruments
The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide 
secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group. If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage 
these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, loan notes, cash 
and short-term deposits. Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group’s operations and financing 
sources. No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the group’s financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The policy for managing each of these 
risks is set out below.
interest rate risk
Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group’s borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate 
instruments. The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged. The group enters into interest rate 
swaps to manage the exposure. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for 
effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates. This 
analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging 
instruments in place at 2 May 2010 and 3 May 2009. The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year as a whole. 
The following assumptions were made:
G  balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as 
interest rates move;
G  gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group; and
G  cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end. An explanation for the split between those 
hedges that were effective at the year end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the group’s net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the group’s profit before tax by approximately 
£0.2m (2009: £4.5m) and the group’s equity by £91.6m (2009: £93.2m).
Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt. The group’s objective 
is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans. The group also monitors the maturity 
of financial  liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end (2009: 60 days following month end).
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than one month. Short-term flexibility is 
achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets. 58

credit risk
The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to regular credit verification procedures. Receivable 
balances are also monitored on an on-going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash. Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation, the maximum 
exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging
At 2 May 2010 the group held no interest rate swap contracts designated as hedges of the cash flow interest rate risk of the group’s variable rate 
borrowings (excluding bonds). At 3 May 2009, the group held four interest rate swap contracts, with a nominal value of £198.0m, and were designated 
as hedges of the cash flow interest rate risk of £198.0m of the group’s variable rate borrowings (excluding bonds), and were held on the balance sheet as 
a fair value liability of £15.1m. The cash flows occurred quarterly, semi-annually or monthly, receiving a variable rate of interest based on the base rate or 
LIBOR, which ranged from 4.58% to 5.79%, and paid a fixed rate ranging from 4.50% to 5.79%. Remaining contract maturity dates ranged from June 2009 
to October 2011.
At 2 May 2010, the group held five (2009: three) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £728.6m (2009: £763.1m), entered into as part 
of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation tap. A fair value net liability of £108.8m (2009: £129.4m) has been recognised on the balance sheet 
in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against £728.6m (2009: £763.1m) of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate 
of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 5.101% (2009: 5.091%). The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and 
March 2036. The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective. In the prior year cash flow 
hedges in respect of £50.0m (2009: £148m) of the group’s variable rate borrowings and £22.4m (2009: £nil) of the securitised debt were prospectively 
discontinued as a result of the pending rights issue and subsequent debt repurchase. Accordingly in the prior year an exceptional cost of £12.1m was 
recognised in respect of the fair value of these interest rate swaps no longer qualifying for hedge accounting. All ineffective swaps were cancelled during 
the year ended 2 May 2010 resulting in a further exceptional charge to the income statement of £3.3m. The remaining interest rate swaps have been 
assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives. The net unrealised gain of 
£20.3m (2009: £144.2m loss) in respect of effective interest rate swaps was included in equity in respect of these contracts. Losses recycled to the income 
statement in respect of swap terminations amounted to £3.3m (2009: £5.3m) and are included within exceptional finance costs.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year end was 98.7% (2009: 97.5%) in line with the group’s policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.  financial Statements

The interest on variable rate financial instruments is repriced at intervals less than one year. The interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until the 
maturity of the instrument. 
Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included in the above as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject 
to interest rate risk. 
fair values 
Set out in the table overleaf is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the group’s financial instruments. 
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between 
willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: 
Cash and cash equivalents – approximates to the carrying amount stated in the accounts. 
Financial assets – these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this. 
Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments. 
Long-term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying amount in the case of the floating rate 
bank loans and other variable rate borrowings. 
Interest rate swaps – fair values and effective interest rates of derivatives and other borrowings have been based on quotations from counterparties 
and represent estimates of the amount the group would expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.  60

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
IFRS 7 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used to derive fair value. 
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: 
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 – other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
Level 3 – techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

capital risk management 
The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted average cost 
of capital (WACC) and shareholder value. 
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels (together referred to as capital), as appropriate in the light of economic and trading 
conditions. T o maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue 
new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period. 
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including fixed charged cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and free cash 
flow debt service coverage. Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance costs before exceptional items 
(note 7). For the period to 2 May 2010 interest cover was 2.4x (2009: 2.2x).  financial Statements

On 29 May 2009, a three-for-five rights issue was completed and 80.8m new ordinary shares with an aggregate nominal value of £10.1m were issued for 
cash consideration of £207.2m, net of issue costs of £10.9m. The rights issue price of 270p per ordinary share represented a bonus to existing shareholders of 
0.246 ordinary shares per ordinary share held based on the closing share price of 566p on 29 May 2009, the last day the shares traded cum-rights. The rights 
issue was effected through a structure which resulted in the creation of a merger reserve. Greene King plc issued shares in exchange for shares in Greene King 
(Jersey) Limited, which subsequently redeemed its no par value redeemable preference shares for cash. Following the receipt of the cash proceeds through 
the structure, the excess of the net proceeds received over the nominal value of the share capital issued has been transferred from the merger reserve to 
other profit and loss reserves. 
Details of options granted and outstanding are included in note 8. 
During the period no (2009: nil) shares were repurchased and subsequently cancelled. 
25 Reserves 
Share premium account 
Share premium represents the excess of proceeds received over the nominal value of new shares issued. 
capital redemption reserve 
Capital redemption reserve arose from the purchase and cancellation of own share capital, and represents the nominal amount of the share capital cancelled. 
hedging reserve 
Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the group’s derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, in line with the 
accounting policy disclosed in note 1. 
Amounts recycled to income are included within finance costs in the income statement. 
own shares 
Own shares relates to shares held in treasury and by the employee benefit trust. At 2 May 2010 1.0m shares (2009: 1.0m) were held in treasury and 
0.5m shares (2009: 0.8m) by the employee benefit trust. The market values at that date were £4.6m and £2.3m (2009: £5.9m and £4.9m) respectively. 
During the period no shares were repurchased by the employee benefit trust (2009: £0.1m). 0.3m (2009: 0.2m) shares held by the employee benefit 
trust were transferred to satisfy awards under the long-term incentive plan and options exercised under the executive share option scheme. 
The employee benefit trust is independently managed and has purchased shares in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and potential 
awards under the long-term incentive plan. 
At the year end 0.5m treasury shares and 0.4m shares in the employee benefit trust were allocated to meet awards under the long-term incentive plan. 
The transfer of £10.9m from own shares to retained earnings has been made to reflect previous transfers to satisfy awards under the long-term incentive 
plan and options exercised under the executive share option plan and reflects the weighted average cost of own shares.
Goodwill 
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions made prior to May 1998 amounts to £89.7m (2009: £89.7m).

28 Financial commitments 
The group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties and items of plant and machinery. The terms of the leases vary but typically on 
inception a property lease will be for a period of up to 30 years and plant and machinery will be for less than five years. Most property leases have an 
upwards only rent review based on open market rents at the time of the review.

to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 74, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
G give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 2 May 2010 and of its profit for the 52 weeks then ended;
G have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
G have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
G the directors’ statement, set out on page 73, in relation to going concern; and
G  the part of the corporate governance statement on pages 82 to 86 relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.
Other matter

1.  The maintenance and integrity of the Greene King plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of 
these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on 
the website.

32 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and presentation
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting and financial reporting 
standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivatives, where the 
company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year with the exceptions noted below.
FRS 20 Share-based Payments – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
The amended standard changes the definition of vesting conditions and prescribes the accounting treatment of an award that is effectively cancelled due 
to non-vesting conditions not being satisfied. The adoption of the amendment had no impact on the company’s results or financial position.
FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosure
The amended standard requires additional disclosure about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. As noted below the company is exempt from 
producing disclosures required by FRS 29 as the updated disclosures have been incorporated in the consolidated accounts for the year ended 2 May 2010.
investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value of investments is 
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events 
have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: 
G  provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets 
that have rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets 
concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the 
taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold; and 
G  deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits 
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based 
on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de-recognised when the 
company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the 
instrument are passed to an independent third party.
The company is exempt, in accordance with FRS 29.2D, from producing disclosure required by the standard as the group accounts contain disclosure 
that complies with FRS 29 (IFRS 7).
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent measurement is at fair 
value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the 
movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
hedge accounting
T o qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the company’s risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. The company also documents 
how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue 
to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the variability in cash 
flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion 
is recognised in the profit and loss account. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction affects 
profit or loss. 
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in 
equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the profit and loss account as above. If the related transaction is not 
expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit and loss. financial Statements

32 Accounting policies continued
own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The company has an employee benefit trust for the granting 
of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors of subsidiary companies receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares 
or rights over shares. The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted. 
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions (performance linked to 
the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award 
are considered non-vesting conditions. Like market performance, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. 
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an increase in the company’s investments in its subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in 
equity spread over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised 
as an investment reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately 
expected to vest. 
In accordance with the exemption within FRS 20 no amount is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 
which had not vested by the date of implementation of FRS 20.
Related party transactions
In accordance with FRS 8 Related Parties T ransactions the company is not required to disclose transactions with other members of the Greene King group.
33 Profit for the period
No profit or loss account is presented for the company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax for the period is £41.2m 
(2009: £20.5m loss).

At 2 May 2010, the company did not hold any interest rate swap contracts to hedge cash flow interest rate risk related to floating rate debt. These had 
a nominal value of £nil (2009: £180.0m) and are held on the balance sheet as a net fair value liability of £nil (2009: £14.1m). The details of terms and 
interest rates are included as part of the group’s portfolio in note 23.
In 2009 a cost of £10.3m was recognised in respect of the movement on the fair value of interest rate swaps that no longer qualify for hedge accounting. 
These ineffective swaps were cancelled during the year.

such this represents a contingent liability.

statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are

financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
G  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
G  the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
G certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

Share capital
Details of the authorised and issued share capital of the company, which comprises a single class of shares, ordinary shares of 12½p, are set out in note 24 
to the accounts. The rights attaching to the shares are set out in the articles of association. There are no special control rights in relation to the company’s 
shares and the company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights.
On 23 April 2009, prior to the beginning of the year, the company announced an underwritten rights issue of 80,749,647 new shares at 270p per share 
to qualifying shareholders. The rights issue was undertaken on the basis of three new shares at 270p per share for every five shares held by qualifying 
shareholders. Shareholders approved the necessary resolutions at a general meeting of the company on 12 May 2009 and, on 29 May 2009, following the 
exercise of a number of options under the company’s share schemes, a total of 80,755,421 new ordinary shares were issued to qualifying shareholders or 
subscribers for those shares. 
A total of 25,873 ordinary shares, with an aggregate nominal value of £3,234, were allotted, for cash, during the period in connection with the company’s 
sharesave and executive option schemes. In addition, a further 527,000 shares were transferred from treasury to satisfy the grant of awards to directors 
under the company’s LTIP scheme.
The trustees of the company’s employee benefit trust (EBT), Kleinwort Benson (Guernsey) T rustees Limited, transferred 27,856 ordinary shares to 
employees to satisfy the exercise of share options and the vesting of LTIP awards. Although no ordinary shares were purchased by the EBT during the 
period, 149,000 shares were transferred back to the EBT from directors in respect of lapsed LTIP awards. The company makes regular use of the EBT 
to satisfy the exercise of share options and will make market purchases of the company’s shares from time to time to ensure that it has sufficient shares 
to enable it to do so. 
Voting rights
In a general meeting of the company, on a show of hands, every member who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. 
On a poll every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which they are the holder. The AGM notice gives 
full details of deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect of resolutions to be considered at the meeting.
Under the Free4All Employee Profit Share Scheme, participants are the beneficial owners of the shares but not the registered owners. The registered 
owner is the trustee, Killik & Co T rustees Ltd. The trustee will invite participants to direct it on the exercise of any voting rights attaching to the shares held 
under the scheme by the trustee on the participants’ behalf. The trustee will only be entitled to vote on a show of hands if all directions received from 
participants are identical. The trustee is under no obligation to call for a poll. In the case of a poll, the trustee will follow the directions of the participants.
No voting rights will be exercised in respect of any own shares.
T ransfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company other than those which may from time to time be applicable under existing laws and 
regulations (for example under the Market Abuse Directive). 
In addition, pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, directors of the company and persons discharging managerial responsibility 
are required to obtain prior approval from the company to deal in the company’s securities, and are prohibited from dealing during closed periods.
Change of control
All of the company’s share incentive plans contain provisions relating to a change of control and full details of these plans are provided in the directors’ 
remuneration report. Outstanding options and awards would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction 
of performance conditions, if applicable, at that time.
The group’s banking facility agreements contain provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of a change 
of control. Certain of the company’s trading contracts also contain similar provisions.
There are two employees who, on a change of control of the company resulting in the termination of their employment, would be entitled to 
compensation for loss of office. However, in the context of the company as a whole, these agreements are de minimis.
Articles of association
The company’s articles of association may only be amended by special resolution at general meetings of shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement of directors
The number of directors on the board shall be no less than five nor more than twelve. Directors may be appointed by the company by ordinary resolution 
or by the board of directors. A director appointed by the board of directors holds office until the next following AGM, and is then eligible for election by 
the shareholders.
At each AGM all those directors who were elected, or last re-elected, at the AGM held in the third calendar year before the current year shall retire from 
office and may stand for re-election.

resign and the directors decide to accept this offer, (iii) all of the other directors remove them from office by notice in writing served upon them, (iv) they

Powers of the directors
The business of the company is managed by the directors who may exercise all the powers of the company, subject to its articles of association, any 
relevant legislation and any directions given by the company by passing a special resolution at a general meeting. In particular, the directors may exercise 
all the powers of the company to borrow money, issue shares, appoint and remove directors and recommend and declare dividends.
Communications with shareholders
Shareholders who are interested in signing up to e-communications should refer to the shareholders information page for further information on how 
to register via www.greeneking-shares.com.
Charitable donations
Donations by the company for charitable purposes made during the period amounted to £18,400 (2009: £18,700). The group makes no political donations.
Payments to suppliers 
The group understands the benefits to be derived from maintaining good relationships with its suppliers and where possible enters into agreements 
over payment terms. Where such terms have not been agreed it is the group policy to settle invoices 60 days following the end of month of invoicing. 
This policy is dependent on suppliers providing accurate, timely and sufficiently detailed invoices. Payment in respect of 67 days’ average purchases from 
trade creditors of the group was outstanding at the end of the period (2009: 72 days).
Directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance
The group has taken out insurance to indemnify, against third party proceedings, the directors of the company whilst serving on the board of the company 
and of any subsidiary. This cover indemnifies all employees of the group who serve on the boards of all subsidiaries. These indemnity policies subsisted 
throughout the year and remain in place at the date of this report.
Financial instruments
The group’s policy on the use of financial instruments is set out in note 23.
Post balance sheet events
Details of events occurring after the year end are set out in note 30.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The directors who were members of the board at the time of approving the directors’ report are listed on page 28. Having made enquiries of fellow 
directors and of the company’s auditors, each of these directors confirms that:
G  to the best of each director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the preparation of their report of which the company’s auditors 
are unaware; and
G  each director has taken all the steps a director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and to establish 
that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the chief executive’s 
review. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial review. In addition, note 23 
to the financial statements include the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit and liquidity risk. 
The directors are of the opinion that the group’s forecast and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the group should be able to operate within its current borrowing facilities and comply with its financing covenants. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
Auditors
Ernst & Y oung LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office and a resolution to re-appoint the firm as the company’s auditors will be proposed 
at the AGM.
Annual general meeting 
The AGM will be held at 12 noon on T uesday 7 September 2010 at the Millennium Grandstand, Rowley Mile Racecourse Conference Centre, 
Newmarket, Suffolk. The notice of the AGM is set out in the separate circular to shareholders. 
The directors consider that all of the resolutions set out in the notice of AGM are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole. 
The directors will be voting in favour of them and unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of them.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respects of the group financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group financial statements, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the directors must not approve the group financial statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly the financial position, 
the financial performance and cash flows of the group for that period. In preparing those group financial statements the directors are required to:
G  select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply 
them consistently;

Composition of the remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is appointed by the board. During the year the committee comprised Norman Murray (chairman of the committee), 
Ian Durant and Jane Scriven. All of the committee members during the year were regarded by the board as independent non-executive directors. 
T erms of reference and reporting
The committee determines, and annually reviews, all elements of executive directors’ remuneration and the remuneration of other senior executives. 
It recommends the fees that should be payable to the chairman to the board. It approves the contracts of the executive directors and any compensation 
arrangements arising from their termination. It also approves all LTIP allocations and oversees the operation of all of the company’s share based plans. 
The committee is made aware of the salary levels of the senior management team and of the incentive arrangements operating throughout the company.
During the year the composition of the board changed with David Elliott leaving the company and Justin Adams and Jonathan Lawson stepping down from 
the board whilst retaining their management responsibilities. There are now two executive directors and five other managing directors. The committee 
retains overall responsibility for determining the remuneration of all of these.
Advisers to the remuneration committee
The committee has taken external advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information from Hewitt New Bridge Street, who do not 
provide any other services to the company. Advice and assistance is also obtained, where appropriate, from the company’s brokers, Deutsche Bank. 
During the course of the year legal advice has been obtained from law firms Pinsent Masons and Osborne Clarke. The committee also received internal 
advice from Rooney Anand, chief executive, in determining appropriate remuneration and incentive packages for the other executive directors.
Remuneration policy
The company operates in a highly competitive market and must attract, motivate and retain high quality directors. The committee considers current market 
practice and makes comparisons with turnover, market capitalisation and operational details against a selection of other companies. The committee is made 
aware of and has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere within the group and endeavours to ensure that pay rises for executive and non-executive directors 
are generally comparable with those being applied elsewhere in the group. A range of bonus plans are operated for managers throughout the group, 
and all staff with the requisite qualifying service have access to the company’s share save scheme.
No director makes a decision relating to his own remuneration. Individual directors leave the meeting when their own remuneration is being discussed. 
A significant proportion of each executive director’s potential remuneration is performance-related, thus aligning the directors’ interests with those of 
shareholders and encouraging performance at the highest levels. 
The committee has considered whether there are any aspects of the remuneration policy which could inadvertently encourage executives to take 
inappropriate risk and has concluded that the policy remains appropriate in this regard. 
Components of directors’ remuneration
The remuneration package of each executive director consists of the following elements:
Annual pay
Annual pay reflects the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive directors. Pay is reviewed annually or when a change 
in responsibility occurs. The pay rises for the executives in 2009/10 were considered appropriate taking account of the performance of the company, the 
individuals and the relative market positioning of the individuals’ packages and it should be remembered that in general there were no pay rises in 2008/9.
Benefits in kind
The range of taxable benefits available to executive directors is listed on page 78.
bonus
Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee and awarded where justified by performance. For the financial year 2009/10, the 
executive directors were eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus, the maximum amount being 100% of annual pay, for the achievement of stretch 
targets. This is based on pre-determined performance metrics, set at the start of the year, based on group profitability and personal business unit metrics 
as relevant. The committee retains the right to adjust targets to ensure that the effects of changes to capital employed within particular business units, 
as well as other external factors, are taken into account, to ensure overall fairness. The committee believes that the policy for any adjustments continues 
to be applied in an even-handed manner and ensures that there is a better link between reward and performance overall. 
For 2010/11 and future years, the committee is proposing to increase the annual bonus potential from 100% of salary to 150% of salary for the executive 
directors, with a similar level of increase for other senior executives below board level. Bonus up to 100% of salary will be determined by reference to 
group profit and personal objectives similar to those set out above. The additional 50% uplift will be subject to a new performance condition based on 
challenging levels of annual economic profit performance in excess of the company’s strategic plan, with all of any additional bonus being invested in shares 
or granted in the form of nil cost options, which would be deferred or, as the case may be, not exerciseable for a period of one year and which would be 
forfeited in the event that the relevant director or employee leaves the group, other than as a good leaver, during that time. 
The enhanced element of the annual bonus will provide improved strategic linkage through the use of an economic profit-based performance condition. 
Economic profit (operating profit before exceptional items less the weighted average cost of capital multiplied by capital employed) has been introduced 
into the business as a key performance driver and its use in the annual bonus will complement this strategic focus. The use of economic profit will also 
provide a balance to the rest of the bonus plan, which is based on profit before tax and exceptionals and specific business unit-related targets.
The additional focus on economic profit will encourage the management team to target medium-term decisions to ensure growth by: ensuring better 
deployment of capital expenditure; encouraging further improvements in relation to returns on invested capital; freeing up assets where higher economic 
profit can be gained by the group; and extracting higher returns from existing uninvested assets. 
The board has identified additional economic profit above the 2009 strategic plan which is potentially deliverable over the next two financial years, after 
discounting the effect of the recent rights issue. In future years, this proportion of the annual bonus will continue to be dependent on the achievement of 
stretch economic profit targets. If this economic profit is achieved, it will benefit shareholders and the committee therefore considers that senior management 
should be incentivised to deliver this additional performance. There will be disclosure in the directors’ remuneration report each year of the basis on which 
the bonuses were payable. 76

Components of directors’ remuneration continued
bonus continued
The committee considers that the additional bonus potential will provide a stronger incentive to deliver against a rounded range of performance metrics 
and will improve motivation, lock-in and alignment of interest (with the additional element being deferred in shares). In addition, the additional bonus will 
be reclaimable by the company in exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct.
The committee has consulted with a number of the company’s key shareholders and incorporated their feedback in relation to this proposal.
Pension and life assurance
The pension arrangements for Rooney Anand and Ian Bull are on a defined contribution basis. They both have self-invested personal pension schemes 
to which the company makes a contribution. The contribution rates are 25% for Rooney Anand and 20% for Ian Bull. No element of remuneration other 
than annual pay is treated as pensionable. Both executive directors participate in a group death-in-service insurance scheme, with death benefits in excess 
of the HMRC maximum being provided through additional insurance. The cost of this insurance is disclosed as a non-cash benefit in the emoluments table 
on the opposite page. 
long-term incentives
Long-term incentives form an important part of the company’s remuneration for its directors and senior employees, with historically a mix of options and 
LTIP awards being granted, subject to performance conditions based on earnings per share (EPS). Following a review in 2009/10, the company’s policy is 
now to grant only LTIP awards. Directors are now entitled each year to an LTIP award equivalent to a maximum of 133% of base salary. It is the company’s 
intention that no further share options will be granted under the company’s executive share option scheme, although the committee retains the flexibility 
to use the scheme again in exceptional circumstances should the business strategy support its future use. The company’s major shareholders will be 
consulted if any proposed future use of share options would result in an increase in total remuneration.
Awards are made in the form of restricted forfeitable shares, on which dividends are payable. Dividends in respect of future awards will accrue until vesting 
and will be released to the directors to the extent that the awards vest. 
Since 2009/10 all LTIP awards have been subject to two performance measures, namely an adjusted free cash flow condition and an earnings per share 
condition, both measured over a three year period. There is a 60:40 weighting in favour of the cash measure, given the importance of cash management 
as a medium term business priority. The use of two separate performance conditions is designed to provide a rounded assessment of the company’s 
financial performance.
For the three-year adjusted free cash flow measure the same definition as was used in 2009/10 will be adopted: net cash flow from operating activities less 
capital expenditure. Net cash flow from operating activities will include the impact of changes in working capital, and interest and tax payments, but will be 
adjusted to exclude exceptional items at the discretion of the remuneration committee in consultation with the audit committee. 
The capex related deduction in the free cash flow measure will be for capital expenditure on properties that were within the estate at the beginning of the 
performance measurement period, where that capital expenditure has not been funded from property disposal proceeds. Free cash flow has been chosen 
as a performance condition because converting EBITDA to positive cash flows to support debt repayment, continued investment in the business and the 
ongoing payment of dividends is a key measure for both management and shareholders. 
The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance target for the 2010/11 awards will be that the aggregate adjusted free cash flow of the company 
for the three financial years ending in April 2011, 2012 and 2013 must be more than £230.4m to vest at the minimum level and at least £270.4m to vest in 
full. Measuring on an aggregate three-year basis (rather than the more common approach of focusing on the end-year only of the three) will ensure that there 
will be a focus on delivering cash across all three years. 
The adjusted earnings per share part of the performance condition for awards granted in 2010/11 will be based on a sliding scale range of ‘pence per share’ 
targets for the 2012/13 year end, with between 0% and 100% of that part of the award vesting depending on the extent to which the targets are met. The 
committee does not consider it appropriate to disclose the range, but does consider it to be appropriately challenging in the current economic climate. There 
will be disclosure of the conditions and the extent to which they have been achieved in the remuneration report at the time each award vests.
employee share schemes
In common with all other employees, the executive directors are also entitled to participate in the sharesave and share incentive plan. Further details 
of these schemes are given later in this report, together with the directors’ entitlements under them.
Remuneration from other company directorships
Since September 2007 Rooney Anand has served as a non-executive director of Drive Assist Holdings Limited, a company unconnected with the group. 
He is entitled to receive and retain for his personal benefit £40,000 per annum from that company by way of director’s fees. Governance
77
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
Remuneration for non-executive directors
The fees paid to the chairman and the other non-executive directors are determined by the board as a whole. They are agreed after taking external advice 
and making market comparisons, and relate to the services of the directors in connection with the company’s business. The non-executive directors do 
not have service agreements and cannot participate in the pension scheme, the bonus scheme or the share option schemes. 
Service agreements
Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service agreement with a notice period of one year. In the event of the employment of an executive 
director being terminated, the committee would pay due regard to best practice and take account of the individual’s duty to mitigate their loss. 
Rooney Anand and Ian Bull, whose contracts with the company commenced on 6 August 2001 and 9 January 2006 respectively, are both subject to 
one year notice periods from the company. Their contracts do not contain any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment. 
The terms of Rooney Anand’s appointment as chief executive were agreed and set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004.
The contracts of Justin Adams, David Elliott and Jonathan Lawson, who ceased to be directors during the year, were also subject to one year notice periods. 
Justin Adams and Jonathan Lawson, who remain managing directors of the Brewing Company and Local Pubs divisions respectively notwithstanding that 
they stood down from the board on 30 April 2010, were not paid any compensation in connection therewith. David Elliott, who left the company on 
31 January 2010 and ceased to be a director, was paid an amount of £266,000 in lieu of notice, in line with his contractual entitlement. 
Non-executive directors are appointed pursuant to letters of appointment for three-year periods. The table below sets out the start and expiry date 
of their respective appointments.

  Left the company 31 January 2010. In addition to the annual pay set out above, he also received a payment of £266,000 in lieu of notice in line with his contractual entitlements. 
No payments were made to any third parties in respect of any directors’ services. Non-cash benefits principally include the provision of company cars, fuel 
for company cars, life assurance and private medical insurance. Other cash benefits include cash allowances paid in lieu of company cars, accommodation 
expenses and accrued holiday pay. 
directors’ pensions
Amounts paid or payable to the self-invested personal pension schemes of the executive directors made by the company in respect of the period are 
shown in the table below:

The amount above in relation to David Elliott includes £58,000 of contributions due for his service during the year and a further £66,500, being an additional 
one year’s contributions, payable in accordance with his contractual entitlements when he left the company. 
Tim Bridge is a pensioner member of the group’s defined benefit scheme. His pension is equivalent to 1/45th of his final pensionable earnings for each 
year of service, with a pro rata payment for a part year, subject to HMRC limits. His final pensionable earnings were those received immediately prior 
to him ceasing to be chief executive.
T wo former directors receive additional pension income from the company. John Bridge, who retired as a director on 31 December 1989, receives a 
pension of £26,000 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements and Bernard Tickner, who retired as a director on 27 August 1992, receives a pension of 
£21,000 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements. As required by law, both of these figures are stated net of their company-funded pension in payment 
at 31 March 1997.
Share price during the period
The closing price of the company’s shares on 30 April 2010 (being the last business day before the financial period end) was 453.9p (2009: 490.37p, 
adjusted for the rights issue). The closing price of the company’s shares during the period ranged between 366.75p and 530.57p, adjusted for the 
rights issue.  Governance

All relevant figures adjusted for 2-for-1 share split in September 2005 and the rights issue in May 2009, using a factor of c. 1.245 in relation to the number of options and 
of c. 0.802 in relation to the share price. 
*  Following David Elliott’s departure on 31 January 2010, a proportion of the unvested options granted to him in 2007 and 2008 lapsed, as indicated, proportionate to the 
unexpired period from the end of his employment until the end of the performance period. The remainder of the unvested options will vest on their original vesting date, 
subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions. His vested options are exerciseable until 31 July 2010.  
During the year, adjustments were made in respect of all outstanding options, both to the option price and the number of options held by each director, 
to reflect the impact of the rights issue completed in May 2009, to ensure that the aggregate exercise price of each option remains unchanged. There 
were otherwise no changes made during the period to the terms and conditions of any options then outstanding, and no options were exercised during 
the period (2009: no changes made and no options exercised). There have been no options exercised and no other changes to the date of this report. 
Unvested options can only be exercised if a performance condition has been met. This condition relates to the growth in audited adjusted earnings per 
share which must exceed RPI inflation by 4% per annum, measured over the period of three consecutive financial years of the company, starting with 
the year in which the award is granted. Since the year end, the options granted in 2007 have lapsed, as a result of the remuneration committee having 
determined that the performance conditions applicable to those options have not been met. 80

*  Following David Elliott’s departure on 31 January 2010, a proportion of the unvested awards granted to him in 2007 and 2008 lapsed, as indicated, proportionate to the 
unexpired period from the end of his employment until the end of the performance period. The remainder of the awards will vest on their original vesting date, subject 
to satisfaction of the performance conditions.
As disclosed in the RNS announcements at the time of the awards, directors are entitled to receive dividends on their shares. During the year the directors 
received dividends in the amounts set out below in respect of the 2007 LTIP awards which, as explained below, will be forfeited shortly on the third 
anniversary of their grant.

The market price of the shares on 9 December 2009 was 411.6p, although the number of shares comprising the award was determined by reference 
to the closing market price on 8 December 2009, namely 420.3p.
During the year the 2006 LTIP awards lapsed on the third anniversary of their grant as a result of the remuneration committee having determined that 
the performance conditions applicable to those awards had not been met. The 2007 LTIP awards will also lapse on the third anniversary of their grant 
for the same reasons. T otal gains made by directors under the LTIP in the period ended 2 May 2010 therefore amounted to £nil (2009: £522,720).
The 2008 LTIP awards will only vest if the company’s growth in earnings per share is equal to or greater than the increase in RPI plus 3% per annum 
compound over the three consecutive financial years starting immediately before the award. At this level, 25% of the award (rounded down to the nearest 
1,000 shares) will vest. 100% of the award will vest if the company’s growth in earnings per share is greater than the increase in RPI plus 8% per annum 
over the same three year period. There is a pro-rata scale (rounded down to the nearest 1,000 shares) between the minimum level of RPI plus 3% and 
the maximum level of RPI plus 8%. If the targets are not met, the award will lapse. Governance

Audited information continued
long-term incentive plan continued
The 2009 LTIP awards will only vest to the extent that two separate performance targets are met, over the three financial years ending in April 2012. 
A maximum of 60% of each award will vest if an adjusted free cash flow performance condition has been met. The remaining 40% of the award will vest 
if an earnings per share performance condition has been met. The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance condition is that the aggregate 
adjusted free cash flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2010, 2011 and 2012 must be more than £190.0m to vest at the 
minimum level and at least £230.0m to vest in full. 
The earnings per share performance condition sets a range for the EPS for the financial year ending in April 2012 which the remuneration committee 
considers to be sufficiently challenging in the current market conditions. Details as to the extent to which the targets have been met and the awards 
have vested will be provided at the end of the three year performance period.
No changes were made during the period, or since the year end to the date of this report, to the terms and conditions of any awards then outstanding. 
Save as set out above, no awards vested or lapsed during the period. There have been no other changes to the date of this report. 
Sharesave scheme
The company has operated an HMRC approved sharesave scheme for a number of years. Options are granted over the company’s ordinary shares at an 
option price which, at board discretion, is at a discount of up to 20% of the closing price at the time of granting. The company has historically granted all 
such options at a 20% discount. 
The interests of directors in options granted under the sharesave scheme were as follows:

* Following his departure, David Elliott has until 31 July 2010 in which to exercise a proportion of his options with his accrued savings.
Justin Adams’ and Jonathan Lawson’s options can be exercised between 1 April and 30 September 2014. 
All options outstanding at 2 May 2010 were granted at an option price below the year-end closing price.
Share incentive plan
The directors’ beneficial interests in Greene King shares resulting from participation in the company’s HMRC approved share incentive plan are reflected 
in their shareholding data in the directors’ report. No award will be made in respect of the 2009/10 financial year (2008/9: no award).
Shareholders will be asked to vote on this remuneration report, as an ordinary resolution, at the company’s AGM.
Approved by the board of directors on 30 June 2010.

Governance structure
The board
The board considers that it is vital to ensure that there is an appropriate range of skills and experience among its members, and that the objectivity 
and integrity of members should be exemplary. The board currently comprises a non-executive chairman, four other non-executive directors and 
two executive directors. The directors’ biographies are on page 28. 
All of the directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment to the board and to re-election by shareholders 
every three years thereafter. 
The division of responsibilities between the chairman and the chief executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the board. 
The job descriptions are available on request. The chairman has primary responsibility for running the board and devotes such time to his role as is 
necessary to properly discharge his duties. The chief executive has responsibility for executing the company’s strategy and achieving operational and 
financial goals.
The board has a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for its decision, including approval of the long-term objectives and strategy, approval of 
budgets and financial statements including the report and accounts, acquisitions and disposals, changes to the structure of the group and overall corporate 
governance issues. It reviews trading performance and considers major capital expenditure and acquisition opportunities. Management is delegated the task 
of the detailed planning and implementation of the company’s strategy. 
Information and training
Full and timely information is provided to the board to enable it to properly discharge its functions. All directors have access to the advice and services 
of the company secretary and are provided with the opportunity to question management as required. The training needs of the board are regularly 
reviewed. Explanations of issues and legislative changes affecting the industry have been provided to the board during the year. 
There is an agreed procedure, set out in writing, for directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice at the company’s 
expense. The company has in place directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
Newly-appointed directors receive a full and appropriate induction on joining the board to acquaint them with the company. This takes the form of 
meetings with other board members and the provision of an induction pack containing general information on the company, its policies and procedures, 
financial information and a briefing on directors’ responsibilities.
Performance evaluation 
The board believes it is appropriate to undertake a regular performance evaluation of the board, its committees and individual directors. It has determined 
that an internal process of evaluation is most appropriate, to enable first hand input from individual directors to be obtained. An evaluation exercise was 
undertaken in January and February 2010, with the results reported to the board at the March board meeting. 
The evaluation was conducted by means of questionnaires circulated to all members, the results of which were then discussed between the chairman 
and chief executive. The questionnaire covered a range of topics including board structure and composition, board processes, corporate governance, 
composition and effectiveness of its committees and communications with shareholders and analysts. As a result of the evaluation some changes will be 
made to the board agenda, to ensure that a wide range of topics can be discussed. 
The board has confirmed that it is satisfied that it and its committees are operating effectively. Between evaluation exercises an open dialogue exists 
between all board members enabling issues to be raised and dealt with as they occur. 
The performance of the executive directors is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee in conjunction with their annual pay review and the 
payment of bonuses. The performance of Tim Bridge, chairman, was reviewed by the non-executive directors, led by Norman Murray, the senior 
independent non-executive director, taking into account the views of the executive directors. 
Independence of non-executive directors
The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are carefully examined and 
fully discussed. Their independence and objectivity are of paramount importance. The board believes that they all have a range of skills and experience 
which will help the company and that their understanding of the company, its strategy and operations increases over the years. 
The board is satisfied that all of the non-executive directors were independent throughout the year, being free from any relationship with the executive 
management which could result in any conflict or affect their independent judgment, and that they all remained independent in character and judgment. 
None of the independent non-executive directors participates in the share option schemes or long-term incentive plan operated by the company and 
none was dependent on the fees received from the company as their primary source of income. 
Norman Murray is the senior independent non-executive director. Norman was appointed to the board in January 2004, has never been employed 
by the company and has had diverse business interests. The board considers that he has remained independent from management in both character 
and judgment, that his performance has been effective and that he has demonstrated commitment to the role. A key responsibility for the senior independent 
director is to be available to shareholders in the event that they may feel it inappropriate to relay views through the chairman, chief executive or 
finance director. 
Tim Bridge took over as chairman of the board in May 2005. The board noted that, because of his long tenure as an executive director, he did not 
meet all of the independence criteria set out in the combined code. However, the board was, and remains, confident that the strength of character and 
independent judgment that he exhibited as chief executive continues in his role as chairman. The board is satisfied that his performance as chairman is 
effective and that he demonstrates continued commitment to the role. He is also a non-executive director of William Ransom & Son plc and during the 
year was a non-executive director of Weatherbys Ventures Limited, but these are not regarded as significant commitments and do not impact upon his 
ability to perform his role as chairman effectively. Governance

meetings and attendance
Board meetings are scheduled to be held eight times a year. There is also a strategy day for the board each year. Between meetings, as required, the 
board can be in frequent contact to progress the company’s business and, if necessary, board meetings can be held at short notice. Where possible, 
however, ad hoc committees of the board are appointed to deal with matters which it is known will need to be dealt with between scheduled board 
meetings. If directors are unable to attend meetings they are given the opportunity to be consulted and comment in advance of the meeting. The chairman 
holds regular informal meetings with the non-executive directors without the executive directors being present.
The table below sets out the attendance record of each director at scheduled board and board committee meetings during the year.

Conflicts of interest
The board has the right, under the articles of association, to approve potential situational conflicts of interest. A small number of such potential conflicts 
have been approved by the board following disclosure by certain directors, in each case with the relevant director not taking part in any decision relating to 
their own position. Directors are also aware that the disclosure and authorisation of any potential conflict situation does not detract from their requirement 
to notify the board separately of an actual or potential conflict in relation to a proposed transaction by the company. The board keeps its authorisations 
under review on a regular basis.
Board committees
The board has established an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a nomination committee, each of which has formal terms of reference 
governing its method of operation. Each of the terms of reference, which are available on request and will be available for inspection at the AGM, reflect 
the provisions of the combined code and have been approved by the board.
Set out below are reports from each of the nomination committee, audit committee and remuneration committee.
nomination committee report
During the year the nomination committee was chaired by Tim Bridge, and the other members of the committee were Norman Murray and John Brady, 
appointed to the committee in June 2009. Apart from the chairman, all members were considered by the board to be independent.
The committee’s role is to propose candidates for appointment to the board, to review regularly the structure, size and composition of the board and 
make recommendations to the board with regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary. 
The board changes which became effective on 30 April 2010, when Justin Adams and Jonathan Lawson stepped down from the board whilst retaining 
their management responsibilities, were overseen and approved by the nomination committee. The decision was taken in order to achieve parity in the 
management structure of the company, given that prior to the changes only two of the five divisional managing directors were members of the board. 
No new appointments were made to the board during the year. 
The committee met twice during the year and the chief executive, at the request of the committee, attended both meetings.
All directors are subject to re-election by shareholders following their appointment and subsequently in every third year. The nomination committee 
undertakes a review of all directors who are due for re-election to determine whether or not to recommend their re-appointment. Members of the 
committee do not participate in discussions regarding their own re-appointment. 84
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010

Board committees continued
Audit committee report
The audit committee was chaired during the year by Ian Durant. The other members of the committee were Jane Scriven and John Brady. All members 
are considered by the board to be independent. The board is satisfied that Ian Durant has recent and relevant financial experience, as the former finance 
director of Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC, formerly Liberty International plc. 
The role of the audit committee is to review the results of the full year audit and the interim results in each case prior to their submission to the board. 
It is responsible for reviewing the company’s internal financial control systems, advising the board on the appointment of external auditors, overseeing 
the relationship with the external auditors, reviewing the company’s whistleblowing procedures and considering the need for a full internal audit function. 
It also reviews the group’s risk management policies and procedures prior to submission to the board and receives detailed reports on the risk management 
functions within the business units.
The committee had three meetings during the year and on each occasion the finance director and senior members of the finance function attended. 
The external auditors attended all of the meetings. In addition, the chairman of the committee regularly meets privately with the external audit partner 
to discuss matters relevant to the company.
The committee reviews the audit plan presented by the auditors before the start of each audit cycle and agrees the scope of the audit work. During the 
audit process the committee keeps under review the consistency of accounting policies on a year to year basis and across the group, and the methods 
used to account for significant or unusual transactions. The financial statements and interim results are reviewed in detail prior to their submission to the 
board. Following the audit the committee discusses issues arising from the audit, and any matters the auditors may wish to discuss. 
The audit committee continuously monitors the relationship with the auditors and assesses their performance, cost-effectiveness, objectivity and 
independence. The board is satisfied that the auditors are independent of the company and that best practice is being observed.
During the year the company made limited use of specialist teams within Ernst & Y oung LLP for non-audit work such as taxation advice and transaction 
support. The audit committee has established a policy in relation to the use of Ernst & Y oung LLP for non-audit work. The company will award non-audit 
work to the firm which provides the best commercial solution for the work in question. Pieces of work estimated to be in excess of £25,000 are put out 
to tender unless agreed otherwise by the chairman of the audit committee. The finance director may approve specific engagements up to £50,000 and 
£100,000 cumulatively, and the chairman of the audit committee may approve engagements, up to £100,000 and £200,000 cumulatively, with fees in 
excess of those limits being subject to approval of the full committee.
The company’s internal audit function focuses primarliy on the group’s managed house divisions, where the greatest financial risks are perceived to exist. 
Elsewhere within the group a combination of the external audit procedures and the types of financial risks involved are felt to be such that a wider internal 
audit function is not required. 
Remuneration committee report
The remuneration committee was chaired during the year by Norman Murray, and the other members were Jane Scriven and Ian Durant. All the 
members are considered by the board to be independent. 
The role of the committee includes determining the remuneration policy for the executive directors and the chairman and fixing the total individual 
remuneration package of each of the executive directors, considering the granting of share options and awards under the long-term incentive plan and 
determining bonuses payable to the executive directors.
The remuneration committee met six times during the year. The chairman and the chief executive, at the request of the committee, attend its meetings. 
The chairman does not participate in any discussions relating to his own remuneration. The chief executive is consulted by the committee on its proposals, 
but does not participate in any discussions relating to his own remuneration.
Details of the company’s policies on remuneration, service contracts and compensation payments are set out in the directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 75 to 81.
Communication with shareholders
Shareholder communication is regarded as a key priority for the board, with the annual report and interim statements being the principal media used. 
Both are made available to all shareholders. In addition, the AGM is fully utilised as a means of communicating directly with private shareholders, who have 
the full opportunity to ask questions. The board aims to ensure that all members of the board, including in particular the chairmen of the board committees, 
are available to answer questions at the AGM. 
All substantive items of business at shareholders’ meetings are dealt with under separate resolutions, including a resolution to adopt the report and 
accounts. The chairman announces the results of the proxy voting on each resolution after it has been dealt with on a show of hands. The notice 
of meeting is issued in compliance with both the articles and the combined code and is sent to shareholders a minimum of 20 working days before 
the meeting.  Governance
85
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
Communication with shareholders continued
There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, including meetings after the announcement of the year end and interim results. The board 
receives regular reports from the chief executive on the meetings he and the finance director have with principal shareholders. The senior independent 
non-executive director, Norman Murray, has been available to shareholders if they have had concerns about governance issues which the normal channels 
of contact have failed to resolve. 
The company maintains a website (www.greeneking.co.uk) to provide up-to-date, detailed information on the company’s operations and brands, which 
includes a dedicated investor relations section. All company announcements are available on this site, as are copies of slides used for presentations to 
investment analysts.
Internal control 
The board acknowledges its responsibility for the group’s systems of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness. Such systems can only be 
designed to manage, and not to eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
that the group’s assets are safeguarded and that the financial information used within the business and for external reporting is reliable. 
The company has assessed the key risks to which it is exposed and has formalised the control environment needed to address these and other issues. 
There are processes in place which are in accordance with the guidance of the T urnbull Committee on internal control. The board has adopted a 
formal risk policy and regularly reviews risk management and internal controls, including key performance indicator data on the significant risks faced. 
The executive directors routinely consider the effective management of risk throughout the business at their regular meetings. This group oversees the 
development of risk management strategies, the implementation of suitable management actions and monitors progress made. The audit committee 
receives regular reports on risk issues within the business. 
The board is ultimately responsible for the company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. A formal assessment of the risk and 
control environment in place during the period and to the date of this report has been undertaken, based on detailed reports from, and subsequent 
discussions with, senior management. No significant problems were disclosed in these reports.
The control environment comprises the elements set out below:
G  internal control and risk management process 
The directors routinely monitor all aspects of risk management and internal control, and regularly assess the data on the significant risks faced. Major risks 
are identified, the financial implications of each risk assessed and the adequacy and effectiveness of the associated control environment analysed. Any issues 
arising from this process are discussed with operational management as needed. Appropriate steps are then taken to mitigate and monitor the effect of 
these risks. Data on the key exposures is reviewed regularly by the executive directors and the audit committee of the board.
G  internal audit
The controls over the group’s managed houses are enhanced by an internal audit team and the availability of comprehensive information from the EPOS 
till system. On behalf of the board, the audit committee assesses the scope of the internal audit function within the group, including seeking the views of 
the external auditors.
G  Information and financial reporting systems
The group’s comprehensive planning and financial reporting procedures include annual detailed operational budgets and a three year strategic plan, both 
of which are reviewed and approved by the board. Performance against the budgets is monitored, and relevant action taken, throughout the year, through 
the periodic reporting of detailed management accounts and key performance indicators. Forecasts are updated during the course of the year.
With a centralised financial reporting system, transactions and balances are recognised and measured in accordance with prescribed accounting policies, 
and all relevant information is appropriately reviewed and reconciled as part of the reporting process. The use of a reporting pack by all business units 
in the group ensures that information is gathered and presented in a consistent way that facilitates the production of the consolidated accounts. 
G capital and project control
There are clearly defined evaluation and approval processes for acquisitions and disposals, capital expenditure and project control. These include escalating 
levels of authority, detailed appraisal and review procedures and post-completion reviews of all major projects to compare the actual outcome with the original 
plan. Certain transactions are reserved for approval by the board. Limits of delegated responsibility and areas of authority have been identified for employees.
G External audit
The audit committee reports to the board on matters discussed with the auditors during the course of the statutory audit and interim review. 86

Statement of compliance 
The company is committed to ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are maintained. Although the 2010 version of the Combined Code 
will not apply to the company until the financial year beginning on 2 May 2011, the board will review its requirements and work towards compliance in 
due course. The board considers that the company has complied with the 2008 Combined Code throughout the year, except in the following areas:
A.3.2
A.3.2 requires that at least half of the board, excluding the chairman, should comprise independent non-executive directors. From the beginning of 
the year until 31 January 2010, when David Elliott retired, this requirement was not met, in that during that period the board comprised the chairman, 
four non-executive directors and five executive directors. With the retirement of David Elliott and the subsequent stepping down from the board of 
Justin Adams and Jonathan Lawson, the board now complies with this clause of the code.
A.4.1 
A.4.1 requires the majority of members of the nomination committee to be independent non-executive directors. From the beginning of the year until 
June 2009, this requirement was not met, in that the nomination committee had just two members, only one of whom was deemed to be independent. 
During that part of the year no committee meetings were held. In June 2009 a third member, John Brady, whom the board regard as independent, 
was appointed and the requirement was met. 
The information required by DTR 7.1 and DTR 7.2 is set out in this report, except for information required under DTR 7.2.6 which is set out in the 
directors’ report. Governance

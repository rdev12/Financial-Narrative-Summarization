CORRDominos Colour sec a/w  30/3/05  16:06  Page 1 From strength to strength
In 2004, Domino’s Pizza continued to grow at a rapid rate
but speed of expansion did not mean compromising on
quality. After all, the long-term strength of our business
relies upon the maintenance of very high standards.
That’s the reason why we will only open great-looking
new stores in prime locations and appoint outstanding
franchise operators to run them.

UK and Ireland
Chairman’s Statement
For us here at Domino’s Pizza in the UK and Ireland,
bigger seems to present us with more opportunities to
get better at what we do. As our store numbers grow,
so do our system-wide sales. In 2004, total sales from
all stores reached a record-setting £174.3 million, a
£32 million increase over 2003. And, keep in mind,
2003’s system-wide sales grew by £23 million after
breaking the then 2002’s record. Simply put, more
stores mean more sales. At the close of 2004 we 
celebrated the launch of our 357
th
store and our 
system is now bigger than those of our two nearest
competitors combined. We still foresee a time when
up to 1,000 Domino’s Pizza stores will be operating in
the UK and Ireland.
As the number of stores increases, the associated
costs per store are reduced. For example, consider our
National Advertising Fund (NAF) which finances our
marketing campaigns and is made up of contributions
from all stores. The NAF provides for the continuation
of our very successful relationship with The Simpsons
on Sky One as well as all of our TV advertisements and
campaigns in support of new product developments. In
2004 our National Advertising Fund grew to £7 million,
up from £5.7 million in 2003. When one considers that
the costs incurred in a nationwide advertising campaign
are the same whether there are ten or one hundred
or even one thousand stores, it’s easy to see that 
the returns and cost-effectiveness are going to be 
significantly improved with each new store that opens.
Our opportunities for future growth are more exciting
than ever. More residential property is being built all
over the country and in those new houses demand for,
and access to, in-home entertainment is still on the
rise. Demand for home-delivered pizza is following suit
as people seek to enjoy more time in their homes. A
quick look at the growth in our e-commerce business
is clear evidence that more people are logging on,
ordering a pizza and sitting down at home to enjoy 
as much leisure time there as possible.
Our e-commerce business is a success story in its own
right, generating £8.2m in sales during 2004, a 41%
increase over 2003. This success comes despite the
fact that our IT infrastructure, which we revamped 
in 2004, had spent a good part of the year under 
construction. The resulting work saw a new and
enhanced website and an improved interactive TV 
ordering platform on Sky Active, both aimed at making
our customers’ ordering experience more convenient,
enjoyable and much faster.
At Domino’s we benefit from a robust community of
franchise partners, whose ranks grew to 147 from 128
between 2003 and 2004. Many of these hard-working
people have become millionaires since joining our team
and their success has been earned the old-fashioned
way - through hard work and passion for their business,
as well as their adherence to Domino’s stringent quality
standards which benefit the whole system as well as
the individual. 
This year, I am delighted to welcome two significant
new appointments to our Board. Firstly, I should like
to welcome Lee Ginsberg who joined us as Finance
Director on 1 November 2004. Lee has extensive
experience in the leisure and retail industry and is 
a very positive addition to the Company’s strong 
senior management team. Also recently appointed is
John Hodson who joined us as Non-Executive Director
on 14 February 2005. John’s skills are certain to be an
excellent asset to the Company.
With heartfelt gratitude, I must also recognise two
accomplished men who have been instrumental in 
our success: Yoav Gottesman and Gerald Halpern.
Yoav has helped us navigate our path to success and
my brother Gerald has worked beside me for the past 
11 years, providing insight that helped to give our
business a strong foundation for growth. Yoav retired
from the Board in May 2004 and Gerry will be retiring
from our Board of Directors at the upcoming Annual
General Meeting.
In closing, I should like to say ‘thank you’ to everyone
in the Domino’s team for a job well done again this
past year. We couldn’t have reached the peaks we’ve
reached without the outstanding people in each of our
support departments and in each of our stores. And,
of course, we thank you, our shareholders, whose
confidence in us allows us to grow stronger each
year. It is you who provide us with the resources to
accomplish ever greater triumphs year after year and
who make it possible for us to raise the benchmark at
the start of each new year. We simply couldn’t do it
without you. We will work hard to earn your continued
confidence in 2005.

INTRODUCTION
2004 was another very successful year for your
Company with sales reaching record levels both 
system-wide and at store level. Profitability also 
continued to grow very strongly as the benefits of our
high operational gearing became still more apparent.
Whilst we opened fewer new stores in 2004 than in
2003, our priority remains to only open in the right
locations with the right operators, and this we achieved.
Our strong cash generation continued and, as 
indicated in previous statements, this will be returned
to shareholders as long as it does not impact on the
growth of the business. As a result, the share buy
back programme was commenced during 2004 and 
it is proposed to significantly increase the dividend
payment for the year. 
Our continuing success results from a strong and 
talented management team who have an in-depth
understanding of the market in which we operate.
Their innovative approach has helped to further
strengthen our leadership position. 
SYSTEM SALES
System sales, which are the sales of all stores in the
Domino’s system in the UK and Republic of Ireland,
rose by 22.5% to £174.3m (2003: £142.3m) in the 
53 weeks ended 2 January 2005. Like-for-like sales 
in the 268 stores open for more than twelve months
grew by 6.6% (2003: 7.4%). 
In 2005 Domino’s Pizza celebrates 20 years in the UK
market. In the last five years alone, total system sales
have grown by over 174.5% from £63.5m in 1999 to
£174.3m in 2004. This is an annual compound growth
rate of 22.4%. 
SYSTEM EXPANSION AND MANAGING GROWTH
In 2004 we opened 40 new stores (2003: 50) and
closed one (2003: one). As a result, the year-end store
count in the UK and Ireland increased to 357 stores
(2003: 318). 
Forty new stores in 2004 was, however, a 
disappointment as we had set ourselves an internal
target to repeat the 50 new store openings we
achieved in 2003. There were two reasons for the
shortfall. Firstly, as foreshadowed in my Interim 
Statement, uncertainty arising from long-awaited
changes in the planning Use Classes Order, which 
will result in Domino’s Pizza stores requiring A5
(rather than A3) class, has caused delays in our
obtaining the necessary consents. 
The legislation that gave rise to these changes was
announced in early 2004 but, after an extraordinary
delay, it has only recently been confirmed that the new
classes system will come into effect on 21 April 2005.
Whilst we do not welcome the still stricter planning
controls, we hope the elimination of uncertainty will
allow the planning process to become more predictable.
It is the strategy of the Company to expand the system
as quickly as possible. We will not however, do this at
any price and the quality of the franchisees that operate
new stores continues to be of paramount importance. 
This highly selective approach to expansion is the 
second reason for our opening fewer stores in 2004
than in the previous year. During 2004, although we
saw another record number of applications from
potential new franchisees, aided by our winning the
British Franchise Association Franchisor of the Year
award, there remained a lack of suitable franchisees
in regions that we have identified for expansion and
where we have secured new sites. We, therefore,
declined to open a number of stores where there 
was neither a new franchisee of the standard required
nor an existing franchisee ready to operate multiple
stores. I am pleased to report that most of these sites
have now opened or are scheduled to open in the
first quarter of 2005 with franchisees who will be a
credit to the system. 
TRADING RESULTS 
Group turnover, which includes the sales generated by
the Group from royalties, fees on new store openings,
food sales and rental income, as well as the turnover
of corporately owned and operated stores, grew by
20.5% to £74.2m (2003: £61.6m). 
Group operating profit grew by 53.2% to £9.1m
(2003: £6.0m) although there was an exceptional
charge of £532,000 in 2003 related to a tender offer
and the establishment of an Employee Benefit Trust
(“EBT”). Excluding this, Group operating profit grew
by 40.6%. During 2004 the Group incurred a loss 
on the sale of fixed assets of £47,000 compared 
with a profit of £775,000 in the previous year, almost
all of which related to corporate store disposals in
both years.

It’s up to these diverse and dedicated people to take great
care of our customers and uphold the high standards
that make us the pizza delivery leaders. That’s why we
invest in attracting, training and retaining the very best.

CORRDominos Colour sec a/w  30/3/05  16:07  Page 6 Chief Executive’s Report 
Interest paid rose to £0.4m (2003: £0.3m) as the
result of a full year interest charge on the EBT. Net
interest costs are covered 33.7 times by operating
profits (2003: 29.3 times). After taking account of
these items, profit before tax was up 34.9% to 
£8.8m from £6.5m. 
The tax charge fell from 30% to 23% principally as 
a result of the non-recurrence of the tax effect of the
previous year’s store disposals; the relief available 
on the rollover of capital gains made in earlier years
and the tax relief available to the Company on the
exercise of employee options. As a result of the
reduced tax charge, profits after tax were up 47.7%
to £6.7m (2003: £4.6m).
EARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDEND 
Basic earnings per share were up 46.7% to 13.23
pence from 9.02 pence. Diluted earnings per share
increased by 51.0% to 12.67 pence from 8.39 pence.
As a result of the strong cash generation during the
year, the Board is pleased to recommend a further
significant increase in the dividend payment which, 
if approved, will give a final dividend of 3.05 pence
per share (2003: 2.18 pence per share). This would
give a total dividend for the year of 5.25 pence per
share, a 50.0% increase over the 3.50 pence per share
declared for 2003. The proposed dividend is 2.5 times
covered by profits after tax (2003: 2.6 times).
Subject to shareholders’ approval the final dividend
will be payable on 29 April 2005 to shareholders on
the register on 15 April 2005.
CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET 
2004 has been another encouraging year in terms 
of our balance sheet and cash flows. Net cash inflow
from operating activities reached £9.9m, up from
£8.0m in 2003. This increase was attributable in the
main to the higher operating profits which were
£3.1m up on 2003.
The Group continues to generate increasingly strong
cash flows and the model is proving to be even more
robust as profitability grows and capital expenditure
levels have reduced now that the infrastructure is in
place. At the year-end, the Group had cash on hand 
of £4.8m (2003: £3.7m). The increase in cash on 
hand this year was even more reassuring given the
underlying cash flows. During 2004 we spent £2.1m
more than last year on fixed assets, primarily due to
the purchase of the long leasehold interest of the
commissary in Naas. Furthermore, we bought back
shares at a cost of £1.6m, had higher outflows of
£0.6m in tax and £0.9m in dividends but still increased
cash balances by £1.1m. 
During the year options over 2.4m shares were 
exercised generating a cash inflow of £1.1m 
(2003: £1.0m). 
Towards the end of the year, the Employee Benefit
Trust (“EBT”) granted further reversionary interests 
in 600,000 of the Company’s shares which were 
purchased by the EBT at a cost of £1.2m. This was
financed by a further bank loan of £1.2m guaranteed
by the Company. The EBT now holds a total of
3,599,921 shares financed by the bank loan of 
£6.4m (2003: £5.2m). The Company has adopted 
the accounting treatment of UITF 38, Accounting 
for ESOP Trusts. The full cost of the shares has 
been deducted from shareholders’ funds, with the
debt being consolidated into the Group’s balance sheet.
During the year DP Capital extended the leasing 
support provided to franchisees for the fit-out of 
new stores and the refit of existing stores, with new
advances of £0.9m. After repayments, the balance
outstanding at the year-end from this activity was
£2.9m (2003: £3.1m). These facilities are financed by
a limited recourse loan facility and the amount drawn
down at the year-end stood at £2.6m (2003: £2.7m).
At the year-end, the Group had consolidated debt 
of £9.0m (2003: £8.0m) all of which related to the
EBT loan and financing for DP Capital referred to
above. After taking into account cash balances, 
net borrowings at the year-end stood at £4.2m 
(2003: £4.2m) representing 31.7% (2003: 39.7%) 
of shareholders’ funds.
Although adoption of IFRS will only be mandatory for
AIM listed companies from 2007, we have already
made a preliminary assessment of the impact on the
Group. Our evaluation has highlighted that the adoption
of IFRS is not expected to have any significant impact
on the Group’s reported results.

CORPORATE STORES
In recent years we have been exploring different
structures to enable our shareholders to benefit 
from the significant profitability and exceptional
returns on capital that can be obtained from a well-run
Domino’s Pizza store. Past experience has shown us
that corporate ownership can dull the entrepreneurial
spirit that is essential to that success, and impose
overheads, that in a smaller business, might be 
avoided. We have, therefore, been exploring a 
number of alternatives, including joint ventures, to
see if the partnership of corporate strength and the
entrepreneurialism of a franchisee who has invested his
or her own money into the business can reproduce
the success experienced by so many of our franchisees.
The results to date from our current joint ventures
have been encouraging and, as a result, we have
determined to incorporate most of the existing 
corporate stores into joint ventures. 
We will attempt to establish as many of the 
joint ventures as possible using third party debt 
funding so that your Company’s role will be that 
of an equity partner. This will enable us to maximise
our returns and obtain the return of much of the 
capital previously invested. This will then become
available for reinvestment in the core business or
returned to shareholders.
LEADING THE MARKET
In 2004, the take-away and home-delivered food 
market in the UK was estimated by Mintel to be worth
£5.2bn, of which home delivery now constitutes 24%.
The total value of the home delivered food market in
the UK has increased in value by 62% since 1999 and
is now estimated to be around £1.2bn. Pizza currently
accounts for 43% of the home delivered food market
and we estimate that Domino’s can claim to deliver
approximately one in ten home delivered meals in 
the UK.
Research suggests that the home delivery market 
will be worth in excess of £1.8bn by 2009 and this
growth will be driven by continued pressure on 
consumers’ time coupled with increasing access to
convenient technologies that offer online, interactive
and SMS ordering of home delivered food.
There has been considerable recent debate on the
issue of healthy eating which has prompted us to
review our responsibilities in this area. We believe
that we have a role to play in supporting Government
efforts to increase public health and awareness of
nutritional issues. Your Company believes that its main
responsibility is to provide customers with high quality
food, about which they can access full information,
and provide a menu which includes options to suit 
different lifestyles and dietary needs. The introduction
in 2004 of reduced fat cheese, ‘Delight’ mozzarella, 
is a demonstration of this approach in action and 
we will continue to reinforce our commitment in
these areas. 
Through constant and close monitoring of the world in
which we operate, and through innovation and practical
changes that benefit our customers, I am confident
that Domino’s Pizza will continue to strengthen its
leadership of the home delivered food market.
BUILDING THE BRAND 
Brand-building activity continued to be an important
focus in 2004, both externally to customers and 
internally to our own people.
The strength of our National Advertising Fund was
leveraged with creative, high impact and closely 
targeted campaigns throughout the year, culminating
in a highly successful launch for our new gourmet pizza,
Double Decadence™. These campaigns benefited
from the continued support of our sponsorship of 
The Simpsons on Sky One which ensures our brand
has a continuous presence in homes across the UK
and Ireland at peak pizza-ordering time.
Direct mail and local store marketing, which includes
the distribution of over 150 million menus each 
year, are mainstays of our marketing activity and 
are complemented by the efforts of our franchisees
to foster local loyalty through positive community 
relations campaigns.
Our e-commerce platforms go from strength to
strength with sales in 2004 ahead by 41% on the
prior year. Sales through the internet and interactive
TV accounted for 5.2% of sales in the UK (2003: 4.5%).

The first-mover advantage we enjoyed after becoming the

so much added convenience for customers, rapid growth in

website (www.dominos.co.uk) launched in 2004, enabling
customers to order pizza in seconds and ordering from us
through Sky Active requires a few clicks on a remote control!

A top priority for Domino’s Pizza is to deliver more than
just great-tasting pizza to the communities we serve. 
We do this in a number of ways – through sympathetic
store design, responsible operations and support for
local charities and groups. Our franchisees understand
that, at the heart of a successful Domino’s business,
there is a successful relationship with the community.

CURRENT TRADING AND PROSPECTS 
Trading in the first six weeks of the current year has
got off to a good start with like-for-like sales up 6.6%.
In the same period, e-commerce sales are 49% ahead
of last year. Our store opening programme is also well
on track to achieve our targets. 
Our strategy remains the roll-out of new stores and
the growth of like-for-like sales, whilst maintaining
tight control of overheads. Achievement of this 
strategy will allow us to generate significant amounts
of cash which, in the absence of any business need,
will be returned to shareholders. We have made a
promising start to 2005 in the achievement of all
these objectives and, therefore, look forward to the
year with confidence. 
CONCLUSION AND THANKS
At the heart of your Company’s success is our 
highly-focused approach – the delivery of hot, high
quality pizza on time. Fulfilling this simple promise
every day is a dedicated team of corporate and 
in-store team members to whom I offer my thanks
and respect.
In particular, I should like to thank our franchisees.
These men and women are the engine of our 
organisation and their enterprise, enthusiasm and
round-the-clock dedication sets the pace for the 
rest of our business.

Pizza Group Limited (Unapproved) Share Option Scheme, has been in place since 30 March 1999. The Domino’s Pizza Share Option
(Unapproved) Scheme was introduced on 24 November 1999.

offered the chance to release their options over shares in Domino’s Pizza Group Limited in return for equivalent options over ordinary shares
in the Company under the Domino’s Pizza Share Option (Unapproved) Scheme. Further details of options outstanding at the year-end are
contained in note 20.
CORR dominos financials -1 a/w  30/3/05  15:54  Page 16 Annual Report & Accounts 2004 17
The Remuneration Committee has resolved that the exercise of these options which have been granted under the share option schemes will 
be subject to the condition that the growth in normalised earnings per share in any financial year between grant and vesting exceeds the
growth in the Retail Price Index in the previous financial year by at least 5%.
On 23 March 2004 the Company established the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 2003 Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme. Under the
scheme the Company can grant options to eligible full time employees. For details of the options granted and outstanding see note 20.
Company share buyback programme
During the year the Company commenced its programme of buying back its own shares. A total of 800,000 shares of 5 pence each were
purchased during the year at a total cost of £1,600,000 before expenses. The reason for the purchase of these shares is that the Company 
has generated surplus cash and this is being returned to shareholders in the form of an enhanced dividend policy and share buybacks. 
These shares have been cancelled and no longer form part of the Company’s issued share capital.
Creditor payment policy 
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the Company 
and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. At 2 January 2005, the Group had an average of 
25 days (2003: 31 days) purchases outstanding in trade creditors. 
Corporate governance
The directors acknowledge the principles set out in the Combined Code issued by the committee on Corporate Governance and considers the
main provisions in-so-far as they are appropriate to the Company. At present the main facets are:
• The Board – at the year end the Company had four executives and two non-executive directors. The directors hold regular Board meetings
at which operating and financial reports are considered. The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s
strategy, budgets, and major items of capital expenditure and senior personnel appointments.
• Audit Committee – which consists of Nigel Wray and Colin Halpern. It meets at least twice each year and is responsible for ensuring that
the financial performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored, for meeting the auditors and reviewing the reports from
the auditors relating to accounts and internal control systems.
• Remuneration Committee – which consists of Nigel Wray and Colin Halpern. It meets at least twice each year and has a primary
responsibility to review the performance of executive directors and senior employees and set the scale and structure of their 
remuneration having due regard to the interests of shareholders. It also has responsibility for administering the share option schemes.
• Going Concern – the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future and
for this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparing the accounts.
• Internal Control –  the directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains internal controls to provide reasonable
assurance on the reliability of the financial information used within the business and for safeguarding the assets. There are limitations in
any system of internal controls and accordingly, even the most effective system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
with respect to preparation of the financial information and the safeguarding of the assets.
The key elements of financial control are as follows:
• Control Environment – the presence of a clear organisational structure and well-defined lines of responsibility and delegation of appropriate
levels of authority.
• Risk Management – business strategy and plans are reviewed by the Board.
• Financial Reporting – a comprehensive system of budgets and forecasts with monthly reporting of actual results against targets.
• Control Procedures and Monitoring Procedures – ensuring authorisation levels and procedures and other systems of internal financial 
controls are documented, applied and regularly reviewed.
Directors’ Report
CORR dominos financials -1 a/w  30/3/05  15:54  Page 17 18 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
Directors’ Report
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those accounts, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
accounts; and prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Employees
Employees of Group companies are encouraged to participate in the success of the business through incentive and share option schemes.
Progress is regularly communicated to the management of subsidiary companies and all management and staff are expected to communicate
fully within their own area of responsibility. 
Disabled employees
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the requirements of the job can be adequately
fulfilled by a handicapped or disabled person.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy wherever practicable, to provide continuing employment under normal
terms and conditions and to provide training, career development and promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate.
Corporate social responsibility and charitable donations
Domino’s Pizza is committed to delivering the highest standards of product, service, image and safety for our franchisees, team members,
customers, the communities we serve and all other stakeholders affected by our operations. 
Furthermore, we strive to be an equal opportunities employer and are committed to investing in our team members through market-leading
remuneration, training and development. Our franchisees are contracted to adhere to high standards of employment practice.
The Company also ensures that its rapid expansion plans are underpinned by a culture of ‘Responsible Growth’. This means that we aim to
earn the respect, admiration and trust of local people and authorities by taking a responsible attitude towards the environment, construction,
planning and local regeneration. 
In 2004, the Company’s charity of choice was the Make-A-Wish Foundation
®
UK, an inspiring charity that grants the wishes of children 
who are living with life-threatening illnesses. As well as donating £20,000 lump sum to Make-A-Wish
®
, the Group’s franchisees and stores
undertook a wide range of fund-raising activities throughout the year.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
We have audited the Group’s financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2005 which comprise the Group profit and loss account,
Group statement of total recognised gains and losses, Group balance sheet, Company balance sheet, Group statement of cash flows and the
related notes 1 to 26. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities the Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom 
Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or 
if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We read the Directors’ report, the Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s report and the Report on Director’s Remuneration and 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements within it.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of
the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at 2 January 2005
and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Sunday to 30 December each year. No profit and loss account is presented for Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc as permitted by Section 230 of 
the Companies Act 1985.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and are jointly controlled by one or more ventures under a contractual
agreement are treated as joint ventures in the Group accounts. Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method. The 
Group accounts include the appropriate share of assets and liabilities and earnings, based on management accounts for the period to 
2 January 2005.
Goodwill
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions of a subsidiary, associate or business is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and
amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life up to 20 years. It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first
full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary, associate or business is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on acquisition that has not been amortised through
the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalised at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a 
business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint
that, unless the asset has a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value is limited to an amount that does not create or increase any
negative goodwill arising on the acquisition. Intangible assets created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged
against profits in the year in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Franchise fees – over 20 years
Interest in leases – over the life of the lease
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full year following acquisition and in other periods 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Significant property developments
Interest incurred on finance provided for significant property development is capitalised up to the date of completion of the project. 
These costs are then depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policy for the relevant class of tangible fixed assets.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost less residual value of each asset evenly over its
expected useful life as follows: 
Freehold buildings – over 50 years
Equipment – over 2 to 10 years
Leasehold building improvements – over the life of the lease 
Motor vehicles – over 18 months to 3 years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable.

Notes to the Financial Statements
at 2 January 2005
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Stocks
Stocks comprise raw materials, consumables and goods for resale (being equipment for resale to franchisees) and are stated at the lower of
cost and net realisable value. Cost of stock is determined on the average cost basis or, for computer and food stock, the first-in, first-out basis.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less or to receive more, tax, 
with the following exceptions:
• Provision is made for tax on gains from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, or gains on disposal of 
fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding
agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the 
balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only
where the replacement assets are sold.
• Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable
taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction 
is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate. All differences are taken to the profit 
and loss account.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
As lessee
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed 
to the Group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital elements 
of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. The interest elements of the
rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a
constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As lessor
Amounts receivable under finance leases are included under debtors and represent the total amount outstanding under lease agreements 
less unearned income. Finance lease income, having been allocated to accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return on 
the net cash investment is included in turnover. Income and expenditure from the rental of leasehold properties and equipment have been
included in the gross income in turnover and the related expenditure within cost of sales. 
Employee Benefit Trusts
The Company has adopted UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts. Shares in the Company held by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust 
are stated at cost and included as a deduction to shareholders’ funds. The trust has waived its entitlement to dividends. The Group will 
meet the expenses of the trust as and when they fall due. When options are granted the difference between market price and the grant 
price is amortised to the profit and loss account over the performance period.
Exchange of non-monetary assets
Exchange of non-monetary assets for an interest in joint venture, associate or subsidiary is accounted for in accordance with UITF 31. 
Gains are recognised to the extent that the fair value of consideration received exceeds that part of the non-monetary assets no longer
owned, including related goodwill. If the gain is unrealised, this is reported in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Pensions
The Company makes contributions to certain individuals’ personal pension plans. Contributions are charged in the profit and loss account 
as they become payable. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised as follows:
Pizza delivery – on delivery
Commissary and equipment sales – on delivery
Royalties (based on system sales) – on delivery
Franchise sales – on commencement of franchisee trading
Finance lease interest income – on commencement of franchisee trading
Rental income on leasehold properties – on a straight line basis in accordance with the lease terms
2. TURNOVER AND SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The principal components of turnover are royalties received, commissary and equipment sales, sale of franchises, pizza delivery sales, rental
income on leasehold properties and finance lease interest income, stated net of value added tax after eliminating inter-company transactions.
All of the turnover is in one continuing business segment being the development on the Domino’s Pizza Franchise System and originates in
the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The directors believe that full compliance with the requirements of SSAP 25 ‘Segmental
Reporting’ would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of the Group as it would require disclosure of commercially sensitive information.
All of the turnover of the Joint Ventures relates to the United Kingdom.

would become taxable only if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief. The amount not provided is £191,000
(2003: £156,000) in respect of this. At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
Due to a change in legislation, the Company is able to receive a tax credit when new shares are issued to satisfy the exercise of share options.
The timing of the exercise and hence resultant tax credit is at the discretion of the option holder.

19. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s principal financial instruments are bank loans, other loans, finance leases and cash.
The financial instruments are principally in place to finance the head office facility and associated equipment, provide finance to franchisees
and to provide finance for the EBT loan. The Group has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise
directly from its operations. As permitted by FRS 13 short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosure of financial
liabilities and financial assets.
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps or financial foreign currency contracts. In view of the
low level of foreign currency transactions, the Board does not consider that there are significant risks in respect of this. All financial assets 
and liabilities are denominated in £ sterling. The main risk area is in respect of any change in interest rates on the floating rate loans, which
the Board will continue to monitor.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets
The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the Group was as follows:
Financial
Floating asset
Fixed rate rate on which

Finance lease receivable 2,940 2,940 – – 28 months
Cash 4,824 – 4,824 –

The floating rate financial assets are based on the Group’s bank base rate plus a fixed percentage.
The average interest on the fixed rate financial asset is 11%.

Finance leases 65 65 –

The average interest on the fixed rate financial liability is 7.1% (2003: 7.2%). This is fixed over a weighted average period of 55 months 
(2003: 55 months). The bank loan attracts interest at a rate of 1% over base rate.
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities is set out in notes 17 and 18.
The fair value of the financial liabilities is not considered materially different from book value.
Un-drawn committed facilities at 2 January 2005 amounted to nil (2003: £3,000,000) in respect of the bank loan, and £4,500,000 in respect of
other loans relating to a limited recourse loan facility. The bank loan facilities expired in 2004 (2003 expiry date 9 November 2004). Of the
other loan facilities, £3,000,000 expires 5 March 2005 and £1,500,000 expires 30 November 2005.

20. SHARE CAPITAL (continued)
In 2003 the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Employee Benefit Trust was established for the benefit of employees. The EBT was established to
hold and deal in the Company’s shares under two new share incentive schemes. These are the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 2003 Enterprise
Management Incentive Scheme, under which the Company may grant options over Ordinary Shares to eligible full time employees. During
the year options over 481,000 shares were granted under this scheme. EBT also operates a long-term incentive plan under which senior
executives may be incentivised by the grant to them of reversionary interests over a portion of the assets of the trust. During the year further
reversionary interests were granted over 600,000 shares. At 2 January 2005, the Trust held 3,599,921 shares, which had a historic cost of
£6,360,000. These shares had a market value at 2 January 2005 of £8,279,818.
At 2 January 2005 reversionary interests over 3,425,000 shares in Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc have been granted. Further details are

The Articles of Association of the Company requires that any director appointed to the Board by the directors shall hold office only until

amount of £919,880.22.
7. Resolution 9 – Renews an existing authority given to the directors each year to allot shares for cash to persons other than existing shareholders
up to a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued share capital. This authority, which will expire at the next Annual General Meeting or, if
earlier, 15 months from the date of the resolution, gives the directors flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise
and the 5% limit ensures that existing shareholders’ interests are protected.
8. Resolution 10 – Seeks to grant (until the next Annual General Meeting or the expiration of 15 months from the date of the resolution if
sooner) the directors authority to purchase the Company’s own shares up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of
the Company. In proposing this Resolution, the directors consider that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders that
directors should retain the ability to make market purchases of the Company’s own shares without the cost and delay of an Extraordinary
General Meeting to seek specific authority for a share purchase.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
DELIVERING VALUE
Ian Durant, Chairman
“ Capco is well positioned to 
maintain its momentum 
following a year of progress 
and value creation.”
Capco’s strong performance in 2012 continues 
the positive momentum generated since the 
Company was established in 2010. Over this 
period, the Company has delivered market 
leading returns to its shareholders as a result 
of a focus on executing its strategy of unlocking 
value across its business supported by eff ective 
capital management. 
At the asset level Covent Garden has performed 
well with the continued evolution of the tenant 
mix and expansion of the estate through key 
acquisitions. An equity placing in September 
raised £149 million of new capital to support 
this strategy . Key planning milestones for the 
Earls Court Masterplan have been achieved 
alongside formal planning consent and the 
formation of a joint venture to develop the 
Seagrave Road project. This year has also seen 
continued reallocation of capital from non-core 
assets, particularly from GCP , to Earls Court 
and Covent Garden. 
The Olympic Games were a highlight of 2012, 
and I am pleased that our Earls Court venue 
was the host of the successful volleyball 
tournament which attracted over half a 
million visitors.
Engagement with the communities in which 
the Company operates complements the 
strategy and has been an area of much activity 
during 2012. Our entrepreneurial and diverse 
company culture is essential to the creative 
approach to place-making and the Corporate 
Responsibility (CR) strategy . Events such as

OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS
the Poppy Appeal in Covent Garden and the 
ongoing Earls Court Education Project show 
commitment to embedding the CR strategy 
in the areas in which the Company operates, 
whilst initiatives including volunteer days 
are undertaken by staff  throughout the year. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS 
In 2012 Capco delivered strong results 
with a total return of 22.6 per cent. EPRA 
adjusted, diluted NAV per share was the main 
component of this, rising from 167 pence to 
203 pence driven by the increase in valuation 
of the assets which were up 16.7 per cent on a 
like-for-like basis. Total shareholder return 
was 32.1 per cent. It should be noted that these 
results have been achieved with exceptionally 
low leverage; at December 2012 the Group’s 
LTV was 10 per cent.
I would like to thank the Executive 
Directors and all staff  for their hard work 
and commitment over the past year which 
has contributed to this strong performance. 
The Directors propose a ﬁ nal dividend 
of 1.0 pence per share, bringing the total 
dividend paid and payable for 2012 to 
1.5 pence per share. 
GOVERNANCE 
The Board has established an open culture 
which encourages dialogue and debate 
between the Executive and Non-executive 
Directors. The values of the Board in regard to 
both governance and corporate responsibility 
are embedded throughout the Group.
The Audit Committee has had a busy year of 
diligent oversight of the controls, risks and 
reporting, thus assuring the Board that the 
Company’s reporting is balanced, consistent 
and compliant. The Remuneration Committee 
has committed much time and eff ort to its 
review of Executive remuneration in 2012, 
and I am grateful to the Committee members 
for their contribution. The Committee has 
had a diffi  cult job in reconciling the views of 
a minority of shareholders and its conclusions 
are described on pages 59 to 75. 
As stated in the 2011 report, the diversity 
and composition of the Board have 
been reviewed and we were pleased to 
welcome Demetra Pinsent who joined as 
a Non-executive Director in May . Demetra 
is a former partner of McKinsey & Co and 
was leader of its European Apparel, fashion 
and luxury goods practice for ﬁ ve years, 
advising leading high street, aspirational 
and luxury retailers and brands.
The Group’s ongoing strategy was a focus of 
debate and discussion for the Board during 
the year, and the business model focusing on 
central London retail and residential property 
was affi  rmed whilst keeping an open mind on 
opportunities to allow the business to develop 
further. People development and succession 
planning have also been a focus of the Board. 
I am grateful to the Non-executive Directors 
who are participating in a mentoring 
programme with senior members of the 
management team below Board level to 
develop, strengthen and create depth in 
management capability . 
MOVING FORWARD 
In 2012 London took its place on the world 
stage as host city of the Olympics and centre 
of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, 
and its success under the spotlight has 
enhanced its standing as a global city and an 
attractive location for investment. The global 
capital ﬂ ows into London have underpinned 
the central London real estate markets despite 
the continued poor macroeconomic outlook 
for the UK, but London’s ‘safe haven’ status 
should not be taken for granted. 
Nevertheless, as we move forward I am 
conﬁ dent that Capco’s strategy to unlock 
value from its core estates whilst maintaining 
a strong ﬁ nancial position will enable 
it to capitalise on opportunities for its 
shareholders and continue to achieve 
market leading returns.

Commitment to Corporate 
Responsibility (CR)
Our entrepreneurial culture encourages a creative 
and holistic approach to place-making, which takes into 
consideration our impact on the environment and on the 
local communities where our estates are based. CR has 
become embedded into the fabric of our day-to-day work. 
For more about the speciﬁ c initiatives that illustrate our 
strategy, including the Apple Market Challenge (pictured

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive
“ Capco’s clear and focused 
business model and strategy 
have delivered strong results 
in 2012 and the assets 
continue to off er the 
potential for outperformance 
going forward.”
ground level has enabled the strategy to 
expand into premium residential conversions 
of the upper ﬂ oors. This has continued to 
deliver value uplift with the overall estate 
valued at £952 million, an increase of 7 .2 per 
cent on a like-for-like basis. 
In line with the successful repositioning 
strategy at Covent Garden, the equity placing 
in September raised capital for further 
investment in the district. The ERV target was 
also revised to £60-65 million by the end of 
2015. In 2012 £89 million of acquisitions were 
completed growing Capco’s ownership in the 
area by 13 per cent, creating a scale in line with 
historic London landed estates. 
Capco’s active asset management approach 
achieved landmark lettings including the ﬁ rst 
permanent stand alone fragrance and beauty 
concept from Chanel and a ﬂ agship store for 
Jo Malone. Balthazar, Keith McNally’s French 
brasserie concept backed by Caprice Holdings, 
opened in February 2013. Further growth is 
expected through the tenant engineering 
strategy which drives the continued 
repositioning of other areas of the estate as 
well as the introduction of new larger-scale 
developments and interventions. 
2012 was a year of continued progress for 
Capco as our focus on unlocking value 
generated further momentum to deliver 
superior returns for shareholders. Capco has 
a clear business model focusing on retail and 
residential London property . This delivered 
signiﬁ cant uplift at the Group level, with 
adjusted NAV per share up 22 per cent. 
Capco’s creative asset management and 
place-making skills at Covent Garden 
continued to drive value, whilst our ability 
to deliver complex planning projects was 
evident in the signiﬁ cant milestones achieved 
with the Earls Court Masterplan and Seagrave 
Road project in 2012. 
A strong balance sheet allowing Capco to retain 
high levels of liquidity alongside conservative 
gearing ratios underpins Capco’s estate 
strategies. This year £320 million was realised 
mainly from disposals within the non-core 
investments of GCP and China as well as the 
completion of the Seagrave Road joint venture. 
In May , a new ﬁ ve-year £70 million revolving 
credit facility was agreed, establishing a more 
ﬂ exible ﬁ nancing structure, and in September, 
the equity placing raised gross proceeds of 
£149 million to be invested in Covent Garden.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
Valuations
The Group beneﬁ ted from strong 
revaluations across its business during 2012, 
with a like-for-like valuation increase of 16.7 
per cent representing the main component of 
a total property return of 21.7 per cent.
Covent Garden increased in value reﬂ ecting 
rental growth as well as the continued strong 
demand for prime assets from a wide range of 
investors. The Earls Court and Seagrave Road 
land interests experienced a signiﬁ cant 
valuation increase due to the positive 
momentum of each project as well as the 
strong central London residential market. 
Other assets, mainly comprising Empress 
State and the last remaining asset in GCP , 
increased in value reﬂ ecting the strong 
investment market for those properties.
Covent Garden
Since taking ownership in 2006 over 50 new 
brands have opened in the Covent Garden 
area making it one of London’s most vibrant 
estates. There have been a number of new 
lettings in 2013 demonstrating continued 
demand for space on the estate. The successful 
introduction of new retail and dining at the

OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS
Earls Court & Olympia
The Earls Court Masterplan received resolutions 
to grant outline planning consent from the 
London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham 
(LBHF) and the Royal Borough of Kensington 
& Chelsea (RBKC) in September and November 
respectively . We are now working towards 
obtaining formal planning consent in the ﬁ rst 
half of 2013, which will require the issue of 
the Stage Two report by the Greater London 
Authority (GLA) and ﬁ nalisation of the Section 
106 agreements. The valuation of Capco’ s Earls 
Court interests has increased considerably to 
£336 million as at December 2012, an increase 
of 58 per cent in 2012. 
Formal planning consent for the Seagrave 
Road development was received in March. 
The 50:50 joint venture with the KFI in 
respect of this project completed in August 
realising net cash proceeds to Capco of £65 
million. The joint venture has now moved 
into its implementation phase, resulting in 
certain proposed enhancements to the design 
of the scheme as well as a detailed planning 
application to extend the scheme up to Lillie 
Road which will be submitted shortly to 
LBHF . The sales and marketing strategy is 
being ﬁ nalised with a view to launching the 
scheme in the next 12 months. The progress in 
taking forward this project has led to Capco’s 
50 per cent interest increasing in value by 62 
per cent (on a like-for-like basis) during 2012 
to £104 million.
In January 2013, the Conditional Land Sale 
Agreement (CLSA) was signed with LBHF 
enabling the inclusion of its land in a 
comprehensive redevelopment of the Earls 
Court & West Kensington Opportunity Area 
(ECOA). The Council is applying for approval 
of this deal from the Secretary of State and a 
decision is expected in the coming months. 
Discussions continue with Transport for 
London (TfL) for a regear of Capco’s existing 
leasehold interests at Earls Court, as this was 
not concluded in 2012.
Olympia has offi  cially relaunched as Olympia 
London following a signiﬁ cant £30 million 
investment over the past two years. It will be 
the focus of the Group’s exhibitions business, 
providing dynamic and ﬂ exible events space to 
cater for the needs of the exhibitions industry . 
OPPORTUNITIES AND OUTLOOK
Capco is well positioned within its core 
central London retail and residential property 
markets, and our assets continue to off er the 
potential for outperformance going forward. 
The fundamental drivers of long-term growth 
in London are strong, however we remain 
mindful of the short-term risks presented 
by the challenging macroeconomic conditions 
as we progress our plans. 
In Covent Garden we will continue the creative 
place-making, active asset management and 
strategic acquisitions as well as initiating 
selective development. At Earls Court, we will 
look to deliver the formal planning consents 
for the Earls Court Masterplan, create the 
detailed design of the ﬁ rst phase of the 
redevelopment and ﬁ nalise a transaction with 
TfL in relation to our land interests whilst 
assisting the local authorities as appropriate 
to respond to the judicial review challenges 
faced. The Seagrave Road project will focus 
on achieving a successful launch under its 
new branding of Lillie Square.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
MEASURING OUR PERFORMANCE
The Group’s Key Performance Indicators are selected to ensure clear alignment 
between its strategy , shareholder interests and remuneration of its employees. 
DESCRIPTION
Total property return is calculated as capital growth 
including gains and losses on disposal plus rents 
received less associated costs, including ground rent. 
This metric allows comparability to the IPD Total 
Return All Property Index.
TARGET
1.5 per cent pa outperformance since listing.
PERFORMANCE
During the year, the Group has outperformed by 
19.4 per cent. 
Total return is the growth in the EPRA adjusted, 
diluted NAV per share plus dividends per share 
during the period.
Outperformance over a three year period, versus 
the median of a comparator group of the nine 
largest constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate 
Index, is identiﬁ ed as a key measure of the success 
of Capco’s strategy .
2.5 per cent pa outperformance on a rolling 
three-year basis.
The Group has generated a total return of 17 .6 
per cent per annum on a rolling three-year basis, 
outperforming the comparator group by 3.1%. 
1
Total shareholder return is the increase in the price of 
an ordinary share plus dividends during the period.
The Group’s total shareholder return is benchmarked 
against the median total shareholder return of a 
comparator group of the nine largest constituents 
of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
As a key metric for long-term equity-based 
compensation for the Group’s employees, total 
shareholder return aligns incentives with 
shareholder interest.
4.0 per cent pa outperformance on a rolling 
three-year basis.
The Group generated a total shareholder return of 
39.1 per cent per annum on a rolling three-year basis, 
outperforming the comparator group by 17 .1%.

A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level (including underlying earnings per share) or speciﬁ cally relevant to each estate, 
for example ERV at Covent Garden and EBITDA at Earls Court & Olympia. These are discussed further in the asset-speciﬁ c operating reviews in the Financial Review .
All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors’ remuneration. These three indicators are carefully aligned with the Group’s strategy of unlocking 
value and delivering market-leading total returns over the longer-term. Total Property Return, underlying earnings per share and net asset value are linked to annual bonuses 
available to certain of the Group’s employees.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
The Board has overall responsibility for 
Group risk management. It reviews principal 
risks and uncertainties regularly , together 
with the actions taken to mitigate them. 
The Board has delegated responsibility for 
assurance for the risk management process 
and the review of mitigating controls to the 
Audit Committee.
Executive Directors together with Senior 
Management from every division and 
corporate function of the business complete 
a Group risk register. Risks are considered 
in terms of their impact and likelihood from 
both a ﬁ nancial and reputational perspective. 
Risks are assessed both gross and net of 
mitigating controls. Review meetings are 
held to ensure consistency of response and 
adequacy of grading. Detailed risk registers 
are reviewed twice yearly and upon any 
material change in the business with a full 
risk review undertaken annually , at which 
point it is also reviewed in detail by the Audit 
Committee with new or emerging risks 
considered by the Committee as appropriate. 
This allows the Audit Committee to monitor 
the most important controls and prioritise 
risk management and internal audit

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Overview
The Covent Garden estate continues to 
perform well with a capital value of £952 
million as at December 2012, a 7 .2 per cent 
like-for-like uplift year-on-year. In total, 
Capco owns 62 buildings comprising 380 
lettable units and over 898,000 sq ft of 
lettable space in Covent Garden. At 31 
December 2012, gross income (representing 
passing rent plus non-leased income) was 
£39.4 million. 
In line with the successful repositioning 
strategy at Covent Garden an equity placing 
was undertaken in September raising £149 
million of capital for further investment in 
the district. Proceeds from the placing in 
September were used to fund several 
acquisitions including:
 – The Wellington Portfolio consisting 
of three properties with 52,700 sq ft 
of mixed use space 
 – 17-18 Floral Street and 25-29 Henrietta 
Street which together include 15 retail 
& F&B units
 – 14 Garrick Street leased to 
The Forge restaurant 
In total, £89 million of acquisitions were 
completed in 2012 which expanded the estate 
by over 105,000 sq ft and, combined with the 
purchase of Kings Court in 2011, allow for 
further residential and retail opportunities 
as well as larger-scale interventions to unlock 
value from the estate. In January 2013, Capco 
exercised its option to acquire a 125 year lease 
for 38 King Street from the Trustees of the 
Africa Centre.
At the time of the placing, the ERV target 
was revised to £60-65 million by the end of 
2015 which would support an estate valuation 
at current yields of approximately £1.3 billion 
over this three-year timeframe. In 2012, 
27 new lettings (excluding those with 
non-standard terms such as development 
breaks) were negotiated at 4.6 per cent above 
December 2011 ERV . Tenant demand remains 
strong across the estate which is operating 
at near full occupancy at 99 per cent. 
Retail activity
King Street, the home of Covent Garden’s 
contemporary luxury off ering, saw the 
opening of Opening Ceremony , Jo Malone, 
7 for All Mankind and a new concept from 
Hackett in 2012. The upcoming additions 
of Aesop and Twenty8Twelve as well as the 
recent signing of Sandro, part of the LVMH 
group, continue the evolution of the street 
with 40 per cent of the brands changing in 
the last 12 months. In addition, public 
realm works to King Street were completed 
in May bringing the streetscape in line with 
the retail mix and creating a better experience 
for visitors. 
In November, Ralph Lauren announced it 
would be closing its Rugby brand globally in 
February 2013. Whilst disappointing, the unit 
is leased to Ralph Lauren until 2021, and off ers 
the opportunity to introduce a new brand into 
an attractive Piazza location in due course.
A successful pop-up luxury fragrance and 
beauty concept by Chanel which opened in 
July in the Market Building has now led to a 
permanent lease for the brand in the same 
location. In addition, Casio opened its G 
Shock West concept store in April, alongside 
Links of London.
Footfall in Covent Garden is consistently 
strong at 45 million. The ABC1 audience is 
now 89 per cent of UK visitors and dwell 
time has increased to over 90 minutes for 
Londoners and visitors, up from 78 minutes 
in 2011. 
Dining
The food and dining off er at Covent Garden 
now ranges from cult concepts to ﬁ ne dining. 
May saw the opening of MEATmarket on the 
balcony of Jubilee Hall, the latest cult burger 
concept from the team behind MEATliquor 
and MEATeasy . In July , Jamie Oliver’s new 
British concept, Union Jacks, opened in the 
Market Building, taking over part of the space 
vacated by Ponti’s in the North Hall. Brasserie 
Blanc, from chef Raymond Blanc, opened on 
the Opera Terrace in spring and late summer 
saw the arrival of Venchi in the Market 
Building, its only location outside of Italy . 
In February 2013, the Balthazar restaurant 
opened in the former Flower Cellars Building, 
with Balthazar Bakery next door. It is the 
only outpost of Keith McNally’s Balthazar 
outside Manhattan. 
In November, it was announced that 
Covent Garden will be the home of Union 
Square Group’s Shake Shack, a highly 
successful concept in its native New York 
City . The restaurant will be taking space in 
the South Wells of the Market Building in 
space formerly occupied by New York Deli 
and The Icecreamists and will be opening 
in summer 2013.
The most recent new signing, Sticks ‘n’ Sushi, is 
a Danish and Japanese fusion concept and will 
be opening later this year on Henrietta Street 
in space formerly occupied by Walkabout. 
Residential 
In line with the successful repositioning 
of the estate, Capco has been actively seeking 
opportunities to bring Covent Garden back 
to its residential roots, identifying offi  ce 
conversions to create luxury residential space 
overlooking a London landmark. The ﬁ rst 
residential conversion, The Henrietta, was 
completed in early 2012 and included three 
luxury lateral apartments and a duplex 
penthouse which set a new benchmark for 
quality in the area. All of the apartments 
in The Henrietta have now been sold at an 
average value of £2,250 per square foot, a 
signiﬁ cant uplift on prevailing values in the 
area. The sales generated trading proﬁ ts on 
sale of £2.9 million during 2012, and provided 
the basis for a 19 per cent increase in the value 
of the residential space at Covent Garden.
The Russell, on the corner of the Piazza 
and Russell Street, will be completed in 
spring 2013 and will create a further ﬁ ve 
luxury apartments including two penthouses. 
Conversion work on The Beecham has started 
on site to create a further seven apartments 
and work on The Southampton, a fourth 
residential project, will begin in the 
coming months.  22

OPERATING REVIEW – COVENT GARDEN CONTINUED
FUTURE PRIORITIES 
Capco’s strategy in Covent Garden remains 
on track, driving momentum and unlocking 
value through creative asset management 
and place-making. Consistent with the 
revised ERV target for the end of 2015, Capco 
will be seeking geared total returns of at least 
10 per cent from its Covent Garden holdings. 
Going forward the focus will remain on 
tenant engineering and the retail and dining 
mix in order to bring rental values in line with 
the wider West End retail areas. Growing the 
estate through tactical acquisitions will remain 
a priority with an active approach to buying 
within and around the boundaries of the 
existing estate. 
Strategic development and large-scale 
intervention opportunities are being considered 
for the estate. A planning application for Kings 
Court is being prepared for submission in the 
ﬁ rst half of 2013. The scheme would create 
new retail and residential space and improve 
pedestrian ﬂ ows between King Street and 
Floral Street. 
Reviving Covent 
Garden’s residential 
heritage
The Henrietta
Capco launched its ﬁ rst luxury 
residential conversion, The Henrietta, 
in Covent Garden in February. 
The quality, design and speciﬁ cation

The Earls Court Masterplan represents a 
unique opportunity to regenerate a substantial 
part of central London, creating thousands 
of new homes and jobs. Bordered by some of 
the most prime real estate neighbourhoods 
in London, the redevelopment off ers the 
potential for signiﬁ cant value creation by 
implementing Sir Terry Farrell’s vision to 
create ‘Four New Urban Villages and a 21st 
Century High Street’ across the 70 acre ‘Earls 
Court & West Kensington Opportunity Area’ 
(ECOA). In addition to 7 ,500 homes and 12,000 
jobs, the Masterplan will also create new 
health, education, cultural and community 
facilities as well as 23 acres of green space 
including the 5 acre Lost River Park. 
In 2012 the Royal Borough of Kensington 
and Chelsea (RBKC) and the London Borough 
of Hammersmith & Fulham (LBHF) resolved 
to grant planning consent for the Earls Court 
Masterplan. These are the most signiﬁ cant 
milestones achieved to date in the strategy to 
unlock value through the outline planning 
process from Capco’s interests in the area 
which comprise the leaseholds of the Earls 
Court Exhibition Centres, the freehold of 
the Northern Access Road and certain other 
assets in the area. 
The Earls Court Masterplan covers 
the ECOA as designated in the Mayor’s 
London Plan, earmarking the site as one for 
redevelopment and regeneration in London. 
The redevelopment of the ECOA is also in 
line with the core strategies of both local 
authorities and the Supplementary Planning 
Document (SPD) which was adopted by both 
RBKC and LBHF outlining the preferred 
option for comprehensive redevelopment 
of the Opportunity Area. 
“ Signiﬁ cant milestones 
were reached with the 
Earls Court Masterplan 
throughout the year which 
created considerable value 
for shareholders.” OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS
As a result of the progress in the planning 
process, most notably the two resolutions to 
grant consent for the Earls Court Masterplan, 
and greater clarity around the potential costs 
of implementing the development such as 
Section 106 agreement and other costs, the 
valuation of Capco’s interests within the ECOA 
undertaken by Jones Lang Lasalle, the external 
valuer, has increased signiﬁ cantly. These 
interests are now valued at £336 million, 
a valuation surplus of £123 million on the 
December 2011 valuation, and represent 
£14.8 million per acre.
As previously reported, judicial review 
applications have been submitted against 
LBHF and RBKC regarding the SPD and 
against LBHF regarding the Conditional Land 
Sale Agreement (CLSA). In January the High 
Court refused to grant permission for the 
judicial review relating to the CLSA to proceed; 
the applicant has exercised his right to review 
his application for permission at an oral 
hearing, which is expected to take place 
in April. The judicial review relating to the 
SPD is expected to be heard in July 2013.
Consultation has taken place with the local 
community throughout the Earls Court 
Masterplan planning process and will 
continue throughout the project. 
In terms of land assembly , continued 
discussions during 2012 have not yet led to a 
conclusion of arrangements with Transport for 
London (TfL) regarding its land at Earls Court. 
TfL is the freeholder of Capco’s leasehold 
interests of the Earls Court Exhibition Centres; 
TfL also owns the Lillie Bridge Depot which 
is currently used for operational purposes. 
However formal agreement has now been 
reached with LBHF regarding its land in the 
ECOA (see below). 
CONDITIONAL LAND SALE
AGREEMENT WITH LBHF 
Capco and LBHF formally signed the 
Conditional Land Sale Agreement (CLSA) 
in January 2013. Under the CLSA, Capco is 
entitled to acquire the Council’s 22 acres of land 
in the ECOA on a phased basis for a total cash 
consideration of £105 million, plus reprovision 
(as part of the future development) of the 760 
homes currently on the West Kensington and 
Gibbs Green estates (the Estates). 
The total cash consideration of £105 million 
is payable as follows: Capco paid £15 million 
in July 2011 at the time of entering into the 
Exclusivity Agreement with LBHF which has 
been regarded as the ﬁ rst instalment of the 
consideration. A further payment of £15 million 
was paid on signing of the CLSA for the Farm 
Lane and Gibbs Green School sites: legal title 
of Farm Lane was transferred on signing; 
Gibbs Green School will continue to be used 
by Queensmill School until the school relocates 
to new premises in 2014 and legal title will be 
transferred at that time. 
The remaining £75 million is payable in ﬁ ve 
equal annual instalments of £15 million each 
once Capco exercises its option to acquire the 
land. This option is exercisable until the earlier 
of (a) ﬁ ve years from the date of entering into 
the CLSA and (b) nine months from completion 
of the aff ordable housing on Seagrave Road. 
If the option is not exercised by December 2015 
the annual payments will be increased in line 
with RPI. Land can be drawn down in phases 
until 2035 but no phase can be transferred 
unless Capco has ﬁ rst provided replacement 
homes for the residents of the relevant phase. 
If the CLSA terminates or expires before all 
the land is drawn down, there are provisions 
dealing with the pro rata refund of the £75 
million cash consideration where speciﬁ ed 
events subsist at the date of termination. 
Overage of up to £65 million is payable in 
the event that the total area developed across 
the ECOA exceeds that set out within the 
Masterplan planning applications.
Whilst the purchase of the Farm Lane and 
Gibbs Green school sites is unconditional, the 
disposal of the Estates is conditional on 
receiving approval from the Secretary of State 
for the Department of Communities and Local 
Government. LBHF has resolved to send the 
decision to the Secretary of State for formal 
approval and a decision is anticipated in the 
coming months. £10 million of the initial cash 
consideration is recoverable if the Secretary of 
State does not approve the sale of the Estates 
and the CLSA is terminated.
In addition, the CLSA provides that Capco 
will acquire any private residential units on 
the Estates in the event that LBHF is required 
to purchase these properties as a result of an 
owner bringing forward a valid claim under 
certain provisions of the Town and Country 
Planning Act 1990 which relate to Statutory 
Blight. This replaces the agreement signed in 
March 2012 between Capco and LBHF . There 
is a cap of £55 million for such purchases, 
which includes certain other related costs 
of up to £10 million.

OPERATING REVIEW – EARLS COURT AND OLYMPIA CONTINUED
Separately , if a resident who owns their home 
on the Estates chooses not to take up the off er 
of a new home within the development and 
wishes to move away early , Capco has off ered to 
purchase such homes up to a cap of £7 .5 million 
from the date of signing of the CLSA. Once 
the Secretary of State has issued a satisfactory 
consent and a satisfactory planning consent 
has been granted, and both these consents are 
free from challenge, this cap will increase to 
£15 million. Once the option is exercised, the 
cap for all purchases under these provisions 
relating to Statutory Blight and early purchases 
will be £55 million. Sums paid by Capco to 
acquire existing homes would be off set against 
the cash consideration where these homes are 
included in a phase that is transferred to Capco.
FUTURE PRIORITIES
Formal planning consent is targeted for the 
ﬁ rst half of 2013 which will require ﬁ nalisation 
of the Section 106 agreements and the issue of 
the Stage Two report by the Greater London 
Authority (GLA). The Section 106 agreements 
are being progressed with the local authorities, 
the GLA and TfL, and will outline the local 
community beneﬁ ts of the development, 
including improvements in transport as well 
as investment in training and employment for 
the community .

The risk of further judicial challenge against

transactions cannot be discounted, and will 
in part depend on the outcome of the existing 
judicial reviews.
Now that the planning process is well 
advanced and agreement has been reached 
with LBHF , the next objective is to conclude 
discussions with TfL as freeholder of land in 
the ECOA. To facilitate this, the parties are 
currently focused on the restructuring of 
Capco’s leasehold interests at Earls Court 
whilst TfL considers how it could cease its 
operational activities at Lillie Bridge Depot. 
The intention remains to secure an extension 
of Capco’s existing leasehold leases and 
inclusion of development rights to enable Sir 
Terry Farrell’s Masterplan to be implemented 
whilst providing TfL with some participation 
in the value generated from any future 
development of the land.
Discussions with Network Rail in regard to 
the air rights above the West London Line 
are agreed in principle and the detailed terms 
are currently being negotiated.
In anticipation of ﬁ nalising the outline 
planning process and land assembly 
discussions, Capco is considering how 
it can best participate in the implementation 
of the Earls Court Masterplan which off ers 
the potential for signiﬁ cant value creation 
over the medium and long-term. Detailed 
design work has begun on what would likely 
be the ﬁ rst phase of development, the ‘Earls 
Court Village’ , with the aim of submitting 
detailed planning applications later in 2013.
EMPRESS STATE BUILDING
Capco has a 50 per cent stake in this landmark 
offi  ce building which is adjacent to the ECOA. 
The 31 storey tower is the highest building 
in LBHF . Fully renovated in 2003, the entire 
building is let to the Metropolitan Police 
Authority on a long lease which expires in 
June 2019. Capco’s share of net rental income 
for 2012 was £7 .3 million.
In the medium-term, opportunities to extend 
or review the existing lease will be considered 
or alternatively the property may be suitable 
for a residential conversion in line with the 
plans for the ECOA. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In March the Seagrave Road project received 
formal planning consent from LBHF . In 
August the 50:50 joint venture with the Kwok 
Family Interests (KFI) completed following 
the satisfaction of all conditions precedent 
and Capco received £65 million at closing. 
The joint venture with KFI brings in the 
expertise of a partner experienced in high 
quality residential developments. 
Capco notes the ongoing legal situation in 
Hong Kong regarding charges brought by 
the ICAC against certain members of the 
Kwok family , but this has not impacted the 
operation of the Seagrave Road joint venture.
As a result of the positive planning consent 
and work undertaken on implementation 
of the development, including work on unit 
sizes, mix and internal speciﬁ cation which 
have signiﬁ cantly enhanced the quality of 
the scheme, Capco’s share of the Seagrave 
Road site has been valued at £104 million. 
This represents a signiﬁ cant 62 per cent 
like-for-like increase since the December 
2011 valuation. 
Certain amendments to the existing planning 
consent will be submitted shortly to LBHF 
which the joint venture partners believe 
will improve the scheme. The joint venture 
is considering certain small acquisitions on 
the edge of the existing site, in particular 
to extend the northern end of the scheme 
to Lillie Road, and a detailed planning 
application for this new part of the scheme 
will be submitted shortly .  32 
OPERATING REVIEW – EARLS COURT AND OLYMPIA CONTINUED
FUTURE PRIORITIES
Adjacent to the wider Earls Court Masterplan, 
the Seagrave Road project is one of the largest 
development projects in West London and 
off ers an exciting opportunity to transform the 
area, with the potential to achieve sales values 
in line with established neighbourhoods near 
the site. 
The sales and marketing strategy for the 
Seagrave Road project is being ﬁ nalised 
with the aim of launching the ﬁ rst phase 
of the scheme to the market in the next 12 
months. As part of this, the development 
will be branded “Lillie Square” . Construction 
activity will follow the launch.
The enhanced quality of the scheme, together 
with the proposed extension to the north, 
have increased total development costs 
(excluding land) which are now estimated to 
be in the region of £380 million. However the 
peak capital requirement for the joint venture 
(excluding land) is still envisaged to be circa 
£100 million (Capco share: £50 million) due 
to the phased construction programme.
New Identity
Seagrave Road will be launched to 
market as Lillie Square. The naming 
is based on the adjoining Lillie Road 
as well as the garden square at the 
heart of the scheme.
This view is looking into the main 
access road of the scheme with 
mansion blocks on either side. 
The glass building which can be

FUTURE PRIORITIES
The focus is to maintain a robust exhibitions 
business focusing on the enhanced Olympia 
London, attracting new customers whilst 
preparing for the transition of business from 
Earls Court. Olympia London is now a more 
ﬂ exible space allowing it to cater for the 
changes in the exhibitions business, especially 
the trend for smaller shows. 
In the short-term the business performance 
will continue to reﬂ ect the ongoing uncertainty 
of Earls Court’s future as an events venue, 
particularly following the positive planning 
consents for the Earls Court Masterplan and 
without the one-off  impact of the Olympics. 
67 per cent of 2013 budgeted licence fees are

EXHIBITIONS BUSINESS
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Capco’s exhibitions, conference and 
events business currently operates from 
the enhanced Olympia venue and the two 
exhibition halls at Earls Court. EBITDA for 
2012 was £14 million, down 15 per cent on a 
like-for-like basis year-on-year in line with 
expectations due to the ongoing uncertainty 
around the future of the Earls Court venue. 
Olympia celebrated its 125 year anniversary 
in 2012 and recently announced its rebranding 
as Olympia London, off ering ﬂ exible and 
dynamic events spaces in central London. 
Capco has invested £30 million over the past 
two years to enhance Olympia, including the 
completion of Olympia West (previously the 
West Hall) in 2011 to create 97 ,000 sq ft of 
modern exhibition space, works to create 
enhanced event spaces at Olympia Central 
(previously Olympia Two), and an improved 
conference centre which was completed in 
September 2012. 
Earls Court successfully hosted the Olympic 
volleyball tournament in summer 2012 
which generated approximately £3 million 
of EBITDA. During the two weeks of the 
Games, 76 volleyball matches were played 
welcoming over half a million visitors 
overall, more than 35 per cent of the venue’s 
annual attendance. 
In 2012 a number of shows recorded increases 
in visitor ﬁ gures including Olympia Beauty , 
which achieved a 7 per cent increase from 2011 
by welcoming 23,500 visitors and the London 
Vet Show , which posted a record attendance 
of 3,300 vets.

The majority of capital employed in the 
Group’s non-core assets, GCP and China, has 
now been recycled at a considerable proﬁ t.
THE GREAT CAPITAL PARTNERSHIP
The Great Capital Partnership is a joint venture 
between Capco and Great Portland Estates plc. 
Capco’s strategy over the last two years has 
been to release value from the portfolio, 
capitalising on the strong demand for central 
London real estate. In 2012 £218 million (Capco 
share) was realised from the joint venture 
through sales including Park Crescent East, 
the Jermyn Street Estate and the Regent Street 
assets. The sales were completed at a 9 per cent 
premium to the December 2011 valuation. 
There is one asset left within the joint venture, 
Park Crescent West, which was valued at £48 
million (Capco share) as at December 2012, 
up 17 .6 per cent during the year reﬂ ecting 
the potential for a residential conversion 
demonstrated in the price achieved on the 
sale of Park Crescent East.
At the time of demerger, the GCP portfolio 
consisted of 34 assets valued at £247 million 
as at December 2009; net of external debt, 
Capco had equity of £135 million invested in 
the joint venture. Based on the distributions 
from the partnership over the past 3 years and 
assuming realisation of the remaining asset 
at its December 2012 valuation, Capco’s 
investment in GCP has generated an equity 
multiple of 1.7 times and an IRR of 30 per cent. 
CHINA
The investment into two China real estate funds 
off ered the opportunity to generate superior 
returns while building long-term strategic 
relationships. The last investment was sold in 
2012, and Capco received £18 million during 
2012. Capco’ s remaining interest of £4 million as 
at December 2012 mainly represents retentions 
that are expected to be paid during 2013. Since 
demerger , over £72 million has been realised 
from the China investment. This has generated 
an equity multiple of 1.6 times and an IRR of 
31 per cent.
FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES 
Capco’s track record in its non-core 
investments in GCP and China has been 
strong, delivering signiﬁ cant returns both in 
terms of realised proﬁ ts and IRRs. Accordingly , 
new opportunities may be considered and 
allocated a modest proportion of the Group’s 
balance sheet should they off er the potential to 
generate advantageous returns or complement 
the core activities of the Group.

“ Capco ended 2012 in a strong ﬁ nancial 
position with exceptionally low leverage 
of 10 per cent and over £400 million 
of liquidity .”
During 2012 the retail and residential sectors of the London 
property market continued to perform well with strong tenant 
and investor demand for well managed properties in prime central 
London locations. 
The Group’s property portfolio increased in value by 15.4 per cent, 
£228 million during the year to 31 December 2012, 16.7 per cent on 
a like-for-like basis. This capital growth was a signiﬁ cant element 
of the Group’s total property return, which including rental income 
and proﬁ ts from disposal as well as the revaluation, was 21.7 per cent.
The valuation increase also helped deliver a pre-tax proﬁ t of £245.5 
million compared to £161.9 million in 2011. 
EPRA adjusted, diluted net assets per share rose 22 per cent during 
the year, increasing from 167 pence at 31 December 2011 to 203 pence. 
This 36 pence increase together with the 1.5 pence dividend paid 
during the year represents a total return of 22.6 per cent.
Underlying earnings were £12.5 million which compares favourably to 
£9.6 million in 2011, the stronger outturn attributed to the reduction 
in underlying ﬁ nance costs exceeding the loss of net rental income. 
In May the Group secured its ﬁ rst revolving credit facility , providing 
increased ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility and allowing its cash reserves to be 
utilised more effi  ciently . Weighted average debt maturity has been 
extended to 4.8 years, from 3.6 years at 31 December 2011. In September 
a capital raising was completed providing liquidity for the continued 
expansion of Covent Garden.
The Group’s property LTV now stands at 10 per cent versus 29 per cent 
in 2011 and 35 per cent in 2010.
Restatement of 2011 comparatives
The adoption of the recent amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ , 
has required the Group to represent its deferred tax position as though 
the amended standard had been in eff ect at 31 December 2011. The 
amendment introduces a presumption that investment property assets

accounted for under IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ will normally be 
recovered through sale rather than use. This change in calculation 
basis increased the 31 December 2011 IFRS reported net asset position 
and proﬁ t after tax by £4.8 million. As a result, the 2011 EPRA adjusted, 
diluted net assets per share increased by 1 pence to 167 pence.
FINANCIAL POSITION
At 31 December 2012 the Group’s EPRA adjusted net assets were 
£1.6 billion representing 203 pence per share adjusted and diluted, 
an increase of 36 pence per share on 2011.
The primary driver behind this increase was the gain on revaluation 
and sale of the Group’s property portfolio which lifted net asset value 
per share by 34 pence. There was a positive valuation performance 
across all three estates but most notably at Earls Court & Olympia.
Following the resolutions by LBHF and RBKC to grant outline planning 
consent in September and November respectively , the Group’s valuer of 
Earls Court & Olympia, Jones Lang LaSalle, continues to recognise that 
the value of the redevelopment potential of the Group’s interests at Earls 
Court exceeds that of its existing use as an exhibition centre. This step 
change in valuation basis ﬁ rst occurred in the second half of 2011. The 
valuation at 31 December 2012 attributed a land value of £14.8 million 
per acre to the site which compares to £8.6 million at 31 December 2011.
At Covent Garden higher rental levels were achieved on retail and F&B 
assets together with the residential conversion potential of certain 
buildings. Like-for-like property values increased 7 .2 per cent, a good 
performance against the backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty that 
compares favourably to the IPD Capital Growth index for the 
corresponding period which recorded 4.2 per cent decrease.

Trading Property
When the Group undertakes the development for sale of certain 
property interests, these will cease to be held for investment purposes 
and will instead be appropriated to trading property . Most notably in 
2012 this applied to Seagrave Road which was appropriated following 
completion of the Seagrave Road joint venture with the Kwok Family 
Interests. Certain properties at Covent Garden which have been or 
will be converted from offi  ce to residential use are also now held as 
trading assets. 
Valuation surpluses on properties held for trading cease to be 
recorded in the consolidated income statement and their balance 
sheet valuation no longer reﬂ ects market value but rather the lower 
of cost or market value. Any diff erence between the carrying value and 
market value is however captured within the EPRA adjusted, diluted 
net asset measure.
At 31 December 2012, the unrecognised surplus on trading property 
was £37 .5 million, up from £1 million at 31 December 2011. 
Capital raising
In September 2012 the Group completed a placing of 68.4 million 
new ordinary shares at a price of 218 pence per share to fund expansion 
opportunities at Covent Garden. The placing, which was priced at 
market value, generated net proceeds of £145 million. The number 
of ordinary shares on issue now stands at 753.1 million (752.7 million 
when adjusted for treasury shares acquired through the odd-lot off er 
discussed below).

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Odd-lot offer
At the Company’s Annual General Meeting in April, shareholder 
approval was received for an odd-lot off er to facilitate a reduction in 
the number of shareholders in the Company in a fair and equitable 
manner. This off er was launched in November 2012 and upon closing 
in December 2012 a 35 per cent reduction in the Company’s shareholder 
base was achieved.
The Company acquired 0.4 million shares for £1.0 million (representing 
236 pence per share), a £0.2 million premium to net asset value per 
share. At the balance sheet date these shares are held as treasury shares.
At 31 December 2012, following the odd-lot off er, 27 .9 per cent of the 
Group’s shares were held on the South African register.
Capital recycling
2012 saw continued momentum towards unlocking liquidity from 
non-core assets in support of the Group’s core strategy .
During the year £320 million was released, principally from The Great 
Capital Partnership for use in the Group’s core estates, and on completion 
of the Seagrave Road joint venture in August.

The Great Capital Partnership contributed £218 million towards 
proceeds from property sales. These sales represented a 9 per cent 
premium to the December 2011 valuation. 
The Group was contractually committed to £21.4 million as at 
31 December 2012 (2011: £14.0 million).
Debt & Gearing
Net debt reduced by £300 million to £164 million, gross debt by £205 
million to £348 million with cash and undrawn committed facilities 
increasing to £401 million. 
In May 2012 the Group signed a £70 million revolving credit facility 
secured over certain assets within the Covent Garden estate, therefore 
retaining the Group’s non-recourse debt structure. This facility 
provided suffi  cient ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility and liquidity to allow the 
Group to repay in full the remaining debt of £93 million secured 
over Earls Court & Olympia. At 31 December 2012 the revolving credit 
facility was undrawn.
Further debt prepayments totalling £112 million reduced the Group’s 
joint venture debt, primarily following the sale of non-core properties 
from within The Great Capital Partnership. 
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan-to-value 
(“LTV”). LTV as at 31 December 2012 was 10 per cent, an unusually 
low ﬁ gure, mainly as a result of the proceeds of the capital raising in 
September 2012 and the liquidity generated from property disposals, 
together with the increase in value of the Group’s property assets. 
Given the current economic climate, the Group considers LTV of 
below 40 per cent to be prudent.

Debt prepayment and repayment have been targeted at shorter-dated 
maturities, helping to reduce the cost of debt, extend the weighted 
average debt maturity to 4.8 years and reduce reﬁ nancing risk. The 
Group now has £72 million of debt maturing in 2013, £67 million 
relating to debt secured over the Empress State Building held in a joint 
venture. This debt is due to mature in August 2013 and reﬁ nancing 
discussions are underway . A detailed breakdown of debt by maturity 
together with the latest covenant test results is shown on page 126.
Derivatives
The Group’s policy is to substantially eliminate the short and 
medium-term risk arising from interest rate volatility . The Group’s 
banking facilities are arranged on a ﬂ oating-rate basis, but swapped 
to ﬁ xed-rate or capped using derivative contracts coterminous with 
the relevant debt facility . At 31 December 2012 the proportion of gross 
debt with interest rate protection was 100 per cent, with the Group’s 
derivative contracts comprising 76 per cent swaps and 24 per cent 
caps or collars.
Investments in China
The exit of the Group’s existing interests has continued as planned 
with £18 million returned during the year. All assets have now been 
sold and the ﬁ nal distributions relating mainly to retentions totalling 
£4 million are expected to be received during 2013. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Dividends paid (8.6) (9.6)
Net cash ﬂ ow 94.9 (98.9)
Typically the main cash ﬂ ow items are operating cash ﬂ ows, dividends 
paid and capital transactions undertaken. 
Recurring cash inﬂ ows were £4.8 million compared to £1.2 million 
for 2011, due mainly to the lower interest costs.
Capital transactions comprise property acquisitions and disposals, 
together with investment and divestment in other long-term assets. 
Property investments and developments comprise acquisitions of £94 
million, £86 million of which was invested in strategic acquisitions 
within the Covent Garden estate. Development expenditure totalled 
£41 million, £32 million of which was invested towards the 
redevelopment of Earls Court and Seagrave Road and improving 
Olympia London. 
Sale proceeds of property and investments comprised £255 million, 
principally from The Great Capital Partnership as well as £18 million 
returned from investments in China. 
Completion of a joint venture arrangement with the Kwok Family 
Interests occurred in August. The venture, to develop land interests at 
Seagrave Road, resulted in the loss of control of the former subsidiary 
Seagrave Road GP Limited, and the disposal of a 50 per cent limited 
partnership interest in Seagrave Road LP . The disposal of the net assets 
of the partnership, less costs of arrangement and the reorganisation 
of internal funding resulted in a net cash inﬂ ow of £65.4 million. 
To align the corporate structure to long-term strategy an internal 
reorganisation was undertaken in November 2011 to segregate the 
operating business at Earls Court and Olympia from the investment 
properties. The internal sale and purchase was determined to constitute 
a VAT supply between two internal VAT groups. During 2011 input 
VAT of £22 million had been received from HMRC but, due to the 
timing of returns, the equal and off setting output VAT was not settled 
until January 2012.
Financing cash outﬂ ows relate primarily to the eff ect of net debt 
prepayments and repayments (£201 million) off set by proceeds from 
the September 2012 capital raising (£145 million), as discussed above.
Dividends paid of £8.6 million reﬂ ect the ﬁ nal dividend payment 
made in respect of the 2011 ﬁ nancial year and the interim dividend 
paid in September. This is slightly lower than the previous year due 
to the scrip dividend alternative now off ered to shareholders.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group has presented an underlying calculation of proﬁ t after 
tax and adjusted earnings per share ﬁ gures in addition to the amounts 
reported under IFRS. The Directors consider this presentation to

business as it removes exceptional and other one-off  items.

Exceptional items
In addition to revaluation surpluses on investment and development 
property and fair value movements on derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, 
exceptional items which have been removed from the calculation of 
underlying proﬁ t include:
 – Proﬁ t on sale of trading property of £6.1 million;
 – Finance charges of £2.0 million relating to the termination of 
interest rate swaps following debt prepayments and arrangement 
fees for the Group’s revolving credit facility; 
 – £10.0 million following further divestment of China investments
 – Impairment charges arising on trading property of £0.9 million
Income
Net rental income fell 5.3 per cent in the year largely the result of the 
sale of properties from The Great Capital Partnership which occurred 
in both the current and prior year. Like-for-like net rental income 
increased 1.8 per cent (£0.9 million) to £56.2 million, with the reduction 
in exhibition income at Earls Court and Olympia off set by increased 
income at Covent Garden. Of the residual £8.8 million non like-for-like 
net rental income, £4.4 million arose following acquisitions in 2011 
and 2012 with £4.4 million attributed to disposals during 2012, 7 per 
cent of total net rental income.
The continued uncertainty surrounding the venues business at 
Earls Court resulted in lost shows and a reduction in the size of certain 
exhibitions retained. This was off set in part by a good performance at 
Olympia and the RPI-linked rental uplift at Empress State, resulting 
in a 5.8 per cent fall in like-for-like net income for the EC&O segment.
Net rental income at Covent Garden has increased 9.4 per cent on 
a like-for-like basis most notably from new letting activity in 2011 
and 2012. 
Other income of £6.1 million comprises trading property proﬁ ts, 
£2.9 million of which arose on the sale of residential developments 
at Covent Garden.
Property valuation and sales
As outlined earlier the gain on revaluation and sale of the Group’s 
investment property portfolio (£213.9 million) taken together with 
proﬁ ts achieved on the sale of trading property (£6.1 million) and the 
movement in the unrecognised trading property valuation surplus 
of £36.5 million have collectively contributed 34 pence to the Group’s 
EPRA net asset value per share. 
Proﬁ ts of £16.4 million were realised on the sale of investment 
properties during the year, notably from The Great Capital 
Partnership. In total since demerger the Group has recognised 
valuation gains of £81.8 million from GCP .
Administration expenses
Underlying administration expenses increased 18 per cent to 
£26.1 million. This is the result of becoming a standalone business 
in May 2010 and the expiration of transitional services provided by 
the Group’s former parent in June 2011. This increase is in line with 
expectation and now broadly indicative of normalised operating costs.
Net ﬁ nance costs
Excluding gains and losses on the change in fair value of derivatives, 
one-off  costs incurred on the termination of interest rate swaps and 
arrangement fees relating to the Group’s revolving credit facility , 
underlying net ﬁ nance costs for the year fell to £22.8 million from 
£34.8 million in 2011. 
This reduction reﬂ ects the impact of various debt prepayments and 
repayments together with the beneﬁ t of reﬁ nancing during a period 
of historically low interest rates.
Proﬁ t on available for sale investments
Proﬁ ts recognised in the income statement have arisen from 
investments held in China. These have largely been recycled from 
the Group’s revaluation reserve following receipt of distributions.
Taxation
The total tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2012 was £5.5 
million which is made up of both underlying tax and exceptional tax. 
Underlying tax is the amount of tax charged on the underlying proﬁ ts 
of the Group and was £3.9 million for the year on underlying proﬁ ts of 
£16.4 million. This tax charge reﬂ ects an underlying tax rate of 24 per  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS
cent which is in line with the standard rate of UK corporation tax. 
The standard rate of UK corporation tax will fall to 22 per cent from 
April 2014 onwards. Exceptional tax of £1.6 million arises from the 
proﬁ ts on disposal of trading properties. 
Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable on a 
theoretical disposal of all investment properties held by the Group is 
£nil (2011: £nil). The contingent tax position is arrived at after allowing 
for indexation relief and Group loss relief. 
A disposal of the Group’s trading properties at their market values as 
per note 16 would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 
£9 million (24 per cent of £37 .5 million). 
The Group’s Tax Policy , which has been approved by the Board and has 
been disclosed to HM Revenue & Customs, is aligned with the business 
strategy . The Group seeks to protect shareholder value by structuring 
operations in a tax effi  cient manner which complies with all relevant 
tax law and regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation 
as a responsible taxpayer. As a Group, we are committed to acting in 
an open and transparent manner. 
Consistent with the Group’s policy of complying with relevant 
tax obligations and its goal in respect of its stakeholders, the 
Group maintains a constructive and open working relationship 
with HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining 
advance clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment may 
be uncertain.
Dividends
At the Company’s Annual General Meeting in April 2012, the proposed 
scrip dividend scheme was approved by Shareholders and a scrip 
dividend alternative was off ered to Shareholders in respect of the ﬁ nal 
2011 dividend and again for the interim dividend of 2012. Take-up was 
16 per cent, with 799,301 new ordinary shares issued during the year in 
respect of the scheme.
The Board has proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be 
paid on 20 June 2013 to Shareholders on the register at 24 May 2013. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board again intends to off er a scrip 
dividend alternative.
Going Concern
With an improved weighted average debt maturity , suffi  cient 
headroom against ﬁ nancial covenants and in excess of £400 million 
in cash and available facilities at 31 December 2012, there continues 
to be a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to meet both ongoing and future commitments 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors present the 2012 
annual report and accounts on a going concern basis.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENT
From the Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee
Our corporate responsibility strategy is important to the ongoing 
success of the Company . At Capco, we have an opportunity to 
positively impact the urban landscape both environmentally and 
socially . We recognise that there is a great deal to achieve in both 
these areas and consequently we have set ourselves challenging 
targets for 2013.
The two threads of corporate responsibility that run through 
our business are community and environment. By focusing on 
these broad themes, we have an opportunity to make a signiﬁ cant 
diff erence to the areas where our assets are based.
An example of our commitment to promoting good environmental 
practice was the assessment and certiﬁ cation of both the Earls Court 
& Olympia Venues to ISO 20121, the international standard for 
sustainable event management, in June 2012.
Of our community activities, an initiative of particular note this 
year is the Earls Court Education Programme which engaged 
students at both primary and secondary level with issues associated 
with sustainable urban regeneration.
We value the feedback received from our stakeholders on 
environmental and community issues and these views inﬂ uence 
the design of our future strategy . The opinions of our employees 
are taken into consideration when determining the direction 
of our human resources strategy .
GOVERNANCE
The CR Committee, which I chair, ensures that CR initiatives and 
charitable donations are ﬁ rmly aligned with corporate strategy . The 
implementation of the CR strategy is managed by the CR Executive 
Committee, which is chaired by Jill Pett, Director of HR and CR. 
Capco’s Business Code of Practice and Company policies set out 
long-term commitments to high standards of social, ethical and 
environmental practices. They also frame the CR annual objectives 
which are set and reviewed every year.
PROGRESS
In last year’s Annual Report we set out our CR objectives for 2012. 
In the following section we report on the progress made against 
these goals and set out our targets for the coming year.

Since 2006 Capco has had a team

allowing the business to become an 
integrated and active member of the 
community as well as the majority land 
owner in the area. In its plans and vision 
for the area Capco recognises the need 
for a highly collaborative approach with 
local stakeholders including the Covent 
Garden Area Trust, a body which protects 
the special interest of the Covent Garden 
Conservation Area and the Covent 
Garden Community Association, which 
looks after the interests of residents in the 
area. The Covent Garden team is also 
represented on the Area 1 committee, 
a group of neighbours, ward councillors, 
police representatives and stakeholders 
in the area which meets regularly to 
discuss and agree solutions for issues 
facing Covent Garden. This approach of 
embedding the business within the Covent 
Garden community has been instrumental 
to the overall success of repositioning the 
estate and creating value for the business 
through generating support for planning 
initiatives and new concepts.  44

with the remaining 8% (1,150 t/CO 2 e) being produced by 
The Brewery by EC&O, which was sold during the year.
Following the success of EC&O’s participation in the 
Carbon Voyage scheme, the project was included as a case 
study in a full Technology Strategy Board report on the 
Creative Industries Knowledge Transfer Network. The 
most used part of the service is the shuttle service to 
Gatwick and then Heathrow, and we have started to 
engage with the major freight providers on this service. 
Over the last year, we have engaged 25 major shows 
and events companies in this initiative.
Continue to monitor our 
carbon footprint.
Develop the Carbon Voyage 
scheme in conjunction with 
other stakeholders.
Continue to ensure our 
compliance and manage our 
participation in the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment 
(CRC) scheme.
We continue to participate in the CRC scheme, purchasing 
£160,000 of carbon credits for the current period.

Environment – our creative and holistic approach to place-making protects the environment where our estates are based
Aim for a 5% reduction in 
consumption on a like-for-like 
basis against 2011 ﬁ gures. 
Review the existing Energy 
Performance Certiﬁ cates for 
Covent Garden to assess existing 
performance levels and identify 
areas of concern. 
Undertake a pilot study at Covent 
Garden to prepare Display Energy 
Certiﬁ cates (DEC) for several 
buildings and review the ﬁ ndings.
We achieved a 4% reduction, which equated to a fall of 
514,793kg of CO 2 emissions after adjusting the data to 
exclude the impact of Earls Court being used as an 
Olympic venue (based on internally calculated ﬁ gures).
We have completed a review of our Energy Performance 
Certiﬁ cates for those premises surveyed to date: 56% were 
graded A to E.
We undertook a pilot DEC study of two buildings, which 
achieved a Grade D and a Grade B.
Achieve a 3% reduction in 
utilities consumption on a 
like-for-like basis against 
2012 ﬁ gures.
We intend to continue our 
work on EPCs, particularly 
those properties within the F/G 
Bands and improve their ratings 
where opportunities arise.
Minimise energy consumption 
and CO 2 emissions during the 
design phase of the Seagrave 
Road development in line with 
the Mayor’s energy strategy . 
This will include using energy 
effi  cient building materials 
and creating a sustainable 
living environment.
Continue to review the inclusion 
of sustainable elements in our 
development programme to 
suit our occupiers.
We have developed our Seagrave Road energy strategy 
in line with the Mayor’s objectives to reduce energy 
consumption and CO 2 emissions by various means.
We will actively encourage sustainable living through:
 – Smart metering to monitor energy consumption;
 – Well-informed and trained ‘Green Champions’ on-site 
who will promote recycling.
Work with contractors to ensure 
waste to landﬁ ll is minimised, 
targeting 50% plus being recycled 
or re-used and implement a 
Construction Environmental 
Management Plan.
In design phase, embed 
sustainability through initiatives 
such as photovoltaic panels, 
meeting level 4 requirements of 
the Code for Sustainable Homes.
All future major developments 
in Covent Garden are to meet 
BREEAM for Refurbishment 
‘Very Good’ standard where 
constraints permit within a 
Conservation Area and when 
refurbishing listed buildings.
Aim to increase waste recycling 
from our Covent Garden tenants, 
produce reliable statistical data 
for ongoing monitoring and 
investigate options for rolling 
this out across our estate. 
Continue to work closely with 
our contractors to minimise 
waste sent to landﬁ ll.
At Covent Garden proactive management of our tenants’ 
waste meant we achieved zero waste to landﬁ ll with 33% of 
the diverted waste stream being recycled and 67% being used 
in an ‘energy from waste’ process. 
We have renovated approx 92,500 sq ft of our existing 
portfolio during 2012. All current major works meet and/or 
exceed building energy effi  ciency standards where 
constraints permit within a Conservation Area and when 
refurbishing listed buildings.
At 15 Grosvenor Street, we are encouraging waste reduction 
by providing desk-side paper recycling facilities to all staff  
and cutting down on non-recyclable waste. During 2012 we 
increased our recycling output by almost 75% resulting in a 
saving of 8,610 kg of CO 2 e. We expect this to stabilise in the 
next few years but with some improvement. The recycling 
statistics are published monthly on our Intranet and a focus 
on green initiatives is actively encouraged.
During 2013, it is our 
aim to expand our tenant 
engagement programme on 
environmental issues such 
as waste reduction, recycling 
and energy management.
In executing our major 
development projects at Covent 
Garden, we will aim to achieve 
a target of less than 15% of 
waste going to landﬁ ll.
Assess ways in which we can 
create effi  ciencies through 
improved monitoring and 
reduced water consumption.
Procedures are being put into place to monitor and record 
metered water usage.
Monitor metered water usage 
across our portfolio. 46

Local Communities – we make a positive impact on the local communities where our assets are located
Continue to support community 
projects which speciﬁ cally 
beneﬁ t young people in London 
and in the areas where our assets 
are located.
Earls Court
As part of the 2012 Earls Court Education Programme, 
children from two primary schools participated in 
development programmes related to environmental 
issues associated with urban redevelopment. 
We then extended the programme into secondary schools 
and hosted the ‘Big Debate’ between Henry Compton and 
Fulham Cross Schools.
As part of the ‘Hammersmith and Fulham Partnership 
against crime’ scheme, the EC&O Venues team have 
continued to work with the police and local stakeholders 
to combat gang crime in the area. 
We encourage our contractors to employ local skills and 
will ensure that labour employed on the Earls Court 
development is from the local boroughs.
Covent Garden
The Covent Garden team consolidated its strong 
relationship with the Covent Garden Area Trust and 
other local community groups.
The 2012 Schools Apple Market Challenge engaged 10 schools 
and approximately 600 young people in designing and 
marketing a product to be sold on the market. The winning 
team designed a highly innovative, voice-activated lunch box. 
In March Damien Hirst joined children from local schools 
in spin painting activities in conjunction with the Kids 
Company Charity .
Support community projects 
which speciﬁ cally beneﬁ t young 
people in London and in the 
areas where our assets are located.
Further enhance our property 
management strategy for the 
beneﬁ t of all stakeholders.
In March 2012 Earls Court was recognised as ‘Exhibition 
Venue of the Year’ at the Exhibitions News Awards. Olympia 
was highly recommended in the category of ‘Exhibition 
Venue of the Year’ at the Events Awards.
The Covent Garden property management team have 
launched a number of initiatives for the beneﬁ t of 
stakeholders, including quarterly Customer Forum 
Meetings and ‘sparkle weeks’ involving an enhanced 
cleaning regime in partnership with retailers.
King Street was re-opened in June following major 
works to improve the road surface and streetscape.
Further develop our property 
management strategy for the 
beneﬁ t of all stakeholders.
Health & Safety – regular reporting and monitoring
Update the H&S Management 
Plan and further improve our 
H&S reporting across the Group.
The Group H&S Committee, which is chaired by the 
Investment Director and includes representatives from all 
parts of the business, meets twice a year and has implemented 
the H&S Management Plan across the Group.
The Capco Board and subsidiary Boards receive regular 
H&S reports.
With estimated combined visitor numbers of more than 
50 million to EC&O and Covent Garden, there were 30 
RIDDOR accidents reported for the year and no prohibition 
notices served. In respect of the 326 employees there was 
one reportable incident.
In addition, each business holds its own meetings and 
promotes H&S with suppliers and contractors.

Implement internal development 
programmes that will enhance 
the capability and performance 
of our people. Introduce 
succession planning at all

All staff  attend regular business brieﬁ ngs given by 
the Chief Executive. 
The intranet was successfully launched in September 
and is updated regularly .
A leadership development programme was launched 
in September 2012 and 60% of head offi  ce and Covent 
Garden employees attended training during 2012. 
Discussions regarding succession planning have 
progressed in order to ensure the ongoing success 
of the business.
Launch the next level of our 
Leadership Development 
Programme and further 
develop learning programmes 
that will enhance the capability 
and performance of our people.
Continue to encourage 
employees to engage in CR 
initiatives and contribute 
120 Group employee hours 
to supporting these projects.
We will encourage individual 
fundraising activities of our 
people and their immediate 
families through the staff  
recognition fund.
Capco staff  completed over 275 hours of CR-related 
activities during 2012. This included team activities 
such as the day the Finance team spent building a 
new vegetable garden for the Earls Court YMCA.
Employee fundraising of £4,000 was matched by 
the Capco staff  recognition fund.
Encourage employees to 
engage in CR initiatives 
and contribute 300 
Group employee hours to 
supporting these projects.
Agree a CR-related personal 
objective for each employee.
Increase the limit set 
for Company matched 
funding and encourage 
individual fundraising.
PEOPLE
The number of people employed across the 
Group at the year end totalled 326 of which 
55 are based at head offi  ce.
As a consequence of recruiting the best 
people with entrepreneurial ﬂ air, we have 
high-performing staff  who deliver Capco’s 
demanding business plan. Typically , we 
accelerate career development for individuals 
by giving them signiﬁ cant responsibility early 
in their careers. Our fast-moving business 
requires high performance at all levels and 
we set clear objectives during a review process 
which measures performance in key skills 
and ensures that individual goals are clearly 
linked to Company strategy . 
In 2012 we launched an internal Leadership 
Development Programme for our senior 
management team. The aim of the 
programme is to develop the leadership 
capability of the participants through a 
combination of interactive simulation 
sessions and practical skills workshops. 
Delegates have developed a personal 
development plan following participation 
in a 360 feedback process and have beneﬁ ted 
from senior level mentoring throughout 
the programme.
We further support our people in their 
professional development through academic 
study and currently have six employees 
working towards professional qualiﬁ cations. 
We have also introduced a series of lunchtime 
seminars for staff  covering relevant 
business topics.
We believe that high performance should be 
recognised and therefore bonus awards are 
linked to ratings received during the review 
process. Furthermore, as part of our 
remuneration strategy employees participate 
in our share schemes, ensuring alignment to 
business strategy . 
We value the well-being of our workforce 
and aim to encourage healthy and balanced 
lifestyles. Diversity is important to us and we 
recognise the beneﬁ ts of employing people 
with varied perspectives. The ratio of women 
to men within our senior management team 
is 1:2. Information on our approach to Board 
diversity can be found in the Governance 
section on page 51.
Aware of the challenges that young people 
are facing entering the job market, we aim 
to provide work experience placements 
across the business. 48

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
From the Chairman 
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2012 Corporate Governance Report. 
Capco’s governance structure comprises a framework of oversight, 
controls and reporting which supports the business. This allows us 
to operate with transparency to achieve the Company’s objectives and 
engender trust from shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. 
The Corporate Governance and Board Committee reports contained 
in this section of the Annual Report describe the operation of the 
Board and its Committees and explain how we applied the principles 
of good governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
during 2012.
There are two areas that I particularly wish to bring to shareholders’ 
attention this year: executive remuneration and Board composition.
Following Capco’s exceptional performance since 2010, the 
Remuneration Committee has undertaken a review of the 
Remuneration Policy and remuneration arrangements for Executive 
Directors. The conclusions of the review are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from page 59. 
At the time of last year’s report, we were in the process of recruiting 
a new Non-executive Director, and we welcomed Demetra Pinsent to 
the Board in May 2012. A former partner of McKinsey & Co, Demetra 
has brought extensive luxury retail experience and an understanding 
of brand creation to the Board, and I am pleased to report that she is 
making a great contribution to the Board’s discussions. During 2013 
we will continue to consider Board composition to ensure that the 
balance of skills, experience and diversity remains appropriate. 
Finally , in 2012 a revised UK Corporate Governance Code was 
introduced, and new regulations on remuneration disclosures and 
narrative reporting have been proposed. The new regulations do not 
apply to Capco until 2013, however we are monitoring their 
development closely and have incorporated additional disclosures 
where appropriate this year, including restructuring the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report into a policy report and implementation 
report. Good corporate governance is not only about formal 
Annual Report disclosures but also a cultural commitment the 
Board and management make to conduct themselves with openness, 
transparency and fairness, to engage with shareholders constructively , 
and to maximise the long-term value of the business within an 
acceptable framework of risk and with due regard to all stakeholders. 
This is a responsibility we all take very seriously .
By order of the Board
Ian Durant
Chairman

STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Company was fully compliant with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during 2012.

formal annual report disclosures.” OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS
THE BOARD
Board composition
As at 31 December 2012 the Board comprised 
the Chairman, three Executive Directors and 
six Non-executive Directors. The table below 
summarises the membership of the Board and 
Committees. In addition, biographies of all 
the Directors including information on their 
skills and experience can be found on pages 
48 and 49. 
Board independence
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires 
that, excluding the Chairman, at least half 
the Board should comprise Non-executive 
Directors determined to be independent. 
The table below sets out which of the Directors 
the Board considers to be independent. Each 
independent Director has conﬁ rmed that there 
is no reason why they should not continue to 
be considered independent, and the Board is 
satisﬁ ed that they all remain independent in 
character and judgement.
Diversity
As we reported last year, the Board was keen to 
improve its gender diversity . We are delighted 
that Demetra Pinsent was appointed as an 
additional Non-executive Director in May 
2012, bringing a wealth of luxury retail and 
branding experience to the Board, and thus 
increasing diversity in several respects. 
Information on the way we recruit new 
Directors and our induction programme 
can be found on page 57 .
Diversity is important to Capco across the 
Group and we recognise the business beneﬁ ts 
of employing people with varied outlooks. 
We are keen to develop female talent and the 
ratio of women to men within our senior 
management team is 1:2. Further information 
on our people practices, including our learning 
and development strategies, is contained in the 
Corporate Responsibility Report on pages 42 
to 47 .
The Board does not feel that it is appropriate 
to set targets on gender diversity as all 
appointments must be made on merit, 
however gender and wider diversity issues 
will continue to be taken into consideration 
when evaluating the skills, knowledge and 
experience desirable to ﬁ ll each Board vacancy .
AN EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
The Board is collectively responsible for the 
long-term success of the Company , and for its 
leadership, strategy , control and management. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive 
are distinct and formally documented, with the 
Chairman being responsible for the leadership 
of the Board, ensuring its eff ectiveness and 
setting its agenda, and the Chief Executive for 
developing the Company’ s strategic direction, 
implementing policies and strategies decided 
by the Board and managing the business.
Day-to-day management of the Group is 
delegated to the Executive Directors, subject 
to formal delegated authority limits, however 
certain matters have been reserved for 
consideration by the Board. These matters 
are reviewed annually and include: Board

and Committee composition, Company 
strategy , signiﬁ cant funding decisions and 
corporate transactions, delegated authority 
limits and dividend policy . 
Through the Chairman, the Company Secretary 
is responsible for advising the Board on matters 
of corporate governance, and ensures good 
information ﬂ ows within the Board and its 
Committees and between senior management 
and Non-executive Directors.
The Board meets formally throughout the 
year with main meetings timed around the 
ﬁ nancial calendar, and additional meetings 
convened to consider speciﬁ c matters as 
required. Attendance at Board and Board 
Committee meetings held during 2012 is 
shown in the table on page 54. If matters 
require approval at short notice, written 
approval is sought from the Directors.
Board papers are circulated several days in 
advance of meetings to ensure that Directors 
have suffi  cient time to consider their content 
prior to the meeting.
The Chairman also meets regularly with 
the Non-executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present.
It is in the nature of the Company’s business 
that matters requiring the Board’s decision 
are often large, complex and slow moving. 
To assist the Board, informal update meetings 
are held between Board meetings which are 
designed to allow Board members adequate 
time and preparation to explore, understand 
and challenge decisions in preparation. These 
are sometimes combined with site visits and 
provide an opportunity for the Non-executive 
Directors to meet senior management. Three 
such updates were held during 2012.
THE BOARD IN 2012
During 2012 the Board received regular asset and performance updates from the Executive 
Directors, and reports from the Company Secretary , Director of HR & CR and Committee 
Chairmen. Other matters considered by the Board during the year are shown below:
 – Strategy
 – Annual and interim results, interim management statements and dividends
 – Finance matters including budgets, taxation, cash and treasury management
 – Signiﬁ cant investment decisions including property acquisitions, disposals and leases
 – Property valuations, market and broker updates
 – £70m revolving credit facility

OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS
ENSURING AN EFFECTIVE BOARD
Board performance and evaluation 
Recognising that Capco’s Board must be 
eff ective, the Board conducts an annual 
evaluation of its own performance and that 
of its Committees and Directors. In 2012 an 
internal review was conducted. Directors were 
asked to answer questions on a wide range of 
topics, and to highlight any areas they felt 
needed additional focus. The outcome of the 
review was positive, with the Board judged to 
be eff ective and open, however several areas 
have been identiﬁ ed for attention during 2013. 
Further information on the evaluation process, 
the priorities identiﬁ ed and progress against 
actions arising from the 2011 review is set 
out below .
In addition to the Board evaluation, during 
the year the Senior Independent Director and 
Non-executive Directors conducted an annual 
appraisal of the Chairman’s performance, and 
the Chairman undertook an appraisal of the 
Chief Executive’s performance. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
requires that an externally facilitated review 
is undertaken every three years. It is expected 
that Capco will commission its next externally 
facilitated review in 2013 as the last external 
evaluation took place in 2010.
COMMUNICATION WITH 
STAKEHOLDERS
Our policy
The Board is keen to ensure that our 
shareholders and potential investors have a 
good understanding of Capco’s business and 
performance, and that Directors are aware of 
any issues and concerns which shareholders 
may have. The Company communicates with 
stakeholders in a number of ways.
Corporate website
Our corporate website 
www .capitalandcounties.com allows visitors to 
access Company information, annual reports, 
results presentations and webcasts. The site also 
includes links to our business unit websites and 
contact details for shareholder queries. 
Annual General Meeting 
Our AGM allows the Board to update our 
shareholders on Capco’s progress, and provides 
an opportunity for shareholders to pose 
questions to the Directors, and meet senior 
executives. Shareholders are encouraged to 
vote on the resolutions put to the meeting, 
either in person at the meeting, online or by 
submitting a proxy card. We publish the

results of the votes on all resolutions on our 
website following the meeting. 
Our 2013 AGM will be held on 3 May 2013. 
The notice of Annual General Meeting will be 
issued to shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the meeting. Separate resolutions will 
be proposed on each separate issue, and in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, each of the Directors will off er themselves 
for election or re-election.
The Chairman and Chairmen of the Board 
Committees will be available at the AGM to 
meet shareholders and answer any questions. 
Should shareholders be unable to successfully 
resolve concerns following contact with 
the Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance 
Director, they may raise them through the 
Senior Independent Director. 
Communications with shareholders
Communication with the Company’s investors 
is a priority for the Board. The Company has 
an extensive investor relations programme, 
and the Chief Executive and Finance Director 
hold meetings with institutional shareholders 
throughout the year, including results 
presentations, webcasts, road shows, one-to-
one meetings and investor tours. 
During 2012, the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee discussed proposed 
amendments to the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration with Capco’s major shareholders. 
The Company’s major shareholders are 
encouraged to meet with the Chairman and 
the Senior Independent Director to discuss 
any matters they may wish to raise. 
The Directors receive regular updates on the 
Company’s major shareholders, and receive 
reports on shareholder feedback at each 
Board meeting. The Non-executive Directors 
are invited to attend the Company’s 
results presentations.
Private shareholders may raise questions 
through the Company Secretary’s offi  ce 
either by telephone or by email (feedback@
capitalandcounties.com).
Odd-lot Offer
In November 2012, the Company launched 
an Odd-lot Off er to reduce the number of 
small, inactive shareholdings on the register. 
All shareholders were able to elect to retain 
their shares. The Company repurchased shares 
representing 0.06% of the issued share capital, 
and the Company’s shareholder base was 
reduced by 35%. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Chairman’s other business commitments 
are set out in his biography on page 49. 
During the year it was announced that 
the Chairman would be appointed as 
Non-executive Chairman of Greggs plc in 
May 2013. The Board remains satisﬁ ed that 
this additional commitment will not interfere 
with the performance of his duties as Chairman 
of Capco. 
The Deputy Chairman has been appointed as 
a Director of the supervisory Board of Capco’s 
joint venture in respect of the Seagrave Road 
development. He receives no remuneration for 
this appointment. The Board considered this 
appointment carefully before conﬁ rming its 
approval and is satisﬁ ed that there is no conﬂ ict 
of interest and that the appointment does not 
compromise his independence.
On appointment, and each subsequent year , 
Non-executive Directors are required to conﬁ rm 
in writing that they have suffi  cient time to 
devote to the Company’ s aff airs. In addition 
they are required to seek prior approval from 
the Chairman before taking on any additional 
external commitments which may aff ect their 
time available to devote to the Company .
The Board remains satisﬁ ed that all Non-
executive Directors are contributing eff ectively 
to the operation of the Board.
The Company’s Articles of Association 
permit the Board to authorise potential 
conﬂ icts of a Director’s interests that may 
arise. The Board has adopted a procedure 
under which Directors must notify the 
Chairman of any potential conﬂ icts. The 
Chairman then decides whether a conﬂ ict 
exists and recommends its authorisation 
by the Board where appropriate. A Director 
who had a conﬂ ict of interest would not be 
counted in the quorum or entitled to vote 
when the Board considered the matter in 
which the Director had an interest. 
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination and 
Corporate Responsibility Committees. 
The terms of reference of each Committee 
are available on the Company’s website 
www .capitalandcounties.com. The activity of 
each Committee is described on pages 55 to 75.

OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS
The Audit Committee, reporting to the Board, 
has responsibility for overseeing the ﬁ nancial 
reporting process, monitoring the eff ectiveness 
of internal control, internal audit, risk 
management, the statutory audit and 
monitoring the independence of the statutory 
auditors and the provision of non-audit 
services. As at 31 December 2012 and the date 
of this report the Committee comprises three 
independent Non-executive Directors, and is 
chaired by Henry Staunton who is considered 
to have signiﬁ cant, recent and relevant 
ﬁ nancial experience. 
The Committee invites the Company’s 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director 
and Financial Controller to attend its meetings 
together with senior representatives of the 
external and internal auditors. Members of 
senior management, including the Head 
of Tax, attend by invitation to present such 
reports as are required for the Committee to 
discharge its responsibilities.
The Audit Committee met four times during 
2012. Attendance at these meetings is shown 
in the table on page 54. 
The Committee follows an annual programme 
that ensures it gives thorough consideration 
to matters of particular importance to the 
Company , and considers additional matters 
when appropriate.
The Committee met privately during the year 
with both the external and internal auditors. 
(a) External auditors
The Committee has oversight of the 
relationship with the external auditors, and 
is responsible for developing, implementing 
and monitoring the Company’s policy on 
external audit, and for monitoring the 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and 
compliance with ethical, professional and 
regulatory requirements. Capco tendered 
its external audit contract in 2010, and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) were 
appointed as Group auditors on an annual 
rolling contract. The Committee monitored 
PwC’s eff ectiveness and performance during 
2012, and considered a paper prepared by the 
Financial Controller which conﬁ rmed that in 
management’s view PwC were providing the 
audit service agreed during the tender process. 
The Committee is satisﬁ ed with the service 
received from PwC and has therefore 
recommended to the Board that PwC 
be reappointed in 2013.
(b) Internal auditors
Capco has appointed BDO LLP as its internal 
auditor. During 2012 BDO followed the second 
year of a ﬁ ve-year audit plan focused on areas 
highlighted in the Group risk register. The 
work conducted by BDO during 2012 included 
reviews of payroll, IT security , Covent Garden 
turnover leases, risk management, disaster 
recovery and business continuity planning, 
The Bribery Act 2010, budgetary control and 
ﬁ nancial management information, lease 
income from property management and 
treasury and cash ﬂ ow . It is intended that 
the 2013 internal audit programme will 
have a more strategic focus.
(c) Non-audit services
The Company has adopted a policy to ensure 
that the provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditors does not compromise 
its independence or objectivity . The term 
“non-audit services” does not include reference 
to any advice on tax. Under the policy , Executive 
Directors may commission non-audit work 
with a cost not exceeding the lower of £50,000 
or 15 per cent of the estimated annual level of 
the auditors’ fees at that time. Costs exceeding 
Audit Committee
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2012 
Audit Committee Report. 
As the delivery of Capco’s strategy 
progressed during 2012, the Committee 
gave particular focus to the property 
valuations, both meeting with the 
independent valuers and discussing 
the basis of valuation with the external 
auditors. I am happy to conﬁ rm that 
the Committee is satisﬁ ed with the 
valuation process and the valuations. 
In 2013 we will continue to ensure 
that Capco’s ﬁ nancial reporting, risk 
management and internal controls 
are appropriate for a company of 
Capco’s standing.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 56 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
this limit must be approved in advance by the 
Audit Committee Chairman. In addition, the 
Executive Directors must give consideration to 
the preservation of auditor independence; and 
the external auditors are required to conﬁ rm 
that they are acting independently and must 
not audit their own work; make management 
decisions for the Company; create a mutuality 
of interest; develop close personal relationships 
with the Company’s personnel; or ﬁ nd 
themselves in the role of advocate for the 
Company . The Committee is satisﬁ ed that 
the policy is eff ective.
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2012 
were £401,000, of which £64,000 related to 
non-audit work. These fees primarily relate 
to advice on corporate transactions and a 
staff  presentation on the Bribery Act 2010. 
The Committee is satisﬁ ed that the external 
auditors remain independent and objective.
(d) Internal control and 
risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management framework and 
system of internal control and the ongoing 
review of their eff ectiveness. A summary of 
the risk management framework is set out on 
page 12. The framework is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risk, and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Audit 
Committee monitors and reviews the Group’s 
internal controls and risk, and reports to the 
Board on its work and conclusions.
Ongoing processes for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the signiﬁ cant risks faced by 
the Group were in place throughout the year . 
These controls accord with the Turnbull 
guidance ‘Internal Control – Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code’ and remained 
in place up to the date of the approval of this 
Annual Report. The procedures are reviewed 
by the Board on an annual basis.
The key elements of the Group’s day-to-day 
procedures and internal control framework are:
 – Formal schedule of matters reserved 
for the Board
 – Formal delegated authority limits
 – Formal documentation of 
signiﬁ cant transactions
 – The Executive Directors are closely 
involved in the day-to-day operations 
of the business and hold regular meetings 
with senior management to review all 
aspects of the business
 – The Board received regular updates on 
strategy and project developments at the 
formal Board meetings and Board updates
 – A formal whistleblowing procedure is in 
place under which staff  may raise matters 
of concern (no calls were received during 
the year)
Speciﬁ c controls relating to ﬁ nancial reporting 
and consolidation processes include:
 – Management structure with clear lines 
of responsibility and accountability , staff ed 
by appropriate personnel
 – A comprehensive system of budgeting 
and review . The Board and Audit 
Committee receive regular reports from the 
Finance Director which include forecasts 
and performance against budget and 
ﬁ nancial covenants
 – The internal audit programme undertaken 
by BDO. The Committee is satisﬁ ed that 
the internal audit services provided by 
BDO were independent and eff ective
 – Group Finance participates in the control 
self-assessment and policy compliance 
elements of the risk management 
framework and sets formal requirements 
with business unit ﬁ nance functions which 
specify the reports and approvals required. 
Group Internal Audit regularly reviews 
the eff ectiveness of internal controls and 
reports its ﬁ ndings to the Audit Committee 
An annual risk management process is 
followed to identify risks and review the 
eff ectiveness of mitigating controls. Risk 
registers are completed by the Executive 
Directors and senior management across the 
Group and used to compile the Group risk 
register. The Group risk register is reviewed 
twice a year and upon any material change 
to the business, with a full review being 
undertaken annually , at which point it is also 
reviewed by the Audit Committee with new or 
emerging risks considered by the Committee 
as appropriate. The Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties are set out on pages 13 to 15.
(e) Taxation
During 2012 the Audit Committee received 
regular updates from the Head of Tax and 
considered the Group’s Tax Policy which is 
referred to on page 41. The Committee is 
satisﬁ ed that the Tax Policy is appropriate 
for the Group. 57 WWW.CAPITALANDCOUNTIES.COM

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2012 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. In advance 
of the implementation of the revised BIS 
disclosure regulations, we have restructured 
this year’s report to include a policy report 
and an implementation report. We have 
also included a number of the forthcoming 
new disclosures.
Signed on behalf of the Board
Ian Henderson
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
28 February 2013

“ A review of 
remuneration policy .”
2012 was a particularly busy year for the 
Remuneration Committee. As foreshadowed 
in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
we undertook a review of Capco’s executive 
remuneration policy and arrangements, and 
have recently discussed the Committee’s 
conclusions with our major shareholders. 
An explanation of the review and brieﬁ ng 
process, and the Committee’s proposals for 
executive remuneration in 2013 are contained 
within this report.
Capco has performed exceptionally well 
since its launch in 2010, generating a total 
shareholder return of 139.8 per cent, which 
exceeds the performance of the comparator 
group for Capco’s long-term incentive 
schemes by some 52.0 per cent. The 
remuneration arrangements put in place 
on Capco’s launch were intended to support 
the initial three-year business plan of the 
Company , and the Committee feels they 
have done this most eff ectively . As a result 
of Capco’s performance since launch, it is 
expected that the majority , and potentially 
all, of the initial three-year incentive awards 
will vest during 2013. 
The Committee feels it is important to ensure 
that the Company’s remuneration structure 
remains eff ective and appropriately aligned 
with Company strategy and shareholder 
interests to support the business. In conducting 
its review , the Committee was mindful of the 
remuneration arrangements of other Group 
employees, the current economic environment 
and the market. 
The Committee received positive support 
from the majority of shareholders consulted, 
but a small proportion of shareholders did 
not fully endorse the original proposals. The 
full range of views were carefully considered 
in ﬁ nalising the arrangements although it 
has proved impossible to satisfy all of the, 
at times conﬂ icting, responses. However, 
the Committee believes that in light of the 
discussions held with shareholders the 
ﬁ nal proposals set out in this report are 
appropriate for 2013. 
The outcomes of the review are listed on 
page 61. The two main recommendations 
were that Executive Directors’ salaries be 
increased (in the case of the Chief Executive 
and the Investment Director for the ﬁ rst time 
since 2010) and that the Executive Directors 
be off ered a further opportunity to co-invest 
in the Company’s shares subject to revised 
performance targets which will require 
performance to exceed the current stretch 
targets, and hence substantial returns to be 
generated for shareholders, for the awards to 
vest in full. We have also taken the opportunity 
to increase the shareholding requirement for 
Executive Directors, and to introduce bonus- 
malus in respect of share awards made in 
2013 and beyond. This year we have expanded 
our retrospective disclosures on Directors’ 
performance targets, and we intend to further 
expand on this in 2013.
The salary increase awarded to the Chief 
Executive for 2013 equates to approximately 
3 per cent per annum since the last increase 
at listing. Whilst strong performance has 
been demonstrated each year, the Committee 
considered it to be more aligned with 
shareholders’ interests to wait three years 
before reviewing salary levels in order to 
provide a reasonable length of time for what 
was a new executive management team to 
properly establish itself operationally , and 
demonstrate its ability to deliver a sustained 
level of strong performance. The overall 
impact of the proposals (which operate within 
existing discretions) is to increase the fair value 
of the Chief Executive’s total remuneration by 
approximately 0.9 per cent per annum relative 
to the 2010 arrangements, the last time the 
overall package was reviewed. The Committee 
believes that the salary of the Chief Executive 
will remain below the level that reﬂ ects the 
recent outperformance by the Company as 
compared with our peer group, and therefore 
will focus on ensuring that this is appropriately 
reﬂ ected in due course.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
This Directors’ Remuneration Report 
has been prepared in line with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006, 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 and the FSA 
Listing Rules. The audited information is 
set out under 3.1 on page 67 and Tables b) 
to d) on pages 73 to 75 The structure of this 
report has been modiﬁ ed from previous 
years based on the proposed regulations 
put forward by the Department for 
Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS). This 
report has been approved by the Board of 
Directors for submission to shareholders 
for their approval at the AGM. 60

In addition to updating you on the revised 
executive remuneration proposals, the report 
also explains the other matters considered 
by the Committee during the year, and the 
implementation report sets out details of the 
amounts paid to Directors during 2012, and 
their outstanding share awards. 
It is important that Capco’s executive 
remuneration remains fair and appropriate 
for the Company . The Committee believes 
that the remuneration policy and 
remuneration package set out in this 
report for 2013 is appropriate.
1. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for determining and recommending to the 
Board the policy for the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors, setting targets for the 
Company’ s incentive schemes and determining 
the total individual remuneration package 
for each Executive Director. 
Membership of the Committee as at 31 
December 2012 and the date of this report is set 
out in the panel on page 59. In addition, the 
Company Chairman, Chief Executive and the 
Director of HR & CR are invited to attend 
Committee meetings and contribute, except 
on matters relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee met more frequently than 
usual during 2012 as a result of its review 
of Capco’s remuneration policy and executive 
remuneration. Attendance at the 12 meetings 
held during the year is shown in the table 
on page 54 and a summary of the matters 
considered by the Committee during the 
year is set out in the adjacent shaded box.
2. POLICY REPORT
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report sets out Capco’s remuneration 
policy . Details of actual remuneration 
paid, share awards made, and the associated 
performance conditions are set out within 
the implementation report which starts on 
page 66.
2.1 Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the Company’s 
remuneration policy are to:
 – Strongly align executive remuneration 
with shareholders’ interests
 – Underpin a pay-for-performance culture
 – Support the retention, motivation and 
recruitment of talented people who are 
commercially astute and creative
 – Encourage executives to acquire a 
meaningful holding of Capco shares
Accordingly , the Committee aims to achieve 
an appropriate balance between ﬁ xed 
and variable remuneration, and between 
remuneration based on short-term and 
longer-term performance. Fixed remuneration 
includes base salary , beneﬁ ts and pension. 
Variable remuneration includes an annual 
bonus, of which half is deferred in shares, 
which may be matched subject to long-term 
outperformance (via the Matching Share 
Plan (MSP)), and annual awards under the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP).
The remuneration policy is aligned to the 
strategy and nature of the Company , and 
reﬂ ects the importance of total return and 
the long-term nature of Capco’s business 
rewarding the Executive Directors for 
delivering strong performance against the 
Company’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
Details of each element of remuneration, their 
purpose and link to strategy and performance 
metrics are set out in the policy table in 
section 2.3.
The graph above shows the Total Shareholder Return at 31 December 2012 of £100 invested in Capital & Counties 
Properties PLC at the start of the ﬁ rst day of trading in its shares following its demerger from Liberty International 
PLC (10 May 2010), compared to the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index. The Committee considers this benchmark to be the 
most appropriate for illustrating the Company’s performance. £100 invested in Capital & Counties Properties PLC at 
the start of the ﬁ rst day of trading in its shares would have been worth £239.80 at 31 December 2012.
MATTERS CONSIDERED BY THE 
COMMITTEE DURING THE YEAR INCLUDE:
 – Review of remuneration policy and 
Executive Director remuneration
 – Shareholder discussion meetings 
held in connection with the 
remuneration review
 – Forthcoming changes to disclosure 
requirements and shareholder rights, 
including the Company’s response to

2.2 Review of remuneration policy
As explained in the introduction to this 
report, during the year the Committee 
conducted a review of Capco’s remuneration 
policy and practices to ensure that they 
continue to be appropriately aligned with 
Company strategy and shareholder interests. 
The Committee concluded that the 
remuneration policy remains broadly 
appropriate and that the initial three-year 
remuneration package, which included a 
2-for-1 co-investment opportunity , had been 
highly eff ective in motivating the Executive 
Directors to deliver exceptional returns 
to shareholders. The Committee further 
considered that the structure of the reward 
arrangements does not in any way encourage 
inappropriate risk taking. Details of the 
remuneration policy can be found in 
section 2.3.
As part of its review , the Committee 
developed a suite of proposals for Capco 
Executive Director remuneration which 
are fully described within this report and 
are summarised in the shaded box above. 
The Committee has taken the opportunity 
to respond to a number of comments received 
from shareholders in response to our 2011 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, including 
changing the balance of personal and 
ﬁ nancial objectives for the Executive 
Directors, requiring more stretching 
performance for full vesting of awards made 
under the PSP and MSP , and the phased 
introduction of retrospective disclosure 
of annual bonus performance targets. 
In addition the Committee has increased 
the shareholding requirement for Executive 
Directors and introduced bonus-malus on 
share-based incentive awards made from 
2013 onwards.
The Committee Chairman and Company 
Chairman discussed the proposals with the 
Company’s largest shareholders, and the 
Association of British Insurers (ABI) and 
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) 
during November and December 2012. The 
Committee Chairman subsequently also 
wrote to other shareholders to brief them 
on the proposals and seek their feedback. In 
total, the holders of more than 80 per cent of 
Capco’s shares were briefed on the proposals 
as part of the review and the initial proposals 
were amended to take into account comment 
from a minority of shareholders who did not 
fully endorse the proposals. 
The two main amendments were to limit 
executive salary increases in 2013 to 10 per 
cent and to include a two-year holding period 
on the additional 2013 PSP award.
The overall impact of the proposals (which 
operate within existing discretions) is to 
increase the fair value of the Chief Executive’s 
total remuneration by approximately 10 per 
cent relative to the arrangements for 2012 (in 
line with his salary increase, with the tougher 
long-term incentive performance conditions 
off setting the additional PSP opportunity). 
This ﬁ gure equates to approximately 3.2 per 
cent per annum since Capco’s listing. Relative 
to 2010, the last time an equivalent level of 
opportunity was off ered, the increase is 0.9 
per cent per annum which reﬂ ects the 3.2 
per cent per annum increase in salary off set 
by a reduction in expected value due to the 
tougher long-term incentive performance 
conditions. As a percentage of salary , the 
overall expected value of incentives is 
lower than in 2010 due to the additional 
performance required to achieve the same 
matching levels.
It is the view of the Committee that 
individuals with the necessary capabilities 
and experience to deliver Capco’s strategy 
successfully are few in number. The proposed 
level of salary for the Chief Executive is below 
median for the Company’s peer group and the 
Committee will look to address this over time. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION IN 2013
 – Increase Executive Director salary levels from April 2013 to move towards appropriate 
market positioning
 – Move from three-yearly to annual salary reviews for Executive Directors
 – Up-weight ﬁ nancial performance in the annual bonus from 50% to 75% of the bonus to 
reﬂ ect shareholder feedback (and correspondingly reduce the weighting on individual 
performance from 50% to 25%)
 – Exercise discretion to increase the 2013 PSP award from 150% to 200% of salary on an 
exceptional basis. The additional 50% will only be earned for performance above the 
current stretch targets and will be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period
 –Off er the Executive Directors the opportunity to co-invest up to 150% of 2013 salary over 
the next three years under the MSP when permitted by scheme headroom with an 
exceptional matching opportunity of 2-for-1. Any matching opportunity above 1-for-1 
will only be earned for performance above the current stretch targets
 – Increase the individual Executive Director shareholding requirement from 150% of salary 
to 200% (300% for the Chief Executive) to further strengthen Executive Directors’ 
alignment with shareholders’ interests
 – Introduce bonus-malus on share-based incentive awards made from 2013 onwards
The Executive Directors will have the 
opportunity to earn incentives, but mainly 
over the long term and only based on 
performance against notably stretched targets, 
as described in section 3.6 of this report.
The Committee believes that the proposals will 
provide Capco with a remuneration structure 
for 2013 which supports the creation of 
sustainable shareholder value and will continue 
to align the interests of Executive Directors 
with those of shareholders by rewarding the 
Executive Directors for performance which 
achieves Capco’ s objectives and generates 
exceptional returns for shareholders. The 
Committee believes that the changes to 
Executive Director remuneration for 2013 are 
appropriate given their performance to date and 
the need to support delivery of Capco’ s strategy . 
An engaged and creative management team will 
have the opportunity to generate signiﬁ cant 
further growth for shareholders, however 
Capco’ s exceptional performance to date raises 
the bar for continued outperformance from 
these levels. 62

2.4 Performance scenarios
The potential reward opportunities 
illustrated in ﬁ gure 2 on the following page 
are based on the policy which will apply in 
2013, applied to the base salary at the salary 
review date 1 April 2013. For the annual bonus, 
the amounts illustrated are those potentially 
receivable in respect of performance for 2013. 
It should be noted that the PSP and MSP 
awards granted in a year do not normally 
vest until the third anniversary of the date 
of grant. The co-investment award assumes 
co-investment by the individual of 50 per 
cent of salary in 2013. The projected values 
of long-term incentives shown here exclude 
the impact of share price movement and 
dividends. In illustrating potential reward 
opportunities the following assumptions 
have been made:

FIGURE 2:
2.5 Remuneration of senior executives 
below the Board 
The policy and practice with regard to the 
remuneration of senior executives below the 
Board is consistent with that for the Executive 
Directors. These executives have not, to date, 
participated in the MSP but do participate in 
the PSP with past awards being subject to the 
same performance conditions as those made 
to Executive Directors. The 2013 awards made 
to senior executives below the Board will be 
subject to the same performance conditions 
as previous years’ awards.
In exceptional circumstances, such as 
recruitment, long-term incentive awards 
may be granted without performance 
conditions to participants below the Board.
2.6 Employment contracts and policy 
on termination provisions
The service contracts of Executive Directors 
are approved by the Remuneration Committee 
and are one-year rolling contracts. The current 
contracts commenced on 17 May 2010. The 
service contract may be terminated by either 
party giving one year’s notice to the other. 
It is the Company’s policy that termination 
payments should not exceed the Director’s 
current salary and beneﬁ ts for the notice 
period. Any annual bonus payment in respect 
of the year of termination is subject to the 
discretion of the Committee. MSP and 
PSP vesting is also at the discretion of the 
Committee and accordingly any awards 
will normally lapse unless the individual 
is considered a ‘good leaver’ . In the case of 
a good leaver, payments are pro-rated for 
time and remain subject to outstanding 
performance conditions. In the event of a 
change of control of the Company , MSP and 
PSP awards will generally vest. Except in 
certain cases which were set out in full in the 
Company’s prospectus dated 12 March 2010, 
vesting will be pro-rated for time and remain 
subject to performance conditions. However 
the Committee has discretion to allow awards 
to vest in full in such circumstances if it 
deems this to be fair and reasonable. An 
individual would generally be considered 
a ‘good leaver’ if they left the Group’s 
employment by reason of injury , ill-health, 
disability approved by the Committee, 
redundancy or retirement with the agreement 
of the employing company . However an 
individual may be considered a ‘good leaver’ 
for any other reason at the absolute discretion 
of the Committee. 66

2.9 How the Committee takes account 
of employee views, general employee 
pay increases and shareholder views
When setting Executive Director pay the 
Committee considers the remuneration 
and overall conditions of all employees. 
The Committee does not consult with 
employees when deciding remuneration 
policy , however the Committee receives 
regular updates on salary increases, bonus 
and share awards made to Group employees 
and is aware of how the remuneration of 
Directors compares to that of other 
employees. These matters were taken into 
account when conducting the review of 
executive remuneration.
The Chief Executive is to receive a pay 
increase of 10 per cent in 2013. This is his ﬁ rst 
increase in salary since Capco listed in 2010 
and is equivalent to an increase of 3.2 per cent 
per annum since 2010. The average salary 
increase awarded to all Group employees 
below Board level in respect of 2013 is 
expected to be 4.3 per cent.
It is the Remuneration Committee’s policy to 
consult with major shareholders prior to any 
major changes to its executive remuneration 
policy . The shareholder engagement 
undertaken by the Committee Chairman 
and Company Chairman during November 
and December 2012, and its conclusions, 
are described in section 2.2 of this report. 
3. IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report explains how Capco’s remuneration 
policy has been implemented during the year. 
The implementation report contains details

3.2 Salary increases
On listing, the Executive Directors’ salaries 
were ﬁ xed for three years to allow the 
Committee to assess a then unproven 
management team. During 2012, Soumen 
Das’ salary was increased from £300,000 
to £350,000 following the Committee’s 
assessment of his performance in the role of 
Finance Director and his ongoing contribution 
to Capco. As explained above, no other 
Executive Director has received a salary 
increase since the Company’s listing in 2010. 
Over the three years since listing, the salary 
positioning of the Executive Directors has fallen 
below the levels that the Committee believes 
to be appropriate for the contribution and 
experience of the individuals concerned and 
it is intended that they will be increased with 
eff ect from 1 April 2013 to start to address this. 
When setting Executive Director pay 
the Committee also considers changes 
to the remuneration and conditions of 
other employees.

The ﬁ nancial performance element for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 was based on growth 
in absolute NAV per share, Total Property 
Return relative to the IPD Total Return All 
Property Index, and adjusted EPS. The 
Committee has decided that, subject to the 
rebalancing of weightings between ﬁ nancial 
and individual performance measures shown 
above, these measures remain appropriate 
for 2013 as they reﬂ ect the KPIs by which 
the Company measures its success. Further 
information on the Company’s KPIs can be 
found on page 11.
The revised weightings of each ﬁ nancial 
measure reﬂ ect the Committee’s view of 
their relative importance for 2013 given 
the current stage in the execution of Capco’s 
strategy . The key area of focus for 2013 
continues to be capital growth.
The annual ﬁ nancial performance targets are 
set by the Committee in the ﬁ rst quarter of 
each year following an analysis of external 
and internal expectations compiled by the 
Committee’s independent adviser, Kepler 
Associates. The Committee sets targets it 
believes to be appropriately stretching, 
but achievable.
In determining the annual targets for these 
measures in 2012, the Committee recognised 
the long-term nature of some aspects of the 
Company’s strategy , particularly with regard 
to its land interests at Earls Court, and the 
extent to which this would be reﬂ ected in 
these measures on a 12-month horizon. 
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2012, 
the Company performed strongly against 
each of its ﬁ nancial targets, for example both 
NAV per share and adjusted EPS were over 9 
per cent higher than the top end of the target 
range set by the Committee, whilst the Total 
Property Return at 21.7 per cent compares to 
2.4 per cent for the IPD index. Accordingly 
awards of 75 per cent of salary were made 
to each Executive Director in respect of the 
ﬁ nancial performance measures. 
The annual individual performance targets 
for the Executive Directors are approved by 
the Committee in the ﬁ rst quarter of each year 
following discussion between the Committee 
Chairman and the Chief Executive. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The individual targets for the Executive 
Directors encompassed all the key aspects of 
the business and included speciﬁ c investment 
objectives relating to Capco’s assets including 
targets relating to investments, disposals and 
developments, ﬁ nancial objectives relating 
to reporting, treasury , debt, corporate ﬁ nance 
and taxation, and objectives which focused 
on CR, HR and personal development. The 
weighting of each measure varies by role, 
and the speciﬁ c objectives are tailored to the 
key areas of focus for each individual. The 
Executive Directors were each considered to 
have delivered excellent performance in 2012, 
including the securing of planning consents 
for Seagrave Road and resolutions to grant 
planning consent for the Earls Court 
Masterplan, signiﬁ cant progress towards 
ﬁ nalising the CLSA and the achievement 
of the ﬁ nancial objectives. Accordingly, 
awards of 67 .5 per cent of salary were made 
to each Executive Director in respect of the 
individual performance measures.
The maximum bonus opportunity for 
Executive Directors is 150 per cent of annual 
salary with a bonus of 75 per cent of salary 
payable for achieving target levels of 
performance. 50 per cent of any bonus earned 
is payable in cash and 50 per cent is deferred 
in Capco shares for three years, under the 
MSP , subject to risk of forfeiture should the 
Executive Director leave the Company . Figure 
5 above summarises performance against 
both the ﬁ nancial and individual performance 
targets for 2012.
SUMMARY OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BONUSES 2012

Ian Hawksworth £320,625 £320,625 £641,250

Why is each performance measure appropriate for Capco?
Measure Reason
Growth in Net Asset Value per share Considered by the Committee to be the most important driver of value creation for Capco at the 
present time, in particular in connection with the Earls Court land interests 
Relative Total Property Return Rewards the additional value added to the portfolio by management over and above any changes in 
value from tracking the property market as a whole, as measured by IPD
Earnings per share Rewards growth in net rental income (of particular relevance to the Covent Garden portfolio and the 
exhibitions business), as well as the management of ﬁ nancing and other costs. However, given the 
current stage of the Company’s development, the Committee considers EPS to be less relevant as an 
indicator of value creation than capital growth 70 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
3.4 Matching Share Plan (MSP)
Executive Directors may earn one matching 
share or nil-cost option for each deferred 
share awarded under the annual bonus, based 
on performance over three years. Details of 
the performance conditions are provided 
in the long-term incentive performance 
conditions section below . The matching 
opportunity on deferred bonus shares may 
be increased to 200 per cent in exceptional 
circumstances, however this discretion has 
not been exercised by the Committee to date.
In 2010 (the inception year of Capco), Executive 
Directors were invited to co-invest up to 150 per 
cent of salary in the Company’s shares during 
the ﬁ rst 12 months of inception in return for 
the opportunity to receive up to two shares for 
each share purchased, subject to three-year 
performance. The Committee had discretion 
to extend the initial investment period to 24 
months, and exercised this discretion during 
2011 as the Company was subject to extended 
restricted periods during which Directors were 
unable to purchase Capco shares. 
The normal matching level permitted for 
co-investment under the MSP is a 1-for-1 
match although this may be increased to a 
2-for-1 match in exceptional circumstances. 
There is no grossing up for tax in determining 
the level of matching award on co-investments 
made. The higher matching level of the initial 
co-investment opportunity was intended to 
help ‘kick-start’ the plan by ensuring executives 
were highly motivated to maximise their 
commitment, and drive the long-term 
performance of Capco. Ian Hawksworth 
(£675,000) and Gary Yardley (£600,000) 
invested the maximum investment permitted 
under these arrangements in 2011, and 
Soumen Das made investments totalling 80 
per cent (£359,000) of the maximum during 
the co-investment period.
The Committee considers that the MSP 
has been highly successful and has played 
a crucial role in motivating and retaining 
management. Accordingly , and in light of 
the Company’s strong performance since 
2010, delivering total shareholder return 
of 139.8 per cent and outperforming the 
comparator group by 52.0 per cent (which 
signiﬁ cantly exceeds the maximum level 
of performance rewarded under the current 
performance conditions) the Committee 
intends to off er the Executive Directors an 
opportunity to invest up to 150 per cent of 
2013 salary over the next three years when 
permitted by scheme headroom with an 
exceptional matching opportunity of 2-for-1. 
The additional matching opportunity can 
only be earned for performance above the 
2010 co-investment stretch targets, as 
illustrated in ﬁ gure 6.
3.5 Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The operation of, and the maximum 
opportunities under, the PSP are explained 
on page 63.In 2011 and 2012, in line with 
common market practice, the Committee 
made awards to Executive Directors of 150 
per cent of salary in nil-cost options which 
utilise a lower proportion of the Company’s 
share capital than market value share 
options. Following the review of executive 
remuneration the Committee has decided 
that an exceptional award of 200 per cent of 
salary in nil cost options will be made in 2013 
in light of the Company’s strong performance 
since demerger, delivering total shareholder 
return of 139.8 per cent and outperforming 
the comparator group by 52.0 per cent (which 
signiﬁ cantly exceeds the maximum level of 
performance rewarded under the current 
performance conditions).
Details of the performance conditions that 
apply to awards made under the PSP are 
set out in the next section. The potential 
additional 50 per cent of salary to be awarded 
in 2013 can only be earned for performance 
above the current stretch targets, as illustrated 
in ﬁ gure 6 and will be subject to a two-year 
post-vesting holding period.
The Committee continues to explore ways 
of structuring future awards under the 
long-term incentive arrangements in a 
potentially more tax effi  cient manner for 
participants. The Committee will ensure 
that any changes are cost neutral to Capco. 
No changes are proposed at this time.
3.6 Long-term incentive 
performance conditions
The current performance conditions are the 
same for both the MSP and PSP and comprise 
two measures:
 – Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends) 
 – Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
The measures are weighted equally , i.e. 50 
per cent of an award is subject to performance 
against each of these measures.
The Committee believes that these two 
measures are the most appropriate measures 
of long-term success for Capco as long-term 
relative performance provides an appropriately 
objective and relevant measure of Capco’s 
success which is strongly aligned with 
shareholders’ interests. 
The Committee believes that NAV is the most 
important internal measure of success for 
Capco. Accordingly the Committee considered 
it appropriate to reward NAV performance 
under both the short and long-term incentive 
arrangements, with absolute NAV being used 
in respect of the annual bonus arrangements 
and relative NAV (as the main component of 
TR) being used in respect of the PSP and MSP . 
NAV is used as a performance measure by 
around 70 per cent of FTSE 350 property 
companies in their annual bonus arrangements. 
Relative TSR helps align the interests 
of Executive Directors with shareholders 
by incentivising share price growth, and, 
in the Committee’s view, provides an 
objective measurement of the Company’s 
long-term success.
Following its review of executive 
remuneration, the Committee concluded that 
the existing performance measures remained 
appropriate but that more stretching targets 
would be required for full vesting of PSP and 
co-investment awards to be made in 2013. The 
new performance conditions were set by the 
Committee following an analysis of internal 
and external expectations, and are believed to 
be appropriately stretching. The Committee 
believes relative TSR outperformance of +4 
per cent per annum to be broadly equivalent 
to an upper quartile level of performance. 
Additionally , as Capco’s shares currently 
trade at a premium to NAV , achieving the 
TSR outperformance target will be tougher 
than for others of the comparator group.
The performance conditions for the MSP 
and PSP awards made previously (which 
will continue to apply to MSP awards made 
in respect of deferred bonus) and the new 
performance conditions for MSP co-investment 
and PSP awards to be made in 2013 are 
illustrated in ﬁ gure 6 on page 71. Under the 
new performance conditions, for all levels 
of outperformance below the 2010 stretch 
targets, the matching opportunity will be half 
the co-investment opportunity off ered in 2010. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Performance is measured relative to a 
comparator group comprising the eight 
largest FTSE 350 property companies and 
Capco. Following its review of executive 
remuneration, the Committee concluded 
that the existing comparator group 
remained appropriate for the 2013 awards. 
The members of the comparator group 
are shown in ﬁ gure 6.
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee 
must also satisfy itself that the TR and TSR 
ﬁ gures are a genuine reﬂ ection of underlying 
ﬁ nancial performance. In assessing the extent 
to which the performance conditions have 
been met, the Committee will consult with 
its independent remuneration adviser. The 
calculation of the returns will be reviewed 
by the Company’s auditors as appropriate.
3.7 Chairman and Non-executive 
Director service contracts 
and remuneration
The Chairman has been appointed for an 
initial term, subject to annual re-election 
by shareholders, which will expire at the 2013 
AGM. The Chairman’s annual base fee was 
originally £200,000 plus an annual car 
allowance of £18,000, although this has been 
varied such that a proportion is paid into a 
SIPP arrangement. During his ﬁ rst three 
years the Chairman also received a supplement 
of 15 per cent of his base fee in lieu of any 
pension contributions. In addition, the 
Company made a matching award of deferred 
shares comprising 200 per cent of the number 
of invested shares in respect of each Capco 
share he purchased within the ﬁ rst 12 months 
of inception of Capco (up to 150 per cent of 
his base fee.) This represented a 1-for-1 match, 
grossed up on the basis of an income tax rate 
of 50 per cent. The award will vest on the 
third anniversary of inception of Capco on 10 
May 2013, subject to his continuing in offi  ce.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed 
the Chairman’s remuneration arrangements 
in light of his performance since Capco’s 
inception and with regard to market 
comparatives, and has agreed that the 
Chairman’s fee be increased to £225,000 
per annum, subject to annual review , with 
eff ect from his re-election at the 2013 AGM. 
All other transitional beneﬁ ts will cease at 
this date with the exception of private health 
cover which will be maintained. As a result 
of the cessation of transitional beneﬁ ts the 
Chairman’s ongoing remuneration will fall 
by 9 per cent (£23,000).
The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors is considered by the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive, with regard to market 
comparatives, and recommended to the Board 
as a whole. The Non-executive Director fees 
are reviewed annually and have not changed 
since the demerger. The basic annual fee 
for Non-executives has been £40,000 with 
an additional £5,000 for membership of 
a committee and £10,000 for chairing a 
committee and for the Senior Independent 
Director role. The fees were reviewed during 
2012, and it was agreed that they would be 
increased as set out below with eff ect from 
1 May 2013.
Fee 2010-20122013
Basic fee £40,000 £44,000
Committee member £5,000 £5,500
Committee Chairman £10,000 £11,000
Senior Independent 
Director
£10,000 £11,000
The Non-executive Directors do not receive 
any pension, bonus or long-term incentive 
beneﬁ ts from the Company . With the 
exception of Demetra Pinsent, whose letter 
of appointment contains a one-month notice 
period, the letters of appointment of the 
Non-executive Directors have no notice 
periods. The letters of appointment are 
reviewed by the Board annually .
3.8 Statement of shareholder voting
At the Company’s 2012 Annual General 
Meeting, a total of 454,863,806 votes were 
cast on the advisory vote approving the 2011 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. Of these 
votes, 399,712,356 (87 .88 per cent) votes were 
cast in favour of the resolution. The following 
table shows the results of the advisory vote

3.10 Directors’ shareholdings
The beneﬁ cial interests in the shares of the 
Company for each Director who served during 
the period are set out in note 42 on page 122.
At present the Executive Directors are 
required to achieve a shareholding in the 
Company equivalent to 150 per cent of base 
salary within three years of the demerger, 
other than Soumen Das who is required to 
achieve a holding equivalent to 100 per cent. 
Each Executive Director has met the existing 
shareholding requirement. The Committee 
has decided that, with eff ect from 2013, the 
shareholding requirement will be increased 
to 300 per cent of salary in the case of the 
Chief Executive and 200 per cent in the case of 
the other Executive Directors, to be achieved 
by retaining at least 50 per cent of any vested

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
(a)  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
(b)  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (EU) have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed  
and explained in the financial statements; and  
(d)  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions  
and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that  
the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence  
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
(a)  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
(b)  the Directors’ report contained in the Governance section of the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties  
that it faces. 
Signed on behalf of the Board on 28 February 2013.

the Group and Company Balance Sheets, the consolidated Income 
Statement, the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Group and Company Statements of Cash Flow, the Group and 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS  
AND AUDITORS  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 78, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown  
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing. 
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
 the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness  
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
& Accounts 2012 to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report. 
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
In our opinion:  
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of  
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2012 and of the Group’s profit and Group’s and Parent Company’s 
cash flows for the year then ended; 
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;  
– the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE 
COMPANIES ACT 2006  
In our opinion:  
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; 
– the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
– the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement 
set out on pages 50 to 58 with respect to internal control and  
risk management systems and about share capital structures  
is consistent with the financial statements. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT  
BY EXCEPTION  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:  
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been  
received from branches not visited by us; or  
– the Parent Company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or  
– we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or 
– a corporate governance statement has not been prepared  
by the Parent Company.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
– the Directors’ statement, set out on page 77, in relation to  
going concern; 
– the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to  
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
General information 
The Capital & Counties Properties PLC Group’s assets principally 
comprise investment properties at Covent Garden; Earls Court & 
Olympia; a 50 per cent interest in Empress State, a building adjacent 
to the Group’s interests at Earls Court; a 50 per cent interest in the 
Seagrave Road development; and a 50 per cent interest in The Great 
Capital Partnership, a joint venture focused on London’s West End. 
Capital & Counties Properties PLC was incorporated and registered 
in England and Wales on 3 February 2010 under the Companies Act 
as a public company limited by shares with registration number 
7145051. The registered office of the Company is 15 Grosvenor Street, 
London, W1K 4QZ, United Kingdom. The principal activity of the 
Company is to act as the ultimate parent company of Capital & 
Counties Properties PLC Group, whose principal activity is the 
development and management of property. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union, International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and 
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The Directors have taken advantage of the 
exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to 
present a separate income statement or statement of comprehensive 
income for the Parent Company. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under  
the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation of 
properties, available for sale investments and financial instruments 
held for trading.  
Standards and guidelines relevant to the Group that were in issue 
and endorsed at the date of approval of the consolidated financial 
statements but not yet effective and have not been adopted early: 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’  
(amendment re: offset of financial assets and liabilities) 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in other Entities’ 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (revised) 
IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (amendment) 
IAS 28 ‘Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures’ (amendment) 
IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (amendment) 
The assessment of amendments issued but not effective are not 
anticipated to have a material impact on the financial statements 
with the exception of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’. The standard, 
which has recently been endorsed by the EU, removes the 
proportional consolidation option currently available under IAS 31 
‘Interests in Joint Ventures’. This will impact the Group’s existing 
accounting policy in respect of joint ventures. Rather than 
proportionally consolidating the Group’s share of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses on a line-by-line basis, the Group’s net interest 
in the joint venture will be disclosed as a single line item in both the 
consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement. 
This change will reduce total assets and total liabilities as currently 
presented, with no change in net assets. The Group does not intend 
to early adopt this standard. 
During 2012, the following accounting standards and guidance were 
adopted by the Group:  
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’  
(amendment re: transfers of financial assets) 
IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ (amendment) 
Collectively these pronouncements either had no impact on  
the consolidated financial statements or resulted in changes to 
presentation and disclosure only, with the exception of IAS 12 
‘Income Taxes’ (amendment) which requires retrospective 
application and restatement of prior period comparatives,  
the details of which are set out below. 
Restatement of prior year comparatives 
The Group has chosen to early adopt the amendment to IAS 12 
‘Income Taxes’ as it is more representative of the Group’s recovery 
basis. This amendment introduces a presumption that investment 
property assets accounted for at fair value under IAS40 ‘Investment 
Property’ will normally be recovered through their eventual sale 
rather than their use. 
The impact of this change on the key financial statement line items 
for the year ending 31 December 2011 was as follows: 
 £m
Balance Sheet  
Deferred tax provision Reduced by 4.8
Consolidated Income Statement 
Deferred tax charge Reduced by 4.8
 
  Pence per share
Earnings per share  
Basic Increased to 23.9
Diluted Increased to 24.0
The amendment had no impact on the opening balance sheet at 1 January 
2011, consequently no additional balance sheet has been disclosed. 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, which have 
been applied consistently across the Group are set out below. 
Going concern basis 
As stated in the Directors’ Report, the Directors are satisfied that  
the Group has the resources to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future, for this reason the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared on a going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation 
These accounts include the consolidation of the following limited 
partnerships: Capital & Counties CGP, Capital & Counties CGP 9, Capco 
CGP 2010 LP, Capco CGP 2012 LP and EC Properties LP. The members  
of these qualifying partnerships have taken advantage of disclosure 
exemptions available in Statutory Instrument 2008/569 and therefore 
will not produce consolidated accounts at the partnership level. The 
consolidated financial statements are prepared in British pounds sterling 
which is also determined to be the functional currency of the Parent. 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on 
which the Group is deemed to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity, whether through a majority of the voting rights 
or otherwise. They cease to be consolidated from the date this control 
is lost.  
All intragroup balances resulting from intragroup transactions are 
eliminated in full.   OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Joint ventures 
The Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities is accounted for 
using proportional consolidation. The Group’s share of the assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses is combined with the equivalent 
items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis. 
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are reviewed at  
least annually for impairment. Where there exists an indication of 
impairment an assessment of the recoverable amount is performed. 
The recoverable amount is based on the higher of the investment’s 
continued value in use or its fair value less cost to sell; fair value is 
derived from the entity’s net asset value at the balance sheet date. 
Estimation and uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity 
with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses. Although these estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.  
The most significant area of estimation and uncertainty in the 
consolidated set of financial statements is in respect of the valuation 
of the property portfolio and investments, where external valuations 
are obtained. The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is 
inherently subjective due to the assumptions as outlined within  
the investment and development property note. As a result, the 
valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject  
to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions 
which may not prove to be accurate and could therefore have a 
material effect on the Group’s financial condition. 
Other areas of estimation and uncertainty are included within  
the accounting policies below, the more significant being: 
Revenue recognition 
Share-based payments 
Provisions 
Pensions 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Income tax 
Trade and other receivables 
Derivative financial instruments 
Operating segments 
Management has determined the operating segments with reference 
to reports on divisional financial performance and position which are 
regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to be the 
chief operating decision maker. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the income statement except for differences arising  
on the retranslation of available for sale investments which are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.  
Revenue recognition 
Property rental income and exhibition income consists of gross income 
calculated on an accruals basis, together with services where the Group 
acts as principal in the ordinary course of business, excluding sales of 
investment properties. Rental income receivable is spread evenly over  
the period from lease commencement to lease expiry.  
Lease incentive payments, including surrender premiums paid 
which can be directly linked to enhanced rental income, are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Upon receipt  
of a surrender premium for the early termination of a lease, the profit 
and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the lease concerned are 
immediately reflected in income. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed at the 
inception of a lease, for example increases arising on rent reviews, are 
recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.  
Rent reviews are recognised as income, based on management’s 
estimates, when it is reasonable to assume they will be received. 
Estimates are derived from knowledge of market rents for 
comparable properties determined on an individual property  
basis and updated for progress of negotiations. 
Where revenue is obtained by the sale of properties, it is recognised 
when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the 
buyer. This will normally take place on exchange of contracts unless 
there are conditions attached. For conditional exchanges, sales are 
recognised when these conditions are satisfied. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate. 
Dividend income is recognised when the relevant Group company’s 
right to receive payment has been established. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view are 
required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence 
to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. 
These are excluded from the calculation of underlying earnings. 
Income taxes 
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the year 
and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is calculated using 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.  
In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax is provided using the balance 
sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the tax bases of those assets and liabilities. However temporary 
differences are not recognised to the extent that they arise from the 
initial recognition of assets and liabilities (other than on a business 
combination) that at the time of the transaction affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit and loss. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted  
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected  
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred 
tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believes it is probable that future taxable profit will  
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and 
when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income 
taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the same taxable 
group or different taxable entities where there is an intention to 
settle balances on a net basis.  
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income, or directly in 
equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.  88 
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
An investment property accounted for at fair value will normally  
be recovered through sale rather than use.  
Share-based payments 
The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration 
to employees and Directors is recognised through the income statement 
with reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date of grant.  
The income statement is charged over the vesting period of the options.  
An option pricing model is used applying assumptions around 
expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility.  
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans and other 
share-based payment arrangements are treated as treasury shares and 
deducted from equity.  
Impairment of financial assets 
An annual review is conducted for financial assets to determine 
whether there is any evidence of a loss event as described by IAS 39. 
Where there is objective evidence of impairment the amount of any 
loss is calculated by estimating future cash flows or by using fair 
value where this is available through observable market prices. 
Investment and development property 
Investment and development properties are owned or leased by the 
Group and held for long-term rental income and capital appreciation 
and exclude properties occupied by the Group. 
The Group has chosen to use the fair value model. Properties are 
initially recognised when the significant risks and rewards attached 
to the property are transferred to the Group. They are recorded at 
cost and subsequently revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value 
as determined by professionally qualified external valuers on the 
basis of market value after allowing for future transaction costs.  
The valuation is based upon assumptions as outlined within the 
investment and development property note. These assumptions 
conform with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyor’s (“RICS”) 
Valuation Professional Standards.  
The fair value of properties is arrived at by adjusting the market 
value as above for directly attributable lease incentive assets and 
fixed head leases. 
Properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised 
finance lease liability. 
The cost of development properties includes capitalised interest and 
other directly attributable outgoings, except in the case of properties 
and land where no development is imminent, in which case no 
interest is included. Interest is capitalised (before tax relief) on the 
basis of the average rate of interest paid on the relevant debt 
outstanding, until the date of practical completion. 
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for 
continued future use as an investment property, the property 
remains an investment property measured at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
and development property are recognised in the income statement  
of the period in which they arise. Depreciation is not provided in 
respect of investment properties including plant and equipment 
integral to such investment properties. 
When the use of a property changes from that of trading property to 
investment property, such property is transferred at fair value, with 
any resulting gain being recognised as property trading profit.  
Investment properties cease recognition as investment property either 
when they have been disposed of or when they cease to be held for the 
purpose of generating rental income or for capital appreciation.  
Where the Group disposes of a property at fair value in an arm’s 
length transaction the carrying value immediately prior to the sale  
is adjusted to the transaction price, offset by any directly attributable 
costs, and the adjustment is recorded in the income statement.  
A property ceases to be recognised as investment property and  
is transferred at its fair value to Trading Property when, in the 
Directors’ judgement, an investment property commences 
development with the intention of sale. Criteria considered in  
this assessment include, the Board’s stated intention, contractual 
commitments, financial and technical feasibility. 
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. 
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other  
leases are normally classified as operating leases.  
Group as a lessee: 
In accordance with IAS 40, finance and operating leases of property 
are accounted for as investment property. Finance leases are 
recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum  
lease payments. The investment property asset is included in the 
balance sheet at the lower of fair value and the present value of 
minimum lease payments, gross of the recognised finance lease 
liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and 
finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 
Other finance leased assets are capitalised at the lower of the fair 
value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum lease 
payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the 
useful life of the asset.  
Rental expense under operating leases is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Trading property 
Trading property comprises those properties that in the Directors’ 
view are expected to be disposed of within one year of the balance 
sheet date or are to be developed with the intention to sell.  
Such properties are transferred from investment property at fair 
value which forms its deemed cost. Subsequently it is carried at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment consists of fixtures, fittings and other office 
equipment. Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset plus any attributable cost in 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over an asset’s estimated useful life to a maximum of five years. 
Investment in Group companies 
Investment in Group companies, which is eliminated on consolidation, 
is stated in the Company’s separate financial statements at cost less 
impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses are determined with 
reference to the investment’s fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair 
value is derived from the subsidiary’s net assets at the balance sheet date. 
On disposal, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and its 
carrying amount is included in profit or loss.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Investments 
Available for sale investments, being investments intended to be held 
for an indefinite period, are initially recognised and subsequently 
measured at fair value.  
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale 
investments are included in other comprehensive income, except to the 
extent that losses are determined to be attributable to impairment, in 
which case they are recognised in the income statement.  
Disposals are recorded upon distribution, at which time accumulated fair 
value adjustments are recycled from reserves to the income statement.  
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Directors 
exercise judgement as to the collectability of the Group’s trade  
and other receivables and determine when it is appropriate to 
impair these assets. Factors such as days past due, credit status of 
the counterparty, historical evidence of collection and probability 
of deriving future economic benefit are considered.  
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses non-trading derivative financial instruments to 
manage exposure to interest rate risk. These instruments have  
not been designated as qualifying for hedge accounting. They are 
initially recognised on the trade date at fair value and subsequently 
remeasured at fair value based on market price. Changes in fair value 
are recognised directly in the income statement. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations for goods or services acquired in the 
ordinary course of business. Trade payables are recognised at fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost until settled. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to shareholders are recognised as a liability 
once approved by shareholders. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current obligation 
arising from a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle that 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at their net proceeds on  
issue, as an approximation of fair value, and subsequently carried 
at amortised cost. Any transaction costs, premiums or discounts  
are capitalised and recognised over the contractual life using  
the effective interest method. In the event of early repayment  
all unamortised transaction costs are recognised immediately  
in the income statement. 
Pensions 
The costs of the defined contribution scheme and the Group’s 
personal pension plans are charged against profits in the year  
in which they fall due.  
Past service costs, current service costs and curtailment gains of  
the defined benefit scheme are recognised immediately in income. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity  
in other comprehensive income for the period in which they arise. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method and applying 
assumptions which are agreed between the Group and its actuaries. 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed where there are present or 
possible obligations arising from past events, but the economic 
impact is uncertain in timing, occurrence or amount. A description 
of the nature and, where possible, an estimate of the financial effect 
of contingent liabilities is disclosed. 
Capital commitments are disclosed when the Group has a contractual 
future obligation which has not been provided for at the balance 
sheet date. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
Where the Group’s own shares are re-purchased, the consideration 
paid is classified as treasury shares and deducted from equity. Where 
such shares are subsequently sold or re-issued, any consideration 
received is included in equity. 90 
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
Management has determined the operating segments based on reports reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to be the chief 
operating decision maker. The principal performance measures have been identified as net rental income and net asset value. 
For management and reporting purposes the Group is organised into five operating divisions being Covent Garden, Earls Court & Olympia, 
The Great Capital Partnership, China and Other. The Other segment primarily constitutes the business unit historically known as 
Opportunities and other head office companies. Due to actions taken by the fund manager who controls the divestment decisions pertaining 
to the Group’s interests in China, this segment has been presented separately as the segment’s results in 2011 exceeded the quantitative 
threshold requiring separate disclosure. The Earls Court & Olympia segment also includes the Group’s interest in The Empress State Limited 
Partnership which holds the Empress State building adjacent to the Group’s property at Earls Court. 
The Group’s operating segments derive their revenue primarily from rental income from lessees, with the exception of Earls Court & Olympia 
whose revenue primarily represents exhibition income. 
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to individual segments.

6 PROFIT ON SALE OF SUBSIDIARIES 
On 9 February 2012, the Group disposed of its shareholding in The Brewery by EC&O Limited for a consideration of £2.0 million, resulting  
in a profit of £1.1 million.  
On 29 February 2012, the Group disposed of its shareholding in Covent Garden Restaurants Limited for a consideration of £1.0 million, 
resulting in a profit of £0.6 million.  
7 LOSS OF CONTROL OF FORMER SUBSIDIARY 
On 30 August 2012, the Group completed a joint venture arrangement with the Kwok Family Interests. The venture, to develop land interests 
at Seagrave Road in West London, resulted in the loss of control of the former subsidiary Seagrave Road GP Limited, and the disposal of a 50 
per cent limited partnership interest in Seagrave Road LP. Consideration received of £7.5 million and associated costs resulted in a net loss  
of £1.0 million.  
On the date control was lost, the 50 per cent investment retained was re-measured and reflected at fair value.  
The disposal of the net assets of the partnership together with reorganisation of internal funding (previously fully provided by the Group  
and now reorganised to reflect the respective 50:50 partnership interests) resulted in a net cash inflow of £65.4 million. 
8 WRITE BACK OF IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER RECEIVABLES 
Following an impairment review of loan notes receivable by the Group, a write back of a previously recognised charge of £0.6 million was 
recognised in 2012. The write back was calculated with reference to the market value of certain property assets that the Group would have 
priority over in the event of default. There was no impairment adjustment in 2011.  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

12 TAXATION CONTINUED 
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year 
The tax assessed for the year is £5.5 million which is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom. 
The differences are explained below: 
 
2012
£m
Restated
2011
£m
Profit before tax 245.5 161.9
Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate in the UK of 24.5% (2011: 26.5%)  60.1 42.9
UK capital allowances not reversing on sale  (0.4) (0.6)
Revaluation surplus not recognised in deferred tax (43.5) (31.7)
Prior year corporation tax items (1.1) –
Expenses disallowed  0.5 0.5
Non-taxable items (9.3) (8.1)
(Reduction)/increase in deferred tax following change in corporate tax rate  (0.8) 0.4
Total tax expense reported in the income statement 5.5 3.4
Tax items that are taken directly to equity include deferred tax on an element of the share options and deferred tax on pensions. 
‘Revaluation surplus not recognised in deferred tax’ of £43.5 million arises from the Group’s decision to early adopt the new IAS 12 provisions which 
changed the basis on which deferred tax on investment properties is calculated in the accounts. The amendment introduces a presumption that 
investment property assets accounted for under IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ will normally be recovered through sale rather than use. Based on the 
Group’s holding structure for a number of its investment properties, the majority of the fair valuation movements in the year are not reflected in the 
deferred tax calculation and so appear as a permanent timing difference in the tax reconciliation. Early adoption of the new IAS 12 provisions has 
resulted in a restatement of the 2011 amount for this item and the removal of ‘Utilisation of losses (brought)/carried forward’. 
Further amendments to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2012 Budget which included changes to the main rates 
of UK corporation tax. The main rate of corporation tax decreased from 26 per cent to 24 per cent from 1 April 2012. The Budget will reduce 
the main rate of corporation tax from 24 per cent to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013 with a further 1 per cent reduction in rate from 1 April 2014 
resulting in a final corporation tax rate of 22 per cent. 
13 PROFIT FOR THE YEAR ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS OF CAPITAL & COUNTIES PROPERTIES PLC 
Profit of £5.0 million is dealt with in the accounts of the holding Company in respect of the year (2011: £2.8 million). No income statement  
or statement of comprehensive income is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 Companies Act 2006.

Included within investment and development properties is £2.6 million (2011: £1.7 million) of interest capitalised during the year on 
developments and redevelopments in progress. 
The fair value of the Group’s investment and development properties as at 31 December 2012 was determined by independent, appropriately 
qualified external valuers Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court & Olympia (excluding Empress State), and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder  
of the Group’s investment and development property. The valuation conforms with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) 
Valuation Professional Standards. Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts. 
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, 
construction costs, forecast growth rates, yields and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties while taking 
account of tenure and structural condition. 
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use. When considering the highest and best a valuer will consider, on a 
property by property basis, the highest valuation which will include its actual and potential uses given current market conditions. Where the 
highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this 
change in arriving at its valuation. 
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold investment property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these 
assets. Most significant of these occur when a credit facility is in place or when planning permission, lease extension or renegotiation of use 
are required (as is the case currently regarding Earls Court). These restrictions are factored in to the property’s valuation by the external 
valuer. Also see disclosures surrounding development risks on page 15.

Finance lease liabilities are in respect of leasehold investment property. Certain leases provide for payment of contingent rent, usually 
a proportion of net rental income, in addition to the rents above. 
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default. 
27 OPERATING LEASES 
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases. 
In the United Kingdom standard commercial leases vary considerably between markets and locations but typically are for a term of five  
to 15 years at market rent with provisions to review to market rent every five years.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Group’s operations: market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, 
and market price risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below. 
Market risk 
(a) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks. 
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. 
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas 
borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.  
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps. Swaps have the 
economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. Interest rate collars  protect the Group by capping the maximum 
interest rate paid at the collar’s ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor. Interest rate swaptions provide 
the Group with the right but not the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap on a specific future date at a set rate. 
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate derivative financial instruments,  
as discussed in the financial review on pages 36 to 41. 
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn borrowings profile of the Group: 
Fixed

Derivative impact (nominal value of derivative contracts) 344.2 (344.2) 515.1 (515.1)
Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 348.0 – 524.0 29.3
Interest rate protection 100.0%  94.6%
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent. 
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective is 3.6 per cent (2011: 4.5 per cent). 
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would have a positive impact on the movement in fair 
value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the income statement of £9.8 million (2011: £10.0 million). The approximate impact  
of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the movement in fair value of derivative 
financial instruments recognised in the income statement of £9.8 million (2011: £10.0 million). In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve  
is highly unlikely. However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts 
in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents management’s assessment of possible changes in interest rates. Because the fixed rate 
derivative financial instruments are matched by short-term floating rate debt, such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group 
cash flow overall. 
(b) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group’s largest exposure to foreign exchange movements is in respect of its investments in the Chinese investment fund which is 
denominated in US dollars. The Group’s policy is generally not to hedge foreign currency exposures that are less than 15 per cent of its net 
assets. Foreign currency exposures in excess of this amount, as far as practicable, will be hedged by borrowing in foreign currencies and 
through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. 
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have decreased the net gain taken directly  
to equity for the year ended 31 December 2012 by £0.4 million (2011: £1.8 million). The approximate impact of a 10 per cent weakening of 
sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 by £0.4 million 
(2011: £2.0 million). This represents management’s assessment of possible changes in exchange rates.  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
(c) Market price risk 
The financial results are subject to movements in the value of underlying investment properties, interest rates and economic sentiment. 
A one per cent increase in the valuation of investment and development property would increase the valuation of investment and 
development property in the income statement by £15.9 million. A one per cent decrease in the valuation of investment and development 
property would decrease the gain on revaluation of investment and development property in the income statement by £15.9 million.  
For further information on covenant positions on investment and development property refer to page 126. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.  
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Group’s operational requirements and investment commitments.  
The Group’s treasury policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities. 
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entities’ ability to meet the relevant facilities’ 
financial covenants. The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.  
A detailed analysis of the Group’s financial covenant position is set out on page 126. 
The Group’s policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk. 
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost. 
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through  
the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the 
contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk. This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time  
of the desired refinancing. 
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make 
payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied 
by the par yield curve.

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk arises primarily from 
trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Group’s undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans 
with financial counterparties.  
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously 
monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default. 
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial 
information. As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2012 is £3.1 million 
(2011: £2.0 million). 
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is the Group’s policy to calculate any impairment specifically 
on each contract. 
In relation to the Group’s exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are fully provided against. Additionally, specific provisions are 
made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns. 
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. 
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: 
 
Group 
2012 
£m 
Group
2011
£m
Up to 90 days 8.4 15.5
Over 90 days 0.4 –
Trade receivables 8.8 15.5
Also included within receivables are £4.0 million (2011: £3.4 million) of loan notes. All loan notes have been reviewed for potential impairment
and are considered to be receivable as at the year end. 
In 2012 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of £0.1 million (2011: an impairment of £0.3 million). This is considered to be 
an immaterial amount and within budgeted levels given current economic conditions. 
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury. Relationships are 
maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit 
ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and AAA).  
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Classification of financial assets and liabilities  
The tables below set out the Group’s accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities, and their fair values at  
31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011. 
The fair values of quoted borrowings are based on the bid price. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from 
observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield curves at 31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash

Capital structure 
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing 
the capital structure. The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets 
with maximum efficiency and flexibility.  
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio. The Group aims not  
to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 45 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent. These are discussed in 
the financial review on pages 36 to 41.

year was 134 per cent and occurred on 1 January 2012. 
Fair value estimation  
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The different levels are defined as follows: 
Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets. 
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly 
from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices. 
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data. Valuations at this level are more subjective and 
therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models. Such testing has not indicated that any material 
difference would arise due to a change in input variables.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
29 DEFERRED TAX PROVISION 
Under IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, provision is made for the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the revaluation of investment properties at  
the corporate tax rate expected to apply to the Group at the time of sale. For UK properties the relevant tax rate will be 23 per cent (2011: 25 per cent). 
The IASB released an amendment to IAS 12, 'Income taxes', on 20 December 2010, which provides an exception to the principles in the 
existing standard for measuring deferred tax assets or liabilities when investment property is measured at fair value. The amendment 
introduces a presumption that investment property assets accounted for under IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ will normally be recovered 
through sale rather than use. The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 with early adoption permitted. 
For the purposes of the financial year ended 31 December 2012 the Group has early adopted the new IAS 12 provision. Early adoption requires 
retrospective application of the amendments resulting in deferred tax being recalculated under the new provisions resulting in the 
restatement of the 2011 deferred tax balance on investment & development properties and Group losses. 
Under the new IAS 12 provisions the recognised deferred tax liability on investment properties is £1.8 million at 31 December 2012 (2011 restated: £3.3 
million). The calculation is on a disposal basis and includes indexation relief, the Group's holding structure and the application of the REIT provisions 
to disposals occurring 2 years or more post exit (7 May 2012). The Group's contingent tax liability is £nil (2011: £nil). This is after taking into account 
the availability of Group losses, indexation relief and the rebasing of properties formerly within the REIT regime to their May 2010 Market Value. 
A disposal of the Group's trading properties at their market value as per note 16 would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of  
£9.0 million (24 per cent of £37.5 million).

Deferred consideration is the amount payable on the 2009 acquisition of the non-controlling interests’ share in Earls Court & Olympia.  
The amount of deferred consideration payable is based on a number of factors including a potential redevelopment of the ECOA, with the 
final details of such a redevelopment dependent on discussions with the owners of the adjacent land and the outcome of the planning process. 
The maximum potential payment is £20.0 million.   OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

expenditure. The Group’s share of joint venture commitments included within this amount was £0.2 million (2011: £0.4 million). 
In March 2012 a subsidiary of the Group entered into an agreement with LBHF to acquire any private residential units on the West Kensington 
or Gibbs Green estates in the event that LBHF is required to purchase these properties if an owner brings forward a valid claim under certain 
provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 which relate to Statutory Blight suffered as a result of the adoption of the Strategic 
Planning Document, up to a maximum of £50 million including certain other related costs. It is intended that costs incurred would be offset 
against the consideration relating to the CLSA in respect of the LBHF land. The agreement was replaced by equivalent provisions within the 
CLSA which was signed on 23 January 2013. Refer to note 41 for further details.

1 The Directors of Capital & Counties Properties PLC have been determined to be the only individuals with authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the 
activities of the Company.  
During 2012 The Great Capital Partnership disposed of a portfolio of properties to Great Portland Estates plc, the Group’s joint venture 
partner, a related party. Consideration of £135.0 million (Capco share) was received in cash. The market value of these properties at date  
of disposal was £124.4 million (Capco share). 
In September 2012, the company completed a placing of 68.4 million new ordinary shares at a price of 218 pence per share. Blackrock 
Investment Management (UK) Limited, a related party controlling more than 10% of the voting rights in the company, subscribed for  
13.2 million shares at a price of 218 pence per share. 
38 DIRECTORS’ EMOLUMENTS 
The details of individual Directors’ remuneration and pension benefits as set out in the tables contained in the Directors’ remuneration  
report on pages 59 to 75 form part of these financial statements.  
39 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives. All schemes are equity settled,  
as such the cost recognised relates to the fair value of equity instruments determined at the grant date of the instruments. The expense  
is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest. 
Reconciliations of movements in incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 117 to 119.

39 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 
1. Performance Share Plan 
Market value options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Performance Share  
Plan (“PSP”). 
Exercise is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant.  
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: 
(a) the Company’s total return (TR) over three consecutive financial years (the TR Performance Period) relative to the median of the  
TRs over the equivalent period of the Company, Intu Properties plc (formally Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC), Land Securities 
Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury  
plc (the Comparator Group); and  
(b) the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) over a period of three years (the TSR Performance Period) relative to the median  
of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group. 
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.  
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR performance 
period. In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back. For full vesting 
of the awards made to date to be achieved, the target is median +2.5 per cent per annum. 
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested in 
ordinary shares. For full vesting of the awards made to date to be achieved, the target is median +4 per cent per annum. 
For performance at median, 33 per cent of an award will vest. For intermediate performance above median, vesting will be on a straight-line 
basis from 33 per cent to 100 per cent. 
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of underlying 
financial performance. 
Where events occur which cause the Committee to consider that the performance conditions have become inappropriate or impractical,  
the Committee may amend, relax or waive such conditions as it deems appropriate, provided that the conditions after the changes are not 
materially tougher or easier to achieve than was intended at the outset. 
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased to  
be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished. The Committee 
may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group (whether to replace a removed member or otherwise) if it believes that such addition 
will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group. 
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. In general, options are forfeited if the employee 
leaves the Group before the options vest. 
A schedule to the PSP was approved by HMRC as a CSOP scheme in 2011; therefore the company may now make a proportion of awards as 
approved options. 
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2012 were exercisable between nil pence and 176.33 pence and have a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2013 and 2022.  
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of share options for the year ended 31 December 2012 was £1.8 million  
(2011: £1.7 million).

Deferred share awards made under the performance share plan vest on the third anniversary of the date of award, subject to continued 
employment and satisfaction of performance conditions. 
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of deferred shares awarded under the PSP was £0.1 million (2011: £nil). 
Matching Share Plan 
Under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Matching Share Plan (“MSP”), deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus. Awards  
may also be made as nil cost options.  
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants 
remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award. Awards of nil cost options were made  
in both the current and comparative periods. The fair value of share awards will be determined by the market price of the shares at the grant 
date. The weighted average share price during the year was 208 pence (2011: 172 pence).

Under the Matching Share Plan, awards, which may be awarded as nil cost options, may also be made in respect of certain shares purchased by 
Directors or in respect of awards of the deferred shares or nil cost options described above made under the Company’s annual bonus scheme. 
The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred except in certain circumstances where the 
matching awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred. 
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions. Vesting  
of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally 
determined. The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. The performance 
conditions that apply to the awards of matching shares made in 2012 are the same as those that apply to the awards of options made under  
the Performance Share Plan. 
Matching shares and matching nil cost options generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased or 
deferred shares.

The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect to the MSP was £0.9 million (2011: £0.6 million). 
The Chairman does not participate in the Performance Share Plan or Matching Share Plan, however for any shares purchased within 12 
months of May 2010 and with a value of 150 per cent of his base fee, the Company made a 1:1 matching award of deferred shares on a gross  
of tax basis. The Chairman’s matching share award carries no performance conditions and will vest on 10 May 2013 subject to the Chairman 
remaining in office and having retained ownership of his invested shares. The Chairman invested more than 150 per cent of his base fee in the 
Company’s shares during 2010, and accordingly an award of 529,536 deferred shares was made to him on 1 September 2010. The total expense 
recognised in the income statement in respect of the Chairman’s award was £0.2 million (2011: £0.2 million).

40 PENSIONS 
(a) Current pension arrangements 
Earls Court & Olympia group (“EC&O”) has a hybrid pension scheme comprising an ongoing money purchase section and a final salary section 
which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011. The final salary section is a funded defined 
benefit scheme which is contracted out of State Second Pension. 
The Group’s current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements.

Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from time 
to time to reflect current trends. The standard table used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods is S1 PXA, CMI (125%), 
Year of Birth. The table makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of each member. 
 2012 2011
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:  
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 45) –  Male 89.0 88.8
 Female 91.2 91.0
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 65) – Male 87.2 86.9
 Female 89.3 89.0
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the Scheme, the Company considered the current level of expected 
returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes 
in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected annual return for each asset class 
was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. 
As a result, a discount rate of 4.1 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 4.7 per cent).

41 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD 
On 23 January 2013 the Group together with LBHF entered into a Conditional Land Sale Agreement (CLSA) which provides for the inclusion  
of LBHF’s land holdings at Earls Court in the redevelopment of the ECOA. The CLSA provides the Group with the option to acquire 
approximately 22 acres of land from LBHF for a total cash consideration of £105 million.  
Of the total consideration payable, £15 million was paid in 2011 as part of the exclusivity agreement entered in to at that time (see note 21),  
and a further £15 million was paid on signing to acquire 11 Farm Lane and Gibbs Green School. The balance will only become payable upon 
exercise of the option, which is exercisable until 2017. Further details of this transaction are available on the Company’s website and on pages 
29 and 30 of this document. 
On 28 January 2013, the Group acquired a long leasehold interest in 38 King Street, Covent Garden for £10.5 million.

DIVIDENDS
The Directors of Capital & Counties Properties PLC have proposed a 
final dividend per ordinary share (ISIN GB00B62G9D36) of 1.0 pence 
payable on 20 June 2013.  
Dates 
The following are the salient dates for payment of the proposed 
final dividend: 
Annual General Meeting 3 May 2013
Sterling/Rand exchange rate struck: 9 May 2013
Sterling/Rand exchange rate and dividend 
amount in Rand announced:  10 May 2013
Ordinary shares listed ex-dividend on the  
JSE, Johannesburg:  20 May 2013
Ordinary shares listed ex-dividend on the  
London Stock Exchange:  22 May 2013
Record date for final dividend in UK and  
South Africa: 24 May 2013
Dividend payment date for shareholders: 20 June 2013
South African shareholders should note that, in accordance with  
the requirements of Strate, the last day to trade cum-dividend will be 
17 May 2013 and that no dematerialisation of shares will be possible 
from 20 May 2013 to 24 May 2013 inclusive. No transfers between the 
UK and South Africa registers may take place from 10 May 2013 to  
24 May 2013 inclusive. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer an optional 
scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2012 final dividend.  
The above dates are proposed and subject to change. 
I Important Information for South African Shareholders: 
Holders of the Company’s shares in South Africa should note that 
National Treasury introduced a new Dividends Tax with effect from  
1 April 2012, at a rate of 15 per cent. 
The final cash dividend received by a South African shareholder  
will constitute a foreign dividend and will therefore be subject to 
Dividends Tax. Dividends Tax will be withheld from the amount  
of the final dividend at a rate of 15 per cent, unless a shareholder 
qualifies for an exemption or a reduced rate of Dividends Tax and the 
prescribed requirements for effecting the exemption or reduction,  
as set out in the Scrip Dividend Scheme booklet, are in place. 
It is the Company’s understanding that a receipt of shares pursuant 
to the scrip dividend alternative will not constitute a foreign 
dividend in terms of current legislation. Under the current 
legislation, the scrip dividend will not be subject to Dividends  
Tax, nor income tax on receipt. The new shares which are acquired 
under the scrip dividend alternative will be treated as having been 
acquired for nil consideration. 
This information is included only as a general guide to taxation  
for Shareholders resident in South Africa based on Capco’s 
understanding of the law and the practice currently in force.  
Any Shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position  
should seek independent professional advice. 
Further disclosures required in terms of the JSE Listings 
Requirements will be detailed in the finalisation announcement  
to be published on 10 May 2013.

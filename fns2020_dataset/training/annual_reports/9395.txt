Coverage
LiDCO now has distributors and sales 
forces covering the major markets of 
the US,UK and Japan and sells to 
19 countries worldwide. Future developments
In 2004, LiDCO signed a deal with Philips Medical Systems to
create a communications link between the LiDCOplus monitor
and Philips’ IntelliVue Patient Monitor.This will allow Philips’
customers access to LiDCO’s hemodynamic monitoring data 
on the Philips monitor.

Focus on rail and
roads
In rail we offer three distinct types of services:
track renewals; multi-disciplinary rail maintenance services;
and one-off projects (such as capacity improvements and
signalling schemes).
On the roads our operating companies are involved in
highways maintenance; manufacturing and installing
specialist products and surfaces.
LiDCO has developed a proprietary lithium sensor using
lithium indicator dilution to calculate cardiac output.
This is used to calibrate the LiDCOplus monitor. Safe and
extremely accurate, this method is simple to perform,
taking less than five minutes for the entire procedure.
The LiDCO sensor is activated by a small dose of lithium
chloride, injected via a central venous catheter.The
resulting arterial lithium concentration-time curve is
recorded by withdrawing blood past the lithium sensor.
“LiDCO is developing its
product to be useable in a
wider variety of applications,
including peri-operative
optimisation and congestive
heart failure.”
200
Over 200 hospitals worldwide use
the LiDCO system.
What is driving market growth:
• Increasing numbers of elderly people living longer
• Demand for less invasive products offering better care
• Need for better records and integration
Our global reach
LiDCO sells through a combination of direct sales
forces and specialist medical distributors, who are
trained in the use of the LiDCO System.

Chairman’s Review
page 4
Theresa Wallis Chairman
Sales in the UK were particularly
encouraging and, at the end of 
2003, 25% of UK acute care hospitals 
had purchased LiDCO’s products.
The year 2003 was one of consistent sales growth and growing
recognition of the benefits of minimally-invasive haemodynamic
monitoring.The foundations that had been built previously in terms 
of manufacturing capacity and efficiency enabled the Company 
to increase sales whilst maintaining pricing and gross margins.
Sales grew by 33% to £2.7 million and the loss after tax was reduced 
by 30% to £3.8 million.The installed base of monitors stood at 591 
(264 in the US) at the year end and 10,260 sensors were sold during
the year. As anticipated, overall expenditure by the Company during
the year was reduced substantially to £3.4 million (excluding a
placement of shares which raised £1 million) from £7.4 million in 2002.
This was made possible because of the earlier significant investment 
in the manufacturing equipment, and facilities coupled to product
margin improvements. Careful cost control was also important 
in minimising expenditure.
Sales in the UK were particularly encouraging and at the year end
approximately 25% of UK acute care hospitals had purchased LiDCO’s
products. Delays in implementation of the EU mutual recognition
approvals meant that sales into Europe were delayed into 2004.
However in Japan, PulseCO registration was achieved and a substantial
sale made. In the US, new sales models were introduced during the
second half of the year in order to address the slow US capital sales
cycle anticipated in last year’s report.
During the year, significant effort was devoted to finding and
evaluating potential US sales partners, concluding with the signing of
Heads of Agreement in May 2004 with four distributors across North
America.This will enable LiDCO to increase the number of salesmen
promoting the LiDCO System in the US from seven in 2003 to around
60. We look forward to working with our distributors and agents across
the world in order to maximize our market penetration.
Besides the actual growth in sales, the Company has made significant
progress in increasing its name recognition. In addition, awareness 
and understanding of the benefits of the Company’s products and 
the minimally-invasive technology on which they are based have risen.
These are significant achievements for a young company that only
launched its first products in 2001.
Demand from investors enabled us to issue £1.0 million of new shares
in 2003 to provide additional working capital for the Company.
Principally in order to enable us to fund our US expansion plans, a
further £3.7 million of shares are being issued in 2004. Looking ahead,
I am confident that sales will continue to grow, both directly through
our highly-skilled sales force and indirectly through our distributor
network.Tight controls on cash expenditure will be maintained.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the
management and staff of LiDCO for all their dedication, hard work and
enthusiasm and to our scientific advisory panel for their valuable input
and support.

Our breadth
Breadth of application 
The LiDCO System brings
minimally-invasive cardiac
output monitoring to a wider
variety of major operations.
Intensive care, recovery, surgery etc
Clinicians who use the LiDCO System have found it invaluable
not only in intensive care units, but on patients undergoing a
variety of surgery. Some of these are not able to have catheters
inserted and are reliant on LiDCO’s minimally-invasive approach
to monitoring.This brings the benefits of the LiDCO System to 
an ever-growing new market.
CASE STUDY PENROSE HOSPITAL, COLORADO, USA 
“I find the LiDCOplus continuous cardiac output monitor
invaluable in providing the highest quality and most up-to-date
anesthesia to my patients during major operative procedures.
I use it on all major spine cases and many of my partners now
use it on all their heart cases, especially off-pump bypass cases.”
Dr. Jon Taylor, Chief of Anesthesia

Chief Executive’s Review
page 6
Terry O’Brien Chief Executive
The requirement for less invasive, more portable and user friendly
monitoring continues to grow. Estimates are that, by the year 2030, more
than 70 million Americans will be over the age of 65 and more than 60%
of senior citizens will experience some form of cardiovascular disease
and require treatment in the emergency room, intensive care unit and
other locations throughout the hospital. It is estimated that 90% of
hospitals are already at or over capacity for treating such patients.This
lack of capacity and the resulting shortages create an obvious need 
for faster, simpler and more efficient monitoring equipment. Such
monitoring products need to promote earlier diagnosis and intervention
as well as the ability to monitor a patient’s condition during operations
and thereby help in improving patient care and outcomes.There is
increasing evidence that this kind of accelerated care translates into
quicker recovery, shorter hospitalization and reduced costs.
Increasingly, hospitals are purchasing minimally-invasive monitoring
technologies, driven by a desire to move patients quickly from high
cost areas to lower cost care units such as high dependency and 
step-down wards. Lower risk monitors which focus on key parameters,
such as oxygen delivery, and do not require the use of a ventilator, or 
a cardiac invasive catheter, are meeting the monitoring needs of the
ageing population in the 21st Century.
Given this clear market opportunity, I am pleased to report that
acceptance of our products is now occurring in all our sales territories.
This is evidenced by the fact that at the end of 2003, we estimate that
our technology had been adopted in more than 200 hospitals in
Europe, USA and the Far East.
US distribution agreements
In the US, our key goal was to continue to recruit new customers and
explore various sales models through our existing sales force. In last
year’s Annual Report, we stated our intention to expand distribution
through a sales partnership. After considerable discussion with a
number of interested parties, the decision was made to appoint a
group of independent sales agents in parallel with our own sales
specialists. Consequently, four distributors have signed Heads of
Agreement, with final contracts due shortly.These four agents provide
a wealth of experience and customer relationships and a combined
sales force of around 60 people and will provide significantly increased
US geographic coverage.The newer sales models introduced in the US
during the second half of 2003 will underpin the approach to be taken
by both our own direct US sales force and the expanded group of
agents. Although this approach will require working capital support,
the Directors anticipate that these new sales arrangements will be 
self-financing within 18 months.
Technical collaboration with Philips Medical Systems
The adoption of our products by key clinical centres has enhanced
LiDCO’s recognition.This has led to the signing of a contract with Philips
Medical Systems to create a communications link between LiDCO’s
proprietary, stand-alone monitoring system and Philips' patient monitors,
via the Philips Open Vuelink Interface protocol. Under the agreement,
Philips is providing LiDCO with appropriate software to enable a
communications link between Philips' Intellivue Patient Monitor and the
LiDCOplus Hemodynamic Monitor. Once completed, the communications
link will allow Philips customers to access LiDCO’s proprietary
hemodynamic monitoring data on the IntelliVue Patient Monitor.
The integration of critical care parameters and data derived from the
LiDCOplus monitor will allow a fuller picture of the patient’s condition
and history to be displayed and accessed throughout the hospital.
Financial Review
Turnover increased by 33% to £2,717,000.This growth was impacted by
the targeted shift in business model in the US away from capital sales
towards upcharge and rental models.This reduced turnover in 2003, but
is expected to generate greater ongoing revenue in future years.The
gross profit of £1,909,000 (2002 - £1,263,000) represents a gross margin 
of 70.2% (2002 - 61.9%). In direct sales territories, margins remain strong 
at 70% to 85% for the monitor and 79% to 90% for the disposables, with 
a payback on the apportioned capital costs (in upcharge or fee per use
accounts) of around five months or less.
In 2003, the Company continued its active and ongoing cost
management programme, the initial impact of which was a reduction
of 14% in administration expenses to £6,044,000 (2002 - £7,038,000).
The post-tax loss was £3,829,000 (2002 - £5,496,000) and the loss per
share of 5.27p was an improvement of 32% (2002 - 7.72p). At the year
end, net assets amounted to £5.6 million, including net current assets 
of £4.0 million.The year end net cash balance was £1.6 million 
(2002 - £4.0 million). LiDCO Group Plc Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2003
Our technology
Beat-to-beat monitoring
The LiDCOplus monitor provides
real-time, beat-to-beat
information on the patient’s
status. Each heartbeat is displayed
on the monitor screen as a
separate data point.
Real-time data: essential for patient care
Instead of averaging patient data over several minutes, the
LiDCOplus displays each new reading on its screen without delay.
Changes in the patient’s condition can be seen at once by the
clinician, who can adjust the patient’s treatment accordingly.
CASE STUDY HOSPITAL SANTIAGO APOSTOL, VITORIA, SPAIN
“Determining whether to provide cardiac drugs and at what dose
in critically ill patients with overwhelming infections is a difficult
problem. Initially, in a patient with circulatory failure, the first step
is to determine if they need fluids or drugs which alter the way
the cardiovascular system works.The LiDCOplus monitor
provides this vital information on a beat-to-beat basis and is the
only monitor which helps in the decision making process with
data interpretation screens. Continuous monitoring with the
LiDCOplus helps us to resuscitate the patients, adjust the doses
of drugs, and optimise the patient’s heart rate, oxygen delivery
and stabilise organ function.”
Dr. Javier Maynar, Spain
page 7 Our adaptability
Ease of use
The time taken to attach a
patient to a monitor can be
critical in determining patient
outcomes.
Saving clinicians’ time
The LiDCO System is designed so that nurses can attach the
sensor to the patient.This frees up time for the doctors on the
ward.The patient’s data is then presented on the monitor screen
in an easily-readable form, so that nurses can see at a glance the
condition of each patient.
CASE STUDY VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, USA
“The LiDCOplus monitor has been well received in the culture of
our unit.The nurses are comfortable with both the initial setup
and the interpretation of the data. I feel that this monitor has great
potential in this unique patient population. Given the technical
expertise required and risk of infection, there is little reason to
insert a pulmonary artery catheter instead of a LiDCO sensor.”
Dr. Jeff Guy, Assistant Professor of Surgery,Trauma Surgery,
Burns, & Critical Care
LiDCO Group Plc Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2003
page 8 The second half of 2004 is expected to see significant expansion in our
sales activities, particularly in the US, Japan and Continental Europe.
Revenue is increasingly moving towards being based on a recurring
annuity stream from sensor sales, monitor rental income and software
‘fee per use’ , rather than capital sales of the monitor. In order to support
the sales expansion in the US and in additional new territories, to
finance product development and to provide additional working
capital, the Company is issuing an additional £3.7 million of shares 
(net of costs).
Trading Review
The installed base of monitors rose by 97% to 591 (2002 - 300), while
sales of single use sensors also rose by 97% to 10,260 (2002 - 5,220).
Of the total sales in 2003 of £2,717,000, 67% related to monitors 
(2002 - 74%) and 33% related to sensors and licence fees (2002 - 26%).
LiDCO estimates that as of May 2004 between 2,000 and 2,500 patients
per month are being treated with its technology.The Board’s ambition
is to achieve the Company’s first profits on a monthly basis by the end
of 2005.
Usage of LiDCO sensors is continuing to double every year, and 
this rate of growth is consistent with progress to date on sensor 
sales in 2004.
US
During 2003, sales to US customers were made through our direct 
US-based sales force.Turnover was £742,000 (2002 - £1,008,000), with
capital sales of monitors representing 39% of units placed (2002 - 96%).
The number of monitors and sensors placed increased by 27% and 72%
respectively, with 20% of customers reordering equipment. Like-on-like
sales per sales person increased by 30%.The average number of
monitors purchased/placed (first order) was 3.5 with the average
number of sensors used per month being up from 3 (in previous years)
to 5 in LiDCO sensor calibration accounts.Turnover was adversely
impacted by the shift from capital sale towards upcharge and rental/fee
per use models. In addition, there was an adverse currency impact from
the weakening dollar of £92,000.
The US is the biggest single market and represents approximately 50%
of our potential worldwide sales. Having demonstrated the demand for
LiDCO’s products with a limited direct sales resource, the most pressing
need was to put in place a broad-based distribution network that
would be able to access this market of around 14,000 potential call
points within 3,500 hospitals.To this end, we conducted a review of
distribution and partnership options available (in conjunction with a
US bank - William Blair).The conclusion was that the most effective
approach would be to establish a network of regional agents.
Alongside existing capital sales and upcharge sales models, the
rental/consignment model was introduced during the last quarter 
of 2003 as a basis for accelerating the market penetration of our
monitoring systems given the lengthy US capital sales cycle. Under 
this new model, customers are charged a fee each time they use 
the LiDCOplus software, but pay no up-front fee for the monitor.
Furthermore, they can cost-effectively calibrate their installed LiDCOplus
system using third party products, as well as LiDCO sensors, thereby
further increasing the range of clinical situations in which our monitors
can be used.With this sales model we have had successes at a number
of US hospitals where we have been able to provide advanced, real-
time cardiovascular monitoring, while still saving the hospital money
against their existing revenue budget for invasive monitoring.
UK
Turnover increased by 135% to £707,000 (2002 - £302,000) with sensor
sales (at an average of 8 sensors per monitor per month) more than
doubling. Around 25% of UK critical care hospitals now use LiDCO’s
technology.
In 2003, the UK became the first territory where the use of these newer
products approximated that of the traditional, more invasive catheters.
Given the cost constraints affecting the UK’s National Health Service,
this demonstrates that hospitals are willing to make investments that
are regarded as relatively low-cost and high-value propositions.
Continental Europe
Sales progress in Continental Europe was slower than anticipated due to
unavoidable delays at the individual country level in the implementation
of our January 2003 EU mutual recognition approvals.The extent of
these delays meant that sales into first wave European territories were
delayed into 2004.Turnover for 2003 was £249,000 (2002 - £441,000).
LiDCO continues to sign up new
distributors in countries across the world.

Sales in the Far East and Japan totalled £815,000 (2002 - £152,000).
Approval of the PulseCO system for sale in Japan was received in August
2003 and the Company’s distributor, Nipro Corporation, purchased 100
monitors in preparation for the launch of the product. Following the
product launch in November 2003, Nipro initiated the training of its 
200-strong sales force in February 2004 and began sales activity.
Research and Development and Product Applications
Our development activities centre on additional product applications
that can be quickly added to our platform monitor through further
developments in the proprietary software signal processing and user
interfaces. In particular, we expect to add further functionality in terms
of the optimisation of risk surgery patients, which we believe to be 
a considerable unexploited market opportunity.
Improving outcomes and reducing costs in high-risk surgery patients
One of the most important aspects in the evolution of intensive care 
is the change in emphasis from the intensive care unit as a physical
location to which critically ill patients are taken, towards a hospital wide
cardiovascular physiology knowledge base. Adopting this strategy
means that hospitals can provide cardiovascular monitoring for the 
sub-acute and pre-critically ill patient in less costly alternative sites of
care. Perioperative optimization is the preventative manipulation of
patients’ physiological parameters during the period around surgery 
to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the brain and other critical
organs.These optimization protocols have a positive influence on 
patient outcomes.The increasing recognition of the advantages of
preventative cardiovascular management we believe has increased 
the market for our minimally-invasive and portable technology.
In conjunction with a number of leading hospitals, LiDCO is developing
the LiDCOplus user interface to allow the nurse-led optimization of
fluid administration to such patients.This will reduce the risks and 
costs associated with improving outcomes in surgery patients using
more invasive technologies.Tests are in progress to validate the use 
of our technology in this application. Results from these tests will 
be available shortly.
Looking ahead, we are also assessing the potential to use completely
non-invasive (skin applied) sensor technology with the LiDCOplus
monitor to identify and optimize high-risk surgery patients.
In November 2003, our PulseCO monitor
was launched in Japan.The Japanese
market is the second largest in the world,
after the USA.

Market opportunity
The US, UK and Japan account for
the majority of the £1.65 billion
worldwide market for cardiac
monitoring equipment. LiDCO
now sells its products into all 
these countries.
LiDCO’s wide spread
LiDCO has built up a network of distributors across the world 
and the LiDCO system is in use in 19 countries. Developing
markets have been early adopters of the LiDCOplus monitor.
CASE STUDY SOUTH AFRICA
“I was called out last night to anaesthetise for a major abdominal
operation on an 85- year old patient.The surgeon advised 
his family that he would be unlikely to survive the procedure 
or leave the operating room. However, we used the LiDCOplus
device to monitor the patient throughout the case and, as 
a result, the patient survived to be taken to intensive care 
and within 24 hours he was out of danger.”

Accountability and audit
Going concern
On the basis of current financial projections, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the forseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the accounts.
Internal control
The key procedures designed to provide an effective system of internal control are described below:
• Control environment
The Company’s control environment is the responsibility of the Directors and individual managers at all levels.The Board has
implemented an organizational structure with clearly-defined responsibilities and lines of accountability.
• Information systems and controls
Detailed budgets and forecasts are prepared annually and progress against expectations is reviewed monthly by the Board.
Underpinning these budgets is a system of internal financial control, based on authorization procedures and tiers of authority.
As a medical device Company, LiDCO also has a system of Regulatory controls, to ensure compliance with all requirements 
of the Medicines Control Agency, the US Food & Drug Agency and other medical bodies.
• Monitoring of effectiveness
The composition of the Board and the senior management team provides a suitable range of knowledge and experience to enable
adequate risk monitoring.The Company’s information systems provide detailed, regular variance reports which are reviewed and
acted upon by the Board.The external auditors report separately to the Board on the Company’s accounting and internal controls
as part of their normal audit work.
Statement of compliance
During the course of 2003, there was one area of non-compliance with the Code, in that the Company has two Non-Executive
Directors, rather than the recommended minimum of three.The Board considers that the current balance of membership is the
most suitable for a Company of LiDCO’s current size, but will monitor this position as the Company continues to grow. LiDCO Group Plc Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2003

Remuneration Report
Policy on remuneration
The Remuneration Committee recommends Directors’ remuneration and remuneration policies for all staff. Remuneration levels
are set in order to attract high calibre recruits and to retain and motivate those Directors and employees once they have joined the
Company.This is achieved by a combination of base salary, bonuses and share options, which are offered both to Executive
Directors and to employees at all levels.
The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board.
Remuneration committee
The members of the committee are Ms.Wallis and Mr.Wiegman.The committee is assisted by the Company Secretary.
Service contracts
All four of the Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company dated 29 June 2001.The contracts are not set for a
specific term, but include a rolling 12-month notice period. In addition, all Directors retire by rotation at the Company’s Annual
General Meeting and, where appropriate, offer themselves for re-election.
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment dated 20 December 2002 in the case of Ms Wallis and 2 July 2001 in the
case of Mr Wiegman.These letters are issued in place of service contracts. In keeping with best practice, these appointments are
terminable without notice by either party.
Remuneration package
All four Executive Directors receive a base salary and allowance in lieu of benefits, as shown in the table in note 3 to the accounts.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are also shown in note 3.
The four Executive Directors are members of the Company’s Senior Management Bonus Scheme. Under the terms of the scheme,
the Remuneration Committee assesses the Directors’ individual performances at the end of the financial year, judged against pre-
determined benchmarks. In 2003 the criteria for awarding bonuses were based on sales performance and the Company’s cash
position.The same framework will apply for 2004. Bonuses are capped at 100% of base salary. Non-Executive Directors are not
eligible for bonuses.
No pension contributions were payable by the Group (2002 - £nil).

Supplier payment policy
The Companies Act 1985, as amended, requires the Group to make a statement of its policy and practice on the payment 
of creditors.
It is and will continue to be the policy of the Group to negotiate with suppliers so as to obtain the best available terms taking
account of quality, delivery, price and period of settlement and, having agreed those terms, to abide by them.
The total amount of of the Group’s trade creditors falling due within the period ended 31 December 2003 represents 81 days’
worth (2002 – 90 days’ worth) as a proportion of the total amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Donations
The Group made no charitable contributions during the year (2002 – none). No political donations were made during the year
(2002 – none).
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilites
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year which give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group 
for that period. In preparing those Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act
1985.They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Going Concern
After making reasonable enquiries and performing analysis, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the
Financial Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the forseeable future.
On the basis of the anticipated levels of sales, costs and cash flow, together with the additional funds being raised by issuing 
new shares in 2004, the Directors have satisfied themselves that the level of cash in the business is sufficient for at least the next 
12 months.
For these reasons, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members
of LiDCO Group Plc
We have audited the Financial Statements of LiDCO Group Plc for the year ended 31 December 2003 which comprise the
Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheets, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, Reconciliation of Movement in
Consolidated Shareholders’ Funds and related Notes 1 to 23.These Financial Statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit report, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As described in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Company’s Directors are responsible for the preparation of the
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibility is to audit 
the Financial Statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.We also report if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the
Financial Statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with
the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We read the Directors’ Report for the above year and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and 
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company's and the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial Statements.
Going concern
In arriving at our audit opinion we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure in note 1 concerning the Company’s
requirement for further funding which it is seeking by way of a placing of shares, which is subject to shareholder approval. In view
of the significance of this uncertainty, we draw attention to this matter, but our opinion is not qualified in this respect.
Opinion
In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group
at 31 December 2003 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Accounts
Year ended 31 December 2003
1. Accounting Policies
The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.The
particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption under s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to disclose the profit and loss account 
of the Company.The loss of the Company for the year is shown in note 21.
Accounting convention
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Going concern
The Company requires further funding to enable it to expand its US distribution arrangements and exploit the development of its
products.The Company is seeking to raise up to £4.0 million in additional funds by way of a placing of shares.The fundraising is
subject to shareholder approval, which is of its nature uncertain at this time.These accounts are prepared on a going concern basis
on the assumption that such approval will be obtained.
Merger accounting
Admission to the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”) occurred on 5 July 2001.The
restructuring of the Group agreed by the shareholders in February 2001, under which the minority holdings in LiDCO Limited
would be bought out in exchange for shares in LiDCO Group, was conditional upon admission and is therefore deemed to have
occurred on 5 July 2001.
The Directors consider that the relative rights of the shareholders have in substance remained unchanged during the re-
organization. Merger accounting has therefore been adopted as the accounting treatment for the re-organization. Under this
method, results are reported as if the acquiring companies have been combined since incorporation. No purchased goodwill is
created in the transaction and the assets and liabilities of LiDCO Limited are not adjusted to reflect their market value.The
comparative figures have been restated.
Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable from product sales and income from licence agreements granted. Dependent upon the
terms of each licence agreement, income from licence agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis, commencing from the 
date of receipt of cash over the period of the licence, subject to a maximum of ten years.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Investments in shares in LiDCO Group Plc
held by the Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trust are valued at the lower of cost and year end market value.
Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates prevailing 
at that date.These translation differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences arising from the different treatment of items for accounting and taxation
purposes, which are expected to reverse in the future without replacement, calculated at the rates at which it is expected that tax will arise.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. LiDCO Group Plc Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2003
page 25
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets represent software development costs and clinical trials on the LiDCO and PulseCO systems.These have
been capitalized and are amortized in equal annual amounts over three years.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.The annual rates 
of depreciation are as follows:
Plant and machinery 20% per annum
T ools and equipment 33% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 20% per annum
Computer equipment 33% per annum
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Capital instruments
Capital instruments are accounted for and classified as equity or non-equity share capital, equity or non-equity minority interests
and debt according to their form.There is no premium payable on redemption of non-equity minority interests.

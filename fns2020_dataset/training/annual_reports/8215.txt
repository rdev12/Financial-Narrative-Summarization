Accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain 
tangible fixed assets, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in the United 
Kingdom. A summary of the main accounting policies which have been applied consistently (except as explained below) is 
set out as follows.
Chang es	in	ac c oun ting	policies
The Group has adopted FRS 20, ‘Share-based Payment’. The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting 
policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly. The effects of the change on net operating expenses and 
the tax credit for the year ended 31 March	2006 are summarised as follows:
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included 
in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the group revises 
its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The proceeds received net 
of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.

Year ended 31 March 2006
As previously stated  (55 ,298)	 451
Restated  (55 ,562)	 530	
The net effect of the change in policy in the year ended 31 March 2006 is to increase net operating expenses by £264,000, 
increase the tax credit on the loss on ordinary activities by £79 ,200 and increase the loss sustained for the financial year by 
£184,800.
The cumulative effect of implementing the policy is to increase Group reserves at	31 March 2006 by £17 4,000 (2005: 
£95 ,000). The changes are summarised as follows:

Basis	o f	c onsolida tion
The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the company and its 
subsidiary undertakings up to 31 March. The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated profit and loss 
account from the date on which control passes. Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, its assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values. 
All gains and losses that arise after the group has gained control of the subsidiary are included in the post acquisition profit 
and loss account. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in the company and on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid 
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and is amortised through the profit and loss account over its 
useful economic life. The Directors have assessed the estimated useful economic life of goodwill at 20 years from date of 
acquisition based on the strengths of the underlying businesses and projected future market growth. The Directors review 
the level of goodwill for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
T angible	fix ed	assets
The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost with the exception of freehold land & buildings (which are held at 
valuation), together with any incidental expenses of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values, on a 
straight line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this 
purpose are:
Freehold buildings   2% to 25%
Leasehold improvements   20%
Office fixtures and fittings   10% to 50%
Vehicles and computer equipment   20% to 50%
Freehold land is not depreciated
Surpluses arising on the revaluation of tangible fixed assets are credited to a revaluation reserve. On subsequent disposal of 
a revaluated asset, the revaluation surplus relating to this asset is transferred to the profit and loss account reserve.
The Directors review tangible fixed assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
In v estmen ts
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Accounting policies continued Accounting policies continued Accounting policies continued InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007
34
St ock s
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provisions are made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective 
items where appropriate.
R e v enue	r ec ognition
The Group only recognises revenue on the sale of equipment when the goods are received by the customer and when there 
are no unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the equipment. Service revenues are recognised 
over the period to which the service relates. Unrecognised service revenue and associated costs of sale are included as 
deferred income and deferred cost respectively in the balance sheet.
F or eign	curr encies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The assets and 
liabilities of such undertakings are translated at year end exchange rates. Any resulting exchange differences are taken to 
reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Exchange differences arising on borrowings 
in foreign currency financing overseas investments are taken to reserves to the extent they offset exchange differences in 
the investment.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
L ease	agr eemen ts
Finance lease arrangements, which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset, are 
treated as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included in fixed assets and the capital element of the 
finance leases is shown as obligations under finance leases. The finance lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and 
interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged 
to the profit and loss account in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding. Assets held under finance leases 
are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007
35
Def err ed	 tax a tion
Full provision is made for deferred taxation resulting from timing differences between profits computed for taxation 
purposes and profits stated in the financial statements to the extent that there is an obligation to pay more tax or right to 
pay less tax, in the future as a result of the reversal of those timing differences. Deferred tax is not provided where a timing 
difference arises from the revaluation of fixed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be recoverable in the 
foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
R esear ch	and	de v elopmen t
Research and development expenditure is written off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
P ension	c osts
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees and directors. The assets of the scheme are 
held separately from those of the Company. The annual contributions payable are charged to the profit and loss account on 
an accruals basis. The Company provides no other post-retirement benefits to its employees and directors.

The Group grants share options to employees and directors on a discretionary basis. The scheme is ‘unapproved’ and all 
employees have agreed in writing to accept liability for any National Insurance contributions that become due on exercise of 
options. In addition the Group operates a SAYE scheme that is offered on similar terms to all employees.
The fair value of options granted after 1 April 2003 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase 
in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense 
is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where variations are due only to share prices not 
achieving the threshold for vesting.
Debt 	issue	c osts
Debt issue costs are capitalised and offset against the loans to which they relate. The costs are amortised over the term of 
the loan.

On 29 December 2006 the Group sold the trade, net tangible assets and goodwill of its United Kingdom distribution 
business for a consideration of £41,000 ,000 in cash. £1,000 ,000 of the consideration remains unpaid at the year end and will 
be paid on agreement of the completion accounts. The sale resulted in a loss on disposal of £5 , 752,000 but because goodwill 
is not an allowable cost for taxation purposes there is a corporation tax charge on disposal of £6,999 ,000.
On 	 31 March 2006 the Group had substantially sold its European operations which resulted in a provisional loss on  
disposal of € 5 ,246,000 (£ 3,661,000) dependent on collection of debtors and the fair valuation of stock to be finalised on  
31 March 2007. An additional loss on sale of subsidiary undertakings of £ 373,000 has been recognised on the disposal of 
the European operations.
As a result of the material change in the nature and focus of the Group’s operations that this disposal represented, the 
UK Distribution operations have been shown as discontinued operations in the financial statements (2006: the European 
operations were classified as discontinued operations).
Cost of sales attributed to continuing operations were £11, 797 ,000 and discontinued operations were £136,835 ,000. Net 
operating expenses attributed to continuing operations were £22,04 7 ,000 and discontinued operations were £14,86 7 ,000. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007

As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented in these 
financial statements. The parent Company’s loss for the year ended 31 March 2007	was £16,177 ,000 ( 2006: £11,980 ,000).
8	 L oss	per	shar e
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of £15 ,935 ,000 ( 2006: £11,84 6,000) 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 141,885 , 401 (2006 : 	 141,111,944).
The adjusted basic earnings per share has been calculated to provide a better understanding of the underlying performance of 
the Group as follows:
  2007	 2006
  Basic and diluted Basic and diluted

Share of operating loss of associate 7 64	 0 .54	 -	 -
Adjusted basic earnings per share 862	 0 .61	 803	 0 .57
The loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of 
calculating the diluted earnings per ordinary share are identical to those used for basic earnings per ordinary share. This is 
because the exercise of share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore not dilutive 
under the terms of FRS 22 ‘Earnings per share’.

Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost. As permitted by section	 133 of the Companies Act 1985, where the relief 
afforded under section	 131	of the Companies Act 1985 applies, cost is the aggregate of the nominal value of the relevant 
number of the companies shares and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the share capital of the 
subsidiary undertakings. The directors consider that to give full particulars of all subsidiary undertakings would lead to a 
statement of excessive length. A list of principal subsidiary undertakings and associates is given on page 46.
The goodwill arising on the associates acquired is being amortised on a straight-line basis over 20 years. This is the period over 
which the directors estimate that values of the underlying businesses are expected to exceed the values of the underlying assets.

The main financial risks faced by the Group include interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, liquid resources and various items, such as debtors and creditors that arise 
directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial 
instruments shall be undertaken. The year end position reflects these policies and there have been no changes in policies or 
risks since the year end.
Financial asset returns are maximised by ongoing review of the Group’s cash flow requirements. Any funds surplus to short-
term working capital requirements are placed on interest bearing deposit.
Liquidity risk is further managed by agreeing separate borrowing facilities for any additional working capital and investment 
requirements. In accordance with this policy, the Group has negotiated a sterling invoice discounting facility of £1, 750 ,000 with 
Barclays Bank (2006: £ 24, 496,000 with IBM), of which £1,181,000 ( 2006: £19 ,385 ,000) was used as at	 31	March	 2007. This facility 
is provided on a rolling basis and is subject to 3 months notice by either party.
Short term trade debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures with the exception of the 
Currency exposure analysis.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets
The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the Group comprise cash of £12, 782,000 as follows:

Fair value
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed 
and willing parties, other than by a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. The fair values of financial assets 
and liabilities as at	 31 March 2007 approximate to the book value at those dates based on comparison with similar instruments 
available from alternative providers.

Currency exposure
The Group seeks to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas by borrowing as 
far as possible in the same currencies as the operating currencies of its main operating units. Gains and losses arising on net 
investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of 
total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than 
their local currency. Foreign exchange differences on translation of earnings are taken to the profit and loss account of the 
Group.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on revalued property. The tax on the gains arising would only become payable if 
the property were sold without rollover relief being available. The tax which would be payable under such circumstances is 
estimated to be £526,000 ( 2006: £ 526,000). These assets are expected to be used in the continuing operations of the business 
and, therefore, no tax is expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.

Deferred shares differ to ordinary shares in that they do not entitle the holder to receive any dividend or other distribution; do 
not entitle the holder to vote at any general meeting of the Company; do entitle the holder on a winding up to repayment of 
amounts paid only after payment in respect of each Ordinary Share of the capital paid up and a further payment of £10,000 on 
each Ordinary Share and are treated as non-equity shares. 
Potential issues of ordinary shares
Certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the Company at prices ranging from 1.8p to 337 .0p under the share 
option schemes.

Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The 
contractual life of an option is 10 years. Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment except for those employees who were transferred with the disposal 
of the Specialist Distribution division. These employees have been given until 29 December 2007 to exercise their options. 
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:
Grant date 01/08/2003	 01/04/2005	 21/06/2005	 03/07 /2006	 12/07 /2006

to exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the

Notes:
1 A member of the Company (a 
‘Shareholder’) entitled to attend 
and vote at the AGM may appoint 
one or more proxy (or proxies) to 
attend (and on a poll) vote in his 
stead. Any person (whether a 
Shareholder or not) may be 
appointed to act as a proxy. 
2 If a proxy is appointed for use at the 
AGM, the form of proxy as issued by 
the Board must be used. This form 
of proxy is enclosed herewith 
reply-paid. To be effective, a form of 
proxy, together with the power of 
attorney or other authority (if any) 
under which it is executed, or a 
notarially certified copy of such 
power or authority, must be 
deposited at the Company’s 
registrars at the following address 
by no later than 10 a.m. on 5 August 
2007 or any adjournment thereof: 
Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 
Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, 
BR3	 4TU. 
3 Completion and return of a form of 
proxy will not preclude a 
Shareholder from attending and 
voting at the AGM (or at any 
adjournment thereof) in person in 
respect of which the proxy is 
appointed if such Shareholder 
subsequently decides to do so.
4 The Company, pursuant to 
Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001 (2001	S.I. 
No. 3755), specifies that only those 
Shareholders registered on the 
register of members of the 
Company at 10 a.m. on 5 August 
2007 (or, if the AGM is adjourned, in 
the register of members of the 
Company 48 hours before the time 
of any adjourned AGM) shall be 
entitled to attend and vote at the 
AGM in respect of the number of 
shares in the Company registered in 
the name of such Shareholders at 
that time. Changes to entries on the 
register of members after that time 
shall be disregarded in determining 
the rights of any person to attend or 
vote at the AGM.
5 A copy of the service agreements 
between the Company and its 
Directors will be available to the 
public for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company 
during usual business hours on any 
weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and 
public holidays excluded) from the 
date of this Notice to the time and 
date of the AGM (including any 
adjornment thereof) and also on 
the date and at the place of the 
AGM from	 15 minutes before the 
AGM to its conclusion.
6 This Notice, the accompanying 
Form of proxy and the annual 
audited accounts will be available 
for inspection, free of charge, at the 
registered office of the Company 
during usual business hours on any 
weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and 
public holidays excluded) for a 
period of one month from the date 
of this Notice. 
7 Biographical details of the Directors 
who are proposed for reappointment 
at the AGM are set out on pages 12 
to 13 of the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements of the 
Company for the year ending  
31	March 2007.
8 If the Chairman, as a result of any 
proxy appointments, is given 
discretion as to how the votes the 
subject of those proxies are cast and 
the voting rights in respect of those 
discretionary proxies, when added 
to the interests in the Company’s 
securities already held by the 
Chairman, result in the Chairman 
holding such number of voting 
rights that he has a notifiable 
obligation under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, the Chairman 
will make the necessary 
notifications to the Company and 
the Financial Services Authority. As a 
result, any member holding 3% or 
more of the voting rights in the 
Company who grants the Chairman 
a discretionary proxy in respect of 
some or all of those voting rights 
and so would otherwise have a 
notification obligation under the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, 
need not make a separate 
notification to the Company and 
the Financial Services Authority.

joint Shareholders. For this purpose seniority is determined by the order in which the names 
stand in the register of members of the Company in respect of the joint holding.

discretion. Please note that if the ‘Vote Withheld’ box is marked with an ‘X’, the Shareholder 
will not be counted in the calculation of votes ‘For’ and ‘ Against’ and the Shareholder will not 
be taken to have given his/her/their discretion to the proxy on how to vote. 
7 Multiple proxies A Shareholder may appoint more than one proxy to attend. When two or 
more valid but differing instruments of proxy are delivered in respect of the same share for use 
at the same meeting and in respect of the same matter, the one which is last validly delivered 
(regardless of the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or 
others as regards that share.  If the Company is unable to determine which instrument was last 
validly delivered, none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of that share.

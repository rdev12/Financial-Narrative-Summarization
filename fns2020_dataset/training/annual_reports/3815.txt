Chairman’s statement
‘ Computacenter made steady progress 
during 2006. in each of the group’s 
three principal markets, management 
continued to make determined efforts 
to improve both strategic focus and 
operating performance.’
r on san DLer Ch AIRmAN
Computacenter made steady progress during 2006. In each of the 
Group’s three principal markets, management continued to make 
determined efforts to improve both strategic focus and operating 
performance. 
The steep fall in revenue in recent years was arrested in 2006. 
Despite continuing product price erosion, revenues of £2.27 billion 
were only marginally lower than the previous year (2005: £2.29 
billion), reflecting improvements in the competitiveness of our 
offerings and the increased focus on mid-market sales 
opportunities. Operating profit, before exceptional charges, 
increased by 14.5% to £33.6 million (2005: £29.3 million) and this 
figure includes approximately £6.2 million of losses arising in 
Germany associated with the start-up of two shared datacentre 
contracts. Taking into account non-operating exceptional charges  
of £5.0 million in France, operating profit increased by 3.2% to  
£28.5 million (2005: £27 .7 million). A reduction in net interest  
receipts following the return to shareholders of £74.4 million in July 
resulted in a 3.2% fall in profit before tax to £32.9 million (2005: 
£34.0 million). The share consolidation that accompanied the return 
of capital had a beneficial impact on the Group’s diluted earnings  
per share, which rose by 16.9% to 13.8 pence (2005: 11.8 pence)  
on a pre-exceptional basis, and by 1% to 11.0 pence (2005: 10.9 
pence) after taking exceptional items into account.
Notwithstanding the £74.4 million return of capital, the balance  
sheet remained strong, with year-end net cash of £29.4 million 
(2005: £101.0 million), prior to customer-based loans and finance 
leases. Inclusive of these, the net funds of the Group finished the 
year at £10.8 million (2005: £100.4 million).
The Board is pleased to recommend a final dividend of 5.0p per 
share, bringing the total dividend for 2006 to 7 .5p (2005: 7 .5p).  
This is consistent with our stated policy of maintaining the level  
of dividend until earnings have risen sufficiently to bring the  
cover to within the target range of 2 – 2.5x. The final dividend  
will be paid on 31 may 2007 to shareholders on the register  
as at 4 may 2007 .
Operating profit in the UK increased by 16.8% to £37 .5 million (2005: 
£32.1 million), principally as a result of improved gross margins on 
product sales. Our UK Product Division has been re-engineered in 
recent years to serve our customers more cost effectively, involving 
considerable investment in new e-commerce systems and a 
reorganisation of resources. These improvements are beginning 
to show benefit, both in terms of margin and in our market share. 
We also continue to target the mid-market segment through our 
telesales operation, Computacenter Direct, where revenues in 2006 
grew in excess of 40%.
Technology Solutions, the consulting and systems integration unit 
within our UK Services Division, performed strongly and continued 
to enhance its reputation for technical excellence, particularly in 
datacentre-related activities. Professional services revenues grew by 
10.6% in 2006. elsewhere within the Services Division, performance 
was mixed. margins in our contractual services business units, 
Support Services and managed Services, remained attractive, partly 
as a result of further centralisation of resources within a shared 
services delivery model; however, in a disappointing year for 
contract renewals, revenues for contractual services increased 
by just 1.0% from the previous year.
In January 2007 , we concluded the acquisition of Digica l imited for a 
consideration of £28 million, including the settlement of approximately 
£12 million of debt. Digica is a leading provider of infrastructure 
management and application services for medium sized public and  Job:	 7603_CC_FRONT_AW	 Proof:	 07	 Proof Read by:

private sector organisations, with particular expertise in datacentre 
managed services. Its operations are highly complementary to those 
of Computacenter, and the combination will give both businesses the 
opportunity to deliver a far broader offering to their respective client 
bases. This acquisition fits neatly with Computacenter’s strategy of 
developing its contractual services business. 
Computacenter Germany produced revenue growth of 5.9%, 
stimulated in the latter months of 2006 by the impending change 
to German vAT, which became effective in early 2007 . Profit 
performance in Germany was less encouraging, with operating profit 
falling to £2.8 million (2005: £5.0 million), although this decline can be 
attributed to higher than anticipated start-up losses of £6.2 million 
associated with two shared datacentre services contracts. 
Nevertheless, this should not be allowed to obscure the encouraging 
underlying improvement in the German business. Services 
revenues, which account for over a third of the German total, grew 
strongly, particularly in managed Services (both desktop and 
datacentre) and in telephony projects, including voice Over IP .
The performance of Computacenter France remained 
unsatisfactory, although pre-exceptional operating losses for the 
year reduced from £7 .6 million to £6.5 million. The restructuring 
during the first half of 2005 contributed to this improvement, 
although its benefits were mitigated by intense price competition 
in the French market and further product margin erosion as a 
consequence. Additional restructuring of the French cost base took 
place towards the end of 2006, resulting in an exceptional charge of 
£2.4 million, and we expect the business to show further progress in 
2007 towards an eventual return to profitability. The financial 
statements also show a non-cash exceptional charge of £2.6 million 
representing an impairment of the French non-current asset base. 
In October, I was pleased to announce that John Ormerod had 
joined the Board as a Non-executive Director and also assumed  
the chairmanship of the Audit Committee. John brings a wealth  
of experience to both roles and I very much look forward to  
his involvement with the Group in the years ahead.
As we have stated before, it is difficult to draw any meaningful 
insights from current trading until we have completed the first 
quarter. Notwithstanding this, a considerable amount of work has 
taken place in recent years to improve the strategic positioning of 
Computacenter, through developing significantly the services 
capabilities and restructuring the cost base of our product 
businesses. Alongside these initiatives have been a series of 
operational enhancements, aimed at improving efficiencies in  
our core processes and at upgrading our sales capabilities.  
The combination of these activities positions the Group well  
for the future.
As always, the credit for the Group’s performance belongs to the 
staff, to whom I offer my wholehearted thanks for their dedication 
and hard work.

of sale in our product supply business.
•  extending our presence in growth markets, and in 
particular the medium-sized business segment.
•  Broadening the range and depth of our 
service activities.
•  Improving the efficiency of our operations by 
deploying shared services facilities across our 
customer base.
•  Accelerating the growth of our contractual 
services business. 08. Computacenter plc  Annual report & accounts 2006

Chief executive’s review
u K
UK revenues declined by 5.2% to £1.28 billion (2005: £1.35 billion). 
modest services growth partially mitigated a product sales decline 
of 7 .2%, which was principally due to our withdrawal from selected 
low margin volume sales in trade distribution. 
Operating profit grew 16.8% to £37 .5 million (2005: £32.1 million). 
The improvement came mainly from better product margins, but 
also reflected our success in penetrating new markets and delivering 
operational efficiencies.
services Division
Overall services revenues grew 3.1%, with strong Technology 
Solutions growth compensating for a disappointing 1.0% increase 
in contractual revenues. 
We continued to focus on reducing operational costs and improving 
customer service. In particular, we sought to make more effective 
use of shared resources and tools for service delivery. The 
increased use of the Technical Resource Group, a flexible, shared 
engineering resource, across our client base, helped reduce 
our operational overheads significantly and made our offerings 
more competitive.
Throughout 2006, we saw a growth in contractual opportunities 
arising from an increase in the number of organisations seeking  
to split their service contracts across a range of specialist partners. 
These were typically for contracts of three to five-year terms, rather 
than the ten-year service engagements traditionally placed with 
large systems integrators.
The Services Division comprises three business units: managed 
Services, Support Services and Technology Solutions.
Managed s ervices
Despite a disappointing year for contract renewals, our managed 
Services business unit grew revenues by 6.6% and improved its 
profit contribution.
The UK outsourcing market continues to grow at 4 – 5% annually. 
Promising market developments for Computacenter’s business 
include increased interest from medium-sized organisations for 
desktop and datacentre managed services. 
Our growth plans include the continued expansion and 
enhancement of our service desk and datacentre capabilities. 
This strategic focus led to the acquisition in early 2007 of Digica, 
a provider of infrastructure management and application services 
with a particular focus on medium-sized public and private 
sector organisations.
managed Services successes in 2006 include a five-year £28 million 
distributed IT and datacentre outsourcing contract with eversheds, 
a five-year £6 million contract with IT firm Parity to manage its entire 
IT infrastructure including its datacentre, and an extension in 
scope and terms of our contract with the Nuclear

A highly cost-conscious market led to an overall decline in our 
Support Services revenues. Performance from this business unit 
was strongest in the datacentre environment, where pressure on 
unit price was less intense.  Job:	 7603_CC_FRONT_AW	 Proof:	 07	 Proof Read by:

market demand was driven by clients seeking to centralise and 
consolidate their IT infrastructures to improve service and reduce 
both risk and costs. Growth also came from an increase in the 
subcontracting of support by large outsourcing organisations and 
systems integrators, a market upon which we placed particular 
focus in 2006. Such a partnership approach helped us secure a 
BT-subcontracted three-year hardware maintenance and support 
contract with l iverpool Direct.
Support Services continues to be strong in the traditionally attractive 
financial services market. In addition, our more recent efforts to 
improve our coverage of the mid-market, where there is greater 
growth potential, helped us win business with approximately 30 
organisations that had not previously traded with Computacenter. 
We also saw growth in areas such as the retail sector, where we 
won a three-year contract with John l ewis Partnership for the 
support of all their desktops, laptops, printers and networks across 
the UK.
Other significant wins in the period include a three-year contract for 
the support of Taylor Woodrow’s entire server estate. 
t echnology s olutions
Our Technology Solutions business grew strongly, with much of  
the growth coming from an increase in datacentre projects. With  
a majority of Technology Solutions projects in 2006 including a 
datacentre component, we sought to develop new offerings to 
answer client demand in this area. As a result, we are now able to 
offer an end-to-end datacentre solution for reducing operating costs, 
speeding up business applications deployment and improving 
environmental efficiency.
In addition, we benefited from closer integration with our product 
supply business, as an increasing number of clients chose to couple 
product supply with the purchase of project services. 
A 15% increase in revenues from consulting and project 
management led to very high professional services activity, and 
helped the overall profitability of the Technology Solutions business. 
We now have a substantial pipeline for professional services projects 
in the UK and we anticipate further growth in this area.
We continued to refine our propositions to answer changing client 
requirements. For example, our shared risk approach to Technology 
Solutions projects, which answers a growing demand for assured 
outcomes rather than hired expertise, proved of interest to 
organisations seeking to reduce the risk and fix the cost of projects.
Significant new business in the period included a five-year contract 
with Doncaster College of Further education, worth £6 million, for its 
new 35,000 sq. m. campus. 
product Division
Our ongoing programme of re-engineering our product business to 
deliver improved profitability and growth began to bear fruit in 2006. 
Following a decline in product revenues in 2005, we saw a 
stabilisation in revenues from end-user sales in 2006. 
A 1.7% increase in product gross margins reflects our success 
in implementing improved business controls relating to product 
purchasing and supply. We also continued to lower the cost of sale 
through use of a lighter-touch sales model for product-only clients, 
enabled through our deployment of improved e-commerce systems. 300

Our services contract base across the Group 
continued to grow year on year.
Continuing Contra Ct base gro Wt H
We benefited from our evolving product mix, with a still greater 
proportion of sales coming from network, server and other 
enterprise technologies. This was partly driven by the increased 
criticality of enterprise systems and partly by the growth of our 
Technology Solutions business, where such technology is often 
part of a bundled solution.
The Product Division comprises four business units: Corporate 
h ardware, Software, Computacenter Direct and CCD.
c orporate  Hardware
Technology sales to end-users increased slightly, although following 
a major investment in the latest version of our webshop, Connect 6, 
we experienced 28% growth in online revenues. Web sales now 
comprise over 16% of all hardware orders.
Product margins benefited from an increase in business with 
the financial sector, as well as the growing enterprise technology 
proportion in the product mix. We saw particularly strong growth 
in our Sun, emC, Cisco and IBm enterprise business. 
With price competition still intense in the product market, the 
Corporate h ardware business sought to enhance the range of 
supply-related value propositions it provides to customers. In 
particular, we focused on developing and communicating our 
offerings in the areas of managed multi-vendor procurement 
contracts, extensive multi-site deployments and environmental 
advisory services. 
Significant new product business includes a £50 million contract 
with the ATl AS Consortium, covering managed supply and 
deployment services to support the Defence Information 
Infrastructure (Future) programme within the UK ministry of Defence.
software
Our Software business grew revenues 7% during 2006. Growth 
was across our vendor base, and partly a result of an expanding 
software services market. 
The increased threat of vendor audits, rising merger activity and the 
business disruption of off-shoring, all drove clients to look for greater 
security, efficiency and agility in software purchasing. many of these 
organisations sought help to ensure compliance, consolidate multi-
vendor agreements and renegotiate licence terms. 
To capture better these opportunities, we increased our investment 
in dedicated sales and marketing resources. Whilst this has had 
some short-term impact on this unit’s profit contribution, it is 
envisaged that future software business growth will be achieved 
without the requirement to add further to the cost base.
Significant successes in 2006 include a renewal of microsoft 
licences with BAA in a three-year Direct enterprise Agreement.
c omputacenter  Direct
This business unit, targeting the growing medium-sized business 
market, continued to grow strongly, with improved product margins 
and revenue growth in excess of 40%.
Recruitment of additional sales staff helped drive a 23% increase in 
product volumes, predominantly related to server technology. This, 
together with our increasing success in attaching deployment and 
integration services to technology supply, contributed to an 
increased profit contribution from this unit.
Computacenter Direct continues to attract new clients, and now 
has over 1,500 trading customers. We are confident of continuing 
growth in the mid-market sector.
Our UK Software business, where we increased  
our investment in dedicated sales and marketing 
resources, grew revenues 7% during 2006.

Following a management reorganisation in 2006, CCD, our trade 
distribution arm, sought to reduce its exposure in a small number 
of unprofitable, high volume accounts. As a result, we saw rising 
margins and profitability in the second half of the year.
Profit performance also benefited from a merger of the two 
operating units comprising CCD, reducing our operating costs and 
streamlining the sales operation. Increased sales focus led to a 
number of notable successes during the year, in particular the 
growth of our IBm System x server revenues, which significantly 
increased CCD’s market share in these systems, and the successful 
introduction of a focused server-based computing initiative in 
partnership with h P .
The management team was further strengthened in the last quarter 
and a comprehensive sales development plan has been initiated to 
underpin the business during 2007 and beyond. Although market 
conditions are expected to remain fiercely competitive, management 
believe that we are well placed to build on the improvements seen
in 2006.
r Dc
After breaking even in the previous year, RDC, our technology 
recycling and remarketing operation, returned to profit in 2006. 
Our margin on remarketing services increased by 15.1% and we 
continued to be profitable in Germany.
Our success in 2006 was in part due to a renewed sales focus in 
the first half of the year, with the launch of Computacenter Asset 
Recovery Services and the creation of a new frontline sales team 
instrumental in a number of service wins.
Throughout 2006 we saw significant successes in both our direct 
business, and business won with Computacenter accounts. We 
now see a healthy sales pipeline, which we anticipate should provide 
a secure platform for profit and revenue growth in 2007 .
g ermany
Computacenter Germany recorded revenue growth of 5.9% to 
£654.7 million, although full-year operating profits declined 44.2% 
to £2.8 million (2005: £5.0 million).
The fall in profitability was largely due to the implementation of two 
shared datacentre contracts, and the creation of the underlying 
infrastructure, which collectively produced a loss of approximately 
£6.2 million. Whilst elements of this were planned costs of start-up, 
these losses were on an unacceptable scale and considerable 
efforts were made in the second half of the year to rectify the failings. 
We are confident that this has now been achieved. 
This has obscured to some extent a marked underlying performance 
improvement in the German business. Trading was particularly 
strong at the year-end. Although this may signify a developing 
recovery in the German market, some of this growth appears to 
have arisen from additional spending by clients ahead of the vAT 
increase in Germany in early 2007 .
Sales growth also came from an increase in managed Services 
business, as clients turned to outsourcing to help reduce IT 
operational costs. Overall, we continued to attract new business, 
with some significant wins and renewals leading to 22% contract 
base growth.
As elsewhere, an increased proportion of our product business 
came from sales of enterprise technology. We saw particular growth 
in networking offerings, reflecting the further commoditisation of
the PC and laptop business and our increased focus on business-
led solutions. 
In Germany, we continued to attract new business, 
leading to 22% contract base growth.

Chief executive’s review
In our Technology Solutions business, we continue to see the fruits 
of the investment made five years ago in the development of voice 
Over IP telephony and voice on Demand. Revenues from this 
competitive but highly profitable market segment were twice
their 2005 value and we expect them to continue to grow 
attractively in 2007 .
To support a growing requirement for the provision of a more 
international service to large global customers such as Adidas, we 
took full responsibility in October for our Service Desk facility and its 
120 employees in erfurt. This was previously managed via a joint 
venture with Sellbytel. Through stronger integration with our other 
facilities in milton Keynes (UK) and Barcelona, this will help us build 
a more integrated international service centre network.
Significant wins include a five-year outsourcing contract with Union 
Investment IT for DZ Bank Gruppe, worth up to £60 million in 
product and service sales. We will provide an end-to-end service  
to include support of approximately 10,000 workstations and the 
outsourcing of the client’s datacentre, with all service managed on 
our systems.
Other successes include a three-year europe-wide contract 
with Airbus, worth 30 million euros, and major extensions of our 
contracts with Daimler Chrysler, for network support of its mercedes 
Technology Centre, and with Bosch, to include the support of 
38,000 workstations over a three-year term.
f rance
Performance in France remains unsatisfactory, although pre-
exceptional operating losses reduced 15.0% to £6.5 million (2005: 
£7 .6 million) as revenues grew 3.9% to £307 .3 million (2005: £295.8 
million). Taking into account the effect of exceptional charges, which 
related to additional restructuring of the French business, operating 
loss increased from £9.3 million in 2005 to £11.5 million.
Despite further product margin erosion over 2006, we saw a 
slowdown of the trend over the first nine months and a slight 
improvement in margins in the last quarter. encouragingly, services 
margins improved over the year and we completed the final stages 
of business take-on of our largest multinational services contract. 
We benefited from our ongoing focus on reducing the cost base in 
France in both people and non-people expenses and we intend to 
continue with these measures in 2007 . We also saw some promising 
product and services sales growth, particularly in the second half of 
the year. 
The growth of our profitable maintenance business was another key 
focus, with the launch of a comprehensive sales training programme 
designed to improve the identification, qualification and capture of 
these opportunities. We are already starting to see the benefits of 
this programme, with a significant increase in maintenance business 
over the period and into 2007 . A similar sales training programme for 
enterprise products, which are less subject to price pressures than 
desktop systems, led to an expansion of our team of IBm technical 
consultants and helped grow our IBm revenues by 13%.
To support the provision of a more international 
service to large global customers such as Adidas,

Our Benelux operation recorded an operating loss of £191,000 
(2005: £109,000). The Belgium and Netherlands business achieved 
a break-even result, in spite of costs arising from the development 
of new communication and storage business units to address rising 
demand in those markets. Our sub-scale l uxembourg operation 
recorded an overall loss. 
Product supply performed strongly, with an increased profit 
contribution, as did managed Services, mainly from the growing 
financial sector.
Key wins included a renewal on product supply with Pioneer, a 
technology refresh project at SWIFT, a desktop managed services 
contract with Burgo Ardennes, and a CRm project for the european 
salesforce of Ansell.
international
We saw increasing client interest in our international capabilities  
in 2006, with a number of contract wins and extensions having a 
multi-country component. Typically these were with multinational 
organisations headquartered in europe, such as Cognis, which 
outsourced its global IT infrastructure to Computacenter, including 
management of its datacentre and service desk.
Our service facilities have been extended through the building of 
a multi-lingual shared service desk in Barcelona and through the 
service desk capability in Cape Town, RSA that comes as part of  
the Digica acquisition. This enables Computacenter to determine  
the most suitable location, in terms of both quality of service and 
cost, when configuring service contracts for customers.

The Group has wide ranging programmes designed to identify 
risks, develop and implement an appropriate range of controls, 
and ensure that these controls are suitably resilient. These 
activities are further described in the Group’s Corporate 
Governance Statement.  Summarised below are some of the 
principal risks that present a material threat to the successful 
implementation of the Group’s strategy, categorised into strategic 
risks, operational risks and hazards. Financial risks are described 
in the Finance Director’s Review. 
Strategic risks are those arising principally from external events. 
These include the following:
The Group’s profits are exposed to continuing erosion in the 
unit price of the IT equipment that it sells. This is mitigated 
by efforts to reduce costs and by continually refocusing the  
selling activity on those products and services that offer 
the highest margin potential.
A significant proportion of the Group’s revenues arise from 
a small number of key vendors who have considerable scale  
and market strength. Deterioration of vendor terms present  
a risk, which the Group seeks to mitigate through further 
growth of its multi-vendor portfolio, continuing to build 
its services activities, and the development of strong 
customer relationships.
In the Group’s contractual services activities, there is a trend in  
the market towards shorter-term service engagements and the 
requirement to commit to quantified cost reduction over the 
term of the contract. The Group seeks to mitigate these risks 
through continuing to develop higher value service offerings 
and through widening the client base, particularly in the mid-
market sector.  
•
•
•
Operational risks are those arising from failures in internal 
processes, people and systems. These risks, which can be 
mitigated by internal controls and proactive intervention, include 
the following: 
The dynamic nature of the industry brings the risk that new 
generation service contracts may be entered into, without a 
full comprehension of all of their commercial consequences.  
management controls are constantly being reviewed across  
the Group to minimise this risk.  
An inability to attract and retain key management and operating 
personnel could damage operational efficiency. In response, 
the Group seeks to maintain its focus on succession planning, 
talent identification and training and development.    
h azards constitute perils such as fire and flood, which could 
harm the Group’s ability to deliver services and products. Whilst 
the likelihood of the loss of an entire facility of the Group has 
been assessed as low, the severity may be significant. In 
mitigation, risk prevention and control measures are maintained 
and continuity plans are implemented and monitored through a 
test plan. Similar mitigation has been applied to the risk of 
pandemic illness. The Group also maintains insurance cover for 
certain of these risks.

‘ r evenues for the year of £2.27 billion

tony Conop Hy FINANCe DIReCTOR
f inance Director’s review
t urnover and profitability
Revenues for the year of £2.27 billion represented a reduction  
of 0.7% from 2005. A decline in product revenues of 2.0% was 
partially offset by an increase in services revenues of 3.9%. 
Revenues in the French and German businesses improved in  
the year, whereas revenue in the UK declined by 5.2%, principally 
due to our withdrawal from selected low margin volume sales  
in trade distribution.
Pre-exceptional pre-tax profits improved from £35.7 million to £38.0 
million. Taking into account exceptional charges in France of £1.7 
million and £5.0 million respectively, profit before tax reduced from 
£34.0 million to £32.9 million.
o perating profit
Group pre-exceptional operating profit improved by 14.5% from 
£29.3 million to £33.6 million. 
In the UK, despite a 5.2% fall in revenues, gross profit increased 
by 7 .1%, with the gross margin percentage improving from 12.6% 
to 14.2%. The gross margin improvement is due to both improved 
business mix and some underlying margin improvement. Other 
operating expenses increased by 4.8%, partially as a result of the 
reclassification of approximately 90 heads from ‘cost of goods 
sold’ to ‘other operating expenses’, following the 2005 business 
restructure. UK operating profit increased by 16.8% from £32.1 
million to £37 .5 million. 
  Product sales in the UK declined by 7 .2%, principally reflecting our 
withdrawal from selected low margin volume sales in our trade 
distribution business. In the end-user business product pricing 
continued to be under pressure throughout the year, however 
margins improved, mainly as a result of a more favourable 
business mix.
•
  Services revenues in the UK increased by 3.1%. The growth was 
driven by a 10.6% improvement in professional services revenues, 
whereas support and managed services revenues grew by just 
1.0%. Despite a disappointing year for contract renewals, 
managed services revenues improved by 6.6%; however this  
was offset by a decline in support services revenues, which  
were subject to substantial unit cost pressures. 
In Germany, operating profit fell from £5.0 million to £2.8 million. 
Revenues increased during the year by 5.9%, with a 6.3% growth 
in product revenues and a 5.1% growth in services. In 2005 we 
reported resold third party services within managed services 
revenues in Germany. We now can separately identify these 
revenues, and now report this within product revenues and  
have accordingly reclassified £12.9 million of revenue in the  
2005 comparative amounts. 
 
The fall in profitability was largely due to the implementation of 
two new shared datacentre contracts, and the development of 
the underlying infrastructure, generating a loss of some £6.2 
million. Whilst these two new contracts reflect Computacenter’s 
objective of taking more end-to-end responsibility in our 
infrastructure service contracts, these initial losses much greater 
than expected. Steps have now been taken to rectify the specific 
problems associated with these contracts and to improve the bid 
review process in Germany to avoid any such unanticipated 
losses in the future.  
 
Setting aside these contracts, the underlying business has 
performed more strongly in 2006, with trading particularly strong 
towards the end of the year, partly as a result of clients bringing 
forward their purchasing decisions ahead of the vAT increase in 
Germany in early 2007 . In addition, tighter cost controls ensured 
that operating expenses reduced by 2.5% to £80.6 million, 
despite a 1.1% increase in indirect headcount.

21. Computacenter plc  Annual report & accounts 2006
In October 2006 we disposed of the shares in our associate, 
h elpByCom (a Service Desk facility), and in return took full 
responsibility for their facility and its 120 employees in erfurt, 
resulting in a profit on disposal of £0.3 million.
In France the financial performance was unsatisfactory albeit 
showing some signs of improvement, with the pre-exceptional 
operating loss reducing from £7 .6 million to £6.5 million. Taking 
exceptional charges into account, the operating loss increased 
from £9.3 million to £11.5 million. Despite revenues growth of 
3.9%, product price declines affected margin performance. 
The gross profit percentage reduced from 9.8% to 9.0% in 2006, 
although towards the end of the year there was a slight margin 
improvement. The usual seasonal factors drove an improvement, 
resulting in a reduced loss of £1.1 million in the second half 
of 2006. 
 
Services margins in France improved over 2005 as a result of the 
services transformation project, (which resulted in redundancy 
costs of £1.7 million in the first half of 2005). Ongoing cost control 
contributed to a further reduction in other operating expenses of 
6.5% to £34.2 million. In order to better align the indirect cost 
base of the business, an additional £2.4 million redundancy 
charge has been incurred during the fourth quarter, classified 
within exceptional charges.
Revenues in the ‘Benelux’ region increased by 33.1% principally 
as a result of one very large low margin product fulfillment deal. 
As a result, gross margin percentage reduced from 11.6% to 
9.3% in the year. Other operating expenses increased by 9.5% to 
£2.6 million due to investment in a communication and storage 
business unit. Overall the operating performance was a loss 
of £0.2 million, compared to an operating loss of £0.1 million 
in 2005.

exceptional items
A £5.0 million exceptional charge has been incurred in France in 
the year. A restructure of the French indirect cost base took place 
towards the end of 2006, resulting in an exceptional charge of £2.4 
million. A redundancy charge of £1.7 million, which had previously 
been classified within operating expenses in 2005, has been 
reclassified into exceptional charges in order to provide an 
appropriate comparative.  
There was a further non-cash exceptional charge of £2.6 million, 
representing an impairment of the French non-current asset base 
as the short-term forecast cash flows did not support the pre-
impairment asset value.
r eturn of capital and interest
On 3 July 2006 the Company effected a 5 for 6 capital 
reorganisation. As a result of consolidation, 190,876,000 ordinary 
shares of 5p became 159,063,000 ordinary shares of 6p.
There was an associated cash outflow of £74.4 million, and as a 
consequence the net interest received in the second half of 2006 
reduced in the order of £1.9 million.
earnings per share and dividend
The return of capital during the year has helped to enhance earnings 
per share measures in excess of the improvements delivered by 
profitability gains. Diluted earnings per share, on a pre-exceptional 
basis, increased from 11.8p to 13.8p, an increase of 16.9%. After 
exceptional charges, diluted earnings per share increased by 0.9% 
from 10.9p to 11.0p. It is our intention to maintain the total dividend 
for the year at 7 .5p per share. The final dividend will be payable on 
31 may 2007 to registered shareholders as at 4 may 2007 .

Cash flow and working capital
  2006 2005 Diff

Trade receivable days  58 51 7
Trade payable days  40 39 -1
Inventory levels decreased in line with product revenue from £100.2 
million to £94.6 million whilst inventory days remained static at 23. 
The product business mix continues to shift towards enterprise 
sales, particularly around the end of the year, and these items are 
often not held in inventory, being usually delivered directly from the 
vendor to the end-user. 
Trade receivable days increased substantially from 51 to 58. Whilst 
revenues are 0.7% lower, a higher proportion of sales were recorded 
in the last month of the year, which has resulted in the trade 
receivable days calculation being substantially higher 
than is normally the case. Germany was particularly affected, 
experiencing sales in December approximately 40% ahead of 
December 2005.
Trade payable days increased from 39 to 40. Due to the higher levels 
of business towards the end of the year, the trade payables balance 
and trade payable days were higher at the end of December 2005. 
h owever trade payable days did not increase as much as trade 
receivables, as the payment term with our major vendor is 14 days. 
The cash generated from operations was £25.4 million (2005: £66.0 
million). In relation to operating profit, cash generated from 
operations was 88.9% (2005: 238.5%). The movement in working 
capital was £24.2 million.
Cash and cash equivalents reduced by £73.9 million from £132.9 
million to £59.0 million. Operating profit prior to depreciation and 
other non-cash charges together with net interest earnings totalled 
£54.0 million. These earnings financed working capital outflows  
of £24.0 million, corporation tax payments of £12.0 million, capital 
expenditure of £9.0 million and dividends of £13.3 million. The key 
driver therefore for the reduction of cash and cash equivalents was 
the £74.4 million return of capital in July 2006.
Taking into account the factor financing facility in France, net funds 
prior to customer-specific finance leases and loans reduced by 
£71.6 million from £101.0 million to £29.4 million. 
During the year, we entered into a number of customer-specific 
finance leases and loans, principally in relation to new datacentre 
offerings in the UK and Germany. Taking these into account, total net 
funds at the end of the year were £10.8 million, compared to £100.4 
million at the start of the year, the reduction mainly driven by the 
return of capital mentioned above.
acquisitions
On 4 January 2007 , Computacenter plc completed the acquisition 
of Digica Group from Bridgepoint Capital, l yceum Capital (through 
its investment in Fox IT) and management shareholders. The 
consideration paid for Digica amounted to £15.9 million, in addition 
to which Computacenter settled assumed debt of £12.1 million, both 
of which were satisfied from cash reserves. 
t axation
The effective tax rate (based on pre-exceptional profit before tax) 
for the Group was 36.9% compared to 38.1% in 2005. The 
improvement is mainly attributable to the reduction of unrelieved 
operating losses in France. This accounted for a 6.3% differential 
in the tax rate from the standard 30%. 
f inancial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash 
and liquid resources, and various items that arise directly from 
its operations. The Group occasionally enters into hedging 
transactions, principally forward exchange contracts or currency 
swaps. The purpose of these transactions is to manage currency 
risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. 
The Group’s policy remains that no trading in financial instruments 
shall be undertaken.

23. Computacenter plc  Annual report & accounts 2006
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are 
interest rate, liquidity and foreign currency risks. The overall financial 
instruments strategy is to manage these risks in order to minimise 
their impact on the financial results of the Group. The policies for 
managing each of these risks are set out below.
interest  rate  risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained 
profits, bank borrowings, invoice factoring in France and finance 
leases for certain customer contracts. The Group’s bank 
borrowings, other facilities and deposits are at floating rates. No 
interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into. We will 
continue to monitor this position to ensure that the interest rate 
profile is appropriate for the Group. When long-term borrowings are 
utilised, the Group’s policy is to maintain these borrowings at fixed 
rates to limit the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
l iquidity  risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding and 
committed bank facilities in place to meet any foreseeable peak  
in borrowing requirements. At 31 December 2006 the Group had 
£53.9 million (2005: £55.0 million) of committed bank facilities with 
maturities for up to 1 year, of which 81.3% (2005: 83.5%) were drawn 
down. In addition the Group has £79.0 million (2005: £59.2 million) 
of bank overdraft facilities.
The Group’s net funds position at the year-end was £10.8 million. 
In combination with the above facilities the Group has a strong 
covenant and approximately £60 million of freehold property which 
combined should provide access to substantial additional funds to 
finance working capital movements and planned capital investment.
Foreign  currency  risk
The Group operates primarily in the UK, Germany, France, and the 
‘Benelux’ countries, using local borrowings to fund its operations 
outside of the UK, where principal receipts and payments are 
denominated in euros. In each country a small proportion of the 
sales are made to customers outside those countries. For those 
countries within the euro zone, the level of non-euro denominated 
sales is very small and if material, the Group’s policy is to eliminate 
currency exposure through forward currency contracts. For the UK, 
the vast majority of sales and purchases are denominated in sterling 
and any material trading exposures are eliminated through forward 
currency contracts.
c redit  risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the 
Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets 
is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.

1 Compliance statement 
The Board continues to recognise the importance of effective 
corporate governance in relation to the achievement of the Group’s 
objectives. It has devised policies that seek to apply established 
best practice in order to achieve and maintain compliance with the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance, as published in July 
2003 and reviewed in November 2005 (‘the Code’). The Board 
acknowledges its responsibilities under the Code, the principles 
and provisions of which it supports. This report details how the 
Company has applied those principles and provisions. The Board 
confirms that, save as detailed below, the Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Code throughout the financial year.
2 Board of Directors
Structure
The Board currently consists of three Executive Directors: Ron 
Sandler, Mike Norris and Tony Conophy, and five Non-Executive 
Directors: Philip Hulme, Ian Lewis, Peter Ogden, John Ormerod and 
Cliff Preddy. Details of the Directors, including their membership of 
Committees, are set out below and their biographies appear on 
pages 24 and 25. Ian Lewis, John Ormerod and Cliff Preddy are 
considered by the Board to be independent under the provisions of 
the Code and Cliff Preddy is the Senior Independent Director. Nick 
Cosh served as the Senior Independent Director until his resignation 
from the Board on 28 June 2006. 
The Directors are aware that during the year under review, the 
structure of the Board did not comply with provision A.3.2 of the 
Code, which requires at least half the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, to consist of independent Non-Executive Directors.  
The Board and Nominations Committee have considered this 
matter carefully over the period and have sought to achieve a 
balance between the desirability of achieving compliance with this 
provision of the Code, and the requirement for the Board to function 
effectively and with continuity. This has led to the net addition of one 
independent Non-Executive Director during the year. Although the 
Company is still not compliant with the Code given the present size 
and composition of the Board, there are no plans to appoint any 
further Directors at the present time. 
Decision making 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are split and there is  
a clear division of responsibilities between the two. In brief, the 
Chairman is responsible for the effective operation of the Board  
and for overseeing the strategic focus and performance of the 
senior management. The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-
to-day management of the Group’s activities. There is no individual 
who has unfettered powers of decision and no one individual or 
group of individuals who dominate the Board’s decision making 
processes. The Board believes that it oversees the Group effectively 
and is proactive in its approach. The Board is led by the Chairman, 
who is responsible for setting the agenda and ensuring its efficiency.
The Chairman facilitates the contribution of all Directors and is 
responsible for ensuring constructive relations exist between them. 
The Board sets the strategic aims for the Group and ensures that 
the necessary financial and human resources are in place to 
achieve these objectives. It is also responsible for reviewing the 
performance of management in order to ensure that they are 
meeting pre-agreed objectives.
There is a documented schedule of matters that are reserved for 
the Board and these matters include the approval of major capital 
expenditure and the agreement of strategies and budgets. This 
schedule was comprehensively reviewed by the Board during 2006. 
All of the Directors have access to the Company Secretary, Stephen 
Benadé, who is responsible for ensuring that all Board procedures 
are followed, applicable rules and regulations are complied with and 
the Board is updated on all governance matters. The Chairman 
ensures that new Directors receive a tailored induction and that all 
Directors are properly briefed on issues considered at Board 
meetings to enable them to effectively discharge their duties.  
All Directors receive relevant information in a timely manner.  
This includes detailed briefings on all matters where the Board  
is required to make a decision or to give its approval and regular 
reports on issues such as the trading performance and outlook.  
In addition, senior members of the management team are routinely 
invited to attend Board meetings, thereby ensuring Directors 
continually update their knowledge of, and familiarity with, the 
business of the Group. All of the Directors are entitled to obtain 
independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense,  
where they believe it is important to the furtherance of their duties. 
The Company arranges insurance cover in respect of legal action 
against the Directors and in defined permissible instances, the 
Company is able to indemnify Directors against claims brought.
The Directors set appropriate values and standards, ensuring that 
obligations to shareholders and others are understood and met  
and that a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders is maintained.  
A framework of prudent and effective controls exists, to ensure  
that risks are properly identified, assessed and managed.
All Directors are subject to election at the first Annual General 
Meeting after appointment and are required to retire by rotation, 
every three years. Those Non-Executive Directors who have  
served for more than nine years, are obliged to offer themselves  
for re-election annually.

Corporate governance statement 27. Computacenter plc Annual report & accounts 2006
The Board has established a formal process, which is led by the 
Chairman, for the evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
Committees and individual Directors. Individual interviews are 
conducted by the Chairman with each Director to explore matters  
of Board effectiveness. The information obtained forms the basis of 
a report for discussion by the Board which decides, as a whole,  
on the actions to be taken in respect of those areas identified as 
requiring improvement. The review of the performance of the 
Chairman is undertaken annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Principal Board Committees 
The Board has delegated certain duties to three principal 
Committees, the main responsibilities and composition of  
which are as follows:
Audit Committee
Members: John Ormerod (Chairman), Ian Lewis and 
Cliff Preddy
For the meetings of the Committee during 2006, the Company was 
not compliant with provision C.3.1, which states that there should be 
at least three independent members of the Committee. This non-
compliance was due to the resignations of Ghislain Lescuyer at the 
end of 2005 and Nick Cosh. Due to the resignation of the Audit 
Committee Chairman, Nick Cosh on 28 June 2006, no separate 
Audit Committee meetings were held in the latter half of the year. 
The business of the Committee was dealt with by the Board. The 
Committee membership has returned to compliance, with the 
appointments of Ian Lewis on 15 June 2006 and John Ormerod  
as Audit Committee Chairman on 31 October 2006, and meetings 
separate from the Board will convene in 2007 . During 2006, the 
Committee met twice and attendance at those meetings is set out 
on page 28. The Board Chairman, Group Finance Director, Group 
Internal Audit Manager, Group Risk Manager and the external 
auditor are routinely invited to and attend the majority of meetings. 
Periodically, the Committee also meets privately with external 
auditors and the Group Internal Audit Manager. 
The Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its duties by reviewing  
a wide range of matters including the Group’s annual and interim 
financial statements and accompanying reports to shareholders, 
the preliminary announcement of results and all other 
announcements regarding financial performance. In addition, it 
reviews on behalf of the Board the scope, cost effectiveness and 
result of external and internal audit and the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity. The Commitee establishes and 
monitors the Group’s policy in relation to non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor, with a view to ensuring objectivity, 
independence and cost effectiveness. The Committee monitors the 
integrity of internal financial controls and risk management systems, 
principally on the basis of reports on significant operational risks 
and controls, presented by the Internal Audit Department and the 
Risk and Insurance Department. In addition, the Committee reviews 
practices for answering staff concerns over improprieties and 
should these arise, ensures that procedures are in place for 
appropriate investigation and follow-up. 
Nominations Committee 
Members: Ron Sandler (Chairman), Ian Lewis, John Ormerod 
and Cliff Preddy 
The Committee Chairman is Ron Sandler, the Executive Chairman, 
and the other members are independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee convened three times during 2006. Nick Cosh 
resigned from the Committee on 28 June 2006. In accordance with 
the provisions of the Code, the majority of the Committee is made 
up of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee’s responsibilities include leading the process for 
Board appointments, reviewing the Board composition, skills, 
knowledge and experience, and nominating candidates for both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directorships on the basis of merit 
and objective criteria. It also ensures that the procedures for the 
appointment of new Directors are formal, rigorous and transparent 
and that there is an orderly succession for appointments to the 
Board and senior management.
 
When making a recommendation for the appointment of a Director, 
the Committee will evaluate the existing balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board and produce a description of the role 
and capabilities required for such an appointment. The Committee 
typically uses the services of external advisers to help identify 
candidates from a wide range of backgrounds who will then be 
considered on merit against objective criteria. 
Remuneration Committee
Members: Cliff Preddy (Chairman), Ian Lewis and  
John Ormerod
All of the members of this Committee are independent Non-
Executive Directors. Compliance with provision B.2.1 of the Code 
was not achieved for the entire year, due to the resignations of 
Ghislain Lescuyer at the end of 2005 and Nick Cosh in 2006. 
However, with the Non-Executive appointments in 2006, the 
Committee is once again compliant with the Code. Philip Hulme 
and Peter Ogden generally attend the Committee meetings by 
invitation. Ron Sandler attends meetings but absents himself when 
his own remuneration is considered. 
The Committee determines the Group’s general policy on executive 
remuneration, the specific packages for the Executive Directors and 
the level and structure of remuneration for senior employees in line 
with best practice. The Committee also monitors and reviews the 
terms and conditions of the Executive Directors’ service 
agreements, determines the grant of shares or options to them and 
to senior employees, and appoints any consultants used in 
assessing their remuneration. The Committee’s terms of reference 
are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure that its activities 
comply fully with the provisions of the Code and in particular that 
there is a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy 
on executive remuneration and for fixing the remuneration 
packages of individual Directors.
Throughout 2006 the terms of reference for all Committees were 
available from the Company Secretary on request and were posted 
on the Company’s website. 28. Computacenter plc Annual report & accounts 2006
From time to time, additional meetings are required which may not 
necessarily demand attendance by all Directors, depending on the 
nature of the business to be discussed. During the year, two such 
meetings were required to conclude matters previously considered 
by the Board. Ron Sandler, Mike Norris, Tony Conophy, Philip 
Hulme, Ian Lewis, John Ormerod and Cliff Preddy attended both 
meetings and Peter Ogden was present at one.
It is inevitable that there will be occasions when circumstances  
arise to prevent Directors from attending meetings. In such 
circumstances, the usual practice is for the absent Director to 
review the Board papers and to raise any considerations on  
specific issues with the Chairman.
In addition to the formal Board and Committee meetings, the 
Chairman meets with the Non-Executive Directors without the  
other Executive Directors being present, at least once a year.  
The Non-Executives also meet without the Chairman to  
appraise his performance.
3 Directors’ remuneration
The principles and details of Directors’ remuneration are contained 
in the Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 33.
4 Relations with shareholders 
The Executive Directors have regular contact with institutional 
shareholders (except during close periods) and dialogue with 
shareholders is generally accorded a high priority. The Company 
has a programme of meetings with its major institutional 
shareholders and presents to analysts at least twice a year, 
following the announcement of its interim and final results. The 
Chairman arranges for the Directors to receive regular reports on 
shareholders’ views to ensure the Board develops an understanding 
of matters of concern to the major shareholders. Cliff Preddy, as 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, is available to answer 
any shareholder concerns that are unable to be resolved through 
regular channels. In addition to mandatory information, a full and 
balanced explanation of the business of all general meetings is sent 
to shareholders. The Board welcomes the attendance of individual 
shareholders at general meetings and the opportunity to 
communicate with investors and address their questions. 
Resolutions at the Company’s general meetings have been  
passed on a show of hands and proxies for and against each 
resolution (together with any abstentions) are announced at  
such meetings and noted in the minutes.
5 Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for maintaining and reviewing 
the Group’s systems of internal control, ensuring that these are 
prudent and robust, and enabling risks to be properly assessed and 
managed. Systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board conducts an annual review of the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems. Where 
material weaknesses have been identified safeguards are 
implemented and monitored.  
All systems of internal control are designed to continuously identify, 
evaluate and manage significant risks faced by the Group. The key 
elements of the Group’s controls are as follows:
Responsibilities and authority structure
The Board has overall responsibility for making significant strategic 
decisions and there is a schedule of specific matters reserved for 
the Board. The Executive Directors, together with two senior 
managers, constitute the Group Executive Committee, which meets 
on a regular basis to discuss day-to-day operational matters. 
Separate Executive Committees have been established for each  
of the Group’s operations in the UK, France and Germany. A flat 
reporting structure is maintained across the Group with clearly 
defined responsibilities for operational and financial management.

Control environment
The Group operates authorisation and approval processes that  
are an integral part of its operations. Access controls exist where 
processes have been automated to ensure the security of data. 
Management information systems have been developed to identify 
risks and to enable assessment of the effectiveness of the system of 
internal control. Accountability is reinforced, and the further scrutiny 
of costs and revenues encouraged, by the linking of staff incentives 
to customer satisfaction and profitability.
Planning and reporting processes
A three-year strategic plan is prepared or updated annually and 
reviewed by the Board. A comprehensive budgetary process is 
completed annually and is subject to the approval of the Board. 
Performance is monitored through a rigorous and detailed financial 
and management reporting system, by which monthly results are 
compared to budgets and the previous year. The results and 
explanations for variances are regularly and routinely reported  
to the Board. Appropriate action is taken where variances arise.
Risk management
Specialists within the Risk and Insurance Department monitor 
developments and ensure compliance with legislative and 
regulatory requirements, including the Turnbull Guidelines. A 
comprehensive risk management programme is monitored and 
developed by the Risk Committee, the members of which include 
key operational managers. Through a programme of assessment, 
appropriate measures and systems of control are maintained. 
Detailed contingency plans are in place for all key sites and these 
are regularly tested. 
Capital expenditure and investments 
Procedures exist and authority levels are documented to ensure 
that capital expenditure is properly appraised and authorised. 
Cases for all investment projects are reviewed and approved at 
divisional level. Major investment projects are subject to approval  
by the Board.
Centralised treasury function 
All cash payments and receipts are managed by centralised finance 
functions within each of the operating companies. Weekly reporting 
of cash balances to the Group Finance Department ensures the 
position of the Group as a whole, is properly controlled.
Quality and integrity of staff 
The suitability of staff is determined through rigorous 
recruitment procedures. Management continuously monitors 
training requirements and annual appraisal procedures are  
in place to ensure that required standards are maintained. 
Resource requirements are identified by managers and 
reviewed by the relevant national Executive Committee.
Internal audit
The Group has an internal audit function led by the Group Internal 
Audit Manager who reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee.
The Board, acting through the Audit Committee, has directed the 
work of Internal Audit towards those areas of the business that are 
considered to be of the highest risk. The Committee approves a 
rolling audit programme ensuring that all significant areas of the 
business are independently reviewed within a three-year period. 
The programme and the findings of the reviews are continually 
assessed to ensure they take account of the latest information 
and, in particular, the results of the annual review of internal 
control. The effectiveness of the Internal Audit Department  
and the Group’s risk management programme are reviewed 
annually by the Audit Committee.

Remuneration Committee and advisors
The Remuneration Committee received external advice from 
Linklaters.
Other Directors and employees of the Group who provided material 
advice or services to the Committee during the year were:
Ron Sandler Chairman
Stephen Benadé Group Company Secretary 
Tim Way Group HR Director
Peter Ogden Non-Executive Director
Philip Hulme Non-Executive Director
The Committee takes into account comparative practice in the 
European technology sector, FTSE 250 companies and FTSE  
small caps.
Remuneration policy 
The Committee makes recommendations and determines 
remuneration policy on the Board’s behalf. No Director is involved 
in deciding his own remuneration. The Executive Directors 
determine the fees for Non-Executive Directors that reflect the 
time commitment and responsibilities of their roles, and the 
Committee is responsible for determining the appropriate policy 
for rewarding the Group’s Executive Directors and senior 
management. 
In implementing its policy, the Committee has given full 
consideration to the Principles of the Combined Code with regard 
to Executive Director remuneration, and is satisfied that it has 
complied with best practice provisions in this matter. In particular, 
the following objectives have been addressed:
to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors with the 
qualities required to run the Group successfully;
to reward Executive Directors through remuneration 
arrangements that are competitive but not excessive;
to provide Executive Directors with an incentive for the 
development and performance of the Group in the best  
interest of shareholders; and
to ensure that a significant proportion of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is structured such that rewards are linked to 
corporate and individual performance. 
The policy is designed to ensure that a significant proportion  
of the total remuneration is dependent upon personal and  
Group performance and aligns the interests of executives  
and shareholders. This is achieved through a combination of  
fixed and variable payments, benefits, share option schemes and the 
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’). The latter two total remuneration  
elements are referred to collectively as Equity schemes.

Basic salary and benefits
In seeking to ensure that the basic salary and benefits for each 
Executive Director are appropriate and competitive, relevant  
external market data, as well as pay and conditions in the Group 
generally, are taken into consideration. The Chairman makes 
recommendations to the Committee in respect of the two other 
Executive Directors, based upon this information, together with an 
assessment of their individual performance against specific financial 
and non-financial goals, and the performance of the Group as a 
whole. Cliff Preddy, as Committee Chairman, is responsible for an 
equivalent process in respect of Ron Sandler’s remuneration.
Performance-related bonus scheme 
Mike Norris and Tony Conophy participate in annual performance-
related bonus schemes. 40% of the award is linked to the financial 
performance of the Group against a pre-agreed target, with the 
balance related to the achievement of specific personal objectives 
agreed with each of them for the year by the Chairman, and approved 
by the Committee. Performance conditions are relevant, challenging 
and designed to enhance shareholder value. For 2006, the maximum 
levels of bonus were 75% of base salary and Mike Norris earned 
£144,900 (2005: £100,125) and Tony Conophy £97 ,875 (2005: 
£100,800). Following a review by the Remuneration Committee, the 
maximum levels of bonuses for 2007 will be 75% of base salary.
Equity schemes
Performance Share Plan
This plan now operates as the Company’s main long-term incentive 
scheme for senior employees. The Executive Directors received 
rewards under this plan during 2006 and these awards were 
subject to performance criteria as detailed below.
The 2006 PSP performance target was based on the Group’s 
annual adjusted earning per share (‘EPS’) growth in relation to the 
retail price index (‘RPI’) and measured over a three year period. No 
shares subject to awards will vest if cumulative annual growth is 
less than RPI plus 3%. One quarter of the shares will vest at RPI 
plus 3%. Awards will vest in full if the Group’s cumulative annual 
growth is at or above RPI plus 7 .5%. If the Group’s EPS growth over 
the period is between 3% and 7 .5% above RPI, awards will vest on 
a straight line basis. There will be no retesting of the performance 
target. Awards under the PSP during 2007 will be subject to the 
same performance criteria.
EPS has been chosen as a performance measure that is a widely 
used and transparent yardstick. EPS is calculated on a pre-
exceptional, diluted basis.

Note: The Chairman is ineligible for a bonus award. 31. Computacenter plc Annual report & accounts 2006
The maximum value of shares that can be awarded under the plan 
to an employee in a financial year is 1x base salary. This limit can be 
exceeded in exceptional circumstances up to an absolute maximum 
of 2x base salary. Awards made to the Executive Directors will be in 
the range of 0.75 to 1x base salary. 
Share options
The Executive Directors have historically been awarded executive 
share options under the Company’s share option schemes. As the 
PSP is the main long-term incentive scheme, no such options were 
granted to the Executive Directors in 2006, although some grants 
were made to senior employees. Since 1998, these awards have 
ordinarily been subject to certain performance conditions that are 
challenging and designed to produce significant and sustained 
improvements in the Group’s underlying financial performance. The 
details of the various performance conditions relating to grants are 
set out in the table of Directors’ interests in share options on page 
33. Should the conditions not be met, options will lapse. 
The Computacenter Employee Share Option Scheme 1998 is due 
to expire early next year. The Remuneration Committee considered 
the current reward structure and is intending to introduce a renewed 
executive share option scheme, subject to shareholder approval  
at the 2007 AGM. The PSP will remain the preferred annual long-
term incentive scheme, but the Remuneration Committee wishes  
to retain the flexibility to grant employees options in appropriate 
circumstances, such as in countries where associated tax 
advantages apply.
It is intended that the performance conditions will be aligned  
to the recently approved PSP and will vest on a straight line  
basis. The performance conditions are based on EPS since the 
Remuneration Committee believes that there are insufficient 
comparable organisations to create a meaningful comparator  
group, for the purpose of assessing performance conditions 
based on total shareholder return.
The proposed option scheme constitutes a renewal of the previous 
scheme operated by the Company. The changes that have been 
made are designed to further align the scheme with ABI guidelines. 
The maximum number of options that can be awarded under the 
scheme will remain 3x base salary, although this can be exceeded 
in exceptional circumstances. Should grants be made to Executive 
Directors, a maximum of 1.25x base salary will remain the  
Company guideline.
Further grants of share options will be made in appropriate 
circumstances only, since the approved PSP will continue  
to be the main long-term incentive scheme for senior employees.
Pension
Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Computacenter 
Pension Scheme, a defined contribution salary sacrifice scheme 
available to all employees under which a maximum annual 
Company contribution of £3,710 per employee is payable. The 
maximum Company contribution was reviewed during 2006. It was 
decided that this maximum contribution should be increased to 
£5,400 per employee from January 2007 . The scheme also allows 
employees to make additional salary sacrifices, which the Company 
may contribute to the scheme on their behalf. The amounts of such 
additional salary sacrifices are shown as Company contributions in 
excess of the £3,710 limit in the table of Directors’ remuneration on 
page 32. Mike Norris and Tony Conophy participate in the scheme.
Directors’ contracts
All Executive Directors have a rolling 12 month service contract with 
the Company, which is subject to 12 months’ notice by either the 
Company or the Director. 
No contractual arrangements are in place that guarantee additional 
payments upon termination of employment by the Company. All 
service contracts provide for summary termination in the event of 
gross misconduct.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company. They each operate under a letter of appointment that 
sets out their terms, duties and responsibilities. Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial term which runs to the 
conclusion of the third Annual General Meeting following their 
appointment and may be renewed at that point for a further  
three-year term. 
All Directors must offer themselves for re-election by shareholders  
in general meeting at least every three years, in accordance with  
the Company’s Articles of Association.

technology systems.
Business Review
A description of the Group’s activities and certain key performance 
indicators are contained within pages 2 to 5. The development  
of the Group’s business, together with an indication of future 
developments, are included in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 
6 to 7 , the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 8 to 13 and the 
Finance Director’s Review on pages 20 to 23. Details of some

Results and dividends
The Group’s activities resulted in a pre-exceptional profit before  
tax of £38.0 million (2005: £35.7 million). The Group profit for the 
year available to shareholders amounted to £18.9 million (2005:

The Directors recommend a final dividend for the year of £7 .9 million 
(2005: £9.4 million). Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the 
year in which they are paid, or in the case of a final dividend, when 
approved by the shareholders. As such, the amount recognised in 
the 2006 accounts, as described in note 10, is made up of last 
year’s final dividend and the interim dividend of this year.
The final ordinary dividend for 2006 if approved, will be paid

Ormerod, having been appointed since the last Annual General 
Meeting, will also retire and offer themselves for election.

force at the date of this report.
A resolution to renew the authority is to be put to the 2007

Creditors payment policy 
The Group does not hold any trade creditor balances. However, it is 
the policy of the Group that each of the businesses should agree 
appropriate terms and conditions with suppliers (ranging from 
standard written terms to individually negotiated contracts) and that 
payment should be in accordance with those terms and conditions, 
provided that the supplier has also complied with them. 35. Computacenter plc Annual report & accounts 2006
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies are 
discussed in the Finance Director’s Review on pages 20 to 23 and 
in note 23 to the accounts.
Employee share schemes 
The Company operates executive share option schemes and a 
performance-related option scheme for the benefit of employees. 
During the year, 2,819,600 options over ordinary shares of 6p were 
granted under the executive share option schemes (2005: nil). At the 
year end options remained outstanding under these schemes in 
respect of a total of 7 ,272,724 ordinary shares of 6p each (2005: 
7 ,881,153 ordinary shares). During the year, options over 629,200 
shares were exercised and options over 2,798,829 shares lapsed. 
The Company also operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) to 
incentivise employees. During the year 1,571,604 ordinary shares  
of 6p were awarded under the PSP (2005: nil). At the year end 
1,553,938 shares remained outstanding, under this scheme and 
37 ,666 awards had lapsed.
In addition, the Company continues to operate a Sharesave scheme for 
the benefit of employees. At the year end, 2,569,669 (2005: 3,309,941) 
options granted under the Sharesave scheme remained outstanding.
During the year, the Company has remained within its headroom 
limits for the issue of new shares for employee share plans as 
required in the rules of the plans, specifically the 5% in 10 years limit 
for discretionary plans and the 10% in 10 years for all share plans. 
Corporate social responsibility
The Board recognises that acting in a socially responsible way 
benefits the community, our customers, shareholders, the 
environment and employees alike. A wide variety of initiatives and 
measures are underway to ensure the Group continues to develop 
in a socially responsible way. 
Health, safety and environment
It remains the policy of the Group that each business maintains  
the high standards necessary to safeguard the health and safety  
of its employees, customers, contractors and the public. This 
commitment is formally contained in the Health and Safety Policy 
Statement, which is available from the Company’s website at 
www.computacenter.com/corporate-responsibility or upon request. 
The Group’s Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Department 
monitors and reviews all procedures and policies, utilising the 
advice of external consultants, where necessary, in order to ensure 
the management systems comply with current legal requirements. 
The health, safety and environment management systems are 
registered with UVDB and Verify with annual audits conducted to 
ensure conformance. The environment management system (EMS) 
additionally remains ISO 14001:2004 certified with the BSI 
conducting bi-annual audits at all key locations. 
Computacenter enhanced its commitment to the environment by 
launching a ‘Green IT Advisory Service’ in January 2007 . This service 
provides various innovative offerings including an energy efficiency 
audit of a company’s current IT environment, configuration services  
to achieve minimum energy consumption and advice on the 
environmental lifecycle implications of a typical desktop system. In 
addition, under this service Computacenter will offer ‘carbon neutral’ 
delivery, and offer services from its IT re-marketing and disposal 
subsidiary company RDC. Both Computacenter and RDC have 
committed to offset carbon emissions generated by their operations 
for any PC purchased through the Green IT Advisory Service.
Employee involvement
Computacenter remains committed to involving all employees in 
matters which affect their work and working environment, primarily 
through team briefings where managers are tasked with ensuring that 
information sharing, discussion and feedback happen on a regular 
basis as part of their core responsibilities as leaders. Employee 
Consultative Forums exist in each country to consult staff on major 
issues affecting employment and matters of policy. Should there be 
trans-national issues to discuss, a facility exists to engage a European 
Forum made up of representatives from country Forums. 
Employee opinion surveys are conducted every two to three years  
in the UK, Germany and France by external research companies, to 
seek employees’ views on a wide range of subjects. Programmes of 
work resulting from the feedback are agreed at country level and 
executed locally involving both management and employees. The  
HR Director is responsible for ensuring actions are completed and 
properly communicated across the business.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to equal opportunities, monitoring and 
regularly reviewing policies and practices to ensure that it meets current 
legislative requirements as well as Computacenter’s own internal 
standards. No employee or potential employee receives less favourable 
treatment or consideration on grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, 
gender, age, disability, sexual orientation or marital status. The Group  
is committed to make full use of the talents and resources of all its 
employees and to provide a healthy environment that encourages 
good and productive working relationships within the organisation. 
Policies dealing with equal opportunities are in place in all parts of the 
Group, which take account of the Group’s overall commitment and also 
addresses local regulatory requirements. The HR Department monitors 
and reports to the Board on developments in regulation and practice in 
the various jurisdictions where the Group companies operate, thereby 
ensuring that appropriate action can be taken to ensure compliance.
Performance and personal development
The Group is committed to the development of its employees through 
a regular performance review process. Managers are responsible for 
setting and reviewing personal objectives aligned to corporate and 
functional goals, reviewing performance against behavioural standards 
appropriate to job level, agreeing appropriate training and development 
interventions, and discussing career aspirations. The Group Executive 
Committee has overall responsibility for monitoring management 
development and ensuring that the required skills are available to meet 
the current and future management needs of the Group. At divisional 
and functional level, review processes exist to ensure that there is 
breadth and depth of management talent throughout the business. 
Each year, approximately 2.5% of the Group’s salary expense is spent  
on technical training and skills development. Computacenter’s reward 
strategy is reviewed regularly and continues to emphasise performance-
related pay, particularly for more senior managers, with bonus payments 
aligned to financial performance.
In 2005, the UK business was awarded Investors in People status.  36. Computacenter plc Annual report & accounts 2006
Directors’ report continued
Workplace
International human rights obligations and international employment 
laws are met through a broad range of policies across the Group. 
These ensure that, for example, employees are not subject to 
discrimination, arbitrary or unjust dismissal or unjust application of 
wage rates. Appropriate employee benefit programmes exist across 
the Group.
Business ethics
An ethics policy is operated by the Group, which includes a 
requirement for all employees to report abuses or non-conformance 
with the policy (‘whistle-blowing’). This policy commits 
Computacenter employees to the highest standards of ethical 
behaviour in respect of customers, suppliers, colleagues and other 
stakeholders in the business.
Community relations and charity activities
The Group supports community and charitable projects as part of  
its commitment to corporate social responsibility and encourages its 
employees to support such projects. It also organises and supports 
ad-hoc charitable fundraising events. In addition, the donation of IT 
equipment to schools and other charitable causes is a feature of the 
Group’s recycling programmes. In 2006 the Group made charitable 
donations amounting to £61,000.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in business for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable company law 
and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year which present fairly the financial position of the 
Company and of the Group and the results and cash flows of the 
Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures being disclosed and 
explained in the accounts; and
prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group or Company will continue 
in its business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and hence taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that:
to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no 
information relevant to the preparation of their report of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
each Director has taken all steps a director might reasonably be 
expected to have taken, to be aware of relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s.234ZA of the Companies Act 1985. 
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and a resolution approving the re-appointment of Ernst & 
Young LLP as the Company’s auditor will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

• 37. Computacenter plc Annual report & accounts 2006
We have audited the Group financial statements of Computacenter 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance  
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 29. 
These Group financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial 
statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 
2006 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions  
we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report  
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set  
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements  
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial 
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not 
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures  
or its risk and control procedures.
Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of Computacenter plc
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s 
Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, Risk Management Report, 
Finance Directors Review, Corporate Governance Statement, the 
Directors’ Report and the unaudited part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements.  
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the Group 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union,  
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006  
and of its profit for the year then ended; 
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation; and
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with  
the Group financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2006
1  Authorisation of financial statements and statement  
of compliance with IFRS
The consolidated financial statements of Computacenter plc for  
the year ended 31 December 2006 were authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 12 March 2007 . The 
balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJ Norris and 
FA Conophy. Computacenter plc is a limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly traded.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted 
by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2006 and applied in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling and 
all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except when 
otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of Computacenter plc and its subsidiaries as at  
31 December each year. The financial statements of subsidiaries 
are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, 
using existing GAAP in each country of operation. Adjustments  
are made to translate any differences that may exist between the 
respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and 
profit and losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are 
recognised in assets, have been eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group 
obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on 
which the Group no longer retains control. 
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net 
assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and are 
presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance 
sheet, separately from parent shareholders’ equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
 
Freehold buildings 25–50 years 
Short leasehold improvements  shorter of 7 years and period to 
expiry of lease
Fixtures and fittings
 – Head office 5–15 years
 – Other  shorter of 7 years and period to 
expiry of lease
Office machinery, computer  
 hardware  2–15 years
Motor vehicles 3 years
Freehold land is not depreciated. An item of property, plant and 
equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use  
of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset 
(calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income 
statement in the year the item is de-recognised. 
 
Leases
Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group 
substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the 
leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair 
value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned 
between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so 
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance  
of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and 
benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Intangible assets
Software and software licences
Software and software licences includes computer software that is 
not integral to a related item of hardware. These assets are stated at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value. 
Amortisation is calculated on straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful life of four years.
The carrying values of software and software licences are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the 
estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down  
to their recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried 
initially at cost. Following initial recognition, the historic cost model  
is applied; with intangible assets being carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are 
amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives 
with charges included in administrative expenses.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill
Business combinations on or after 1 January 2004 are 
accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method. Any 
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as 
goodwill and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair 
value of the acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment,  
a gain is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Goodwill recognised on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004,  
the date of transition to IFRS, is recorded at its amortised cost at 
transition to IFRS and is no longer amortised. Any goodwill asset 
arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included 
within the cost of those entities. 43. Computacenter plc Annual report & accounts 2006
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being 
reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value  
may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the 
related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at 
business segment level or statutory company level as the case may 
be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is 
less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss 
is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit 
is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal 
of the unit, or of an operation within it. Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 remains set off directly 
against reserves even if the related investment becomes impaired  
or the business is disposed of.
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an 
indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.  
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-
generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and 
is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of  
an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing 
operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense 
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Investment in an associate
The Group’s interest in its associate was accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting. The associate is an entity over which 
the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary 
nor a joint venture. The financial statements of the associate were 
used by the Group to apply the equity method. The reporting dates 
of the associate and the Group were identical. As is the case with 
the Group’s subsidiaries, the associate prepared its accounts under 
local GAAP . These were then converted into IFRS during the 
consolidation process of the Group.
The investment in the associate was carried in the Group’s balance 
sheet at cost plus its share of the post-acquisition changes in the 
net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any 
impairment in value. The Group’s income statement reflected its 
share of the results, after tax, of operations of the associate. Where 
there was a change recognised directly in the associate’s equity, the 
Group recognised its share of any changes and discloses this in its 
Statement of Changes in Equity.
Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised at their fair value, which initially 
equates to the consideration given plus directly attributable 
transaction costs associated with the investment.
Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost  
and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete 
or slow moving items. Costs include those incurred in bringing 
each product to its present location and condition, on a first-in, 
first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make  
the sale.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30–90 day terms, are 
recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance 
for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is 
made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. 
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is 
assessed as being remote.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise  
cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an  
original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash  
and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts where a right  
of set-off exists.
Interest-bearing borrowings 
All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly 
attributable transaction costs. Borrowing costs are recognised  
as an expense when incurred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or 
part of a group of similar financial assets) is de-recognised where:
the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, 
but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material 
delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under  
the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its 
risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. From 1 January 
2005 the forward contracts are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently re-
measured at fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of 
forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current 
forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is 
positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge 
accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its 
inception. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the 
hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and 
how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such 
hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the 
fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or
cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash 
flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with 
a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward 
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly 
to the income statement.
Foreign currency translation
The Group’s presentation currency is Pounds Sterling (£). Each 
entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items 
included in the financial statements of each entity are measured 
using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional 
currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All 
differences are taken to the consolidated income statement. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the 
date of initial transaction. 
The functional currencies of the overseas subsidiaries are Euro (€) 
and US Dollar (US$). As at the reporting date, the assets and 
liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the 
presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated 
at the average exchange rates for the year. Since 1 January 2004, 
the date of transition to IFRS, exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation are taken directly to a separate component of equity. 
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount 
recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in the income statement. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be  
made of the amount of the obligation. 
•
•
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash-flows at a pre-
tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Taxation 
Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the 
amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following 
exceptions:
where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future; and 
deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or 
tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an 
undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when 
the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates 
and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to 
items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax 
is recognised in the income statement.
VAT
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount 
of VAT except:
where the VAT incurred on a purchase of goods and services is 
not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the VAT 
is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as 
part of the expense item as applicable; and
trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT 
included.
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation 
authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
balance sheet.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates given to 
customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty. The following specific 
recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Product
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on 
dispatch of goods.
Professional services
Revenue is recognised when receivable under a contract following 
delivery of a service or in line with the level of work completed.
Support and Managed Services
Contracted Managed Services revenue is recognised over the 
contract period on a straight-line basis, which represents the level of 
completion of an individual contract. The unrecognised contracted 
revenue is included as deferred income in the balance sheet. 
Amounts invoiced relating to more than one period are deferred  
and recognised over their relevant life.
Finance revenue
Revenue is recognised as interest accrues.
Dividends
Revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive payment  
is established.
Rental income
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for either 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or where the service is 
not provided on a straight-line basis revenue is recognised in line 
with the time pattern of the provision of the service. 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme available to all 
UK employees. Contributions are recognised as an expense in the 
income statement as they become payable in accordance with the 
rules of the scheme. There are no material pension schemes within 
the Group’s overseas operations.
Employee benefits
In accordance with IAS 19, the Group provides for accumulating 
absences. The cost is measured as the additional amount that the 
Group expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has 
accumulated at the balance sheet date. 
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income 
statement, those material items of income and expense which, 
because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better elements of financial 
performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior 
periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Share-based payment transactions 
Employees (including Executive Directors) of the Group can receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or 
rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they 
are granted. The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate 
valuation model, further details of which are given in note 25. In 
valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
performance conditions as none of the conditions set are market-
related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the 
date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award (‘vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting 
date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
Directors’ best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period 
represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period. As the schemes do not 
include any market-related performance conditions, no expense  
is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a 
minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, 
which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment 
arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had 
vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a 
new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled 
and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional 
share dilution in the computation of earnings per share (see note 10).
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-
transferable options to executives and senior employees. Shares  
in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as 
investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction 
from equity (see note 24).
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of 
IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 
only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that 
had not vested on or before 1 January 2005. 
Own shares held
Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classified in 
shareholders’ equity as ‘own shares held’ and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on  
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares. 46. Computacenter plc Annual report & accounts 2006

statements in the period of initial application. 
Upon adoption of IFRS 7 , the Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and the 
nature and extent of risks that they give rise to. More specifically the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and 
its risk exposure in greater detail. There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
3 Segmental analysis
The Group’s primary reporting format is geographical segments and its secondary format is business segments. The Group’s geographical 
segments are determined by the location of the Group’s assets and operations. The Group’s business in each geography is managed 
separately and held in separate statutory entities.
Each geographical business contains the following three business segments:
the Product segment supplies computer hardware and software to large and medium corporate and government customers and to  
other distributors. It includes the resale of 3rd party services for which the Group retains no risks or rewards post sale; and
the Professional Services segment provides technical and project management skills to enable customers in the corporate and 
government sectors to implement and integrate new technologies into their infrastructures; and
the Support and Managed Services segment provides an outsourcing service for specific areas of infrastructure management to 
customers in the corporate and government sectors.
The sale of goods is reported in the Product segment. The rendering of services is reported in the Professional Services and Support  
and Managed Services segments.
Transfer prices between geographical segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.  
The impact of inter-segment sales on operating profit by segment is not significant.
Geographical segments
The following tables present revenue, expenditure and certain asset information regarding the Group’s geographical segments for  
the years ended 31 December 2006 and 2005.

Forecast cash flows for Computacenter France no longer support the value of the non-current assets in the business, and accordingly a full 
impairment to these assets has been recognised at 31 December 2006.
Restructuring costs of £2,425,000 (2005: £1,675,000) were incurred during the year ended 31 December 2006. These principally relate to 
headcount reductions required to restructure the indirect cost base. The 2005 comparatives have been restated to classify these costs as 
exceptional items accordingly.

At 31 December 2006, there was no recognised or unrecognised deferred income tax liability (2005: £nil) for taxes that would be payable  
on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries as the Group has no liability to additional taxation should such amounts  
be remitted due to the availability of double taxation relief.
10 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by  
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the effect of dilutive options.

14 Impairment testing of goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to the cash-generating units Computacenter (UK) Limited and RD 
Trading Limited for impairment testing. These are the lowest level of cash-generating units that can be reliably and separately identified. 
No impairment provision has been required.
The recoverable amounts of Computacenter (UK) Limited and RD Trading Limited have been determined based on a value in use 
calculation. To calculate this, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year 
period. The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 12.0% (2004: 8.0%).

Key assumptions used in the value in use calculation for both Computacenter (UK) Limited and RD Trading Limited for 31 December 2006 
and 31 December 2005 are:
budgeted revenue – the basis used to determine the value assigned to the budgeted revenue is long-run market growth forecasts.
budgeted gross margins – the basis used to determine the value assigned to the budgeted gross margins is the average gross margins 
achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends.

Factor financing
Factor financing is in respect of trade debts factored without recourse which represents a proportion of the debts of the Group’s French 
subsidiary. Under the terms of the arrangement certain trade debts are sold to the factor who in turn advances cash payments in relation to 
these debts. Interest is charged on these amounts on a daily basis at a rate of ECB base rate +0.5%. The Group is not obliged (and does 
not intend) to support any losses arising from the assigned debts against which the cash has been advanced. In the event of default in 
payment of a debtor, the providers of finance seek repayment of cash advanced only from the remainder of the cash pool of debts in which 
they hold an interest. Repayment is not required from the Group in any other way. 
21 Obligations under leases

expenses on empty properties and the Directors’ best estimates of the likely time before the relevant leases can be reassigned or sublet, 
which ranges between 1 year and 10 years. The provisions in relation to the UK properties are discounted at a rate based upon the Bank  
of England base rate. Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based on Euribor.

above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The sterling floating rate assets and liabilities are based on the three month LIBOR rate. The euro floating rate assets and liabilities are based 
on the overnight Euribor rate.
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Fair values
The carrying value of the Group’s short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values. The fair value of all 
other financial instruments carried within the Group’s financial statements equates to their carrying amount.

Own shares held
Own shares held comprise the following:
i) Computacenter Employee Share Ownership Plan
Shares in the parent undertaking comprise 1,189,201 (2005: 1,427 ,042) 5p ordinary shares of Computacenter plc purchased by the 
Computacenter Employee Share Ownership Plan (‘the Plan’). The number of shares held represents 0.7% of the Company’s issued  
share capital.
None of these shares were awarded to executives of the Company under the Computacenter (UK) Limited Cash Bonus and Share Plan. 
Options previously awarded are to be held on behalf of employees and former employees of Computacenter (UK) Limited and their 
dependants, excluding Jersey residents. The distribution of these shares is dependant upon the trustee holding them on the employees’ 
behalf for a restrictive period of three years.
Since 31 December 2002 the definition of beneficiaries under the ESOP Trust has been expanded to include employees who have been 
awarded options to acquire ordinary shares of 6p each in Computacenter plc under the other employee share plans of the Computacenter 
Group, namely the Computacenter Services Group plc Approved Executive Share Option Plan, the Computacenter Employee Share Option 
Scheme 1998, the Computacenter Services Group plc Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, the Computacenter Performance 
Related Share Option Scheme 1998, the Computacenter Sharesave Plus Scheme and any future similar share ownership schemes. All 
costs incurred by the Plan are settled directly by Computacenter (UK) Limited and charged in the accounts as incurred.
The Plan Trustees have waived the dividends receivable in respect of 1,189,201 shares that it owns which are all unallocated shares. 
ii) Computacenter Qualifying Employee Share Trust (‘the QUEST’)
The total shares held are 761,548 (2005: 780,966). All of these shares will continue to be held by the Quest until such time as the Sharesave 
options granted against them are exercised. The market value of these shares at 31 December 2006 was £2,045,000. The Quest Trustees 
have waived dividends in respect of all of these shares. During the year the Quest used the proceeds from UK sharesave option exercises  
to subscribe for 334,654 new 6p ordinary shares and 262,018 new 5p ordinary shares.
iii) Computacenter Trustees Limited 
During the year no new awards of share allocations were made under the Computacenter Bonus Plus Share Plan. As at the year end date 
the total number of shares held by Computacenter Trustees Limited was 381,534 (2005: 457 ,841), all of which are unallocated shares. 
Dividends are waived in respect of unallocated shares.

overseas, all option exercises are satisfied by new share issues. During 2006, options over 4,455 shares were exercised by overseas 
employees and satisfied by new issue shares. The fair value of the options that were granted over the period to 31 December 2006 is 
£9,000 and is recognised as an expense in the income statement for the period (2005: £14,000).

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the recent historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily 
be the actual outcome.
No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
26 Capital commitments 
At 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005, all future contracted Group capital expenditure had been provided for.
27 Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans
The Group has a defined contribution pension plan, covering substantially all of its employees in the UK. The amount recognised as an 
expense for this plan is detailed in note 6.
28 Related party transactions
During the year the Group entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with related parties. Transactions entered into are as 
described below:
 
Biomni provides the Computacenter e-procurement system used by many of Computacenter’s major customers. An annual fee has been 
agreed on a commercial basis for use of the software for each installation. Total fees paid in the year to Biomni amounted to £618,000 
(2005: £342,000). Both PJ Ogden and PW Hulme are directors of and have a material interest in Biomni Limited. 
During the year, HelpByCom supplied services to the Group in the normal course of business totalling £nil (2005: £4,267 ,000). 
Terms and conditions of transactions with related parties
Sales to and purchases from related parties are made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions. Outstanding 
balances at the year end are unsecured and settlement occurs in cash. There have been no guarantees provided or received for any  
related party receivables. The Group has not recognised any provision for doubtful debts relating to amounts owed by related parties.  
This assessment is undertaken each financial year through examining the financial position of the related party and the market in which  
the related party operates. 
Compensation of key management personnel (including Directors)
Please refer to the information given in the Directors’ remuneration table in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 32 for details of 
compensation given to the Group’s key management personnel. There are no other key management personnel.
29 Post balance sheet event
On 4 January 2007 , Computacenter plc completed the acquisition of Digica Group from Bridgepoint Capital, Lyceum Capital (through  
its investment in Fox IT) and management shareholders. The consideration paid for Digica amounted to £15.9 million, in addition to which 
Computacenter settled assumed debt of £12.1 million, both of which were satisfied from cash reserves. The assessment of the fair value  
of assets acquired is in progress and yet to be finalised.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the Parent Company financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company, and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company, and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of 
Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 13. These 
Parent Company financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Parent Company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Parent Company 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the  
Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you 
whether in our opinion the information given in the Parent Company 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has  
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all  
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration  
and other transactions is not disclosed.
Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of Computacenter plc
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Parent Company 
financial statements. The other information comprises only 
Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, Risk Management 
Report, Finance Directors Review, Corporate Governance 
Statement, the Directors’ Report and the unaudited part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the Parent Company financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other 
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the Parent Company financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the Parent Company financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Parent Company financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Parent 
Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair  
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as  
at 31 December 2006; 
the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the Parent Company financial statements.

Notes to the Company financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2006
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as 
permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. The profit after 
tax for the Company was £79,553,000 (2005: £17 ,261,000 loss).
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS 1 5(a) and 
consequently no cash flow statement is presented for the Company.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 
3C of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation 
and has not disclosed information required by paragraphs 51 to 95 
of that standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, 
in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures 
for the Group under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation  
and Disclosure.
Intellectual property
Licences purchased in respect of intellectual property are 
capitalised, classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet 
and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the license.
Depreciation of fixed assets
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all 
other tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, 
less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected 
useful life, as follows: 
Freehold buildings 50 years 
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for 
impairment.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling  
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that 
such assets or liabilities are covered by forward exchange contracts. 
In such cases the contracted rates are used. All differences are 
taken to the profit and loss account.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Executive Directors) of the Group can receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or 
rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they 
are granted. The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate 
valuation model, further details of which are given in note 25 of the 
Group’s accounts. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account 
is taken of any performance conditions, as none of the conditions 
set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the 
date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award (‘vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting 
date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
Directors’ best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period 
represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as 
at the beginning and end of that period. As the schemes do not 
include any market-related performance conditions, no expense  
is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a 
minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, 
which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment 
arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it  
had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a 
new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled 
and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-
transferable options to executives and senior employees. Shares  
in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as 
investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction 
from equity (see note 24 of the Group’s accounts).
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 
20 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only 
to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had 
not vested on or before 1 January 2005. 
Taxation
Corporation Tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current 
tax rate. Where group relief is surrendered from other subsidiaries  
in the Group, the Company is required to pay to the surrendering 
company an amount equal to the loss surrendered multiplied by  
the current tax rate. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or  
a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance 
sheet date with the exception that deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is 
more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from 
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can  
be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.

Notes:
1.  The results shown in the table have not been restated under adopted IFRS. The principal adjustments that would be required to restate the UK GAAP results to adopted 
IFRS would be: the cessation of goodwill amortisation and provision of intangible asset amortisation; inclusion of the pension deficit; additional equity-settled share-based 
payments expense; the joint venture presentational adjustment which presents joint venture taxation and interest within operating profit; and the cessation of accruing for 
proposed dividends.
2.  Adjusted operating profit is adjusted for integration & restructuring costs (2007), profit on Richmond property disposal (2006), amortisation of intangible assets 
(2007, 2006, 2005), impairment of goodwill (2006), joint venture net financing costs and taxation (2007, 2006, 2005), and amortisation of goodwill (2004, 2003). 
Basic adjusted earnings per share are also adjusted for the post taxation effects of these items.
3. Under adopted IFRS the final proposed dividend was not included as a liability in the Balance sheet, in accordance with ‘IAS 10 – Events after the Balance Sheet Date’.

The health and social care environment
Care UK’s reputation for innovation is partly founded on the development of new models of 
care, which increasingly span the interface between health and social care. This understanding 
of the health and social care spectrum places Care UK in a unique position in today’s markets.
Health care
C  Care UK has been very successful in winning centrally procured contracts 
in the first stages of the government’s inclusion of the independent sector in 
the provision of care to NHS patients. As the balance is now moving to local 
procurement by Strategic Health Authorities and Primary Care Trusts, this 
will play to Care UK’s breadth of knowledge and experience of working in 
partnership at a local level with the public sector.
C  Patient choice, exercised at the point of referral, will mean that the public will be 
able to choose to use our facilities – whether it be for a hip replacement, a scan 
or an endoscopy. 
C  Care UK has an excellent infection control record. 
C  Department of Health patient satisfaction surveys consistently rank our 
Independent Sector Treatment Centres at the upper end of the top 20% 
of NHS Hospitals.
The Government White Paper ‘Our health, our care, our 
say’ published in January 2006, set out the objective of 
transferring an increasing amount of care from hospitals to 
the community. In addition to reducing waiting times, the 
increased government spend on health care has led to the 
wider use of technology and higher public expectations. 
The powerful combination of expected demographic changes, 
significant advances in medical technology and greater 
personal autonomy promises to revolutionise how and 
where people are treated. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 3
Social care
Care UK has been a key player in the development of 
person-centred, outcome-based care at a national level. 
We provide residential care, home care and support for 
a wide range of conditions and individuals. Whether it 
be care for older people or children or those with learning 
disabilities or mental health conditions, we take a personal 
approach in supporting all service users.
C  Service users are becoming more closely involved in decisions about their 
own care and will increasingly choose how to spend an individualised 
budget or their own funds. This creates an opportunity for Care UK with 
our established track record of more personalised care.
C  We take quality very seriously – in our care homes this means a clinical 
governance team dealing with issues including falls, medicines 
management, infection control and dignity for older people. 
C  In some cases the combination of specialist nurses, supported by care 
workers, has enabled people who have previously been in long-term 
hospital care to be cared for at home amongst their families.
C  Over time there will be an increasing trend towards the new policy direction 
of individualised budgets and self-payment. Care UK is ideally placed to 
respond to this change. 4 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
This has been a year of excellent performance for Care UK with an increase 
in adjusted profit before tax of 28% to £20.1m (2006: £15.7m) and 
significant progress in advancing the company’s position as an important 
partner for public sector services.
Revenue, including share of joint venture revenue, increased by 38% 
to £275.7m (2006: £199.4m) and adjusted basic earnings per share were 
up by over 22% to 26.26p (2006: 21.47p). Total basic earnings per share 
were 20.27p (2006: 18.02p).
Progress in the group’s Social Care services has continued to be strong, 
with an improvement in operating profit of 17%. The nature of the Social 
Care market and Care UK’s focus on operational excellence and service 
development combine to create a solid platform for continued organic 
progress and potential for further acquisitive growth. 
Care UK has continued to pursue its strategy to position itself as key 
provider of Health Care services on behalf of the NHS and the acquisition 
of Mercury Health during the year was an important step. Our immediate 
focus continues to be to conclude agreement on current “Wave 2” 
preferred bidder appointments.

Chairman’s statement Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 5
Whilst we are disappointed that the West Midlands Diagnostics contract 
is to be terminated, this is clearly a specific issue relating to changes in 
local capacity requirements. Further details on the impact of this are set 
out in the Financial review. 
Care UK considers that the growing demand for healthcare and the 
transition to a market of NHS partner providers is inexorable and that 
the resulting scale of opportunity could be significant for the group.
employees
Care UK and, moreover, the many people that benefit from our support 
rely absolutely on the dedication and professionalism of our employees. 
Care UK continues to invest in the development of skills and leadership 
to ensure that the group is at the forefront of market developments 
and that service provision is both excellent and consistent. On behalf 
of our customers, shareholders and the board I would like to thank our 
employees for their continuing outstanding commitment and performance.
Dividend
The board is recommending a final dividend of 2.80p per share, giving a 
total dividend for the year of 4.02p (2006: 3.65p per share), an increase of 
10%. The final dividend will be paid on 11 February 2008 to shareholders 
on the register on 11 January 2008. This increase is in line with the previously 
stated policy of growing dividends ahead of inflation whilst maintaining 
a level of earnings cover consistent with the group’s growth objectives. 
Dividend cover in 2007 is 6.5 times, measured against adjusted earnings 
(2006: 5.9 times).
outlook
Care UK has established a firm business foundation with excellent visibility 
of future earnings through long-term contracts, a high level of income 
guarantees and the inherent continuity of essential services. The group’s 
financial strength is further underpinned by strong cash flows and the 
value of its property assets.
We believe that Care UK continues to be well placed within its chosen 
markets and the scale, quantity and range of opportunities for both 
organic and acquisitive growth are compelling. The board is, therefore, 
confident that Care UK will maintain its strong performance during the 
coming years.

Chief Executive’s report
social care
The group’s Social Care activities comprise the Residential Care, 
Community Care and Specialist Care divisions, which are commented 
on individually below.
residential care 
market overview and strategy 
The strategy for Residential Care continues to focus on a specialist range 
of services, principally for older people, with particular emphasis on 
rehabilitation and complex needs. The division has a strong asset base of 
care homes that have either been constructed by the group or transferred 
to us by Local Authorities. A key characteristic of this division is that 74% 
of the 3,087 beds are contracted for the long term by public sector 
commissioners. This business model provides a high degree of income 
visibility and, therefore, resilience for the group. 
Our strategic perspective, which is supported by the Government and Local 
Authorities, is that people with moderate needs are best cared for in their 
own home with residential intermediate care, rehabilitation and respite 
care support provided as necessary. The focus of the Residential Care 
C  We provide 24-hour care for over 3,000 older 
people in 56 nursing and residential homes, 
and daycare centres
C  We provide over six million hours of care per year 
in people’s own homes
C  We care for over 1,000 service users within 
our Specialist Care division
C  We deliver over 117,000 patient episodes per 
year within Health Care
delivering Activity Based Care (ABC) is a genuinely 
original style of residential care within 
which the achievements of our residents 
are our own measure of success. ABC 
moves away from care as ‘doing for’ and 
managing dependency, towards a more 
creative, adaptable and beneficial ‘doing 
with’ approach. In our homes staff use 
their time creatively, working together 
with the residents on tasks such as 
setting tables, maintaining a vegetable 
garden or helping in the office. 
As we extend this programme we do so 
with increasing evidence of the positive 
effects that this can have on mental 
health conditions such as depression, 
confusion, anxiety and eating disorders. 
The effects of ABC on older people with 
dementia is often substantive. We have 
seen individuals who were limited at 
home by frailty or illness recover their 
lost confidence and freedom and start to 
take control of their own lives once again.
Activity-based care ABC at work in Forrester Court Nursing Home, London
Mrs. Morrison moved into Forrester Court 
thinking that her life of independence had come 
to an end. After much encouragement she told 
us that, long ago, she enjoyed knitting, but gave 
up frustrated by her deteriorating concentration 
and dexterity. Through trial and error (and a 
great deal of patience) we learnt how to knit 
with her, starting each stitch and tying each knot 
until Mrs. Morrison felt able to take the lead. 
Over the coming weeks and months Mrs. Morrison 
learnt how to knit again without help and taught 
several carers along the way. With her confidence 
returning she began to talk more fluently, reading 
newspapers and even playing table tennis. 
Recently, with the help of our carers, she began 
to prepare her own coffee, wash her pots and 
maintain her room. Mrs. Morrison now plays a 
lead role in the residents group where, through 
her own achievements, she is setting the example 
for everyone to follow. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 7
division is to develop such support services, working in conjunction with 
our Community Care division, as well as to provide residential care for 
higher acuity needs, including frail nursing, dementia care and a range 
of neurological rehabilitation services.

Residential Care has shown further good increases in both revenue (15%) 
and operating profit (13%), entirely from organic growth. As expected, 
the change in operating margin reflects the increase in the number of beds 
operated under management contracts with underlying margin increasing 
by around 0.3% year on year. Financial occupancy for the year was just 
over 97%, slightly higher than in the first half of the year, reflecting the 
build up of occupancy in newly commissioned homes. Average fee rates 
increased over the year from £579 per week to £602 per week, an increase 
of 4%.
Birchwoods, a new residential care facility in Newbury, West Berkshire,

Chief Executive’s report continued
In February 2007 we announced the award of a contract with Slough 
Borough Council for the provision of a 120-bed residential care facility, 
with 90 beds to be contracted for a minimum period of 15 years. This 
contract was signed in September 2007 and construction activity commenced 
in the same month. Services at this care home are expected to commence 
by summer 2009.
In February 2007 we also announced the award of a further management 
contract with the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea. This is a 21-year 
contract for 30 beds, out of a total of 60 beds at the care home, and services 
are now expected to commence early in 2008.
In Poole, our property development partner is awaiting the outcome 
of a hearing regarding the planning application submitted in relation to 
the preferred site for the proposed new care home for older people with 
dementia. Possible alternative sites continue to be sought. Meanwhile 
Care UK continues to manage the former council operated care home 
for Poole Borough Council and to provide daycare and homecare services, 
under a contract that commenced in April 2006. 
Care UK has initiated a new stream of growth through greenfield 
development homes, which will be targeted at both the private self-pay 
market as well as publicly funded residents. Construction commenced 
on the first such development, a brand new 120-bed care home in 
Chelmsford, in October 2007. This new facility will be financed on a 
leasehold basis in a partnership arrangement with a developer and is due 
to commence services in summer 2009. A number of other targeted 
regions have been identified for similar developments, which are also 
expected to be developed on a leasehold basis.
In Richmond, further to the disposal of the first surplus site in 2006, we 
are expecting to commence marketing of the second surplus site in late 
2007. The sale of this site is anticipated to generate a further one-off 
cash receipt.
We continue to see many opportunities for growth within Residential Care 
through a mix of new contracts, extensions of existing homes, targeted 
acquisitions and greenfield developments. 
Care UK works in 
partnership with 
over 150 Primary 
Care Trusts and  
Local Authorities Outcome-based care services
Outcome-based care is an innovative 
approach to social care commissioning 
which meets the objectives of national 
policy and achieves very positive results 
for the people who use our services.
Our approach to outcome-based care aims 
to provide flexibility and responsiveness 
by putting the service user at the centre 
of their care. We achieve this by discussing 
with them what they would like to 
achieve from the care, and when, and 
we make sure that our carers and the 
flexible programmes we put in place 
match the needs and requirements 
of our service users.
We then monitor and review each individual 
and their outcome-based care programme 
to ensure it is meeting objectives.
The benefits are:
C  Improved communication between 
service users and their carers
C  Better, more flexible and more 
relevant use of allocated time
C  The ability to bank time towards 
particular interests and activities
C Happier, more confident service users 
C  The development of relationships 
between service users and their 
carers, contributing to continuity 
sustainability and independence
C  Carers who feel more professionally 
and personally fulfilled, who enjoy 
increased variety in their work
C  A resulting contribution to staff 
retention and professional development
C Satisfied commissioners Outcome-based care services, Fleetwood, Lancashire
Margaret Skitteral, 81, has lived in Fleetwood 
nearly all her life. She has severe learning disabilities 
and no living relatives, which has left her isolated 
and with little self-confidence. She was referred 
to Care UK by Social Services in July 2006, after 
suffering a fracture to her left arm. Care UK 
carers help her with household chores as well 
as facilitating a more independent lifestyle. 
Margaret’s care package was initially planned to 
be for ten days only. However, after a review it 
was decided to provide her with a longer term 
outcome-based care package designed to build 
her confidence, get her out of the house and 
ultimately empower her to lead as fulfilling a life 
as possible. As a result Margaret enjoys a greater 
involvement in the local community, attending 
coffee mornings and going to the bank and 
Post Office. Other positive outcomes have included 
a trip to see the Blackpool illuminations, visiting 
memorable places from her life before she became 
housebound and making use of what she calls 
“the book” – which contains labels of things that 
she buys regularly so she can go to the shops on 
her own and identify the right products.
As a result of outcome-based care Margaret is 
now in control of her own life, working with her 
carers, planning her daily activities and is more 
confident as a result. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 9
community care 
market overview and strategy
Community Care is focused on supporting people in their own homes, 
caring for older people and others with specialist needs. The division is 
now providing an annualised level of over six million hours of care per 
year. The vast majority of activity provides personal and domiciliary care 
commissioned by Local Authorities, with close to 70% purchased through 
‘block’ contracts. 
The strategy for Community Care continues to be to achieve a mix of 
organic growth, including growth from new contract wins, and acquisitions 
of businesses targeted in locations with sufficient population density and 
where the group does not currently have a presence.
The group is increasingly able to differentiate the Homecare business 
as a high quality service provider within a market that, whilst still highly 
fragmented, is subject to both increasing regulatory control and more 
sophisticated Local Authority procurement processes. In particular, Care UK 
is leading the development of services from a procurement model based 
solely on specified inputs, usually labour hours, to a value added outcomes 
approach, with service providers such as ourselves being empowered to 
focus on the individual needs of service users.
In addition, the alignment of Primary Care Trusts with Local Authorities is 
generating an emphasis for commissioners to consider greater utilisation 
of community-based services to deliver a more integrated health and social 
care solution.

During the year Community Care achieved strong growth in both revenue 
(28%) and operating profit (30%). Organic revenue growth for the year, 
at 8%, was similar to the level reported for the first half of the year. 
In line with our strategy of balancing organic growth with selective 
geographically targeted bolt-on acquisitions we acquired Access Homecare, 
St Andrews Villa (Homecare Services) and Homecare Services (Kent) in 
December 2006, April 2007 and June 2007 respectively. Access Homecare, 
based in Greater Manchester, provides around 8,500 hours per week of 
homecare, mainly under Local Authority block contracts. St Andrews Villa, 
based in Stoke-on-Trent, provides over 5,000 hours per week of homecare, 
principally under Local Authority block contracts. Homecare Services is 
based in Aylesford in Kent and is an important provider in the region, 
providing around 7,500 hours of care per week primarily to the Local 
Authority. The initial cash consideration paid for the three businesses 
amounted to £10.5m. Maximum additional consideration of £1.5m in 
aggregate is payable in respect of certain of these businesses over the next 
ten months, subject to the achievement of specific profit targets. 
During the year contracts were won or renewed in Bradford, Sheffield, 
Bracknell, Liverpool, Ealing, Oldham, Harrow and Stoke-on-Trent. We were 
pleased to have been awarded our first contract with the London Borough 
of Harrow, a 3-year contract for around 5,000 hours of personal homecare 
services per week to service users in the Borough. This is the largest single 
contract won by Community Care. As reported at the half-year these 
contract wins were balanced by the loss of a contract for around 2,000 
hours per week in Lambeth following the Council’s re-tendering of its 
homecare requirements.

health and social care Learning disabilities active care
Positive outcomes are the prime objective 
at Loch Park Adventure Centre in Moray, 
Scotland. Service users with learning 
disabilities are taught rural skills such 
as woodwork, masonry and craftwork, 
with the ultimate aim of providing them 
with the workplace and social skills they 
need to reach their full potential and 
contribute to the community in which 
they live.
The service at Loch Park is a day service, 
which in addition provides adventure-based 
activities to a wide range of groups with 
learning disabilities from all over the UK.
The work carried out by service users, 
which includes a tree nursery, contributes 
to the maintenance of the site and 
prepares them for paid or voluntary 
employment in various local businesses, 
all with excellent results. Loch Park services in action
Steven is 32 and has a mild learning and physical 
disability. He has been attending Loch Park twice 
a week for the past 17 years.
Through the help and support of the team at 
Loch Park Steven has learned how to face the 
challenges that life brings, from conducting 
himself in a work situation to moving away 
from his family home to live independently 
in his own house, supported by care workers.
Steven has worked at a garage in Elgin for 
the past 17 years where he fits tyres. Steven’s 
parents and the garage manager meet regularly 
with the team at Loch Park to monitor Steven’s 
progress and to discuss any issues that might 
arise. Through their input and the support of 
the Loch Park team, Steven continues to develop 
both at work and elsewhere in his life.
Steven is currently working towards an SVQ 
Level 1 Workstart Programme for Gardening 
Skills at Banff & Buchan College of Further 
Education. His SVQ training is supplemented 
by other skills introduced to him by Loch Park, 
including building new compost bins, making 
pathways, building a dam in a gorge walk and 
community work.
Loch Park has given Steven a reason to learn 
and to pursue meaningful work. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 11
The new services for outcome-based care in Lancashire and Peterborough 
are now becoming firmly established and are having a very positive impact 
on the lives of the service users concerned. Although the migration to 
service users having more direct influence on the design of their care 
service will inevitably take time, Care UK is establishing a strong reputation 
for innovation through this important market development.
Total homecare hours delivered during the year were 5.2m compared with 
4.0m in 2006, an increase on the previous year of 30%, with the weekly 
hours of care delivered at the year end being around 115,000 compared 
to 85,000 at the start of the year, an increase of 35%. 
Revenue in Community Care has grown by an average of 24% per annum 
over the past four years from a consistent mix of organic improvement 
and bolt-on acquisitions. We continue to see a strong pipeline of contract 
opportunities as well as a good mix of single-branch and regional businesses 
that would fit well with our acquisition strategy in the division.
specialist care 
market review and strategy
This division is focussed on specialist care services, purchased by Local 
Authorities and Primary Care Trusts, which are linked by psychiatric, therapeutic 
or social and behavioural needs and by business models often based on 
contracts for individuals rather than for establishments or block contracts. 
The specialist care areas of mental health, learning disabilities and 
children’s care are all expanding but remain fragmented with a high 
proportion of activity still provided by the public sector. Public sector 
commissioners increasingly are focussing on service outcomes, including 
education where appropriate, therapy and rehabilitation, together with 
migrating people to localised community based services wherever possible.

The nature of these services makes ongoing marketing and demand 
management an important aspect of the division’s operational focus. This 
demand management risk is significantly mitigated by one or both of two 
factors: firstly, the age and dependency profile most usually associated 
with service users in this division, which means that average lengths of stay 
will be longer than typical with care for older people, and secondly the 
high added value nature of the services provided means that average fee 
rates can be significantly higher than for long-term continuing care models.
A new management team has been appointed within this division during 
the year and we are now beginning to see the benefit. We are reviewing 
market opportunities for long-term sustainable growth and to evolve a 
more focussed Specialist Care division.

Specialist Care has delivered overall growth in both revenue and operating

of 4% and 13% from acquisitions made in the prior financial year. 
In mental health, revenue increased by 12% and operating profit by 13% 
compared with 2006. Most of this growth came from the annualisation 
effect of the acquisition of two independent hospitals in Greater Manchester in 
June 2006. The Althea Park specialist eating disorders service was re-configured 
during the year in response to increasing demand for self-harm services with 
a consequent improvement in occupancy levels in this part of the business. 
The performance of our learning disabilities business showed a very pleasing 
improvement with revenue increasing by 9% and operating profit up 20% 
over 2006, mainly as the result of contract wins achieved in the previous 
year. Services in Essex, an important area for this business, were re-tendered 
by the Local Authority during the year and we were very pleased to secure 
an increased share of the overall service provision, commencing in July 2007. 
Further new contracts in Cheshire and Stirling were won during the year, 
with services commencing after the year end. These contract wins are 
balanced by the expiry of a small contract in Argyll & Bute in the year.

Trading in our children’s care business benefited from two acquisitions 
made late in the previous financial year, driving revenue growth of 45%. 
The resulting profit improvement was delayed by the impact of occupancy 
build within new residential units and acquisition integration costs. 
However, with these issues now resolved, operating profit in the second 
half of the year increased by 26% compared with the equivalent period 
in 2006. The focus during this year has been to reorganise the service 
offering within children’s services to be more aligned with the needs 
of commissioners and the mix of urban and rural residential locations 
alongside central educational units, together with a more integrated 
foster care service.
Health care
market overview and strategy
The Health Care division was originally established to participate in the 
Department of Health’s (“DoH”) strategy to reform the provision of both 
primary and secondary care services. We believe that these service reforms 
will continue to provide a strong flow of opportunities for Care UK over 
the next few years. From a standing start in 2004, Care UK is now well 
established as a leading player in this emerging market. The acquisition of 
Mercury Health has brought substantial additional scale and expertise to 
this division resulting in the delivery of a much broader range of services 
to NHS patients.
Separate from the group’s own activities, Partnership Health Group 
(“PHG”), our 50% owned joint venture with Life Healthcare of South 
Africa, continues to remain focussed solely on Independent Sector 
Treatment Centres (“ISTCs”). 
In parallel, Care UK has successfully bid for primary care contracts procured 
both centrally by the DoH and locally by Primary Care Trusts (“PCTs”). These 
contracts include GP practices and walk-in centres, urgent care and “out 
of hours” GP services, specialist clinical assessment and diagnostic services 
and prison healthcare. Strategically we expect that local procurement by 
PCTs will be the main channel for future growth in this area.
As models of healthcare shift from an emphasis on hospital treatment to 
primary care delivered in community settings or at home, our Health Care 
strategy is to develop a range of services across the acute hospital and 
primary care continuum. We are encouraged by the policy direction being 
taken through the review of the NHS being led by Lord Darzi and the 
related recent announcement of a planned national procurement of 100 
health centres and 150 new general practices targeted to address specific 
areas in the UK where inequality in the provision of health care services 
currently exists.

Since the acquisition of Mercury Health in April 2007, the Health Care 
business has been organised around the three service line groupings of 
Primary Care, Secondary Care and Diagnostics. Mercury Health has now  14 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Chief Executive’s report continued
The Secondary Care business comprises the four operational ISTCs that 
form the GC8 “Wave 1” contract acquired with Mercury Health together 
with the group’s 50% share of PHG. The GC8 centres in Portsmouth, 
Medway and High Wycombe are all well established and are providing 
good levels of service under their respective contracts as well as delivering 
the level of financial return anticipated at the time of the acquisition. 
We are now working with local commissioners to develop a broader range 
of services at these sites. As an example, the Portsmouth centre has recently 
commenced a diabetic retinopathy service that was not originally provided 
for under the GC8 contract.
The mid-Sussex Orthopaedic Treatment Centre at Haywards Heath opened 
in June 2006 under Mercury’s management and has not yet reached the 
targeted financial return. Ongoing efficiency improvements at this centre 
are expected to resolve this during the new financial year.
The fifth centre under the GC8 contract, a diagnostics unit in Havant that 
will operate as a satellite centre to Portsmouth, is expected to open as 
planned early in 2008.
been operationally integrated with Care UK’s former Clinical Care division. 
The Health Care business also includes the group’s 50% joint venture interest 
in PHG, which continues to be managed by its separate management team.
The Primary Care business has continued to make steady progress and 
has recently been appointed as preferred bidder for four small additional 
contracts, for an Ophthalmology Clinical Assessment and Treatment Service 
(“CATS”) in Rochdale, for Integrated Drug Treatment Services at HMPs 
Birmingham and Chelmsford and for a local CATS service in Barking & 
Dagenham, where we already provide GP services and a walk-in centre. 
A further prison health contract, for HMPs Garth, Wymott and Preston, 
commenced satisfactorily in the last quarter of the year.
Performance has been generally satisfactory throughout this developing 
business with good levels of patient care and increasing volumes of activity. 
As reported at the half-year the contract to provide an Urgent Care Centre 
in Luton & Bedfordshire had not performed in line with our expectations. 
However, in the second half of the year the performance of this contract 
improved and the clinical model now provides an opportunity for replication 
with other PCTs.

During the year PHG’s clinical outcomes have been excellent and patient 
satisfaction levels have remained very high at the established treatment 
centres at Barlborough Links and Plymouth, both of which have operated 
at, or very close to, the projected contract case-mix levels. PHG’s third and 
fourth “Wave 1” centres, in Maidstone and Goodmayes in North East London, 
opened as planned in October 2006 and December 2006 respectively. 
PHG’s financial performance in 2007 was in line with the original plans for 
this business and has shown a pleasing improvement compared with 2006.
The Diagnostics business comprises the West Midlands regional diagnostics 
contract that was awarded to Mercury Health as part of the “Wave 2” 
procurement programme. This service commenced in July 2007 on a 
partial basis with a ramp-up to a total of 50 sites and made a small 
positive contribution in its first three months of operation.
The take up of contracted activity under this contract has been low since 
its commencement and, regrettably, on 15 November 2007 the DoH 
advised us that it wished voluntarily to terminate the contract. Their 
decision is based on a revised assessment of demand and capacity 
compared to when the contract was originally tendered. The contract 
provides for compensation to be payable in the case of voluntary termination 
and we are now in discussion on this matter.
Disappointing as this decision is, the DoH has assured us that it has arisen 
for very specific and localised reasons and does not signal a wider concern 
regarding strategy or other contracts.
The contract has facilitated the development of an important innovation in 
mobile health care provision, including endoscopy suites, audiology units, 
X-ray units, MRI scanners and other related services, and Care UK is keen 
to deploy this capability in a variety of settings. 
Both Care UK and PHG have been appointed as preferred bidders for a 
number of projects within the DoH’s second wave of ISTC procurement. 
The DoH and the Treasury have recently conducted a review to ensure that 
all projects in the second wave of procurement meet both the local needs 
of patients and offer value for money for taxpayers. On 15 November 2007 
the DoH announced that it was proceeding with the procurement of a 
number of schemes, four of which involve either Care UK or PHG. These 
include Care UK’s Manchester CATS and Essex Electives projects together 
with PHG’s Hampshire/Isle of Wight project. The Hampshire/Isle of Wight 
project will now include a single new treatment centre to be developed on 
the Royal South Hants hospital site in Southampton. We are pleased that 
the DoH has also appointed Care UK as sole bidder for a second CATS 
scheme in Manchester. 
Should all four projects ultimately proceed as currently specified, the 
anticipated overall revenue level would be to the order of £50m per 
annum when fully operational. 
prospects
The markets that the group serves are substantial in scale with customers 
focussed on service reform to provide enhanced service solutions and to 
mitigate funding pressures. 
NHS and government policies continue to include the introduction of 
extended choice for patients to, in turn, drive service improvements as 
a result of greater competition. A key priority in this regard is to redesign 
primary care services to facilitate the migration of care from inappropriate 
hospital environments and to improve access to health care in deprived 
areas. In many cases this will include diagnostic services being brought 
closer to patients.
We believe that Care UK is now well established as a preferred partner for 
a wide range of Local Authority and Primary Care Trust commissioners of 
health and social care services and that the group’s wide range of expertise 
uniquely positions Care UK to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Care UK has consistently achieved excellent growth in Social Care services 
with both well-established and innovative services, and this growth 
momentum is expected to continue. 
The group’s Health Care division has benefited from central NHS procurement 
to create a substantial business within a very short period of time. This phase 
of market development is now migrating to more local ownership and 
Care UK is well placed to develop a number of important relationships. In the 
meantime, the group is focussed on closing current contract appointments 
and is optimistic that this will be achieved during the coming months.

The 2007 financial year was another successful year for Care UK with good 
growth evident in the group’s longer-established Social Care businesses 
and an important acquisition within Health Care. The record levels of 
forward contracted income, strong cash flow and a substantial base 
of property assets provide a very sound platform for the group’s future 
growth, both organic and acquisitive.

overview
The group results show revenue, including the group’s share of joint 
venture revenue, of £275.7m (2006: £199.4m), an increase of 38%, and 
adjusted operating profit of £30.4m (2006: £22.5m), an increase of 35%. 
Growth in these measures in the second half of the financial year was 43% 
and 38% respectively following the acquisition of Mercury Health in April 2007. 
Adjusted profit before tax totalled £20.1m (2006: £15.7m), an increase 
of 28%. Overall profit before tax was £14.5m (2006: £14.2m). All four of 
the group’s business areas showed growth in both revenue and operating 
profit in the year. The group’s forward contracted revenue, including the 
group’s share of PHG’s forward contracted revenue, amounted to £1.2bn 
at 30 September 2007 (2006: £0.9bn).
operating performance
The group’s underlying operating performance is shown in the table above 
as “Adjusted operating profit”, reflecting three adjustments for 2007. 
In addition, in 2006, this measure excluded the profit arising on the sale of 
a surplus property in Richmond as well as the impairment charge recognised 
for goodwill relating to the former specialist recruitment business.
integration & restructuring costs
Following the acquisition of Mercury Health in April 2007 a single 
integrated management team was appointed to cover the newly 
identified business areas of Primary Care, Secondary Care and Diagnostics. 
In addition, a number of other key appointments were identified, which 
have either already been filled or where appointments are expected shortly. 
The combined business will operate in future under the Care UK brand 
and some investment has been required in developing a single brand 
proposition. All of the costs associated with this process have been 
recognised in the 2007 Income statement, together with a small level 
of cost associated with restructuring elsewhere in the group. The total 
cost in the Income statement is £2.1m. 
amortisation of ifrs 3 intangible assets
Under IFRS 3 all business combinations are reviewed in order to identify 
any intangible assets required to be recognised. In 2007, intangible assets 
totalling £24.3m were recognised for all of the four acquisitions made, 
of which Mercury Health represented £18.0m. The non-cash amortisation 
charge for the year amounted to £2.5m (2006: £0.4m), which reflects 
acquisitions made in both the current and prior years. This charge is excluded 
from the measurement of adjusted operating profit. The amortisation charge 
will increase significantly in 2008 because of the annualisation effect from 
current year acquisitions. 
Joint	venture	net	financing	costs	and	taxation
Adopted IFRS requires that contributions from joint ventures are shown 
on an after-tax basis as a single line component of operating profit in the 
Income statement. In calculating underlying operating performance, the 
joint venture net financing costs and taxation have been added back; these 
items are fully taken into account in calculating adjusted earnings per share.
taxation
Under adopted IFRS the group’s share of the taxation charge of joint 
venture interests is deducted in arriving at the net disclosed result for 
the group’s joint venture interest. The group’s headline rate of taxation 
on pre-tax profit, excluding the joint venture contribution, was 29.9% 
(2006: 35.2%). The underlying tax rate, measuring the tax charge applying 
to adjusted profit before taxation, was also 29.9% (2006: 29.7%). These 
rates have benefited by 3.1% and 2.2% respectively from a non-recurring 
deferred tax credit arising from the forthcoming change in the standard 
UK corporation tax rate; in 2006 the underlying rate benefited by 1.8% 
from adjustments in relation to prior years. The headline rate has fallen 
in 2007 as a result of IAS 12, which provides for a deferred tax credit to 
the Income statement in relation to the amortisation of other intangible 
assets. This has applied in 2007 to the substantially increased amortisation 
charge resulting mainly from the Mercury acquisition. The principal reason 
for the underlying rate of taxation being higher than the standard UK 
corporation tax rate remains the non-qualifying nature of much of the group’s 
capital expenditure. The forthcoming change in the UK corporation tax 
rate to 28% takes effect from 1 April 2008 and consequently will benefit 
the 2008 financial year for a six month period.
earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 26.26p (2006: 21.47p), an increase 
of 22%. Total basic earnings per share were 20.27p (2006: 18.02p). Adjusted 
diluted earnings per share were 25.97p (2006: 21.17p) and total diluted 
earnings per share were 20.04p (2006: 17.77p).
Dividends
The board is proposing a final dividend of 2.80p per share. If approved by 
shareholders this would result in a total dividend in respect of the year of 
4.02p per share when added to the interim dividend of 1.22p per share 
paid in July 2007. In 2006 a final dividend of 2.53p per share was paid 
subsequent to the year end in respect of the year ended 30 September 2006. 
At 30 September 2007 a total of 532,617 shares (30 September 2006: 648,400) 
were held by the group’s Employee Benefit Trust, on which dividend 
payments are waived.
acquisition of mercury Health
On 20 April 2007 the group announced the completion of the acquisition 
of Mercury Health from Tribal Group plc for total consideration of £76.8m, 
comprising equity consideration of £31.5m, repayment of intra-group 
borrowings of £24.6m and net debt acquired of £20.7m. As part of the 
consideration for this acquisition Investec undertook a “vendor placing” 
of 5,158,370 new ordinary shares on behalf of Tribal Group, raising 
approximately £34.0m before expenses. Residual proceeds from this 
placing, amounting to £1.7m after expenses, were received by the group.
The integration of the Mercury Health business into Care UK means it is 
not possible to identify the separable contribution to operating profit from 
the former Mercury business for the post-acquisition period. Mercury’s 
revenue contribution in the post-acquisition period was £24.1m. The overall 
operating profit generated by the combined Health Care business, excluding 
PHG, was £1.4m in the second half of the financial year, which was in line 
with the group’s expectations at the time of the acquisition. 18 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007

The Mercury Health balance sheet showed a deficit on net assets 
on acquisition of £5.3m, which included the acquired net debt and 
inter-company borrowings of £45.5m in total. Following a review 
of certain items in the acquired balance sheet, fair value adjustments 
have been made that increase this deficit by £0.8m. The most material 
adjustment resulted from the application of Care UK’s accounting policies 
to Mercury Health and the consequent restatement of £14.8m previously 
included in work-in-progress in current assets to tangible fixed assets.
In addition to this review, an intangible asset in relation to customer 
contracts has been recognised in accordance with IFRS 3, amounting to 
£18.0m before providing for related deferred taxation of £5.1m. This asset 
will be amortised over the remaining lives of the underlying contracts, 
which is approximately five years.

Cash conversion ratio (operating cash flow/adjusted

Operating cash inflow before integration & restructuring costs was £34.6m 
(2006: £29.9m). This represents a cash conversion ratio of 136% of adjusted 
group operating profit (2006: 142%). The group target is between 115% 
and 120%. The performance in 2007 represents good working capital 
management, particularly in view of the start-up of the West Midlands 
diagnostics contract, which required a post-acquisition working capital 
investment of £4.4m. Performance in 2006 was helped by the receipt 
of £2.6m from non-recurring grant payments and a construction-related 
VAT amount. Excluding the non-recurring items in both years the cash 
conversion ratio in 2007 was 154% and in 2006 was 130%.
Integration & restructuring costs absorbed £2.1m (2006: £nil). Net stakeholder 
payments, comprising interest, tax and dividends less proceeds from share 
issues absorbed £11.7m (2006: £12.4m). Maintenance and infrastructure 
capital expenditure amounted to £4.1m (2006: £4.3m), disposal proceeds 
were £0.7m (2006: £2.7m) and a net loan repayment of £0.6m was 
received from PHG. The free cash flow available for discretionary investment 
was therefore £18.0m (2006: £15.9m).
Against this available free cash flow the discretionary investment during 
the year in growth activities amounted to £71.6m (2006: £31.0m). This 
comprised capital expenditure of £13.0m (2006: £14.4m) and acquisition 
movements, including net debt/cash acquired, of £58.6m (2006: £14.7m). 
This figure differs from that shown in the consolidated cash flow statement 
as the latter does not include acquired net debt, although it does include 
acquired cash. The 2006 growth investment also included loans to/investment 
in joint ventures of £1.9m. In addition, non-cash movements contributed 
£1.4m (2006: £nil) to the increase in net debt, largely from the inception 
of new finance leases in certain Mercury Health companies.
Apart from the acquisition of Mercury Health, which represented £47.0m 
of the acquisition-related outflow including transaction costs, three other 
acquisitions were completed during the year. Access Homecare, St Andrews 
Villa and Homecare Services (Kent) were acquired in December 2006, 
April 2007 and June 2007 respectively. All of these businesses were acquired 
in the Community Care division. The combined cash outflow in respect of 
these transactions was £10.5m with the balance of £1.1m being contingent 
payments made in respect of acquisitions completed in previous years.
In April 2007, as part of the financing arrangements relating to the 
acquisition of Mercury Health, the group extended its principal borrowing 
facilities by a further £50m and the net available facility at 30 September 2007 
was £224.5m. This comprises term loans of £189.5m, a revolving credit 
facility of £15m and a £20m performance bond facility. The latter item 
is intended to support the performance bond requirement typically arising 
from contracts within the Health Care business. At 30 September 2007 
the total utilisation under this facility was £160.2m, including performance 
bonds of £2.7m, leaving headroom of £64.3m. This facility expires in 
February 2015. In addition, through the acquisition of Mercury Health, 
the group acquired a non-recourse financing facility supporting Mercury’s 
GC8 ISTC contract. At 30 September 2007 this facility, which is fully drawn 
and is subject to a repayment profile terminating with its expiry in May 2011, 
amounted to £30.5m.
The group’s treasury policy is to have a substantial proportion of the 
group’s borrowings subject to interest rate hedging arrangements. 
At 30 September 2007 the proportion of group borrowings subject to 
effective hedging arrangements was approximately 80%. The hedging 
structure applying to borrowings under the group’s principal facility 
comprised a mix of fixed rate swaps (£45m at an average swap LIBOR rate 
of 5.24% with average unexpired period of 4.6 years) and interest rate collars 
(£61m at an average cap LIBOR rate of 5.82% and an average floor LIBOR 
rate of 4.31% with an average unexpired period of 4.8 years). In addition 
the whole of the Mercury non-recourse facility, an amount of £30.5m at 
30 September 2007, is currently hedged by two fixed rate swaps with an 
average LIBOR rate of 4.99%. The whole of the non-recourse funding 
arranged through separate facilities for the group’s joint venture interest, 
PHG, is also hedged to the expiry date of the various contracts through 
fixed rate swaps. As at 30 September 2007 a total of just under £34m of 
net debt was subject to floating rates of interest, representing approximately 
20% of total net debt. Consequently, the group is materially protected 
against further upwards movement in interest rates whilst being in a 
position to benefit should rates fall. The board keeps both the group’s 
treasury policy and funding structure under regular review.
Cash interest cover, measuring all group interest charged including 
capitalised interest, against adjusted group earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation for 2007 was 3.9 times, compared 
with 4.5 times in 2006. 20 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Financial review continued
west midlands diagnostics contract
On 15 November 2007 the Department of Health (“DoH”) announced 
that it wished voluntarily to terminate the West Midlands diagnostics 
contract that had been entered into by Mercury Health in December 2006. 
This contract commenced operational service delivery in July 2007. 
The group has concluded that the notice of termination does not fall to be 
treated as an adjusting event under IAS 10. Consequently the accounting 
implications of this termination will be dealt with in the group’s interim 
financial statements for the period ending 31 March 2008, including 
consideration of the carrying value of goodwill arising on the acquisition 
of Mercury Health.
The contract provides for compensation to be payable in the event of 
voluntary termination. At this early stage it is not possible to quantify the 
level of compensation that is likely to be received but we have commenced 
discussions with the DoH regarding this.
The table below shows the values in respect of the non-current assets, 
net of related deferred tax, of the West Midlands diagnostics operating 
entity that are included in the group’s Consolidated balance sheet as at 
30 September 2007.
west midlands diagnostics – net asset values at 30 september 2007

Property, plant and equipment (net of related finance lease creditor) 8.2

net assets   9.8
*  The intangible asset is part of the total intangible asset of £18.0m, gross 
of deferred tax of £5.1m, recognised on the acquisition of Mercury Health
In the year ended 30 September 2007 the West Midlands diagnostics 
contract contributed revenue of £5.6m and made a small positive 
operating profit contribution.
future changes to adopted ifrs
IFRS is subject to ongoing review and revision by the International 
Accounting Standards Boards and subsequent endorsement by the EU. 
Care UK is continuing to monitor proposed changes to IFRS, assessing how 
best practice develops, and gauging their impact on the group financial 
statements. Shareholders will be kept informed as to how such changes 
may impact the group’s financial statements.

Report of the directors
for the year ended 30 september 2007
The directors present their report, together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2007. 
principal activities, trading review, and future prospects
The group’s principal activities comprise the provision of a range of health and social care solutions primarily to various public sector purchasers.
A general review of the operations of the group and its future prospects is included in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s report and 
Financial review on pages 4 to 20.
results and dividends
The Consolidated income statement is set out on page 36. The profit for the year is £10.8m (2006: £9.1m). Other movements are set out in the 
Statements of recognised income and expense on page 37; movements in reserves are shown in note 20 of the financial statements. 
The Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) used by the group to measure its own performance are revenue and adjusted operating profit. The figures for the 
year ended 30 September 2007 are set out in the Operational and financial highlights on page 1 together with the figures for the previous year and are 
discussed in the Financial review on pages 16 to 20. At divisional level the KPIs include divisional revenue, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating 
margin and, depending on the specific division, bed numbers and occupancy, hours of care provided, procedures delivered, forward contracted revenue 
and growth, both organically, and by acquisition. The KPIs for each division are discussed in the Chief Executive’s report on pages 6 to 15.
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 2.80p per share (2006: 2.53p), making a total dividend for the year of 4.02p per share 
(2006: 3.65p), amounting to £2.3m (2006: £1.9m). The final dividend will, subject to shareholders’ approval, be paid on 11 February 2008 to shareholders 
on the register at 11 January 2008. The final dividend proposed was not included as a liability as at 30 September 2007, in accordance with 
‘IAS 10 – Events after the Balance Sheet Date’.
corporate social responsibility
Care UK’s approach to corporate social responsibility reflects our commitment to patients and service users as well as to staff and other stakeholders. 
In the coming year we will be developing further the framework for this important aspect of the group’s operations.
Care UK is a member of the FTSE4Good Index, the index for companies which meet globally recognised corporate responsibility standards.
environmental performance
Care UK seeks continuously to minimise any adverse environmental impact from the group’s activities. As the group’s business operations are centred 
around the delivery of health and social care, the group’s environmental impact is naturally low. Our environmental strategy encompasses full compliance 
with environmental laws, regulations and guidance, and effective and organised action to reduce Care UK’s environmental impact. At a local and 
national level we seek the continuous development of policies, processes and staff guidance aimed at reducing the group’s impact. To achieve these 
aims, we promote sustainable design wherever possible, reduce energy consumption and waste, prevent pollution and increase recycling. When building 
new premises we work with our suppliers to research and source materials and services from renewable resources. In the construction of our buildings 
an integral part of the specification is to achieve high levels of sustainability and awareness of the wider environmental effect, adopting the principles 
of Agenda 21.
As a 24 hour per day operation relying on energy resources to provide a comfortable and safe environment for our residents, visitors and staff, reducing 
the amount of energy we use whilst maintaining the highest possible standards of care is a key priority. To help in reducing the energy consumption 
within our residential homes we have engaged consultants via the Carbon Trust to complete an energy management and opportunities assessment. 
From this we have identified an opportunity to reduce energy consumption by up to 15%. We employ a specialist waste management company to manage 
the disposal of all categories of waste in an environmentally safe manner. Our principal food and grocery supplier is aiming to achieve ISO14001 accreditation 
for environmental performance by the end of 2007. During 2007 we conducted a review of all supply arrangements in order to improve the quality 
of goods, works and services received by the group and to and deliver organisational efficiency through economics of scale and the reduction of waste. 
Core to our supplier selection process has been to ensure that the principles of sustainability, economic development and equality are promoted. 
Our environmental policy is available on our website and is available to all staff through our intranet.
health and safety management
Health and safety is a key part of the group’s day to day business. Care UK is committed to maintaining the highest possible standards as we recognise 
that this is of paramount importance to the well-being of our service users, employees, customers and other stakeholders.
With the assistance of a nationally-recognised organisation, we are conducting a major audit aimed at improving the strategic management of health and 
safety, ensuring that it is integral to our service delivery, minimising the risk of injury or ill health and promoting organisational learning.
We will continue to maintain and improve our existing safety management systems and ensure that all necessary resources are provided, with appropriate 
management systems and training in place, to support health and safety related policies. 24 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Report of the directors continued

employment matters
Care UK’s operations are entirely located within the UK. However, the nature of our business means that we frequently recruit staff from overseas. 
In this regard we have paid attention to the issues of equality and diversity. In some of our contracts we have been required to avoid recruitment 
of staff from within the NHS and have therefore relied on international recruitment. For example, in one major contract, we have recruited employees 
from 13 different countries with 62% of the employed healthcare professionals being recruited from overseas. The geographical area of this contract 
includes 10% of the most deprived areas of England. Just under 15% of the population of the urban area and just under 25% of the population in 
metropolitan areas within this region are either black or have minority ethnic origins. We have established a number of initiatives to benefit staff and 
patients including an international colleague network which provides a network beyond the induction period. This network values cultural differences, 
provides support, enhances cultural awareness, provides mentoring where needed and raises the profile of different faiths through individual events. 
As an employer of a diverse population we are spreading such best practice across the group.
It is group policy to give fair consideration to the employment needs of disabled people and to comply with current legislation with regard to their 
employment. Wherever practicable, we continue to employ and promote the careers of existing employees who become disabled and to consider 
disabled persons for employment, subsequent training, career development and promotion on the basis of their aptitudes and abilities. 
training and quality assurance
Care UK believes in and provides for the training of its employees to give them the opportunity to fulfil their roles more effectively, develop their skills 
and enhance their future prospects. Care UK is committed to meeting the targets set by both Skills for Care, the national authority on the training 
standards and development needs for social care staff in the adult sector, and the Children’s Workforce Development Council, which focuses on the 
development of social care workers in the children’s sector. The group has supported this commitment with the progression of its own systems-based 
training programme, complemented by other initiatives in partnership with third party providers. Through these initiatives the group invests in employees 
by seeking to maintain common induction standards, the attainment of National Vocational Qualifications ensuring effective and competent care, 
and the provision of further statutory training.
In the past year we have initiated management development programmes across the group at all management levels. We recognise that our people 
are our greatest asset and to this end we demonstrate how we value them by providing opportunities for development. We have consulted our staff 
in order to understand their objectives, preferences and expectations.
employee involvement
Management regularly visit the residential homes and local branches and discuss with members of staff matters of current interest and concern 
to the business. In order to encourage employees to become shareholders of the company and to participate in the achievements of the group, 
the company operates a Save As You Earn share option scheme (see note 21 of the financial statements). Management have developed a series 
of internal communications tools, including e-mail notices, newsletters and ‘cascade’ briefings in order to keep employees informed regarding the 
progress, financial position and commercial issues of the group. Employees have an open invitation to email the Chief Executive with ideas and issues.
working with the community
Our staff contribute regularly to charitable and community events ranging from monthly organised events to individual activities such as climbing 
Mount Kilimanjaro and skydiving. Over £30,000 was raised by staff in the past year for more than 30 charities.
clinical governance
Following the acquisition of Mercury Health, Care UK now has a significant health care operation together with the longer-established social 
care businesses. The group has clear governance structures including monthly divisional meetings which feed into group-wide quarterly clinical 
governance meetings encompassing both the health and social care operations. A range of key performance indicators have been agreed for 
continuing measurement and these will facilitate the assessment of safety, quality and clinical performance. The group board will review these 
performance trends on an ongoing basis.
principal risks and uncertainties
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s approach to assessing risk and recognises that creating value is the reward for taking, and 
accepting, risk. Executive management implement the board’s policies on risk and control and present assurance on compliance with these policies. 
The external auditor and central compliance functions, such as internal audit, clinical governance and health and safety, which have group-wide 
remits, provide further independent assurance to the board. This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve 
corporate objectives. Accordingly, it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Further information is provided on internal controls in the Report on corporate governance on page 26 and on accounting estimates and judgements 
in note 29 to the financial statements.
charitable and political donations
The group supports a number of charities through a community support scheme. During the year it made charitable donations of £21,000 (2006: £7,000). 
No political donations were made in the year (2006: £Nil).  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 25

21 December 2007 26 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
The directors acknowledge the principles set out in the Combined Code issued in 1998 by the Committee on Corporate Governance and intend to comply 
with the main provisions thereof. The company has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code throughout the year. This report does not cover 
the group’s 50% joint venture interest, Partnership Health Group Limited which has its own corporate governance processes.
The company applies the principles of the Combined Code in the following ways:
internal control
The directors are responsible for the group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The internal control systems are designed to 
meet the group’s particular needs and manage the risks to which it is exposed, and by its nature can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against misstatement or loss.
The Combined Code requires that the directors’ review the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal controls. This requirement extends this review 
to cover all controls, including:
 Financial;
 Operational;
 Compliance; and
 Risk management.
The directors confirm that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the group, that has been in place 
for the year under review, and that this process is regularly reviewed by the directors, and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The group operates in the care sector, one of the most closely monitored and regulated areas of business. Its services are subject to external inspections 
by registration and other authorities, which are followed up by publicly available reports. It also regularly conducts its own internal inspections.
With regard to financial matters, the group operates within a control environment, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the safeguarding 
of assets against unauthorised use or disposition, the maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information used within 
the business or for publication. 
Key established procedures are:
 The definition of the organisation structure and the appropriate delegation of responsibility to operational management;
 The definition of authorisation limits, both financial and otherwise;
 Written operational procedures;
  A system of financial reporting encompassing an annual budget, updated forecasts and the monthly reporting of actual results measured against 
both budget and forecast; and
  The regular assessment of risks facing the business and the reporting of operational performance to the board, including internal and external clinical 
audit reports.
The group’s Risk Management Steering Group (“RMSG”) oversees the group’s risk assessment process. The RMSG is chaired by the Finance Director and 
comprises representatives from each of the group’s operating divisions as well as key functional areas, including human resources and clinical governance.
The senior management of the operating divisions regularly review the systems of internal control in their respective divisions, which are supported by 
assessments of key business risks, controls and resulting exposures, and confirm their compliance with them. These assessments are reviewed by the 
RMSG and are subsequently reported to the group Executive Committee and the board.
The Audit Committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, primarily reviewing the systems of internal control and risk management, 
and the audit process. The external auditor attends all relevant meetings.
The group has in place a formal internal audit function. The function reports to the Finance Director but with direct access to the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee approve the annual internal audit strategy and plan and approve the amount of resources allocated to the internal audit function.
The directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal controls utilising inter alia, the procedures identified above.
going concern
After making enquiries the directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, have formed the judgement that the group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.
The Statement of directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements is set out on page 35.

Directors
At 30 September 2007 the board comprised the non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and four non-executive directors. 
The directors’ biographies appear on page 22 and detail their experience ensuring an effective board to lead and manage the group. All of the 
non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, are considered by the board as being independent, and Fritz Ternofsky has been identified as the 
Senior Independent Director.
The non-executive directors have made arrangements to meet at least annually without the Chairman present, in order to review and evaluate 
the performance of the board, its principal committees and the Chairman. The non-executive directors seek, and take into account, the views of the 
executive directors in carrying out this review.
All directors have access to the Company Secretary and may take independent advice at the group’s expense. The board meets monthly and has adopted 
a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. The board has established three committees with defined terms of reference as detailed below. The terms 
of reference of each of these committees may be obtained by writing to the Company Secretary at the company’s registered office or e-mailing a request 
to investorrelations@careuk.com.
remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by James Strachan and also comprises Fritz Ternofsky, Michael Averill and Miles Roberts. The Committee recommends 
the remuneration of the executive directors, including the granting of share awards and service contracts. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
will be available at the annual general meeting on 6 February 2008 to answer any questions regarding remuneration. The Directors’ remuneration report 
appears on pages 29 to 34.
nominations committee
The Nominations Committee comprises John Nash, Miles Roberts, Fritz Ternofsky, James Strachan, Michael Averill and Mike Parish and is chaired by 
John Nash. The principal function of the Committee is to lead the process for board appointments by reviewing at least annually the structure, size and 
composition of the board and making recommendations with regard to any changes. This includes evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the board and an annual review of the time required from, and performance evaluation of, non-executive directors. In doing so the 
Committee gives full consideration to succession planning in the context of the challenges and opportunities facing the group.
audit committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Miles Roberts and also comprises Fritz Ternofsky and Michael Averill. The Committee has direct access to the group’s 
auditor and liaises with executive management to review the effectiveness of internal controls.
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the group’s financial statements. The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the external audit process and making recommendations to the board in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and remuneration 
of the external auditor. It is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate relationship between the group and the external auditor is maintained, including 
reviewing non-audit services and fees. The group has agreed a policy on non-audit work, which sets out monetary limits for work that may be undertaken 
by the external auditor, in order to safeguard audit independence. The Committee also reviews annually the group’s systems of internal control and the 
processes for monitoring and evaluating the risks facing the group. The Committee reviews its terms of reference and its effectiveness annually and 
recommends to the board any changes required as a result of the review.
In 2007, the Audit Committee discharged its responsibilities by:
  Reviewing the group’s draft financial statements and interim results statement prior to board approval and reviewing the external auditor’s detailed 
reports thereon;
 Reviewing the appropriateness of the group’s accounting policies;
  Reviewing the potential impact in the group’s financial statements of certain matters such as impairments of intangible and tangible fixed asset values 
and proposed International Financial Reporting Standards;
 Reviewing and approving the audit fee and reviewing those non-audit fees payable to the group’s external auditor that require Committee approval;
  Reviewing the external auditor’s plan for the audit of the group’s financial statements which included key risks on the financial statements, 
confirmations of auditor independence and the proposed audit fee, and approving the terms of engagement for the audit; and
 Reviewing an annual report on the group’s systems of internal control and its effectiveness and reporting to the board on the results of the review. 28 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007

The board understands the need for communication with both institutional and private shareholders. In addition to general presentations after the 
publication of the group’s interim and final results the Chief Executive and Finance Director meet regularly with fund managers, analysts and institutional 
investors. The company’s annual general meeting provides a forum for all shareholders to attend and put questions to the board. All resolutions are 
proposed separately. All results statements, company announcements and investor presentations are accessible to all shareholders via the group’s

unauDiteD information
composition and role of the remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is chaired by James Strachan and also comprises Fritz Ternofsky, Michael Averill and Miles Roberts. 
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors. The Committee has access to advice provided by the Chief Executive and the 
Group Human Resources Director and has access to its own independent advisers. During the year the Committee received advice from New Bridge 
Street Consultants LLP on the remuneration packages for executive directors and the structure of annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements. 
No director or senior executive is involved in any matter relating to their own remuneration. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
company’s website and on request from the Company Secretary. This report explains how the company has applied the principles in the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance that relate to directors’ remuneration. It will be submitted to the forthcoming annual general meeting for approval.
framework and policy on executive directors’ remuneration
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that the remuneration packages offered to the executive directors are competitive and designed to attract, 
retain and motivate executive directors and senior executives of a high calibre. In addition, the performance-linked elements are designed to ensure that 
the executives are aligned to the business strategy and the interests of shareholders. Accordingly, a significant proportion of the remuneration package 
depends on the attainment of certain objectives, both short and long-term. These packages are reviewed regularly, at least annually, and independent 
advice is taken where appropriate. During 2007 the Committee conducted an extensive review of senior executive remuneration in the light of both 
market practice and the significant growth and changing composition of the company’s business. It concluded that while the overall structure of the 
annual bonus scheme and the Long-Term Incentive Plan remains valid, a number of incremental changes were appropriate to ensure the continued 
alignment of shareholder interest and executive incentivisation. The changes are set out in detail below.
basic salary
The Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for executive directors. Remuneration is considered with 
regard to personal performance and independently compiled salary summary information, and is commensurate with their responsibilities and experience. 
The Committee also recognises the policy adopted generally regarding remuneration across the group in determining the appropriate arrangements for 
senior executives. During the year under review the base salary levels were increased by 10.8% and 15.2% for the Chief Executive and Finance Director 
respectively. These rises were considered appropriate recognising the performance of the company and overall market relativities.
incentive arrangements
annual performance related bonuses
The bonus scheme has been redesigned for the 2008 financial year. First, the annual bonus potential for a number of key senior executives has been 
increased from 50% to 75% of base salary, balanced by a more stringent deferral element. In prior years, the policy was that half of any bonus earned 
in excess of 10% of base salary, net of tax, must be taken in Care UK Plc ordinary shares and held for three years without being contingent on continuing 
service over the deferral period. From 2008, one-third of any bonus earned will be delivered in the form of deferred shares in the company, which must 
be held for at least two further years and will only be awarded subject to continued employment over the deferral period.
The structure of the performance conditions has also been changed for 2008. For 75% of the bonus potential, a profit before tax target range will be set, 
with maximum bonus payable only for the achievement of a stretching level of performance in relation to the target.
The remaining 25% of the annual bonus potential will comprise Strategic Enhancement Targets, which will be in the form of a number of key strategic 
objectives for each executive to individually achieve. It is anticipated that the achievement of each of these performance conditions will have a strong link 
to improvement in company financial performance.
The Committee has considered carefully the increase in the bonus potential, together with the terms of the share-based deferral and the changes to the 
performance conditions. Overall, the Committee considers that this is now a market-competitive bonus scheme, which will provide a significant potential 
reward for the achievement of excellent operating performance, better retention and greater alignment of interest between executives and shareholders.
The Committee may also pay additional bonuses on a discretionary basis for particular qualitative aspects of performance. These are not predetermined 
by the Committee; however, any discretionary bonus is subject to the overall bonus cap. 
No bonus payments are pensionable. 
long- term incentive plan (“ltip ”)
Under the terms of the LTIP , company shares may be awarded each year to participants, on a discretionary basis, subject to a maximum of 120% of base 
salary. Awards during the 2008 financial year will be made in relation to shares worth 120% of base salary for the Chief Executive, 100% of base salary 
for the Finance Director and 75% of base salary for other participants. 
Awards under the LTIP scheme are subject to two performance criteria, the scales relating to which are determined annually by the Committee. For the 
awards made in the 2008 financial year the criteria are (a) growth in earnings per share (“EPS”), and (b) return on capital employed (“ROCE”). ROCE is 
calculated as operating profit divided by average capital employed, which is defined as net assets plus net debt less assets in the course of construction. 
EPS will be determined on the basis of adjusted earnings per share as reported in the group’s financial statements. ROCE and EPS growth are measured 
over a fixed three-year period. The separate elements of the overall award are calculated independently in determining the overall proportion of each 
award that vests.

incentive arrangements continued
long- term incentive plan continued
The Committee continues to believe that a blend of EPS and ROCE targets provides a balanced incentive, rewarding growth in profitability and a focus 
on capital employed. After careful review the Committee has, however, determined that lower hurdles are appropriate for both EPS and ROCE than for 
prior years’ awards, balanced by a lower level of vesting in achieving the threshold performance target. The Committee considers that the hurdles remain 
appropriately challenging considering the outlook for the next three years. The revised LTIP structure is also now considered by the Committee to be fully 
market-competitive for a growth company.
The sliding scale of performance conditions is as follows:
Vesting level EPS growth (compound over 3 years) ROCE (in year 3)
Zero vesting Below RPI + 6% Below 14%
Vesting at 25% At RPI + 6%  At 14%
Vesting on a straight-line scale between 25% and 100% Between RPI + 6% and RPI + 15% Between 14% and 17%
Vesting at 100% At or above RPI + 15% At or above 17%
Awards remain outstanding under legacy share option schemes. No further options will be granted in the 2008 financial year.
pensions
The group contributes to defined contribution personal pension schemes in respect of the executive directors. None of the executive directors are 
members of any defined benefit pension scheme. The contributions paid in respect of the executive directors are detailed below.
contracts of service and compensation for termination
It is the Committee’s policy that executive directors are employed on rolling contracts subject to twelve months’ notice from either party. The existing 
directors are employed on these terms. There is no provision in any director’s contract for predetermined compensation or liquidated damages in the 
event of early termination, but the company may make payments in lieu of notice at its discretion. The Committee would review each case of early 
termination individually in order to ensure compensation settlements are made which are appropriate to the circumstances.
The contract details for the executive directors are:
  Effective date Unexpired term Notice period
Mike Parish  5 Nov 01 12 months 12 months
Paul Humphreys  8 Jul 02 12 months 12 months
non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, which may be renewed for further terms of up to three years thereafter. As with 
executive directors, non-executives must stand for re-election at the first annual general meeting following their appointment and at least every three 
years thereafter.
Non-executive directors’ fees are determined having regard to the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and experience, and the time and 
responsibilities entailed and the level of fees paid by companies of similar size. The remuneration of the Chairman and other non-executive directors is 
determined by the board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. None of the non-executive directors receives any pension contribution or 
participates in any incentive scheme. All of the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are for periods not exceeding three years and provide for 
early termination without compensation.
The information provided until this point in the report has not been audited. The further disclosures set out below, with the exception of the line graph 
on page 34, have been audited.

notes:
1. The highest paid director for 2007 and 2006 was Mike Parish.
2.  The bonus payable in respect of the 2007 financial year was determined after considering the year-on-year increase in profitability of the group, together with other 
qualitative aspects of management performance. Under the annual bonus plan the bonus payable represented 24.19%. The Committee used its discretion to determine 
an additional bonus payment to arrive at an overall bonus of 40% of base salary.
3. Taxable benefits comprise car allowance, permanent health insurance and private medical insurance.
Directors’ pensions
Pension contributions to defined contribution schemes are detailed in the table below. Contributions for the executive directors are made at rates 
of 12.5% of salary for the Finance Director and 15% of salary for the Chief Executive. These contributions are subject to HM Revenue and Customs limits. 
Where such limits would be exceeded, the remaining amount that would otherwise have been paid as a pension contribution is provided either in the 
form of contributions into a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (“FURBS”) or as a payment in lieu of pension benefits, at the discretion 
of the executive director. A payment of £53,000 (2006: £34,000) was made on this basis to Mike Parish in lieu of pension benefits.

notes:
1.   Award 2 made on 30 December 2003 vested on the basis of the group’s results for the year to 30 September 2006. A total of 45.46% of this award vested, with the 
balance lapsing, as follows:
 Mike Parish – 37,753 shares vested with a market value of £206,000 at 30 September 2006.
 Paul Humphreys – 14,747 shares vested with a market value of £80,000 at 30 September 2006.
2.  For award 3, the targets were set on the basis of UK GAAP as no adopted IFRS comparatives exist for that base year. Award 4 has been re-calculated on an adopted 
IFRS basis so as to ensure that the impact of the change in accounting standards is neutral. 
  Awards 3, 4 and 5 as detailed in the table above are subject to a range of EPS (compound growth over three years) and ROCE (in year 3) performance conditions for the 
separate elements of each award. For award 3 the range of EPS growth targets is RPI+ 10% p.a. at threshold and RPI+ 20% p.a. at maximum and ROCE of between 15% 
and 18%. For awards 4 and 5 the range of EPS growth targets is RPI+ 12% p.a. at threshold and RPI+ 22% p.a. at maximum and ROCE of between 15% and 19.5%. In all 
cases 40% of the award vests at the threshold and there is no opportunity either to change these targets or to re-measure performance after the third year.

schemes have now fully vested.
2.  The group operates an all-employee savings-related share option scheme, the Sharesave scheme, which is designed to provide a long-term savings and investment 
opportunity for employees. For full details of this scheme, see note 21.
3. The market value of the company’s ordinary shares at 30 September 2007 was 497.3p per share and the price range during the year was from 870.0p to 480.0p per share. 34 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
performance graph
The graph below shows the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance of the company compared to the TSR of the FTSE Small Cap over the last five 
financial years. The Small Cap has been chosen as the company has been a constituent of this index throughout the relevant period and as there are no 
direct peer comparator companies against which it would be more appropriate to measure return. TSR is not used directly for measuring performance 
under the group’s long-term incentive plan as the Committee has determined that the measures used, which are explained above, are more appropriate 
in assessing the delivery of improved shareholder return.
In accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act the group’s auditor, KPMG Audit plc, has audited the sections within this Directors’ remuneration report 
on director’s emoluments, directors’ interests in shares and options over ordinary shares.

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required 
to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
The group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the 
group and the parent company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent 
company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration report and 
Corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Cash flow statements
for the year ended 30 september 2007 40 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
The significant accounting policies of the group and parent company are set out below.
accounting policies
European Union (“EU”) law requires that the annual consolidated financial statements of the group for the year ending 30 September 2007 be prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use within the EU (“adopted IFRS”). The directors have elected to prepare the 
parent company’s financial statements on the same basis.
Care UK Plc (the “company”) is a company domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended 
30 September 2007 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “group”) and the group’s interest in associates and jointly 
controlled entities.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 21 December 2007.
(a) statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU adopted IFRS.
(b) basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis or fair value as appropriate except that certain land and buildings had previously 
been revalued and are stated at deemed cost.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making 
the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements. The accounting policies have 
been applied consistently by group entities.
(c) basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable 
or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceased.
ii) Joint ventures
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The consolidated financial 
statements include the group’s share of the profits less losses of joint ventures in the Consolidated Income statement and its interest in their net assets 
in the Consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the equity method of accounting.
iii) Transactions eliminated upon consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and loss or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the group’s 
interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(d) foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income statement.
The functional currency of all the Group entities is UK sterling.
Accounting policies Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 41
accounting policies continued
(e) financial instruments
i) Non-derivative instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
Accounting for cash and cash equivalents is discussed in note (k); interest bearing borrowings in note (m); and finance income and expense in note (q)(iii). 
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. The group has 
no non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
ii) Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from its financing activities. In accordance with its 
treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount the group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking 
into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
iii) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability the effective part of 
any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in the Income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss. The ineffective part 
of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged 
transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy 
when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity 
is recognised immediately in the Income statement.
iv) Financial guarantee contracts
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the company considers 
these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability 
until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
(f) property, plant and equipment
i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 October 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis 
of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation less any subsequent depreciation and impairments. The last revaluation, 
to open market value, of the properties occurred in 1992.
Assets in the course of construction are carried in the financial statements at cost, taken from the most recent surveyor’s cost certificate received prior 
to the date of the financial statements.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
The cost of land and buildings includes both the costs of financing assets in the course of construction and other costs that are directly attributable 
to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Capitalisation 
of finance and other costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete. 
ii) Leased assets
Where the group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is classified as a finance 
lease. The asset acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, 
are included within creditors.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases. 42 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
accounting policies continued
(f) property, plant and equipment continued
iii) Subsequent costs
The group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost 
is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other costs are recognised in the Income statement as an expense as incurred.
iv) Depreciation 
Depreciation is charged to the Income statement to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of property, plant and equipment by equal 
instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold land No depreciation provided
Freehold buildings 25 to 50 years
Long leasehold buildings 50 years or, if shorter, the period of the lease or the associated contract
Short leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease or the associated contract
Plant and machinery (as an integral part of property assets) 25 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Furniture, fittings, medical equipment and office equipment 3 to 10 years
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
v) Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs include the costs attributable to a contract for the period from the date of securing the contract to the date at which financial close 
is achieved. The award of preferred bidder status is normally considered as the point at which the contract has been secured, although contracts are 
individually reviewed in order to apply the most appropriate treatment. Costs that relate directly to a contract and which are incurred in this period are 
included as part of pre-contract costs where they can be separately identified and reliably measured. Such amounts are held within other debtors until 
such time as financial close of the contract is achieved, at which time they are transferred to assets in the course of construction.
(g) intangible assets
i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration and associated costs and the fair values attributable to the 
net identifiable assets acquired. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to adopted IFRS has been 
retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not subject to periodic amortisation but is tested annually 
for impairment. As permitted under ‘IFRS 3 – Business Combinations’, the fair value of the assets acquired may be re-assessed in the instance of further 
information arising within twelve months from the date of acquisition. 
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the Income statement.
ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the Income statement as an expense as incurred.
iii) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the Income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. 
Customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, which will not exceed ten years. Goodwill and intangible assets with 
an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use over their estimated 
useful lives.
iv) Impairment
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether 
there is any impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an 
asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement.
Accounting policies continued Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 43
accounting policies continued
(h) other investments
Other investments and investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
(i) trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses.
(j) inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less the estimated selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle.
(k) cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable 
on demand and form an integral part of the group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
statement of cash flows.
(l) share capital
i) Employee Benefit Trust shares
When share capital recognised as equity is acquired by the group’s Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”), the amount of the consideration paid, including 
directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Such shares are presented as a deduction from total equity.
ii) Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded 
in the period in which they are paid.
(m) interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Income statement over the 
period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
(n) Employee benefits
The assets of all pension plans are held separately from those of the group in independently administered managed funds.
i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income statement as incurred. 
ii) Defined benefit plans
The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan 
assets is deducted. The discount rate applied is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity obligations approximating 
to the terms of the group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 October 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, were recognised. In respect of actuarial gains and losses that 
have arisen subsequent to 1 October 2004, the group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in the Statements of recognised income and expense.
iii) Share-based payment transactions
The group operates a number of share option schemes. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured based on the Black-Scholes formula, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the instruments were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options that are expected to vest.
The group’s Long Term Incentive Plan is managed by a separately administered EBT. Liabilities of the EBT are guaranteed by the company and the 
assets of the EBT mainly comprise shares in the company. The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the EBT have been included in the consolidated 
and company’s financial statements. 
Where a subsidiary awards options over the shares of the company, this is treated as a capital contribution.
(o) trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at cost. 44 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
accounting policies continued
(p) revenue
i) Services rendered
Revenue represents the fair value of sales and services to third party customers, stated net of any applicable value added tax, rebates and discounts. 
The stage of completion as defined in ‘IAS 18 – Revenue’ is determined by reference to the point at which the group has met its principal contractual 
obligations. Revenue is recognised as follows:
social care:
Residential long-term contracts – revenue is recognised on a time-elapsed basis as the principal contractual obligation is to provide bed capacity. 
Units of care under these contracts are typically provided on a daily basis and there is no obligation to carry forward any non-utilised capacity. 
Residential spot purchase contracts – revenue is recognised when the group’s principal contractual obligation is fulfilled, that is typically when a service 
user has received care services from the group, which are usually provided on a daily basis.
Community based services – revenue is recognised only on the actual delivery of care services. Revenue attributable to any unused capacity under ‘block’ 
contracts, where the group is able to submit invoices for contracted services that have not actually been provided, is only recognised when the recovery 
of income is considered virtually certain. 
health care:
Capacity-related contracts - revenue is recognised on a time-elapsed basis as the principal contractual obligation is to provide an agreed level of capacity 
over a fixed term. There is no obligation under these contracts to carry forward non-utilised capacity.
Service-related contracts - revenue is recognised only on the delivery of services either surgical procedures or other treatments under contractual obligations 
that are intended to provide a pre-determined volume of services over a fixed term. Revenue attributable to unused capacity is only recognised when 
recovery of income is considered virtually certain. 
In all businesses when revenue is invoiced in advance this is accounted for as deferred income until the service is provided. 
ii) Government grants
Capital based government grants are included within accruals and deferred income in the Balance sheet and credited to the Income statement over the 
estimated useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate. Grants that compensate the group for expenses incurred are recognised as revenue 
in the Income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.
(q) expenses
i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the Income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated 
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
iii) Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, 
foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the Income statement.
Interest income is recognised in the Income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. The interest expense component of finance lease 
payments is recognised in the Income statement using the effective interest rate method.
(r) taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and comprises current and deferred taxation. Income tax is recognised in the Income 
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, 
together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill not deductible for taxation purposes, 
and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Accounting policies continued Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 45
accounting policies continued
(s) segment reporting
Care UK operates solely within the United Kingdom, hence no geographical segment disclosures are presented. 
(t) non-current assets held for sale
Immediately before their classification as being held for sale, the measurement of the value of any such assets (and all assets and liabilities in a disposal 
group) is brought up-to-date in accordance with applicable adopted IFRS. On their ensuing initial classification as being held for sale, non-current assets 
and disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on the initial classification of non-current assets as being held for sale are included in profit or loss, including where there has been 
any revaluation of the asset. The same also applies to gains and losses on subsequent measurement.
(u) non-gaap performance measures 
The board believe that the ‘adjusted’ profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for the shareholders on the underlying 
performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is monitored internally. The adjusted operating profit is 
not a recognised profit measure under adopted IFRS and may not be directly comparable with ‘adjusted’ profit measures used by other companies. 
The adjustments made to operating profit exclude exceptional income and charges, which are predominantly one-off in nature and therefore create 
volatility in reported earnings.
(v) new standards and interpretations not yet applied
A number of new EU adopted standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 30 September 2007, 
and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements:
i)  IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the Amendment to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Instruments – Capital Disclosures require extensive 
disclosures about the significance of financial instruments for an entity’s financial position and performance, and qualitative and quantitative 
disclosures on the nature and extent of risks. IFRS 7 and the amended IAS 1, which become mandatory for the group’s 2008 financial statements, 
will require additional disclosures with respect to the group’s financial instruments and share capital.
ii)  IFRS 8 – Operating Segments introduces the “management approach” to segment reporting. IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory for the group’s 2010 
financial statements, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the board and Executive 
in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. Currently the group presents segment information in respect of its 
business segments (see note 1); these segments are not anticipated to change under the group’s management approach.
iii)  IFRIC 10 – Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment prohibits the reversal of an impairment loss recognised in a previous interim period in respect 
of goodwill, an investment in an equity instrument or a financial asset carried at cost. IFRIC 10 will become mandatory for the group’s 2008 financial 
statements and will apply prospectively from that date. The adoption of IFRIC 10 is not expected to have an impact on the group’s financial statements.
iv)  IFRIC 11 – IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions requires a share-based payment arrangement in which an entity received goods or services 
as consideration for its own equity instruments to be accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, regardless of how the 
equity instruments are obtained. IFRIC 11 will become mandatory for the group’s 2008 financial statements with retrospective application required. 
It is not expected to have an impact on the group’s financial statements. 46 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Notes to the financial statements
1. segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the group’s business segments. The primary format, business segments, is based on the group’s management 
and internal reporting structure. Care UK operates solely within the United Kingdom, hence no geographical segment disclosures are presented.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Unallocated items comprise mainly interest-bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate assets and expenses.
Business segments
The group comprises the following main business segments:
 Residential Care operates care homes for older people.
 Community Care supports people in their own homes, including older people and others with specialist needs.
 Specialist Care includes the provision of care for individuals with learning disabilities or mental health needs and children’s residential and foster care.
  Health Care provides a range of primary, secondary and diagnostic care services, and includes the group’s 50% interest in Partnership Health Group Limited.

The allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units on acquisitions made in the year ended 30 September 2007 has been completed during the year.
Intangible assets comprise the value attributed to ongoing customer relationships within acquired businesses and are amortised over their estimated 
useful economic lives, which do not exceed ten years.
Management believes that goodwill represents value to the group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted. The goodwill 
arising on the Mercury Health acquisition completed during the year is primarily attributable to:
 	 	 the	assessment	by	the	directors	tha t	the	enlarged	Health	Care	division	w ill	obtain	future	economic	benefits	from	its	participation	in	the	emerging	
market for the provision of healthcare services to NHS patients, beyond the currently extant customer relationships and contracts within the 
Mercury Health business;
 	 	 other	potential	future	economic	be nefits,	such	as	additional	revenues	an d	buyer	specific	operating	synergies,	that	it	is	anticipated	may	be	derived	
from the business; 
 the fair value of the workforce in place at the date of acquisition; and
 the initial recognition of deferred taxation. 
Mercury Health’s existing customer relationships and contracts, which are all due to expire by March 2013, have been recognised as a separate intangible 
asset as required under IFRS 3. 
The goodwill arising on other acquisitions completed during the year is primarily attributable to the fair value of the workforce in place at the date of 
acquisition and the initial recognition of deferred taxation.
The adjustment in respect of acquisitions made in prior years of £1.6m relates to the contingent consideration payable more than 12 months after the 
date	of	acquisition.	The	2006	adjustment	of	£0.4m	related	to	the	acquisition	of	the	remaining	20%	of	the	issued	share	capital	of	Care	UK	Children’s	
Services Limited (formerly Corvedale Holdings Limited). Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 55

b) Impairment charge
During the year ended 30 September 2007, the group reviewed all cash-generating units that contain goodwill for impairment in accordance with  
‘IFRS	3	–	Business	Combinations’.	The	recoverable	amount	was	determined	by	value	in	use.	The	discount	rate	used	in	the	2007	value	in	use	calculation	
was	7.49%	(2006:	6.44%).	There	was	no	goodwill	impairment	identified	(2006:	£2.3m).
c) Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill

Health Care       24.9 —
       65.2 	 34.4
All	of	the	recoverable	amounts	are	measured	based	on	value	in	use.	Those	calculations	use	cash	flow	projections	based	on	actual	operating	results	and	
the	budget	and	forecast	business	plan	for	the	three	years	ending	30	September	2010.	A	further	two	years	of	projected	cash	flows	are	incorporated	using	
an 	 estimated 	 annual 	 growth 	 rate 	 and 	 a 	 terminal 	 value 	 is 	 placed 	 on 	 the 	 value 	 of 	 the 	 annual 	 cash 	 flows. 	 No 	 adjustment 	 is 	 made 	 for 	 the 	 projected 	 terminal	
value of the net assets of the individual cash-generating unit.
The	growth	rate	is	consistent	with	the	long-term	average	growth	rate	for	the	industry .	A	pre-tax	discount	rate	of	7.49%	(2006:	6.44%)	has	been	used	
in	discounting	the	projected	cash	flows,	representing	the	group’s	estimated	weighted	average	cost	of	capital.

19. Deferred tax liabilities
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28% (2006: 30%).
(a) Recognised deferred tax liabilities
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will 
be recovered.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS12) during the period 
are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the 
balances net.

21. Share-based payments
a) Share-based payment schemes
The group has the following share-based payment schemes:
i) No.2 Executive Scheme
The No.2 Executive Scheme was initially an unapproved scheme. It was subsequently approved by the Inland Revenue, although unapproved options were 
also granted under the scheme. This scheme was discontinued in 2003 in relation to new awards.
Options 	 were 	 granted 	 with 	 a 	 fixed 	 exercise 	 price 	 being 	 not 	 less 	 than 	 the 	 market 	 price 	 of 	 the 	 shares 	 under 	 option 	 on 	 the 	 date 	 of 	 grant. 	 The 	 options 	 granted	
under this scheme are generally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant. An employee generally has six months after 
leaving employment of the group to exercise any unlapsed options that have vested.
For the majority of options outstanding as at the year end the following performance conditions apply. The options granted are exercisable in three equal 
tranches, 	 subject 	 to 	 the 	 achievement 	 of 	 performance 	 conditions, 	 measured 	 over 	 a 	 three 	 year 	 period 	 with 	 the 	 final 	 tranche 	 ending 	 in 	 the 	 fifth 	 year 	 following 	
the year of initial grant. The performance conditions for each tranche require that earnings per share for the previous three years must not be less than 
those for the base year increased by RPI + 5% with yearly rests. All of the outstanding options have now fully vested. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007 67
21. Share-based payments continued
a) Share-based payment schemes continued
ii)	SA YE	Scheme
Options	are	granted	with	a	fixed	exercise	price.	The	exercise	price	is	based	on	the	average	of	middle	market	quotations	of	the	shares	under	option	for	
three days preceding the grant date less a discount of up to 20%. The options granted under this scheme generally become exercisable on the third 
anniversary of the commencement of the related savings contract. All employees who work more than 15 hours per week for any group company are 
eligible to participate in this scheme. The company anticipates making annual awards under this scheme. An employee generally has six months after 
leaving employment of the group to exercise any unlapsed options that have vested. 
iii) Performance Related Share Option Scheme
None of the Performance Related Share Option Scheme options is accounted for under IFRS 2 as they were granted before 7 November 2002.
All	of	these	options	initially	become	exercisable	in	three	equal	tranches	in	the	three	years	to	five	years	following	grant.	They	may	then	be	exercised	up	to	
seven years from the date of grant. The performance targets for each tranche normally require that earnings per share for the previous three years must 
not be less than those for the base year increased by RPI + 5% with yearly rests.
iv)	Long	T erm	Incentive	Plan	(“L TIP ”)
Options have been granted as nil cost options under this scheme. The options granted under this scheme are generally exercisable at the end of the 
performance period and for six months thereafter. Awards under this scheme are reserved for employees at senior management level and above. 
If an employee leaves the employment of the group, a proportion of his award may be deemed to have vested, subject to satisfying any performance 
conditions and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The company anticipate making annual awards under this scheme.
Awards under the LTIP scheme are subject to two performance criteria, the scales relating to which will be determined annually by the Remuneration 
Committee.	Details	of	the	performance	criteria	are	further	discussed	in	the	Directors’	remuneration	report	on	pages	29	to	34.
v) Employee Share Option Scheme
The	options	were	granted	with	a	fixed	exercise	price	being	not	less	than	the	market	price	of	the	shares	under	option	on	the	date	of	grant.	The	options	
granted will lapse on the third anniversary of the date of grant if the performance conditions have not been met. For the whole of the option to be 
capable of exercise the growth in the EPS of the company over the performance period must equal or exceed the growth in RPI by 12% per annum. 
If the growth in the EPS of the company over the performance period does not equal or exceed the growth in RPI by 12% per annum then the option 
will not be exercisable.
Awards under this scheme are available for all employees and directors with participation being at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
If an employee leaves the employment of the group, a proportion of their award may be deemed to have vested, subject to satisfying any performance 
conditions and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
b) Share-based payment expense
In	accordance	with	the	transitional	provisions	of	‘IFRS	1	–	First	Time	Adoption	of	IFRS’,	the	group	has	elected	only	to	apply	‘IFRS	2	–	Share-based	
payment’	to	all	relevant	share-based	payment	transactions	granted	after	7	November	2002	but	not	fully	vested	or	exercised	by	30	September	2004.
All	share-based	payment	transactions	have	been	valued	using	the	Black-Scholes	option-pricing	model.	No	performance	conditions	were	included	in	the	
fair value of the calculations. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the year preceding the date of grant. The calculation of volatility 
uses a statistical methodology called generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity that incorporates the occurrence of volatility clustering. 
The expected life of the option is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds 
of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The total Income statement expense for the year relating to employee equity-settled share-based plans was £0.6m (2006: £0.5m). After deferred tax, 
the	total	charge	was	£0.5m	(2006:	£0.4m). 68 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007

a) Strategies, objectives and policies
The	group’s	financial	instruments	comprise	short-term	debtors	and	creditors,	borrowings	and	cash,	all	of	which	are	denominated	in	sterling.	The	main	
purpose	of	these	financial	instruments	is	to	raise	finance	for	the	group’s	operations.
It	is,	and	has	been	throughout	the	year ,	the	group’s	policy	that	no	trading	of	a	speculative	nature	in	financial	instruments	shall	be	undertaken.
The	main	risks	arising	from	the	group’s	financial	instruments	are	interest	rate	risk	and	liquidity	risk.	The	Finance	Director	is	responsible	for	managing	these	
risks and reports to the board on a regular basis on the policies adopted. 
The policies are summarised below and refer to note 29, Accounting estimates and judgements.
b) Interest rate risk
The	group	finances	its	operations	through	called	up	share	capital,	retained	profits,	bank	borrowings,	and	the	sale	of	assets	if	appropriate.	The	group’s	
income	is	by	its	nature	relatively	stable	and	its	growth	is,	inter	alia,	impacted	by	inflation.	Group	policy	is	to	balance	interest	rate	fixes	between	the	short,	
medium and long term.

i) sensitivity analysis
In	managing	interest	rate	risks	the	group	aims	to	reduce	the	impact	of	short-term	fluctuations	on	the	group’s	earnings.	Over	the	longer	term,	however ,	
permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 	 30 	 September 	 2007, 	 it 	 is 	 estimated 	 that 	 a 	 general 	 increase 	 of 	 1% 	 in 	 interest 	 rates 	 would 	 decrease 	 the 	 groups 	 profit 	 before 	 taxation 	 by 	 approximately 	 £0.5m 	
(2006: £0.5m). The effect of only those existing interest rate swaps and collars that existed as at 30 September 2007 have been included in this calculation.

The 	 following 	 summarises 	 the 	 major 	 methods 	 and 	 assumptions 	 used 	 in 	 estimating 	 the 	 fair 	 values 	 of 	 the 	 financial 	 instruments 	 reflected 	 in 	 the 	 above 	 tables:
Derivatives
Derivative	financial	instruments	are	valued	by	using	broker	quotes.
T rade	and	other	receivables/payables
F or	receivables/payables	with	a	remaining	life	of	less	than	one	year ,	the	notional	amount	is	deemed	to	reflect	the	fair	value.	All	other	receivables/payables	
are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
F air	value	is	calculated	based	on	discounted	expected	future	principal	and	interest	cash	flows.
Finance lease liabilities
The	fair	value	is	estimated	as	the	present	value	of	future	cash	flows,	discounted	at	market	interest	rates	for	homogenous	lease	agreements.	The	estimated	
fair	values	reflect	changes	in	the	interest	rates.
Interest rates for determining fair value
Unless	specified	above,	the	group	uses	the	government	yield	curve	as	of	30	September	2007	plus	an	adequate	constant	spread	to	discount	financial	
instruments. The interest rates used are as follows:
       2007 2006
Loans and borrowings       7.0% 6.5%

23. pensions
The	group	has	established	a	number	of	pension	schemes,	both	defined	contribution	and	defined	benefit,	covering	a	number	of	its	employees.
a) Defined contribution plan
The	group	has	a	defined	contribution	group	personal	pension	plan.	Contributions	to	this	scheme	are	charged	to	the	Income	statement	as	they	fall	due.	
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds. 
P ension	costs	for	defined	contribution	schemes	are	as	follows:
       2007 2006 
       £m £m
Defined	contribution	schemes	 	 	 	 	 	 0.7 0.5
As at 30 September 2007 contributions amounting to £0.1m (2006: £0.1m) were payable to the scheme and are included in creditors.
b) Defined benefit plans
As	a	result	of	contractual	arrangements	with	a	small	number	of	public	sector	customers,	the	group	contributes	to	two	defined	benefit	schemes.	
These	schemes	provide	pension	benefits	based	on	final	pensionable	pay .
The schemes are funded by payments to independently managed funds, the assets of which are held separately from those of the group. The funds 
are	administered	by	trustees	as	a	separate	legal	entity .	The	trustees	of	the	fund	are	required	to	act	in	the	best	interest	of	the	fund’s	beneficiaries.	
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes’ trust documentation.
Contributions 	 to 	 the 	 defined 	 benefit 	 pension 	 schemes 	 are 	 charged 	 to 	 the 	 Income 	 statement 	 so 	 as 	 to 	 spread 	 the 	 cost 	 of 	 pensions 	 over 	 employees’ 	 estimated 	
working	lives	with	the	group.	The	contributions	are	determined	by	qualified	actuaries	on	the	basis	of	triennial	valuations	using	the	projected	unit	method.
The	liabilities	of	the	defined	benefit	schemes	are	measured	by	discounting	the	best	estimate	of	future	cash	flows	to	be	paid	out	by	the	schemes	using	
the	projected	unit	method.	This	is	the	amount,	after	taking	into	consideration	reimbursement	assets,	which	is	reflected	in	the	deficit	in	the	Balance	sheet.	
The	projected	unit	method	is	an	accrued	benefits	valuation	method	in	which	the	scheme	liabilities	make	allowance	for	projected	earnings.
Care UK LG Pension Scheme
The most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2006. At the date of the actuarial valuation the market value of the scheme’s assets was £2.5m and the 
actuarial	value	of	those	assets	represented	80%	of	the	benefits	that	had	accrued	to	members,	after	allowing	for	expected	future	increases	in	earnings.	
F ollowing	the	valuation	the	employer	contribution	rate	decreased	with	effect	from	1	October	2007	from	29.45%	to	29.40%.	The	group	will	monitor	
funding levels on an annual basis. The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 1 April 2009. The group considers that the contribution rates 
agreed	with	the	trustees	at	the	last	valuation	date	are	sufficient	to	eliminate	the	deficit	over	ten	years	and	that	regular	contributions	which	are	based	on	
service	costs	will	not	increase	significantly .
Employer contributions amounted to £0.8m (2006: £0.9m) for the year ended 30 September 2007. Employer contribution rates in respect of future years 
have	currently	been	agreed	at	29.40%	of	total	pensionable	salaries.
This scheme obtains approval by the Government Actuarial Department when new members join the scheme.
The	trustee’s	board	has	five	places,	three	of	which	are	nominated	by	the	employer	and	two	are	nominated	by	the	scheme	members.
Dorset County Council Pension Fund
The group is an admitted body of the Dorset County Council Local Government Pension Scheme. This is a closed scheme and no new members can be 
admitted. During the year ended 30 September 2006 a number of employees transferred to the group but continued to be members of Dorset County 
Council Pension Fund.
Under 	 the 	 rules 	 of 	 the 	 admission 	 agreement, 	 the 	 associated 	 pension 	 fund 	 assets 	 and 	 liabilities 	 are 	 separately 	 identifiable 	 and 	 segregated 	 for 	 funding 	 purposes.
Under	the	terms	of	the	group’s	contract	with	P oole	Borough	Council,	the	group	is	indemnified	for	any	shortfall	in	scheme	assets	and	for	any	increase	
in	contributions	required	by	any	future	actuarial	valuation;	hence	the	group	has	no	constructive	or	legal	obligation	to	fund	a	deficit	on	the	associated	
segregated	portion	of	the	scheme.	Accordingly ,	the	group	has	recognised	an	asset	equal	to	the	current	deficit	on	the	segregated	portion	of	the	scheme.	
This	reimbursement	asset	has	been	p r e s e n t e d 	 a s 	 o f f s e t t i n g 	 t h e 	 c u r r e n t 	 s c h e m e 	 d e fi c i t 	 o n 	 t h e 	 s e g r e g a t e d 	 p o r t i o n 	 o f 	 t h e 	 s c h e m e 	 a n d 	 i s 	 t h e r e f o r e 	 i n c l u d e d	
within 	 retirement 	 benefit 	 obligations.
The	most	recent	valuation	of	this	scheme	was	as	at	31	March	2004.	As	at	3	April	2006,	being	the	date	the	employees	were	transferred	to	the	group,	
the	segregated	portion	of	the	scheme	showed	that	the	value	of	the	scheme’s	assets	was	£1.4m	and	that	the	actuarial	value	of	those	assets	represented	
74%	of	the	benefits	that	had	accrued	to	members,	after	allowing	for	expected	future	increases	in	earnings.
Employer contributions amounted to £0.1m (2006: £0.1m) for the year to 30 September 2007. Contribution rates in respect of next year are expected 
to be 13.1% of total pensionable salary. 74 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007

The	derivation	of	the	overall	expected	return	on	assets	reflects	the	actual	asset	allocation	at	the	measurement	date	combined	with	an	expected	return	for	
each asset class. The bond return is based on the prevailing return available on high quality (AA or similar) corporate bonds. The returns on equities and 
property are based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long-term growth prospects for the economy in general, 
the long-term relationship between each asset class and the bond returns and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date. 
The actual return on plan assets was £0.5m (2006: £0.2m).

do not consider it meaningful to set out the interest and dividend payments made within the group as these are a function of the group’s central 
financing	arrangements.	There	are	no	provisions	or	expenses	recognised	for	doubtful	debts	with	subsidiary	undertakings.

29. accounting estimates and judgements
a) Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
The	preparation	of	the	financial	statements	in	conformity	with	adopted	IFRS	requires	management	to	make	estimates	and	assumptions	that	affect	the	
reported	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	at	the	date	of	the	financial	statements	and	the	reported	amounts	of	revenue	and	expenses	during	the	year	
then ended. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used in accounting for allowances for uncollectible receivables, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, share-based payments, 
pensions,	taxes	and	contingencies.	Estimates	and	assumptions	are	reviewed	periodically	and	the	effects	of	revisions	are	reflected	in	the	financial	
statements in the period that an adjustment is determined to be required.
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the group’s critical accounting policies and estimates and 
the application of these policies and estimates.
Significant	accounting	judgements	in	applying	the	group’s	accounting	policies	have	been	applied	by	the	group	in	order	to	prepare	the	consolidated	
financial	statements	with	respect	to	the	value	of	other	intangible	assets	and	goodwill	(note	10),	share-based	payments	(note	21),	financial	instruments	
(note 22) and pensions (note 23) and are described below:
Intangible assets
The	group	uses	forecast	cash	flow	information	and	estimates	of	future	growth	to	initially	value	other	intangible	assets,	to	assess	whether	goodwill	and	
other intangible assets are impaired, and to determine the useful economic lives of its intangible assets. If the results of operations in a future period are 
adverse to the estimates used for impairment testing, an impairment may be triggered at that point, or a reduction in useful economic life may be required.
Share-based payments
Details of the principal assumptions used in calculating the share-based payments expense are given in note 21. When a grant of share awards is made, 
management review the estimates and assumptions used and update them accordingly.
Financial instruments
Refer	to	the	section	on	financial	risk	management	below .
Pensions
Details	of	the	principal	actuarial	assumptions	used	in	calculating	the	recognised	liability	for	the	defined	benefit	plans	are	given	in	note	23.	Changes	to	the	
discount rate, mortality rates and actual return on plan assets may necessitate material adjustments to this liability in the future.
b) Financial risk management
i) Financial risk factors
The	group’s	operations	and	debt	financing	expose	it	to	a	variety	of	financial	risks	that	include	the	effects	of	changes	in	debt	market	prices,	credit	risks,	
liquidity	and	interest	rates.	The	group	has	a	risk	management	programme	that	seeks	to	limit	the	adverse	effects	on	the	financial	performance	of	the	
group	by	using	financial	instruments,	including	debt	and	other	instruments	to	fix	interest	rates.
The board of directors have the responsibility for settling the risk management policies applied by the group. The policies are implemented by the 
Finance	Director	who	receives	regular	reports	from	all	operating	companies	to	enable	prompt	identification	of	financial	risks	so	that	appropriate	actions	
may	be	taken.	A	group	treasury	objectives,	strategy	and	policies	paper	sets	out	specific	guidelines	to	manage	interest	rate	and	liquidity	risk	and	the	use	
of	financial	instruments	to	manage	these.
Interest rate risk
See note 22, Financial instruments.
Credit risk
The	group	has	no	significant	concentrations	of	credit	risk.	Customers	are	typically	local	authorities,	Primary	Care	T rusts	and	NHS	T rusts.	The	group	seeks	
to minimise the risk by obtaining, where practicable, long-term contracts for the services provided particularly where there is a substantial capital investment.
Liquidity risk
The	group	prepares	annual	cash	flow	forecasts	reflecting	known	commitments	and	anticipated	projects.	Borrowing	facilities	are	arranged	as	necessary	
to 	 finance 	 requirements. 	 The 	 group 	 has 	 available 	 bank 	 and 	 overdraft 	 facilities 	 totalling 	 £258.0m, 	 which 	 is 	 sufficient, 	 together 	 with 	 cash 	 flow 	 from 	 profits, 	 to 	
fund 	 present 	 commitments. 	 T erm 	 facilities 	 are 	 utilised 	 to 	 fund 	 capital 	 expenditure 	 and 	 short 	 term 	 flexibility 	 is 	 achieved 	 by 	 the 	 utilisation 	 of 	 overdraft 	 facilities. 80 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2007

29. accounting estimates and judgements continued
b) Financial risk management continued
i) Financial risk factors continued
Price risk
The	group	is	not	exposed	to	commodity	price	risk	but	as	a	provider	of	services	is	subject	to	both	general	and	industry	specific	wage	inflation	pressures,	
including legislative changes concerning the minimum wage level.
Foreign exchange risk
Care UK has a minimal level of foreign currency transactions; therefore no forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into. Foreign currency transactions 
are translated and settled at the prevailing spot rates on the date of the respective transactions, with any resulting gain or loss being taken to the Income 
statement.	There	are	no	overseas	subsidiaries	and	there	are	no	financial	assets	or	liabilities	denominated	in	foreign	currencies.	All	financial	assets	and	
liabilities are held in the functional currency of the group entities (sterling).
ii)	Accounting	for	derivative	financial	instruments	and	hedging	activities
The	group	uses	derivative	financial	instruments	to	hedge	its	exposure	to	interest	rate	risks	arising	from	its	financing	activities.	The	accounting	for	
derivative	financial	instruments	and	hedging	activities	is	described	in	the	group	accounting	policies	above.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging 
instrument. The group is also required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the 
hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis. This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains 
highly effective.
iii) Fair value estimation
See note 22, Financial instruments.

The contract provides for compensation to be payable in the event of voluntary termination. At this early stage it is not possible to quantify the level 
of compensation that is likely to be received but we have commenced discussions with the DoH regarding this.
The table below shows the values in respect of the non-current assets, net of related deferred tax, of the West Midlands diagnostics operating entity that 
are included in the group’s Consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2007.

Explanatory note regarding the special business
1.  At the annual general meeting of the company held on 7 February 2007, the directors were authorised for the purposes of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot 
relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,718,656. That authority will expire at the conclusion of the forthcoming annual general meeting. At this year’s 
annual general meeting, an Ordinary Resolution (Resolution 8) will be proposed to grant the directors authority under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot relevant 
securities	up	to	the	maximum	aggregate	nominal	amount	of	£1,895,044	representing	one	third	of	the	total	share	capital	of	the	company	in	issue	as	at	the	date	hereof .	The	
d i r e c t o r s 	 h a v e 	 n o 	 p r e s e n t 	 i n t e n t i o n 	 o f 	 e x e r c i s i n g 	 t h a t 	 a u t h o r i t y . 	 T h e 	 a u t h o r i t y 	 t o 	 a l l o t 	 u p 	 t o 	 £ 1 , 8 9 5 , 0 4 4 	 n o m i n a l 	 a g g r e g a t e 	 v a l u e 	 o f 	 r e l e v a n t 	 s e c u r i t i e s 	 t o 	 b e 	 c o n f e r r e d 	 p u r s u a n t 	 t o	
Resolution 8 will lapse on 30 April 2009 or on the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the company after the passing of such resolution, whichever is the earlier.
2.  At the annual general meeting of the company held on 7 February 2007, the directors were empowered for the purposes of Section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 to 
allot equity securities which are to be paid up in cash as if Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply to any such allotment for the purposes, inter alia, of the 
allotment of equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £257,798 otherwise than by way of rights. That authority will expire at the conclusion of the 
forthcoming annual general meeting. At this year’s annual general meeting, a Special Resolution (Resolution 9) will be proposed to empower the directors to allot equity 
securities for cash pursuant to the authority conferred upon them by Resolution 9 as if Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply to any such allotment 
provided that such power will be limited to the allotment of equity securities in connection with rights issues (as described in Resolution 9) and the allotment of equity 
securities	up	to	an	aggregate	nominal	value	of	£284,257,	representing	approximately	5	per	cent	of	the	total	ordinary	share	capital	in	issue	in	the	company	as	at	the	date	
hereof. The authority will terminate no later than 15 months after the passing of the Special Resolution.
3.  Resolution 10 authorises the company generally to make purchases of its own shares, as permitted by the Companies Act 1985, the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Listing 
Authority. The directors will only exercise this power of purchase in circumstances which, in the opinion of the directors should result in an improvement in earnings per 
share for the remaining shareholders and all such purchases will be made through the London Stock Exchange.
4.	 	 In	2007,	certain	p rovisions	of	the	Companies	Act	2006	and	the	Disclosures	and	T ransparency	Rules	Sourcebook	came	into	force.	These	provisions	govern	communication s	
in electronic form between the company and its shareholders.
  One of the key changes to the existing regime made by the new legislation is that a company may now satisfy certain of its obligations to send or supply documents or 
information to its shareholders by posting the documents or information to its shareholders on a website instead of sending or supplying the documents or information 
by post or other permitted means. In the case of website communications, the legislation requires that a company must continue to notify its shareholders (by post or 
other permitted means) of the presence of a document or information on the website. Previously legislation only facilitated the use of electronic communications in certain 
limited circumstances.
To enable the company to take advantage of these new provisions in the future, two requirements must be met:
 (i)  the shareholders of the company must be resolved that the company may send or supply documents or information to shareholders by making them available on 
a website (or the company’s Articles of Association must contain a provision to this effect); and
 (ii)  each relevant shareholder must have been asked individually by the company to agree that the company may send or supply documents or information to the 
shareholder by means of a website and the company must either have received a positive response or received no response within the period of 28 days beginning 
with the date on which the company’s request was sent. If the company receives a negative response within the period of 28 days, the company will continue to send 
shareholder information or documents to that shareholder by the post in accordance with the shareholder’s instructions. If no response is received within 28 days, 
the shareholder is deemed to consent to receiving shareholder information or document via the company’s website.
Please	note	that	it	is	currently	intended	to	continue	to	send	certain	communications	to	shareholders	by	post.	These	include	share	certificates,	dividend	cheques,	dividend	
payment vouchers and tax vouchers.

Notes:
1.  The results shown in the table have not been restated under adopted IFRS. The principal adjustments that would be required to restate the UK GAAP results to adopted 
IFRS would be: the cessation of goodwill amortisation and provision of intangible asset amortisation; inclusion of the pension deficit; additional equity-settled share-based 
payments expense; the joint venture presentational adjustment which presents joint venture taxation and interest within operating profit; and the cessation of accruing for 
proposed dividends.
2.  Adjusted operating profit is adjusted for integration & restructuring costs (2007), profit on Richmond property disposal (2006), amortisation of intangible assets 
(2007, 2006, 2005), impairment of goodwill (2006), joint venture net financing costs and taxation (2007, 2006, 2005), and amortisation of goodwill (2004, 2003). 
Basic adjusted earnings per share are also adjusted for the post taxation effects of these items.
3. Under adopted IFRS the final proposed dividend was not included as a liability in the Balance sheet, in accordance with ‘IAS 10 – Events after the Balance Sheet Date’.

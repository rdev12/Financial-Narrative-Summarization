Chairman’s Statement 
2 
There is no doubt the 12-month period to 31 December 2015 was a difficult period as the Company 
contended with a benign market for web-hosting and web-solutions across Southeast Asia. 
 
Notwithstanding the challenging trading environment, the Company continued to invest in new 
products and services and strengthened the balance sheet whilst developing strategic partnerships 
with a number of global enterprises to ensure the Company is well placed to win increasing numbers 
of larger new contracts this year and beyond. 
 
Strategic Partnerships 
I was particularly pleased to see the Company sign several important strategic partnerships during the 
period with multi-national organisations such as Hewlett Packard, CS Loxinfo and, post-period end, 
Alibaba Cloud, a subsidiary of Alibaba.com. It is now a strategic focus across the Company to partner 
with global enterprises, where possible, to ensure the Company is well placed to win significant levels 
of new business this year and beyond. 
 
Balance Sheet Strengthened 
During the period we appointed WH Ireland as nominated advisor and broker to the Company. The 
board believes WH Ireland is well placed to manage the Company’s investment profile in the capital 
markets and completed a subscription with investment company Coston-Smith Asset Management to 
raise £1.74m, before expenses, during the period. 
 
I was also particularly pleased with the level of shareholder support during the recent reverse Scrip 
Dividend, which was widely taken up by our shareholder base increasing both the liquidity in the 
Company’s equity whilst preserving the strength of the Company’s balance sheet. 
 
In combination, these two events, further strengthened the balance sheet to provide much needed 
funding for investment in new products and services and enhanced working capital facilities.  
 
I am now pleased to report the investment phase across all our products and services is now largely 
complete and working capital management at the subsidiary level has been significantly improved. 
 
Senior Personnel  
On 19 January 2015, Darren Hopkins ceased to be the Group's Interim Finance Director in order to 
enable him to take up another UK based opportunity. I would personally like to thank Darren for his 
work as Interim Finance Director, which assisted the Company develop its financial reporting 
processes and achieving its IPO. 
 
Cindy Choo joined RapidCloud as Finance Director shortly after and was appointed to the Board on 5 
February 2015. Cindy's appointment was consistent with RapidCloud's stated intention to appoint a 
full time Finance Director, based in Malaysia, to the Board. 
 
Finally, I would also like to thank the board and all the employees for their commitment and continued 
support, which have been invaluable during the past year and we can all now look to the future with 
increased confidence as the Company capitalises on the numerous opportunities this year and beyond.

Financial Review 
Since the beginning of the financial year under review, the Company has continued to invest in 
products, sales and marketing functions and has successfully launched several new products 
specifically designed for the enterprise segment, significantly expanding its addressable market. 
 
In order to fund the investment in products and further the commercial development of the Company, 
we announced two strategic financial events during the year to strengthen the balance. 
• In June 2015 the Company announced it had raised £1.74m (before expenses) by way of a 
subscription by the Southeast Asian asset management firm, Corston-Smith Asset 
Management (‘Corston-Smith’), who subsequently have a 14.88% holding in RapidCloud. 
• In December 2015, the Company paid its interim dividend of £0.0067 per share by way of cash 
of RM207,000 and a reverse scrip dividend of RM730,000. 
 
The collective effect of both of these events meant that the Company finished the year end with cash 
and cash equivalents of RM6.8m versus RM3.9m for the previous year despite the continued 
investment in Corporate and products development. 
 
Operational Review  
During the year, RapidCloud continued to sign new contracts and commercial agreements with 
significant partners and customers demonstrating its strong position across our target markets.  The 
progress achieved during the year and post the year end, described in more detail below, evidence 
the continued operational progress the Company is making. 
 
New Contract Wins 
RapidCloud has recently announced several new contracts, demonstrating the strong market position 
the Company commands and the increasing traction the Company’s products and services are gaining 
across out target markets across South East Asia: 
 
• In April 2015, the Company announced it had won a contract with RedBox, the award-winning 
courier service of AirAsia.  Under the initial five-year contract, RapidCloud will design, build 
and operate a cloud-based Logistic Management System (LMS) for RedBox, AirAsia.  The 
proprietary LMS will provide a complete end-to-end solution to monitor the entire shipment 
network with a fully integrated online Booking & Tracking portal.  The LMS will be hosted and 
operated from RapidCloud’s datacentre in Kuala Lumpur. 
• In May 2015, the Company also announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Emerge Systems 
(M) Sdn. Bhd., had won contracts with two major international companies for its newly 
launched PortalWEB product worth an aggregate RM1 million, (£0.18m) in the first year. 
o The first of these PortalWEB contract wins was with one of the world’s leading printing 
enterprises.  Under the terms of the Software-as-a-Service (‘SaaS’) contract, 
RapidCloud will build a framework and workflow system to handle internal purchase 
requisition, purchase orders, invoices, budgeting, contracts and assets management 
to automate the internal procurement approval processes. 
o The second contract was with a major Southeast Asian airline.  Under the terms of the 
SaaS contract, RapidCloud will build an internal Training Management System (‘TMS’) 
on its PortalWEB platform.  The TMS application will be developed to manage job 
posting, job recruitment, coaching, candidate profiling and on-the-job assessments.  
Job seekers, recruiters, trainers and administrative users will be granted different 
access controls and functionality to perform individual tasks.  Dashboards for Business 
Intelligence analysis will provide an overview of the various key performance 
indicators of the entire placement processes enabling company-wide decision 
making.

• In May 2016, the Company announced a contract win with Wellmart Online Sdn Bhd 
(‘Wellmart’), a subsidiary of the automotive & plantation conglomerate Delloyd Ventures Bhd, 
for the Company’s e-commerce portal system development tools and consulting services.  This 
contract is expected to generate revenue of approximately RM550,000 in its first year of 
operation. 
 
Commercial Progress 
 CS Loxinfo & Hewlett Packard 
In February 2015, the Company signed a strategic partnership agreement with CS Loxinfo PCL 
(‘CS Loxinfo’), a leading systems integrator and Internet Services Provides (ISP) in Thailand, for 
an initial period of three years, and announced its partnership with Hewlett Packard (‘HP’) in 
June 2015. 
 
CS Loxinfo is one of the most long-standing and recognised ISP brands in Thailand with 
considerable and wide-reaching customer base whereas HP is one of the most successful and 
recognised IT solutions providers in the world. 
 
This innovative partnership provides enterprise and SME customers with multiple large-
bandwidth redundant connections to International and domestic Internet gateways over a 
secure and scalable on-premise or public cloud delivery environment. 
 
Oriented Media Group Bhd 
In July 2015, the Company secured an agreement with Oriented Media Group Bhd (‘OMEDIA’) 
to develop a comprehensive Business-to-Business (‘B2B’) e-commerce platform for small to 
medium sportswear manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers across Asia. 
 
OMEDIA is a Malaysia-based company focused on software and services across the logistics 
and digital media industries. The logistics business offers web-based management systems to 
manage complex logistics networks while the digital media business offers a range of services 
including publishing massive multiplayer online games (MMOG), internet Ad serving and the 
development of edutainment related products and services. OMEDIA is listed on the 
Malaysian stock exchange.  
 
Under the 24-month agreement, RapidCloud will supply all the necessary hardware and 
software for OMEDIA to develop an Online Sportswear Trading Platform (‘OSTP’) to enable 
manufacturers, initially across the Fujian province of the Peoples Republic of China (’PRC‘) to 
market and trade their products with wholesalers and retailers directly online. 
 
RapidCloud will also offer additional modules for OMEDIA to enhance the OSTP over the term 
of the agreement to enable users to manage their own virtual storefronts, track and monitor 
customer accounts and improve their own finance and human resources via additional 
proprietary cloud based software and services. 
 
Alibaba Cloud 
In March 2016, RapidCloud signed a strategic partnership with Alibaba.com Singapore E-
commerce Private Limited (’Alibaba Cloud’), the international business and cloud computing 
arm of the Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA). 
 
Alibaba Cloud is one of the world's largest e-commerce companies, and was established in 
2009 to operate the network that powers Alibaba's extensive online and mobile commerce 
ecosystem with a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services globally.    
Chief Executive’s Statement 
5 
The partnership allows RapidCloud to offer Alibaba Cloud's public cloud infrastructure, 
consulting, managed services, training and support across its offices in South East Asia. 
RapidCloud will also make its key products available from Alibaba Cloud’s platform as a total 
service offering to its customers. After six months of research and development, RapidCloud's 
key products such as its enterprise content management system, sales automation tool and 
document management have already been developed to be tightly integrated onto Alibaba 
Cloud’s platform. This will allow Alibaba and Alibaba Cloud users to be able to subscribe to 
such services easily. 
 
The benefits of having RapidCloud's products on Alibaba Cloud platform include better 
reliability, faster access from various locations, including China and better scalability. At the 
same time, RapidCloud will also be working together with Alibaba Cloud and its parent 
company Alibaba to implement various go to market strategies and cross-selling 
opportunities. 
 
RapidCloud Singapore 
We are also pleased to report that RapidCloud Singapore has now become a Certified Partner 
of Google Inc. It is widely known that only the very best service providers receive the coveted 
Google Partner Badge and places RapidCloud Singapore amongst a small number of elite 
businesses offering services with this accreditation. 
 
This division is now a trusted agency of Google and listed on Google’s Partner Search, its 
proprietary online directory for trusted agencies for search engine optimisation and search 
engine marketing. As such, we expect RapidCloud to approach and secure larger contracts in 
the future with international ‘blue chip’ customers. 
 
SalesMAP Sdn. Bhd. 
Subsequent to the year end, SalesMAP Sdn. Bhd. was established in Malaysia to market and 
sell the Company’s flagship product, SalesMAP.  SalesMap is an intelligent sales system and a 
platform to build a structured sales process and manage sales performance. 
 
Whilst sales to date have been modest, the Company remains confident that this initiative will 
deliver significant shareholder value over the medium term. 
 
Product Development 
During the year the Company continued to invest in the development of new products and services 
and launched a number of new revenue initiatives during the year, specifically targeted at the needs 
of both existing and potential customers. 
 
RapidDocs 
The Company launched RapidDocs during the year, which provides Document Management 
Systems (‘DMS’) via the cloud. RapidDocs is believed to be one of the simplest and most cost 
effective DMS solution across Southeast Asia today. The DMS has been specifically designed 
to minimise the need for physical storage space, by eliminating duplicate documents, whilst 
ensuring collaboration on the most up to date copies are shared throughout the organisation 
for seamless collaboration. 
 
 
 
 
   
Chief Executive’s Statement

ManageWeb 
During the period, the Company successfully upgraded ‘ManageWeb’, its core website 
solution platform. Following the upgrade, which includes the addition of new features and 
operating enhancements, it has received significant new interest and recognition from its 
customer base by allowing them to optimise their user experience and enhance their business 
website. 
 
Internet of Things (‘IoT’) connectivity Management Solution 
The Company has now launched IoT Connectivity Management Solution that seamlessly 
addresses all the requirements of various industries currently deploying IoT solutions.  The IoT 
Connectivity Management Solution empowers them to collate, manage, monitor and report 
the data received from their IoT-enabled devices. 
 
Subsequent to the year end, the Company has also invested in the development of new cloud 
computing products and services. 
 
Disaster Recovery as a Service (‘DRaaS’) 
In May 2016, RapidCloud announced the launch of a Disaster Recovery as a Service. DRaaS is 
a cloud delivered disaster recovery managed service for protecting companies from loss of 
mission critical data in the event of a man-made or natural disaster. It is designed to ensure 
business continuity by minimising downtime and disruption in the event of server failure or 
other disaster. 
 
The Company signed two strategic partnerships, with Symphonet Sdn Bhd and Interlink 
Communication PCL in Malaysia and Thailand respectively, to market the DRaaS solution.  
 
Symphonet is a Malaysian fibre optic network operator offering dedicated high speed data 
Internet connections, wireless, Ethernet, leased lines, IP CCTV solutions, network services and 
network security services to over 1,000 businesses, large corporations and commercial 
buildings in Malaysia. 
 
Interlink is one of the largest fibre optic backbone providers in Thailand and is currently 
engaged in implementation of high speed structured telecommunication networks and 
distribution of networking solutions. Interlink is publicly traded on the mainboard of the Stock 
Exchange of Thailand (SET).  
 
These strategic partnerships allow Symphonet and Interlink to offer their customers a 
selection of RapidCloud's enterprise applications, beginning with DRaaS, which can be 
packaged together with their fibre connectivity, to provide a seamless and reliable high-speed 
transfer of critical data between the customer's primary server and RapidCloud's DRaaS 
facility. 
 
Ximplify 
Ximplify is a cloud business email service and is already one of the most affordable and fully-
featured business email in the market today. The Company will make this service available 
globally and Ximplify is the brand that will propel us to become a global cloud computing 
service provider.

Outlook 
2015 was undoubtedly a period of consolidation with significant investment in products, services and 
the sales and marketing functions across the Company against a difficult market backdrop across the 
Southeast Asia region. 
 
The commercial agreements now signed, with both national and international organisations, 
demonstrate the strength of the Company’s products and services and the board believes the launch 
of the new products and services, coupled with the strong financial control of all aspects of the Group, 
has positioned the Company for significant and sustainable profitable growth during 2016 and beyond.

Directors’ Report 
For the year ended 31 December 2015 
11 
 
 
The directors of RapidCloud International Plc (‘RCI’ or the ‘Company’) present their report together 
with the audited consolidated financial statements of RCI and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) 
for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
 
Principal activities and business review 
The Group’s principal activity during the year was the provision of software solutions to businesses 
through Southeast Asia.  A full review of the Group’s business operations is set out in the Chairman’s 
Statement and Chief Executive’s Statement. 
 
The Company was incorporated in Jersey on 15 March 2013 as a private company originally under the 
name RapidCloud Limited.  On 3 July 2013 the Company re-registered as a public company and 
changed its name to RapidCloud International Plc.  On 14 August 2013, the Company was admitted to 
the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
 
During the year the Group increased both its client base and product offering which has contributed 
to revenue of RM17.15 million (2014: RM17.82 million) and profit after tax of RM0.86 million (2014: 
RM3.67 million). 
 
Outlook 
The directors are pleased that the Company has launched new solutions into the addressable market 
over the past year.  With these new products and services, we are focused on delivering value to our 
customers for sustainable and profitable growth in 2016 and beyond.  We continue to consolidate and 
strengthen our sales and marketing operations and broaden our technical skillsets to capitalise on 
numerous opportunities. 
 
Results and dividends  
During the year, the Group made a profit after taxation of RM0.86 million (2014: RM3.67 million). 
 
Dividends totalling RM0.94 million were paid during the year through cash of RM0.21 million and scrip 
of RM0.73 million at share price of 25.85p. 
 
Risks relating to the Group and its business 
 
Competition 
There is significant competition in the software industry with low barriers to entry, new entrants and 
larger competitors with significant financial resources.  There is risk that competitors have or will 
develop products that are competitive to the Group in terms of functionality, quality or price. 
 
Technological evolution 
Changing customer needs, introduction of new products and continual technologies evolution may 
impact the Group’s business products.  To mitigate this risk, the Group continuously invests in the 
research and development of new customer centric products.   
Directors’ Report  
For the year ended 31 December 2015  
12 
 
 
Economic, legislative and political risks 
The Group may be affected by the adverse developments in the political, economic and regulatory 
environment in which the Group operates.  Uncertainties in the political and economic environment 
include: expropriation; nationalisation; inflation and deflation; changes in interest rates and taxation 
regime and currency exchange control.  Any deterioration in the economic climate could result in the 
delay or cancellation of customers’ technology investment projects and in a more prolonged economic 
downturn, it may lead to the overall decline in the sales of the Group that restrict the growth and 
profitability of the Group.  Whilst the Group strives to continue to take measures to protect itself 
against such risks with prudent financial management and efficient operating procedures, there is no 
assurance that adverse political, economic and regulatory environments will not adversely affect the 
Group. 
 
Credit Risk 
The Group adopts a policy of only dealing with counterparties that the Directors consider to be credit 
worthy. Receivables are monitored on an on-going basis via Group’s management reporting 
procedures and action will be taken for long outstanding debts deemed irrecoverable. While the 
Group had a high level of old receivables at the year end, action is being taken to recover old balances 
and a more formal credit control policy is to be implemented to ensure that the recoverability of 
receivables improves in the future.  
 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group may experience fluctuations in exchange rates that may have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s profitability or pricing competitiveness for its products and services.  There can be no 
guarantee that the Group would be able to compensate or hedge against such adverse effects and 
negative exchange rate effects could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and 
financial performance. 
 
Protection of intellectual property 
The Group protects its proprietary rights on its software for major technology platforms where the 
core products are built. These protected platforms are SME WebCombo, E-Commerce Combo and 
TotalWEB! Lite.  The Group is also reliant on the internal processes and systems to protect such rights.  
Whilst the Directors believe that the Group’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights in its proprietary 
systems, processes and software are adequate, there is a risk that they may not suffice to prevent 
misappropriation of its intellectual property and it may not be able to detect unauthorised use of or 
take appropriate steps to enforce, its intellectual property rights.

to have sufficient funding to continue in business.  For this reason, the Board continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
 
   
Directors’ Report  
For the year ended 31 December 2015  
14 
 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare the financial statements for each financial year.  Under 
that law, the Directors have prepared the financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.  Under company law, the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group as at the end of the financial year and profit or loss of the 
Group for the financial year then ended.  In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 
• state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is appropriate to 
presume that the Group will not continue in business. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group.  They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
Directors’ disclosure to the auditors 
The Directors confirm that: 
 
• to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the 
preparation of their report of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and 
 
• each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken 
to be aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are 
aware of the information.

Remuneration policy 
The objective of the remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives to

benefits as determined by the Board.  Each Executive Director has a service agreement that can be 
terminated by either party giving to the other 6 months’ written notice.  Compensation for loss of 
office is restricted to base salary and benefits only. 
 
The remuneration package for the Executive Directors comprise: 
 
Base salary – annual review of the base salaries of the Executive Directors is conducted after taking 
into account the Executive Director’s roles, responsibilities and contributions to Group performance. 
 
Benefits – benefits include payments for provident funds that are mandatory and statutory pension 
payments as required by laws of the resident countries of the Executive Directors, health insurance 
and other benefits.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
To the members of Rapidcloud International plc 
For the year ended 31 December 2015 
20 
We have audited the Group financial statements of RapidCloud International plc for the year ended 
31 December 2015 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 14, the Directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's (APB's) Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. 
 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB's website at 
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm. 
 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of 
the Group's profit for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
and 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. 
 
Emphasis of matter – Recoverability of trade receivables 
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not qualified, we have considered the 
adequacy of the disclosure made in note 16 to the financial statements concerning the Group’s ability 
to recover its trade receivables. As discussed in note 16, at 31 December 2015 the Group had trade 
receivables of RM14.6 million (2014: RM10.2 million), including RM4.7 million (2014: RM766,000) 
which had been outstanding for over one year at the year end date.  
 
The continued high level of long outstanding receivables indicates an increased degree of uncertainty 
as to whether the debts may be collectible in full and may cast doubt on the Group’s policies and 
procedures for effective debt collection. The Directors have reviewed the outstanding receivables in 
detail and made impairment provisions of RM853,000 against receivables that they believe are at risk 
of not being received in full. The Directors therefore are of the opinion that the unprovided receivables 
will be collected in full and they are making efforts to do so. 
   
Independent Auditors’ Report 
To the members of Rapidcloud International plc 
For the year ended 31 December 2015 
21 
 
The financial statements do not include adjustments that would result from further impairment of 
trade receivables if the Group were unable to collect its debts in full. 
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• we have not received any information or explanation that was necessary for our audit.

1.  Accounting policies 
 
RapidCloud International Plc (‘RCI’ or the ‘Company’) is a company registered and incorporated in 
Jersey on 15 March 2013.  The address of the registered office is 13-14 Esplanade, St. Helier, Jersey, 
JE1 1 BD. 
 
The consolidated financial statements of RapidCloud International Plc and its subsidiaries (together 
the ‘Group’) are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (‘RM’), which is the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.  The functional currency for each individual entity is the local 
currency of each individual entity.  The primary economic environment for the Group is Malaysia.  All 
amounts are prepared to the nearest thousand (RM’000) except where otherwise indicated. 
 
2.  Adoption of new and revised IFRS standards 
 
The Group has not applied in advance the following accounting standards and interpretations, 
including the consequential amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.  The transfer 
to these new or revised standards and interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the 
financial statements. 
 
Standard Effective Date 
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 
Amendments to IAS 1 – Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2016 
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 – Clarification of 
Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation

3.  Significant accounting policies 
 
3.1 Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’). 
 
3.2 Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for 
financial instruments that are measured at the fair values at the end of each reporting period, as 
explained in the accounting policies below. 
 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods 
and services.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of 
whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.

3.  Significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
3.3 Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities 
controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Control is achieved when the Company: 
 
• has power over the investee; 
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
 
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases 
when the Company loses control of the subsidiary.  Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss 
and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the 
Company ceases to control the subsidiary. 
 
Purchase method 
Under the purchase method, the results of the subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included from 
the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. At the date of acquisition, the fair values of the 
subsidiaries’ net assets are determined and these values are reflected in the consolidated financial 
statements. The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of 
exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquire, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. 
 
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions are eliminated; unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered. Where necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of subsidiaries to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of 
the Group. 
 
3.4 Goodwill 
Goodwill represent the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the Group’s share 
of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries at the 
date of acquisition. 
 
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. The carrying value of 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually. The impairment value of goodwill is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets of the subsidiaries exceeds the cost of the business combinations, the excess is recognised as 
income immediately in profit or loss. 
 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or cash-generating units. Subject to operating segment ceiling test, for the purpose of 
goodwill impairment testing, cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are 
aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at 
which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. The goodwill acquired in a business 
combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to a cash-generating unit or a group 
of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

3.  Significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
3.4 Goodwill (continued) 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value-in-use and its 
fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit. 
 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds 
its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss, unless the asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which such impairment loss is recognised directly against any 
revaluation surplus for the asset to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the amount 
in the revaluation surplus for that same asset. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-
generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the 
other assets in the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) on a pro rata basis. 
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses 
recognised in prior periods are assessed at the end of each reporting period for any indications that 
the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was 
recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its 
recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for asset in prior years. Such 
reversal is recognised in the profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
 
3.5 Foreign currency translation 
 
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entities operate (the functional 
currency).The consolidated financial information is presented in Malaysia Ringgits (‘RM’), which is 
RCI’s functional and presentational currency. 
 
Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions.  Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
 
Foreign operations 
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to RM at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
end of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange 
rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. All exchange differences arising from translation are taken 
directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the translation reserve. On 
the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive 
income relating to that particular foreign operation is reclassified from equity to profit or loss.

3.  Significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
3.6 Financial instruments 
 
Financial assets 
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a 
financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the time-
frame established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction 
costs, except for those financial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially 
measured at fair value. 
 
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.  Loans and receivables are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment.  Interest 
income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate method, except for short-term receivables 
where the recognition of interest would be immaterial. 
 
Impairment of assets 
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, a provision for impairment of 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.  The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the recoverable amount.  Provisions for 
impairment of receivables are included in the statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with 
the substance of the contractual agreement. 
 
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all its liabilities.  Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. 
 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction 
costs. 
 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, with interest expense recognised on an effective basis. 
 
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised costs of a financial liability 
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.  The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

3.  Significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
3.7 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset on 
a straight line basis over their expected useful lives, as follow: 
 
Fixtures and equipment   5 years 
Office equipment   5 – 10 years 
Computer equipment   3 years 
Motor vehicles    5 years 
Renovation    10 years 
Signboard    10 years 
Sun Microsystems   5 years 
 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each statement of financial 
position date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.  If any such indication 
exists, the assets are tested for impairment to estimate the assets’ recoverable amounts.  Any 
impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each 
statement of financial position date.  Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the 
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the statement of comprehensive 
income. 
 
3.8 Software development expenditure 
Software research costs are charged as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.  Software 
development costs are charged as an expense in the period incurred unless RCI believes: 
 
• an asset is create that can be identified (a new software product); 
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and 
• the development cost of the asset can be reliably measured. 
 
The capitalised software development costs of the Group are amortised on a straight line basis over 
the estimated useful lives of the assets which is currently assessed to be 5 years. 
 
Impairment of assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be 
impaired.  If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.  An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.  Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
 
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.

3.9 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost and comprise cash 
in hand, cash at bank, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less.  Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are 
included within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of financial position.  For the 
purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts if they 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management. 
 
3.10 Leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor 
are classified as operating leases.  Payments under operating leases (net of any incentives received 
from the lessor) are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over 
the period of the lease. 
 
3.11 Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the 
Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.  Revenue is recognised when the services are 
supplied and is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable net of sales tax, 
returns, rebates or discounts and after eliminating sales with the Group.  The Group recognises 
revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and specific delivery criteria have been met. 
 
Deferred revenue is recognised to the extent that services have been invoiced but have not yet been 
delivered and accordingly are recognised as a liability within accruals and deferred income in the 
statement of financial position. 
 
3.12 Financial income and expenses 
Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances and deposits.  Interest income is 
recognised when the right to receive payments is established. 
 
Financial expenses comprise interest payable on bank loans, hire purchase liabilities’ charges and 
other financial costs and charges.  Interest payable is recognised on an accrual basis. 
 
3.13 Employee benefits 
 
Short term employee benefits 
Wages, salaries, paid annual leave, paid sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognised 
as an expense in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees. 
 
Post-employment benefits 
The Group pays monthly contributions to defined contribution plans.  The legal or constructive 
obligation of the Group is limited to the amount that they agree to contribute to the plan.  The 
contributions to the plan are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period to 
which they relate.

3.  Significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
3.14 Current and deferred income tax 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the statement of financial position date.  Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the 
liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.   
 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
 
4. Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
 
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make 
judgement, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.  Judgements and estimates are 
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  The resulting accounting 
estimates may differ from the related actual results.  The estimates and assumptions that have a risk 
of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the future 
financial years are as follows: 
 
Depreciation, useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment 
The Directors estimate the useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment in order 
to calculate the depreciation charges.  Changes in these estimates could result in changes being 
required to the annual depreciation charges in the statement of comprehensive income and the 
carrying values of the property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position. 
 
Amortisation, useful lives and residual values of software development assets 
The Directors estimate the useful lives and residual values of software development assets in order to 
calculate the amortisation charges.  Changes in these estimates could result in changes being required 
to the annual amortisation charges in the statement of comprehensive income and the carrying values 
of the software development assets in the statements of financial position. 
 
Deferred tax liability 
The Group estimates future profitability in arriving at the fair value of the deferred tax assets and 
liabilities.  If the final tax outcome is different to the estimated deferred tax amount, the resulting 
changes will be reflected in the statement of comprehensive income, unless the tax relates to an item 
charged to equity in which case the changes in tax estimates will also be reflected in equity.

4. Significant accounting judgements and estimates (continued) 
 
Judgements 
 In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following 
significant judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which may have a significant effect on 
amounts recognised in the financial statements: 
 
• impairment of assets (including receivables, goodwill, software development expenditure and 
property, plant and equipment); 
• timing of recognition of revenue on project contracts. 
 
Impairment of receivables 
The Group accesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that 
a receivable is impaired.  To determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment, the Group 
considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the 
receivables and default or significant delay in payments. Further details on the Group’s outstanding 
receivables are in note 16. 
 
5. Revenue 
 
Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods sold and services rendered, net of discounts and 
returns.  Revenue is derived from the Group’s principal activity of the provision of computer products 
and services using cloud computing technology along with the development of software to support 
the services. Revenue analysed by geographical area was as follows: 
 
 2015 
RM’000 
2014 
RM’000 
Malaysia 13,078 13,598 
Singapore 3,218 3,679 
Thailand 215 97 
Philippines 570 413 
Indonesia 72 33 
 17,153 17,820 
 
6. Operating segments 
 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it 
may earn revenues and incur expenses.  IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires disclosure of the 
operating segments that are reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’).  The CODM at 
the end of the financial year under review has been identified as the Board of Directors who have 
responsibility for planning and controlling the activities of the Group.  The Group’s reportable segment 
has been identified as the provision of Cloud Computing services.  Across the Group there is 
considered to be a commonality in the nature of services, the type of customer, the methods used to 
provide services and the regulatory environment. 
 
All operations of the Group are carried out in Southeast Asia.  All revenues therefore arise within 
Southeast Asia.  No single external customer amounts to 10 per cent or more of the Group’s revenue.  
 
As the Group only has one reportable segment, no further segmental information is disclosed.

The government of Malaysia awarded Multimedia Super Corridor (“MSC”) status to a subsidiary, 
RapidCloud (M) Sdn. Bhd. (formerly known as Emerge Systems (M) Sdn. Bhd.) on 28 June 2013, and 
was granted pioneer status by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry for services under the 
Promotion of Investment Act 1986 in which the statutory income is exempted from tax for a period of 
five (5) years from 28 June 2013. 
 
11. Earnings per share 
 
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following: 
 
 2015
RM’000
2014
RM’000
Profit for the financial period after tax and basic earnings 
attributable to ordinary shareholders 856 3,671
 
 Number Number
Weighted average numbers of ordinary shares 20,401,402 17,831,934
 
 
 Sen Sen 
Earnings per share:  
Basic 4.20 20.59 
 
If the basic earnings per share is diluted by the 650,000 deferred contingent shares to be issued as 
part of the acquisition of RapidCloud Singapore Pte. Ltd. (note 14) the dilutive earnings per share

Software development assets comprise capitalised development costs on software products.  These 
costs are internally generated wages and salaries arising from the Group’s software developers and 
are recognised only if all the following conditions are met: 
 
• an asset is created that can be identified; 
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefit; and 
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 
Once development has been completed the software development assets are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their useful lives, which is assessed annually and is currently considered to be 5 years. 
 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an asset that may be impaired.  If any such 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an 
estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.  An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those 
from other assets or groups of assets.  Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
 
There have been no impairments in the financial year under review.

(b) Acquisition of subsidiaries  
 
i) Emerge Systems (Thailand) Ltd and Sharksurf Philippines Incorporated 
 
Although the Group owns less than half of the ownership interest in Emerge Systems (Thailand) Ltd 
(‘EST’) and Sharksurf Philippines Incorporated (‘SPI’) and less than half of their voting powers, the 
Directors have determined that the Group controls these two entities.  On 1 January 2014, the Group 
obtained control of EST and SPI by virtue of written undertakings with other shareholders of EST and 
SPIand the Group now has full and absolute control of the management and business operations of 
EST and SPI.

On 15 January 2014, the Group incorporated a new subsidiary, PT RapidCloud Indonesia, with share 
capital of RM994,156 (IDR3,657,300,000).  This entity is 100% owned by the Group. 
 
iii) RapidCloud Singapore Pte. Ltd. 
 
On 23 July 2014, the Group acquired Exxelnet Solutions Pte. Ltd.  On 30 October 2014, Exxelnet 
Solutions Pte. Ltd. was renamed to RapidCloud Singapore Pte. Ltd. (‘RCSG’). 
 
Goodwill was recognised as a result of the RCSG acquisition as follows:

RCSG was acquired in 2014 at a cash consideration of RM2,520,000 payable to the sellers and with 
deferred consideration (contingent on future profitability over 36 months following the acquisition 
date) to be settled by up to 650,000 new shares of RCI, which is estimated to be at RM2,074,000.

14. Subsidiaries (continued) 
 
The goodwill recognised above comprises expected synergies, revenue growth and future product and 
market developments. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill because they do 
not meet the criteria for separately identifiable intangible assets.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated for impairment testing to the cash-generating 
units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business combination, as follows:

Impairment testing of goodwill 
RCI tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of the CGU’s are determined from value-in-use 
calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount 
rates, growth rates and expected changes to forecast profitability. These assumptions have been 
revised in the year to take account of the current economic environment. Management estimates 
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to each CGU. Future cash flows are derived from the most recent financial 
budget approved by management for the next two years, beyond that period cash flows are 
extrapolated using a growth rate of 3%.  The rate used to discount forecast future cash flows is 10% 
which represents the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.  The test result for each CGU shows 
the recoverable amount is greater than its value in use.

15. Intangible assets and goodwill (continued) 
 
In 2015 no impairment charge has been made against goodwill for any CGU (2014: nil) as the 
impairment tests resulted in headroom for each CGU indicating the recoverable amount is greater 
than the value in use.  RCI has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s 
carrying value by sensitizing the discount rate and reducing the long term growth rate to 0% and the 
results do not indicate the need to create an impairment charge in any CGU.

The Group’s normal trade credit term range from 30 to 60 days.  Other credit terms are assessed and 
approved on case-by-case basis.  The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk that may 
arise from exposure to a single debtor.  Exposure to credit and currency risks related to trade and 
other receivables is disclosed in note 23.  The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and 
other receivables to be approximate to their fair values.

At 31 December 2015 the Group had trade receivables of RM14.6 million (2014: RM10.2 million), 
including RM4.7 million (2014: RM766,000) which had been outstanding for over one year at the year 
end date (see below).  
 
The continued high level of long outstanding receivables indicates an increased degree of uncertainty 
as to whether the debts may be collectible in full.

16. Trade and other receivables (continued) 
 
Trade receivables above include amounts that are past due at the year end but against which no 
allowance for doubtful receivables has been made. All of the Group’s trade receivables have been 
reviewed for indicators of impairment and impairment provisions of RM853,000 have been made 
against receivables thought to be at risk of not being received in full. The Directors believe that the 
unprovided receivables will be collected in full and they are making every effort to do so. The Directors 
are also putting in place improved debt collection procedures and a formal debt provision policy.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies 
The Group’s financial risk management policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are 
available for the development of the Group’s business whilst managing its risks.  The Group does not 
engage in speculative transactions or hedging transactions. 
 
The Group’s principal financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents.  The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations.  The Group has other financial 
instruments such as receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations. 
 
 
 
 
   
Notes to the Consolidated of Financial Statements  
For the year ended 31 December 2015

23. Financial instruments (continued) 
 
The Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk 
management and they recognise that financial risk management is an area in which they may need to 
develop specific policies should the Group become exposed to further financial risks as the business 
develops. 
 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market price 
risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.  This note presents information about the Group’s 
exposure to each of these risks.  The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these 
risks as and when they arise.  Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial 
information. 
 
Credit Risk 
Credit risk arises mainly from the inability of customers to make payments when due.  The Group has 
adopted a policy of only dealing with counterparties that the Directors consider to be credit worthy.  
Receivables are monitored on an on-going basis via Group’s management reporting procedures and 
action will be taken for long outstanding debts deemed irrecoverable. 
 
The carrying amounts of the financial assets recorded on the statement of financial position at the 
end of the reporting period represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to 
financial assets.  Cash at banks are placed with financial institutions that the Directors consider to be 
credit worthy. 
 
The Group’s credit risk exposure relates to the Group’s debts and is discussed in greater detail in note 
16. 
 
Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  
As part of its overall prudent liquidity risk management, the Group actively manages its cash flows and 
ensures that sufficient funding is in place to meet the obligations as and when they fall due.

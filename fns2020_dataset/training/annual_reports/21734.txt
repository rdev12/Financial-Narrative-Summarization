Return of Capital
In July 2012 Booker Group plc issued £124m of shareholder equity to acquire Makro in the UK. Following the successful integration 
of Makro into the Group and a period of strong cash generation, the Board implemented a capital return to shareholders of 3.50 
pence per ordinary share in each of July 2014 and July 2015 at a cost of approximately £61m pa. Given the continued successful 
development of the Group, the Board is proposing a third capital return to shareholders of 3.20 pence per ordinary share (at a cost 
of approximately £57m, based on the current issued share capital of the Group). It is again proposed that this is achieved by the 
issue of a new class of ‘B’ shares which shareholders will be able to redeem for cash. The return of capital requires the approval of 
shareholders, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting on 6 July 2016. Further details of the proposed return of capital 
will be set out in a circular to shareholders which will accompany the notice convening this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
We currently anticipate returning a similar amount to shareholders in July 2017 and will provide an update on this at the 2017 Final 
Results announcement in May 2017 in light of circumstances prevailing at that time.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report that Booker 
Group has delivered another good 
performance. In the 52 weeks to 25 
March 2016 sales rose by 5.0% to 
£5.0bn and operating profit (before 
exceptional items) of £155.1m was up 
11%. Customer satisfaction was strong. 
The financial performance was good 
and the Group ended the financial 
year with net cash of £127.4m. Our 
‘Drive’ plans are working well with 
progress on the catering and retail 
sides of the business. Our like-for-like 
sales to caterers were +0.6% including 
Classic (our on-trade supply business) 
and +1.9% excluding Classic. Our 
like-for-like sales to retailers declined 
by 2.2% primarily due to the effects 
of the ban on small stores displaying 
tobacco products. 
The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business 
are going well. In the 52 weeks to  
25 March 2016 Booker distributed 
£1.8bn of product to our customers’ 
premises versus £1.4bn last year as 
we continue to expand our delivered 
service. Digital sales were £979m 
compared to £874m in the previous year 
and Booker India is making progress. 
On 14 September 2015, Budgens and 
Londis joined the Group. They have 
fitted in well and will help us improve 
choice, prices and service to all our 
retail customers.
Basic earnings per share were 7.24 
pence, up from 6.73 pence last year. 
Given the strong operational 
performance and cash flow of the 
business the Board recommends the 
payment of a final dividend of 4.03 
pence per share (2015: 3.14 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim 
dividend, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 4.60 pence per share (2015: 3.66 
pence per share). The final dividend is 
payable on 8 July 2016 to shareholders 
on the register on 10 June 2016.
In addition to the final dividend, the Board 
is recommending a capital return to 
shareholders of 3.20 pence per ordinary 
share (at a cost of approximately £57m, 
based on the current issued share 
capital of the Group). This follows the 
capital return of 3.50 pence per share to 
shareholders in each of July 2014 and July 
2015. We currently anticipate returning 
a similar amount to shareholders in 
July 2017.
During the year, Richard Rose stepped 
down as Chairman. I would like to thank 
him for the contribution he made to the 
Group in his nine years as Chairman. 
Bryn Satherley also stepped down from 
the Board. In the past ten years Bryn 
has been responsible for Property, IT, 
Supply Chain and Distribution and has 
made a great contribution to Booker. 
In December Gary Hughes joined the 
Board and will succeed Andrew Cripps 
as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
after this year’s Interim Results in  
October 2016. 
I should like to thank all our colleagues 
for their contribution to the success of 
the Group in the year just ended.
Outlook
The Group’s trading in the first seven 
weeks of the current financial year 
is ahead of last year. However, we 
anticipate that the challenging consumer 
and market environment will persist 
through the coming year and the UK’s 
food market remains very competitive.
Whilst there is increasing price 
competition in the UK grocery and 
discount sectors, we will continue to 
deliver our plans to offer our customers 
even better choice, prices and service 
supported by the continued delivery 
of our efficiency programmes. We 
are on track to deliver an outcome for 
the new financial year in line with our 
plans and to make progress in this 
challenging environment. 
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 6 July 2016. The notice of Annual 
General Meeting and a circular setting 
out further details of the proposed 
return of capital, which itself requires 
shareholder approval, will be issued to 
shareholders in due course.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Booker Wholesale Customer Satisfaction (% recommend)
Premier retailers are now delivered 
from Makro business centres rather 
than Booker.
Choice Up
• Booker seeks to grow brand and own 
brand sales.
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 25 March 
2016 were £65m. This is despite 
considerable deflation in the fresh 
markets. The quality and freshness of 
the produce is second to none and 
can be delivered to our customers 
within 48 hours of being harvested.
• We launched CleanPro in 2014. 
This range of professional cleaning 
products has been well received 
by customers. We have 50,000 
customers buying CleanPro each 
week with sales of £42m per annum.
• We continue to improve the ‘good, 
better, best’ of the offer in order to 
satisfy all customers, for example, 
our new frozen bread range meets  
all needs.
Since November 2005 Booker Group 
has been seeking to ‘Focus, Drive 
and Broaden’ the business. 2015 
was a challenging year. In April 2015 
the display of tobacco products was 
banned in small shops in the UK. This 
depressed our retail customer sales. 
Continued price deflation depressed top 
line sales growth and we suffered the 
worst Summer weather in recent years. 
Despite these challenges the Group 
continued to make good progress on 
both the catering and retail sides of 
the business.
FOCUS (commenced  
November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
efficient operator in our sector. We 
continue to improve business efficiency. 
We ‘stop, simplify and standardise’ 
work and invest most of the resulting 
savings in customer service. During 
the year we bedded down the new 
organisation structure. We rolled out 
our new fleet of vehicles, we extended 
the use of ‘self-scan’ and overhauled 
stock management. Our close attention 
to cash has resulted in having £127m of 
net cash, whilst keeping the Group cost 
base in line with last year (pre Budgens 
and Londis).
DRIVE (commenced March 2006)
Thanks to the hard work of Guy Farrant 
and the team, Booker Wholesale/Makro, 
our cash and carry businesses had a 
good year. It served 1,252,000 customers 
this year. We continue to ‘Drive’ choice, 
price and service for our customers. 
Each year we survey 45,000 customers 
to identify where improvements can be 
made. Customer satisfaction is a key 
measure within the business and we have 
made significant progress since 2006. 
Booker and Makro now have a common 
business centre operating structure 
reporting to Andrew Muldoon. This 
enables the Group to move business 
from one location to another to improve 
operational efficiency, health safe 
and legal objectives and customer 
satisfaction. For example, five hundred

were the best we’ve ever achieved.”

Booker’s Pricing vs Cash & Carry Market
Prices Down
• We operate in a very price competitive 
market. Every week we monitor 
prices versus competitors and during 
the year our price index remained 
competitive. We are continuing to 
keep our core line prices at market 
leading levels to provide the best 
possible margin for our customers. 
During the year we saw significant 
price deflation, particularly in 
the catering sector. Booker has 
consistently offered low prices on 
these core products and maintains 
its promise of helping the customer 
during challenging times.
Better Service
• Our people are doing an excellent 
job. Our customers rate Booker 
people highly. Business Centre 
teams across the Group have been 
trained in PRIDE to help improve the 
Parking, Reception, Internal, Delivery 
and Exit experience.
• We have continued to expand and 
improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers 
and greengrocers within the business 
than last year. We also have skilled 
fishmongers operating in our Makro 
Business Centres.
Business Centre Delivery
• Booker offers a seven days a 
week multi-temperature delivery 
service to both retail and catering 
customers (70% of the fleet has 
multi temperature capacity). All 
of our delivery customers pay the 
same price for goods as our collect 
customers. Our delivery business 
continues to grow (from £600m in 
2008/9 to £1.8bn in 2015/16).
• During the year we completed the roll 
out of our new fleet comprising 550 
vehicles of 3 types. As a result of this, 
as well as through separating our 
Business Centres into small, medium 
and large, Booker and Makro 
has increased Business Centre 
delivery capacity.
Categories
• Our catering, small business and 
retail customers are served by 
our trading teams. These are led 
by; Dominic Morrey, Fresh and 
Ritter, Steve Roper, Drinks and 
Classic, Colm Johnson our Impulse 
categories, Mark Dineen Catering 
and Adrian McKeon for the Budgens 
and Londis businesses. Together 
with their teams, they report into 
Andrew Thompson and Guy Farrant. 
We really value the support from, and 
our relationships with, our suppliers 
and strive to become their preferred 
route to market in the UK.
Caterers/Small Business
• In the past two years we have 
restructured the Group, so that all 
our catering and small business 
customers are coordinated by Stuart 
Hyslop and his team. Consequently, 
Independents, Group Accounts 
and National Chains can draw 
upon the Booker, Makro, Classic 
and Chef Direct infrastructures.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
This has helped strengthen caterer 
satisfaction and grown like-for-like 
catering sales by 0.6% including 
Classic, and by 1.9% excluding 
Classic. This is despite continued 
price deflation in the catering market 
Classic is our on trade wholesale 
business. During the year we made 
the decision to concentrate our 
teams on improving our beer, wine 
and spirits offer in Booker and Makro 
and exited some unprofitable keg 
and on-trade business. 
• We have also made good progress 
with Group Accounts, such as 
Cosmo and Enterprise Inns, where 
we serve these accounts from 
Booker and Makro. 
• Our Chef Direct business, which 
serves national accounts from our 
distribution centre in Didcot has 
also had a good year serving clients 
including Byron Burgers, Ed’s Easy 
Diner and Wagamama.
 
Retailers
• All our retail customers, be they 
Premier, Londis, Budgens, Family 
Shopper, retail club members, 
unaffiliated independents or retail 
national accounts are coordinated by 
Steve Fox and his team.
Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew to 3,213 stores (3,082 stores 
last year). Non-tobacco sales to 
these customers grew by 10%. The 
retail development team has put 
a lot of work into both compliance 
and building the sales and profits of 
existing Premier stores.
• Premier still remains unique by 
operating a no cost model for 
members, and has the advantage for 
retailers of providing deliveries and 
also the ability to top-up at their local 
Booker branch. We install the fascia 
and imagery free of charge and also 
provide a market leading promotion 
every four weeks. All goods are 
delivered at cash and carry prices.
Family Shopper
• We continue to develop Family 
Shopper, a local discount format. 
This is doing well. At May 2016, 
we have 42 stores and, although 
still early days, the response to this 
format has been encouraging.
Budgens & Londis
• On 14 September 2015 Budgens and 
Londis joined the Group. Budgens 
serves 150 retailers. The Budgens 
consumer is typically ABC1. 
Londis serves 1,469 retailers with 
approximately 49% of consumers 
being ABC1. Since completion 
of the acquisition, the teams at 
Budgens and Londis have fitted 
into the Group with ease and have 
embraced the Group approach to 
cash, customer satisfaction and 
health and safety. Since joining the 
Group they have generated £13m of 
cash and customer satisfaction has  
been good.
Booker Direct
• Booker Direct serves national retail 
chains from our distribution centres 
with customers including Marks 
& Spencer, most of the cinema 
chains in the UK and the prison 
service in England and Wales. 
Together the Group can now serve 
any independent retailer, Group 
Accounts and National Chains 
throughout the UK.
BROADEN (commenced  
April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the best 
choice, price and service to caterers, 
retailers and small business. We also 
seek to become the suppliers’ preferred 
route to market. In addition, we want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Digital 
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £979m, 
up from £874m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
490,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 408,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details and order products. 
We have also doubled the number 
of stock keeping units available to 
a typical customer on the website 
through our special order system. 
 
Ritter-Courivaud
• Ritter-Courivaud is a speciality 
foods supplier to the UK’s leading 
restaurants. Ritter had a good year 
growing sales via the Makro business 
centres and direct to customers.
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
first business centre in Mumbai. We 
now have four branches in Mumbai, 
one in Surat and one joint venture 
branch in Pune. These serve 21,000 
customers, and have also launched 
200 Happy Shopper symbol retailers 
which harness the lessons learned 
from Premier in the UK for the Kirana 
stores of Mumbai. We continue  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Strategic Report
07
to review growth options in India 
and look forward to developing the 
Booker offer to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers.
Sustainability
• Booker achieved a fourth consecutive 
Carbon Trust Standard in the 
past year, verifying eight years of 
emissions reductions. In addition we 
have gained a second Carbon Trust 
Waste Standard, covering four years 
of improved waste management.
• Over 25,500 customers are now 
recycling with the Group through 
our packaging and used cooking oil 
recycling services. This helps our 
customers save money, increase 
recycling levels and support more 
sustainable communities throughout 
the UK.
• We are rolling out LED lighting to the 
majority of Business Centres over the 
next 3 years.
• Over 6.7 million litres of used cooking 
oil has been recycled, up 72% on  
last year.
• We donated surplus food equivalent 
to over half a million meals to local 
charities in the last year.
• We supported customers who 
were disrupted by the floods 
through providing stock and 
financial assistance.
• We are committed to helping our 
retail and catering customers 
serve communities throughout the  
United Kingdom.
People 
• Again our team have done a brilliant 
job this year. We are committed to 
continuing to make Booker better 
and safer for colleagues. We are 
also developing talent. For example, 
there is a shortage of butchers in the 
trade, so we have developed a formal 
‘butchery apprenticeship’ with 44 
new butchers graduating in the past 
year. We developed similar schemes 
for greengrocers with 36 colleagues 
graduating and fishmongers with 2 
colleagues graduating. There are 
currently 146 colleagues participating 
in this year’s schemes who are due to 
graduate in September 2016 and we 
intend to run all three schemes again 
in 2017/18. We are also currently 
working with The Institute of Meat 
to raise the skill level of our Butchery 
teams further, and to date three 
butchers have been awarded the 
prestigious Master Butcher title. This 
is part of a longer term plan to up-
skill and develop our future Butchery 
Managers who will go through a 
Craft Butcher training programme  
with accreditation.
• Investment in our delivery teams has 
continued to make progress:
− Our drivers and managers have 
annual refresher courses of Safe, 
Secure and Legal training and 
our vocational drivers complete 
training for the Certificate of 
Professional Competence (CPC), 
which is run by our team of in-
house trainers and delivery 
support managers.
– We also run a driver apprenticeship 
scheme, open to internal and 
external drivers who wish to 
develop their career with Booker 
as well as annual training days 
for managers, to support them 
by improving their day to day 
operation to increase customer 
satisfaction and continue helping 
us to drive cash profit.
• For the eleventh year running, the 
performance of the business means 
our people have shared in our 
success through our bonus system. 
With this great team of people, Booker 
will continue to make progress in the  
year ahead. 
• During the year Bryn Satherley retired 
as Group Operations Director. Bryn 
has served Booker for the past 10 
years and we are very grateful for the 
contribution he has made, he remains 
a good friend of the Group and we 
wish him all the best for the future. 
Thanks to the hard work of everybody 
in the Group, our plan to Focus, Drive 
and Broaden the business remains on 
track. Booker Group had a good year; 
customer satisfaction was strong, sales 
and profits were the best we have ever 
achieved. We made good progress on 
the integration of Budgens and Londis. 
We are very grateful for the support of 
our customers, suppliers and people 
and look forward to making progress in 
the year ahead.

GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Overall Group revenue increased by 
5.0% to £5.0bn. Non tobacco like-for-
like sales decreased by 0.3% while 
like-for-like tobacco sales decreased 
by 5.2%. 
Operating margin increased by 0.16 
percentage points to 3.11% (2015: 
2.95%) increasing Group operating profit 
(before exceptional items) by £14.8m to 
£155.1m. 
In the current year a net exceptional 
charge of £2.3m was taken to the 
income statement. This relates to fees 
incurred in relation to the acquisition of 
Budgens and Londis (£2.3m charge), 
restructuring costs (£4.0m charge) and 
adjustments to other provisions (£4.0m 
credit). There were no exceptional items 
in the prior year.
The net finance costs of £2.0m (2015: 
£1.5m) relates mainly to the unwind of 
the discounting of property provisions.
Profit before tax rose £12.0m to £150.8m 
(2015: £138.8m), an increase of 9%.
The effective tax rate for the Group of 
15.3% (2015: 15.2%) was below the 
standard rate of corporation tax in the 
UK of 20% (2015: 21%). This was due 
principally to the utilisation of ACT and 
partial recognition of tax losses from 
prior years. The Group holds significant 
tax assets (c.£48m cash benefit), 
notably those inherited as a result of the 
acquisition of Budgens and Londis in 
addition to ACT and Makro tax losses, 
which continue to be unrecognised 
as the quantum and timing of their 
utilisation remains uncertain. If the 
Group is able to utilise these assets, this 
could result in the underlying effective 
rate of tax remaining below the standard 
rate for the next three years.
Profit after tax was £127 .8m, an increase 
of £10.1m compared to 2015.
Basic earnings per share rose to 7.24p, 
up 8% from 6.73p in 2015.
Returns to shareholders
a) Dividend
  The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 4.03 pence per share 
(2015: 3.14 pence per share), subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, to be held on 6 July 
2016. The final dividend increases 
the total dividend for the year to 4.60 
pence per share (2015: 3.66 pence 
per share). 
b)  Return of Capital
  Given the continued successful 
development of the Group, the 
Board is proposing a capital return 
to shareholders of 3.20 pence per 
ordinary share. It is proposed that this 
is achieved by the issue of a new class 
of ‘B’ shares which shareholders will 
be able to redeem for cash. The return 
of capital requires the approval of 
shareholders, which will be sought at 
the Annual General Meeting on 6 July 
2016. Further details of the proposed 
return of capital will be set out in a 
circular to shareholders which will 
accompany the notice convening this 
year’s Annual General Meeting.
  This will produce a total return to 
shareholders of 7.80 pence (2015: 
7.16 pence), an increase of 9%.
 
Budgens and Londis
On 14 September 2015, Musgrave Retail 
Partners GB Ltd and its subsidiaries 
were acquired for £40m on a cash/debt 
free basis with a normalised working 
capital level. It subsequently changed 
its name to Booker Retail Partners (GB) 
Ltd (‘BRP’).

Following the fair valuing of the 
assets and liabilities, £28.1m of  
goodwill remained.
Pensions
The Booker Pension Scheme is a defined 
benefit scheme that was closed to new 
members in 2001, and was closed to 
future accruals for existing members in 
2002. BRP also has two much smaller 
closed defined benefit schemes.
At 25 March 2016, the Group had an 
aggregate net IAS 19 deficit of £29.6m 
(2015: £19.7m), comprising scheme 
assets of £685.2m and estimated 
liabilities of £714.8m. 
Following the 2013 Booker Triennial 
valuation, there were no cash contributions 
required. The next Triennial valuation date 
is 31 March 2016, and any contributions 
to the scheme arising therefrom would be 
effective from April 2017 .
BRP pension contributions were £0.8m 
since the date of acquisition. Both 
schemes finalised funding valuations 
during the year and agreed no 
further contributions.
Property Provisions
The Group had property provisions 
at the balance sheet date of £40.8m 
(2015: £25.4m). The majority of the net 
movement has come as a result of the 
acquisition of Budgens and Londis, 
where £19.1m of provisions were held on 
25 March 2016.
Impairment
The net book value of tangible and 
intangible fixed assets on the balance 
sheet is £697m (2015: £647m). The 
goodwill carrying value is more than 
supported by expected future cash flows 
discounted back to present day values. 
Cash Flow
Management has continued to focus 
on cash resulting in a net inflow of 
£147.5m, before dividend payments 
in the year of £65.2m, the capital 
repayment of £61.9m and the acquisition 
of Budgens and Londis for £40m. Net 
cash at 25 March 2016 was £127.4m  
(2015: £147.0m). 
Borrowing Facilities
The Group entered into a new five 
year facility in August 2015 comprising 
an unsecured £120.0m revolving  
credit facility. 
The Group’s borrowings are subject to 
covenants set by the lenders. In the event 
of a failure to meet certain obligations, 
or if there is a covenant breach, the 
principal amounts due and any interest 
accrued are repayable on demand. 
The financial covenants are Fixed 
Charge Cover, measured by the ratio 
of EBITDAR (earnings before interest, 
tax, exceptional items, depreciation, 
amortisation and rent) to interest plus 
rent (tested half yearly on a rolling basis) 
being greater than 1.5, and Leverage, 
measured by the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) (tested 
half yearly on a rolling basis) being less 
than 3.0. 
The Group complied with its covenants 
throughout the year. At 25 March 2016 
the Group achieved a Fixed Charge Cover 
of 4.3 and Leverage of nil, comfortably 
exceeding its covenant obligations. In 
addition to these financial covenants the 
Group’s borrowing agreements include 
general covenants and potential events 
of default. The Group has complied in all 
respects with the terms of its borrowing 
agreements at the date of this report.
Interest Rates 
Funds drawn on the revolving credit 
facility bear floating interest rates linked 
to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.80%, where 
the ratio of net debt/ EBITDA is less than 
one. A commitment fee is payable at 
0.28% of the unutilised facility.
Liquidity
At 25 March 2016, the Group held 
£127.4m in cash and cash equivalents 
and had undrawn facilities of £120.0m. 
The peak level of draw down on the 
revolving credit facility in the year to 
25 March 2016 was £13m, giving a 
minimum facility headroom in the year 
of £107m.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 
The Group recognises that it has social and environmental responsibilities arising from its operations and is committed to 
responsible business practices. These improve the welfare of colleagues and the communities in which we operate, and reduce 
our impact on the environment.
Colleagues
It is the Group’s policy to involve colleagues in the business and to ensure that matters of concern to them, including the Group’s aims 
and objectives and its financial performance, are communicated regularly in an open manner and, where appropriate, colleagues’ 
views are taken into account. This is achieved through the use of business briefings and other less formal communication. 
The Directors encourage colleagues to become shareholders in order to promote active participation in, and commitment to, the 
Group’s success. This policy has been extended to all colleagues through the provision of a SAYE share scheme. 
As at 25 March 2016, the following number of colleagues were contributing to the following schemes:
• 3,403 colleagues – 2015 SAYE scheme;
• 2,611 colleagues – 2014 SAYE scheme; and, 
• 2,456 colleagues – 2013 SAYE scheme.
Booker is an inclusive organisation where no-one receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, nationality, marital 
status, colour, race, ethnic origin, creed, sexual orientation or disability. The promotion of equal opportunities for all employees is 
regarded as an important Group priority. 
An analysis of Directors, senior managers and other employees by gender as at 25 March 2016 is as follows:
Male 
Number
Female 
Number
Directors 8 2
Senior managers 59 7
Other employees 9,464 4,100
The Group has a balanced workforce in terms of experience, with an average age of 40.57 (2015: 39.8).
Community
The Group believes that good community relations are important to the long term development and sustainability of the operating 
businesses. The Group aims to build sustainable relationships with its customers, who are mainly independent businesses at the 
heart of their communities, by improving the choice, price and service of products and services supplied. 
Each business centre, distribution centre and support centre has a nominated local charity. For the year ended 25 March 2016, 
colleagues raised £65,473 for these charities.
The Group also donates surplus food to local homeless charities from Booker Business Centres and distribution centres. In the 
year, the equivalent of over half a million meals were donated to charities across the UK, with an additional 14 tonnes of food 
donated to animal charities. 
Human Rights
The Group is committed to the upholding and respect of human rights. We expect our suppliers to operate in a fair and honest 
way towards their employees and those with whom they do business.
Environment 
Resource Efficiency
Booker recognises its obligation to consider carefully its use of natural resources. We are taking steps to reduce our impact on 
the environment, both in our store operations and in our supply chain. 
Using energy efficiently, minimising our emissions to air and monitoring our energy consumption are key components of our 
environmental work. Examples of initiatives this year are:
• LED lighting has been installed on six sales floors, saving an average of 24% electricity per year, and roll out is planned across 
the remainder of the estate over the next three years.
• By changing waste disposal to more environmentally friendly methods, waste to landfill is down 54% versus last year. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Strategic Report

• We are committed to reducing business miles through the use of video conferencing being rolled out across the business. 
Initial assessments show substantial savings on miles and management time.
During the year, our absolute use of energy was 235 GWh compared with 250 GWh in the prior year, a 6% reduction, despite 
6GWh additional energy requirements from the acquisition of BRP.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
For the third year, we report on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for which we are responsible in accordance with The Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). The statement below 
summarises the Group’s GHG emissions from fuel consumption and the operation of the Group’s facilities for the year ended 25

Notes:
• The Group has reported on all material emission sources for which it deems itself to be responsible, and the emissions data is 
reported using an operational control approach to define our organisational boundary;
• The methodologies and definitions used to derive the table above are based on the UK Government Environmental Reporting 
Guidance 2013 using the GHG Protocol and DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors 2015 which expires in May 2016;
• Data collected for the Government Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (‘CRC scheme’) has been used 
to report energy consumption data for Ritter & Classic. The CRC scheme is a mandatory reporting and pricing framework to 
improve energy efficiency in large public and private organisations;
• The intensity measure selected is tonnes CO
2
e per £m of sales;
• In respect of India, we have undertaken a materiality assessment and consider that the related emissions are not material. 
Emissions from these operations are, therefore, excluded from our reported emissions;
• CO

 equivalent; and,
• 20% of the increase in refrigerant gas emissions is due to a change to the DEFRA carbon equivalent conversion factor.
Whilst our total Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions have shown an increase of 8,360 tonnes, primarily due to the acquisition of BRP , 
our like-for-like footprint shows a reduction of 4,434 tonnes or -3%.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Strategic Report

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT CONTINUED
The Carbon Trust Standard is a voluntary certification and mark of excellence that enables organisations to demonstrate their 
success in cutting their carbon footprint. The Standard can be achieved for Energy, Waste and Water. The Standard is awarded 
for a two year period, with Booker obtaining a fourth consecutive Carbon Trust Standard and second Carbon Trust Waste 
Standard in 2015. This accreditation externally verifies eight years of absolute carbon footprint emission reductions and four years 
of improved waste management. Booker Group is the only wholesaler to have held the Standard for that length of time. The award 
demonstrates Booker’s long term commitment to successfully measuring, managing and reducing its carbon footprint.
Preventing Waste
Company Waste Prevention and Recycling
We continue to work to prevent waste, redistribute fit for purpose food, increase recycling and divert waste away from landfill. We 
use the Government’s ‘waste hierarchy’ which sets out five steps for dealing with waste ranked by their environmental impact, to 
ensure all waste is dealt with in the most environmentally positive way. Each store and distribution centre participates in recycling 
paper, plastic, cardboard, metal and wood from pallets. We have invested across the estate in balers, instigated waste league 
tables and continually focus on improvements. During the year we increased the volume of waste recycled and sent to recovery 
processes by 11% and reduced waste to landfill by 54%.
Business to Business Engagement
In addition to our own achievements, we believe that working on sustainability initiatives with independent businesses in local 
communities can deliver further improvements in sustainability.
Customer Packaging Recycling
In April 2012 our packaging recycling service was launched, and now over 14,000 customers are regularly using the service. 
Volumes of cardboard recycled in the year ended 25 March 2016 are up over 12% on last year at over 16,000 tonnes.
Customer Used Cooking Oil Recycling
Customers can arrange a collection of used cooking oil from their premises. The Group operates a simple rebate scheme of 20p 
per litre of waste oil recycled. Approximately 12,500 customers are using the service and over 6.7 million litres of waste oil have 
been recycled into sustainable bio fuels in the year ended 25 March 2016, up 72% on last year.
Customer Energy Efficient Lighting Conversion
This is a new service available to customers, which supports customers in changing to more energy efficient lighting. Initial reports 
from retail customers show a pay back on investment in under 12 months.
Packaging Improvements
As a wholesaler of packaged goods, our primary objective is to ensure that our products are safe to eat and reach consumers 
in optimal condition. Packaging plays a critical role in achieving this and we review at every opportunity how we can use fewer 
materials. This includes improving packaging to protect stock from damage, thereby reducing food waste, and reducing the 
weight of the packaging. This year, packaging changes on own label products have saved 133 tonnes of packaging material. 
Changes include moving Happy Shopper vinegar from glass to plastic bottles, reduction of the tin weight of Chefs Larder fruit and 
vegetables, and removing the card tray from the outer case on own label juices. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Strategic Report

Ethical Sourcing
A number of the ingredients in our own label products are grown in developing countries. We seek to understand, manage and 
mitigate any issues associated with a particular commodity or country.
We use the Fairtrade and Red Tractor Farm Assurance schemes and all prospective own brand suppliers are required to complete 
a sustainability and ethics questionnaire. Examples of our approach are described below.
Red Tractor Farm Assurance 
Red Tractor is a UK food assurance scheme which covers production standards on safety, hygiene, animal welfare and the 
environment. The Red Tractor logo on packs means food or drink has met these responsible production standards and is fully 
traceable back to independently inspected farms in the UK. Red Tractor certifies that food has been produced to independently 
inspected standards right across the food chain – from farm to pack. At 25 March 2016, the Group had 138 own label products 
displaying the Red Tractor logo across its retail and catering ranges and continues to work to widen the products covered by 
this standard.
Fairtrade
The objective of Fairtrade is to achieve better selling prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms of 
trade for farmers and workers in the developing world. Fairtrade is an independent mark found on products where ingredients 
in the product have been produced by small-scale farmers that meet Fairtrade’s social, economic and environmental 
standards. The standards include the protection of workers’ rights and the environment, payment of a Fairtrade minimum 
price and an additional premium to invest in the farmers’ and workers’ community. The Group continues to expand its range 
of catering products that are certified as being Fairtrade, with all Chef’s Larder tea and coffee products now being Fairtrade 
accredited. The Lichfield Fairtrade range has 26 products across tea, coffee, sugar and hot chocolate. During the year the 
Group contributed the equivalent of £116,700 through Fairtrade premiums to help tea and coffee growers. 
Sustainable Palm Oil
Palm oil production has been well documented as a cause of substantial damage to the natural environment. Its impact 
includes deforestation, habitat loss of critically endangered species and a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Although palm oil is only an extremely small input into the production by our suppliers of our own label products, all Chef's 
Larder, Happy Shopper, and Euroshopper ranges of biscuits and snack products contribute to the production of certified 
sustainable palm oil. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Strategic Report

MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Internal controls and risk management 
The Board attaches considerable importance to, and acknowledges its responsibility for, the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management and receives regular reports on such matters. The Board’s policy is to have systems in place which optimise 
the Group’s ability to manage risk in an effective and appropriate manner. The Board has delegated to the Executive Committee 
detailed responsibility for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the risks facing the Group and for deciding how these are to be 
managed. In addition to formal reviews of risk management by the Executive Committee, members are expected to report to the 
Executive Committee as necessary the occurrence of any material internal control issues, serious accidents or events that have 
had a major commercial impact, or any significant new risks which have been identified. Such matters are reported to the next 
Board meeting and/or Audit Committee meeting as appropriate. 
The Group also has in place systems and procedures for exercising control and managing risk in respect of financial reporting 
and the preparation of consolidated accounts which are monitored by the Audit Committee on the Board’s behalf and reviewed 
annually by the Board. These include:
• the formulation and deployment of Group accounting policies and procedures;
• Group policies governing the maintenance of accounting records, transaction reporting and key financial control procedures;
• monthly operational review meetings which include, as necessary, reviews of internal financial reporting issues and financial 
control monitoring; and
• ongoing training and development of financial reporting personnel. 
The Group’s systems and procedures are designed to identify, manage and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects 
of the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They are not designed to eliminate such risk, recognising that any system can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board formally reviews the operation and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls on an annual basis. The latest 
review covered the financial year to 25 March 2016. No significant failings or weaknesses were identified from this review. The Board 
has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group and the resources that our business devotes 
to them. This process is continual and has been in place for the year under review up to the date of this report, and is regularly 
reviewed by the Board in accordance with relevant guidance. There is an established framework of internal controls, which is set 
out in procedures approved by the Board and which include financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. 
These procedures are readily accessible to staff, who follow their guidance. The most important elements of this framework are 
described below: 
Management structure 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company and the Executive Committee has responsibility for specific aspects of the 
Group’s affairs. The Board and each of its committees operate under a schedule of matters or terms of reference and the Board 
determines how the Chief Executive and the Executive Committee may operate within a framework of delegated authorities and 
reserved powers which seek to ensure that certain transactions which are significant in terms of their size or type, are undertaken 
only after Board review. 
The Executive Committee is chaired by Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) and comprises Jonathan Prentis (Group Finance Director), 
Guy Farrant (Chief Operating Officer), Mark Chilton (Company Secretary and General Counsel) and other senior executives 
representing the operational functions within the Group. It meets every two weeks to discuss operational matters, compliance, 
health and safety and trading performance. 
Corporate accounting and procedures 
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part of the corporate communication procedure. Accounting, 
delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures, together with the general 
ethos of the Group are included in these communications, and standardised accounting policies are in place reflecting this policy. 
These procedures are subject to review to ensure that improvements to enhance controls can be made. 
Quality and integrity of personnel 
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training. Quality 
personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment and the ethical standards expected are communicated 
through senior members of staff. 
Three year business plan
Each year the Group produces a three year business plan which covers development of profits and cash flow generation over 
the period.
Budgetary process 
Each year the Board approves the annual budget, which includes an assessment of key risk areas. Performance is monitored 
and relevant action taken throughout the year by regular reporting to the Board of updated forecasts together with information 
on key risk areas. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Strategic Report
15
Risk management
The Board assesses risk management throughout the Group aided by detailed reviews of internal controls and risk management 
procedures. The Group’s risk register is reviewed by the Board as part of annual strategic planning and budgetary cycles.
Investment appraisal 
Capital expenditure is regulated by the use of authorisation levels. For all expenditure beyond specified levels, Board approval 
is required. 
Internal audit 
The Group’s internal audit function, which reports to the Group Finance Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, monitors 
the effectiveness of key internal controls and the adequacy of these controls to manage business risk and to safeguard the Group’s 
assets and resources, in accordance with a work plan approved and monitored by the Audit Committee. Its conclusions are 
communicated to the relevant level of management and the function has a direct reporting responsibility to the Audit Committee.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The principal risks and corresponding mitigation set out below represent the principal uncertainties that the Board believes may 
impact the Group’s ability to deliver effectively its strategy in the future. The list does not include all risks that the Group faces and 
it does not list the risks in any order of priority.
Risk Impact Mitigating factors
Increasing price 
competition in the  
UK grocery and  
discount sectors
A decline in selling prices could have an 
adverse impact on the Group’s sales, 
operating profits and cashflow.
The Group will continue to improve the choice, price and service 
to our customers.
Changes in  
regulation
Changing laws and regulation may 
impact our ability to market or sell certain 
products or could cause the Group to incur 
additional costs or liabilities that could 
adversely affect its business.
The Group operates in an environment governed by strict 
regulations to ensure the safety and protection of customers, 
shareholders, employees and other stakeholders and the 
operation of an open and competitive market. These regulations 
include food hygiene, health and safety, tobacco, data protection, 
the rules of the London Stock Exchange and competition law. 
In all cases, the Board takes its responsibilities seriously, and 
recognises that any breach of regulation could cause reputational 
and financial damage to the Group.
Failure of 
operational 
and synergistic 
benefits of the BRP 
acquisition  
to materialise
This could have an adverse impact  
on the profitability of the Group.
The Group will continue to maintain strong links to suppliers and 
effective cost control. Regular meetings take place between the 
Group and BRP leadership teams, aligning activities targeting 
operational and synergistic benefits.
Failure to respond 
to competition
This could have an adverse impact 
on the Group’s sales, operating profits 
and cashflow.
The industry is extremely competitive with the market being served 
by numerous competitors, ranging from national multiple retailers 
to regional independent wholesalers. We compete by closely 
monitoring the activities of our competitors and ensuring we 
continue to improve the choice, price and service to our customers.
Product quality  
and safety
This could have an adverse impact on the 
Group’s reputation, sales, operating profits 
and cashflow.
The quality and safety of our products is of critical importance 
and any failure in this regard would affect the confidence of 
our customers in us. We work with our suppliers to ensure the 
integrity of the products supplied. Food hygiene practices are 
taken seriously throughout the Group, and are monitored both 
through internal audit procedures and by external bodies, such as 
environmental health departments, within local authorities. We have 
well prepared procedures for crisis management in order to act 
quickly when required. We are aware that if we fail, or are perceived 
to have failed, to deliver to our customers’ satisfaction the expected 
standards of quality and safety in our products, their loyalty to us 
may be potentially impacted. This in turn could adversely impact on 
our market share and our financial results. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Strategic Report

Employee 
engagement and

The continued success of the Group  
relies on investment in the training 
and development of our employees. 
The Group’s employment policies, remuneration and benefits

colleagues with fulfilling career opportunities. The Group 
continually engages with employees across the business to 
ensure that we keep strengthening our team at every level.

providers of credit insurance withdraw or 
materially reduce the levels of cover they 
provide to the Group’s trade creditors in 
respect of the Group, this might affect the 
Group’s ability to obtain products from 
those suppliers on existing credit terms and 
could worsen the Group’s cashflow. 
The Group Finance Director meets the key credit insurers to 
ensure that they have an up to date understanding  
of the Group’s financial position. Likewise, we keep suppliers 
updated of key developments in the Group, through amongst 
other things, key supplier conferences, and aim to be the 
suppliers' preferred route to market.
Pension funding A worsening funding position may require 
the Group to pay cash contributions 
or provide further assurance to cover 
future liabilities. This could worsen the 
Group’s cashflow.
The Group seeks to agree appropriate investment policies  
with the Trustees and closely monitors the funding position  
of the Pension Schemes with the Trustees. Both the  
Company and the Trustees take advice from independent 
qualified actuaries.
Failure of 
the Group’s 
information 
technology 
systems
The maintenance and development of 
information technology systems may result 
in system failures, including cyber security 
breaches which may adversely impact the 
Group’s ability to operate, which could 
affect the Group’s sales, operating  
profits and cashflow. 
The Group has appropriate controls in place to mitigate the  
risk of systems failure, including systems back up procedures and 
disaster recovery plans, and also has appropriate virus protection 
and network security controls. The Group has entered into a 
Transitional Services Agreement which will ensure that Musgrave 
provides appropriate operational support during the period of 
transition of BRP's systems into the Group's IT landscape.
Health and  
safety risks
A health and safety related incident could 
result in serious injury to the Group’s 
employees, contractors, customers and 
visitors, which could adversely affect 
our operations and result in reputational 
damage, criminal prosecution and civil 
litigation. This could affect the Group’s 
reputation, with a potentially adverse affect 
on sales, operating profits and cashflow.
The Group has developed an effective health and safety 
management system to ensure compliance with all legal duties 
placed on the organisation by law. All systems are subject to regular 
review with training provided as appropriate. 
The Group employs a Health and Safety manager to maintain 
the management system, along with the identification and 
remediation of specific risks, and ensuring employees are aware 
of regulatory requirements.
Resource 
management and 
energy efficiency
A long term increase in energy prices could 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
sales, operating profits and cashflow with 
an increasing cost to operations to adapt to 
climate change and mitigate impact.
The Group has a continual focus on reducing our environmental 
impact and implementing changes to our operations to maximise 
opportunities such as recycling more waste and using more 
renewable sources of fuel.
Greenhouse gas emissions are measured and reported annually.
Substantial investment is made to improve environmental risk 
management, with a focus on energy efficiency when investing  
in new capital projects. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Assessment of the Group’s prospects
Going Concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group’s and Company’s financial statements. Further information in relation to the Directors’ 
assessment of going concern is contained in note 1f to the financial statements.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 ('the Code'), the Directors have assessed 
the Group’s viability over a three year period to March 2019. This period has been considered for the following reasons:
• The Group’s strategic planning cycle covers a three year period;
• For major investment projects three years is considered by the Board to be a reasonable time horizon for an assessment 
of the outcome; and,
• The business model can be evolved for significant changes in market structure or government policy over the three  
year period.
The Group produces a forecast three year business plan which incorporates projections for income and cash flow. An 
analysis has been completed to evaluate the financial impact (including on sales, profitability and liquidity) of the Group's 
principal risks, set out on pages 15 to 16, occurring whether individually or in unison over the period, including in a number of 
severe but plausible scenarios. The analysis also assesses the potential impact on the Group's available sources of funding 
and the range of mitigating actions that would be available to offset the effect of those risks, should they arise. 
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of their assessment. 
Strategic report approval
The Strategic Report, outlined on pages 1 to 17 , (including the assessment of the Group's prospects as set out above) incorporates 
the Highlights, the Business Profile and Key Performance Indicators, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the 
Group Finance Director’s Report, the Corporate Social Responsibility Report and the Management of Risks and Uncertainties 
sections of this document.

The Strategic Report can be found on pages 1 to 17 and is 
incorporated by reference and deemed to form part of this 
report. The Strategic Report includes information on the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the business.
Dividends
The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 4.03 
pence per ordinary share. If approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting on 6 July 2016, this final dividend 
will be payable on 8 July 2016 to shareholders on the register 
of members at the close of business on 10 June 2016. 
An interim dividend of 0.57 pence per share was paid on 
27 November 2015.
If the final dividend is approved by shareholders, dividends 
for the year will total 4.60 pence per ordinary share (2015: 
3.66 pence).
Return of Capital
The Company is proposing to implement a capital return to 
shareholders of 3.20 pence per ordinary share at a cost of 
approximately £57m based on the issued share capital of the 
Company at the date of this report. It is proposed that this 
is achieved by the issue of a new class of B Shares which 
shareholders will be able to redeem for cash.
Interests of Directors in Contracts
During the period, no Director had any material interest in any 
significant contract to which the Company or any subsidiary 
was a party.
Changes of Control
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and 
awards normally vest and become exercisable on a change 
of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance 
conditions at that time. The Company is not a party to any 
other significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control following a takeover bid other than 
its bank facility agreement, which provides that on a change 
of control the lender shall not be obliged to fund a utilisation 
(except for a rollover loan) and, if it so requires, may cancel 
its commitment and declare its participation in all outstanding 
utilisations immediately due and payable. Further the Company 
is not party to any agreement with the Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
(whether through resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) that occurs as a result of a takeover bid other than 
with Charles Wilson, in that in the event of a change of control 
of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate 
his employment on 30 days’ notice and to receive a payment 
equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period.

Appointment and Retirement of Directors
Subject to applicable law, from time to time the Board may 
appoint any person to be a director. Under the Articles, any 
such director shall hold office only until the next AGM and shall 
then be eligible for election. The Articles require that at each 
AGM at least one-third of the Board should retire as directors 
by rotation, however, in accordance with the recommendations 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will retire 
and (other than Lord Bilimoria who will be stepping down as a 
Director with effect from the conclusion of the 2016 AGM) offer 
themselves for re-election at the 2016 AGM.
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance
The Company maintains appropriate directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance in respect of itself and its Directors and 
Officers. The Directors may also be indemnified in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association and to the maximum 
extent permitted by law, although no such indemnities are 
currently in place. The insurance does not, and any indemnities 
if granted would not, provide cover where the relevant Director 
or Officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report for the 52 week period ended 25 March 2016. The UKLA’s Listing Rules and Disclosure

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Throughout the year ended 25 March 2016 and to the date of this document, the Company complied with the provisions and 
applied the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (the ‘Code’).
This Corporate Governance Report, together with the Audit Committee Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the 
Remuneration Report, describes how the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code.
The Role of the Board and its Committees 
The Company is led and controlled by the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) chaired by Stewart Gilliland. 
The following Directors served on the Board during the year:
Name From: To:

Charles Wilson 28 March 2015 To date
Jonathan Prentis 28 March 2015 To date

The Board currently consists of three Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors. 
The following changes occurred during the year under review:
• On 1 April 2015, Mark Aylwin resigned from the Board.
• On 8 July 2015, Richard Rose, having served three terms of three years each as Chairman of Blueheath Holdings plc 
(‘Blueheath’) and then Booker Group plc, stepped down as Chairman and retired from the Board at the AGM on 8 July 2015. 
During his tenure, the Board was satisfied that Richard was independent.
• On 8 July 2015, Stewart Gilliland became Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. The Board is satisfied that Stewart was 
independent on appointment.
• On 3 December 2015, Gary Hughes joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director.
• On 1 April 2016, Bryn Satherley resigned from the Board.
All the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any business or 
other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement in accordance with the Code. The 
independence of Non-Executive Directors is considered at least annually and is based on the criteria suggested in the Code. The 
Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge and bring independence to the Board and its decision making process. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
23
The Board believes that it is appropriate to have a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and Lord Bilimoria has fulfilled this 
role and will continue to do so until he retires from the Board at the AGM on 6 July 2016, when he will be succeeded by Karen 
Jones. Lord Bilimoria is available to shareholders where concerns have not been resolved through the normal channels and 
for when such contact would be inappropriate until the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM and thereafter Karen Jones will be 
available to shareholders to address such concerns. The role of the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is set out in a 
written statement which forms part of Karen Jones’ appointment letter.
The Board believes that it has sufficient members to contain a balance of skills and experience, but it is not so large as to be 
unwieldy. The Board contains a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors such that no individual, or group of individuals 
can dominate the Board’s decision making. No one individual has unfettered powers to make decisions. 
Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ biographies on pages 20 and 21.
The Board meets regularly on at least twelve scheduled occasions during each year and more frequently, if necessary. There 
were fourteen Board meetings, nine Audit Committee meetings, six Nomination Committee meetings and eight Remuneration 
Committee meetings held in the year under review and the attendance by Directors at the meetings they were eligible to attend

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
The Board is responsible to shareholders for ensuring that the Group is appropriately managed and that it achieves its objectives. 
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control 
over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and regulatory issues. At its meetings, the Board reviews trading performance, 
ensures adequate financing, monitors strategy, examines investment and acquisition opportunities and discusses reports 
to shareholders. Matters not specifically reserved for the Board and its Committees under its schedule of matters and the 
Committees’ terms of reference, or for shareholders in general meeting, are delegated to members of the Executive Committee.
It is the Company’s policy that the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with their roles and responsibilities 
clearly divided and set out in writing. The Chairman’s main responsibility is the leadership and management of the Board and its 
governance. The Chairman’s commitment to the Company is usually two days per month. His other significant commitments are 
disclosed in his biography on page 20. The Board considers that these commitments do not hinder his ability to discharge his 
responsibilities to the Company effectively.
The Chief Executive is responsible for the leadership and day-to-day management of the Group. This includes formulating and 
recommending the Group’s strategy for Board approval in addition to executing the approved strategy.
Recommendations for appointments to the Board are made by the Nomination Committee. The Committee follows Board 
approved procedures (available on our website) which provide a framework for the different types of Board appointments on 
which the Committee may be expected to make recommendations. Appointments are made on merit and against objective 
criteria with due regard to diversity (including skills, experience and gender). Non-Executive appointees are also required to 
demonstrate that they have sufficient time to devote to the role.
Information and Professional Development 
Directors are continually updated on the Group’s businesses, the markets in which they operate and changes to the competitive 
and regulatory environment through briefings to the Board and meetings with senior executives. Board visits to Group business 
locations enable the Directors to meet with local management and employees and to update and maintain their knowledge and 
familiarity with the Group’s operations.
Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to visit Group operations throughout their tenure to increase their exposure  
to the business.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. The provision of information 
to the Board was reviewed during the year as part of the performance evaluation exercise referred to below. To ensure that 
adequate time is available for Board discussion and to enable informed decision making, briefing papers are prepared and 
circulated to Directors in the week prior to scheduled Board meetings. All Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to make 
further enquiries as they feel appropriate of the Executive Directors and executives. In addition, Board Committees are provided 
with sufficient resources and the power to co-opt such additional support as they may require from time to time, to undertake 
their duties. 
All Directors are entitled to receive independent professional advice at the Company’s expense and have access to the services 
of a professionally qualified and experienced Company Secretary, who is responsible for information flows to the Board and 
advising the Board on corporate governance matters. This ensures compliance with Board procedures and applicable laws and 
regulation. The Board has responsibility for the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary.
On appointment, individual Directors undergo an induction programme covering, amongst other matters:
• the business of the Group;
• their legal and regulatory responsibilities as Directors of the Company;
• briefings and presentations from Executive Directors and senior executives; and
• opportunities to visit business operations. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

Performance Evaluation
The Board undertook an externally facilitated evaluation in 2016. This evaluation was led by the Chairman and was externally 
facilitated by Prism Communications & Management Ltd (‘Prism’), which is part of Equiniti Group plc. Prism had no other 
connection with the Company and was not subject to any conflict of interest, however, the Group receives share administration 
services from Equiniti Limited, also a subsidiary of Equiniti Group plc.
The methodology of the evaluation was via a detailed questionnaire. The review covered the following main areas, which were 
determined by the Chairman and Prism to be of most importance or value to the Board:
• key Board issues;
• strategy and corporate principles;
• internal controls and risk management;
• performance management;
• shareholders and stakeholders; and
• performance in the boardroom.
Feedback was provided by a comprehensive written report to the Chairman and a report to the Board meeting in May 2016. At that 
meeting the Board discussed the evaluation process and the findings. The areas specifically focused upon included the structure 
of the Board (including the role of the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director), participation of executive management in 
Board meetings, the number/frequency of Board meetings, risk and strategic analysis and on-going training requirements, all of 
which were considered in the context of the Company's growth in recent years and the opportunities and challenges facing it. 
The evaluation process provided assurance that each Director continued to contribute effectively and demonstrated commitment 
to the role. The evaluation process has led to the Terms of Reference of the various Board committees being updated in light 
of the wording of the latest version of the Code, a written statement being completed of the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director's role and a programme of regular training sessions being formalised for Directors.
No other actions or changes to Board or Board committee practice were considered necessary in the immediate term following 
the evaluation but the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees will be kept under review in accordance with corporate 
governance best practice.
During the year, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive Directors being present. There was also 
one meeting of the Non-Executive Directors chaired by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director at which the Chairman 
was not present in order to appraise the Chairman’s performance. The Senior Independent Director provided feedback to the 
Chairman of this review.
Board Committees 
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee to oversee and debate 
issues of policy outside main Board meetings. Throughout the year, the Chairman of each Committee provided the Board with 
a summary of key issues considered at the committee meetings. Board committees are authorised to engage the services of 
external advisers as they deem necessary in the furtherance of their duties at the Company’s expense. 
The Audit Committee Report is on pages 27 to 33, the Nomination Committee Report is on pages 34 to 39 and the Remuneration 
Report is on pages 40 to 62.
Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at the first 
Annual General Meeting after their appointment and thereafter by rotation at least once every three years. In accordance with the 
Code all Directors will, however, stand for re-election annually.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Relations with Shareholders 
In fulfilling their responsibilities, the Directors believe that they govern the Group in the best interests of shareholders, whilst having 
due regard to the interests of other stakeholders in the Group including customers, employees and suppliers. 
The Code encourages a dialogue with institutional shareholders based on the mutual understanding of objectives. The Executive 
Directors have regular and ongoing communication with major shareholders throughout the year, by participating in investor 
roadshows and presentations to shareholders. Feedback from these visits is reported to the Board. The Executive Directors 
also have regular contact with analysts and brokers. The Chairman, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and other 
Non-Executive Directors receive feedback on matters raised at the meetings with shareholders and are offered the opportunity 
to attend meetings with major shareholders. As a result of these procedures, the Non-Executive Directors believe that they are 
aware of shareholders’ views. In addition, Lord Bilimoria, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, is available to meet with 
major shareholders and, following his retirement at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, his successor, Karen Jones, will be 
similarly accessible to shareholders.
Arrangements can also be made through the Company Secretary for major shareholders to meet with newly appointed Directors.
The Group maintains a website at www.bookergroup.com which is regularly updated and contains information about the Group. 
The Code encourages boards to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors and to encourage their 
participation. In compliance with the Code, the Board welcomes as many shareholders as possible to attend the Annual General 
Meeting to discuss any interest or concern, including performance, governance or strategy, with the Directors. 
All Directors are expected to attend the Annual General Meeting. The Chairs of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer shareholder questions, through the Chairman of the Board, on 
the responsibilities and activities of their Committees. Shareholders also have the opportunity to meet with the Directors following 
the conclusion of the formal part of the meeting.
In compliance with the Code, at the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman will announce the level of proxies lodged on each 
resolution, the balance for and against and abstentions, and such details will be placed on the Group’s website following the 
meeting. A separate resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting in respect of each substantially separate issue. 
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and section 175 of the Companies Act 2006, formal procedures for the 
notification and authorisation of potential and actual conflicts of interest have been approved by the Board. 
These procedures, which enable the Directors to impose limits or conditions when giving or reviewing authorisation, ensure 
that only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered can authorise conflicts, and require the Board to review 
the register of Directors’ conflicts annually and on an ad-hoc basis when necessary. Any potential conflicts of interest in relation 
to newly appointed Directors are considered by the Board prior to appointment. These procedures have operated effectively 
throughout the current financial period.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 18 May 2016.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Chairman’s Introduction to the Audit Committee Report
In my final report to you as Chairman of the Committee, I am pleased to report on the activities of the Committee for the year 
ended 25 March 2016. 
During the year, we welcomed Gary Hughes onto the Committee and he will succeed me as Chairman after this year’s interim 
results in October 2016. Gary has extensive financial and audit experience from leading the finance functions of a number of 
large companies, and most recently from chairing the Audit Committee of J Sainsbury plc, and so is ideally suited to take over 
the Chairmanship of the Committee.
A key focus for the Committee this year has been the new requirements of the Code that now apply to the Company, particularly 
the process by which the Directors are able to confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Company and consideration of the period over which the viability statement will apply. The Committee 
has reviewed the assurance process and the risk management framework to ensure that it remains appropriate and does provide 
a robust assessment of those principal risks and uncertainties.
We reported last year that we intended to tender the external audit engagement. That tender process was initiated in December 
2015 resulting in the recommendation to re-appoint KPMG as the Company’s statutory auditor for the year ending March 2017 
and to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) as the Company’s statutory auditor for the year ending March 2018. This 
will enable a smooth transition from KPMG to PwC, having completed the process of integrating BRP into the Group’s accounting 
systems. The competitive tender was led by me as Chairman of the Committee, conducted in conjunction with the Group Finance 
Director, Jonathan Prentis and Gary, my successor, and overseen by the Committee. In parallel with the audit tender process, the 
Committee reviewed and updated our policy on non-audit services provided by the External Auditor to ensure that the External 
Auditor continues to be free from any actual or perceived conflict of interest relating to statutory audit services in accordance with 
professional and regulatory requirements. 
In passing my role to Gary, I can be confident that the Company comprises a well managed business with a healthy focus 
on monitoring risks and a keen interest in maintaining robust and effective systems of control. I should like to thank my fellow 
directors for all their support over the past nine years and to wish the Company continued success in the future. 
I will be available to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to answer any questions relating to the role of the Committee.
On behalf of the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Role and Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee supports the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to financial reporting; monitoring the integrity of 
the financial statements and other announcements of financial results published by the Group; and reviewing and challenging 
the judgements and actions of management in relation to the financial statements. The Committee reviews the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal financial control and financial risk management systems and the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal 
Audit function. On behalf of the Board, the Committee manages the appointment and remuneration of the External Auditor and 
monitors its performance and independence. The Group supports an independent and confidential whistleblowing procedure 
and the Committee monitors the operation of this facility.
In accordance with the Code, the Board requested that the Committee advise whether it believes the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference reflect this requirement and can be found in the Investor Centre/Legal Documents section

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Significant Judgemental Areas
The significant areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the accounts for the year ended 25 March 2016 
and how these were addressed are outlined below. Each of these areas received particular focus from the External Auditor, who 
provided detailed analysis and assessment of the matters in their report to the Committee.
Acquisition accounting in relation to Musgrave Retail Partners GB Limited, now known as Booker Retail 
Partners (GB) Ltd and its subsidiaries (‘BRP’)
The acquisition of BRP was subject to approval by the UK competition authority and full clearance was received from the 
Competition and Markets Authority on 3 September 2015. The transaction was completed on 14 September 2015 and BRP 
was then consolidated in the Group’s results from that date. We are required to fair value BRP’s assets and liabilities at the date 
of consolidation. There is an exercise of judgement involved in identifying and valuing the assets acquired in such a business 
combination. In that regard, the Committee examined the methodology and outcomes of external valuations and confirmed that 
they were independent of the Group. Management valuations were then scrutinised against external evidence and the verification 
work completed by the external valuers. The Committee assessed the processes used in the identification and valuation of 
acquired assets and liabilities, including the reasonableness of assumptions used. The Committee also assessed the allocation 
of consideration between goodwill and identified intangible assets. Following this review, we were satisfied that the judgements 
exercised were appropriate.
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension Schemes
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, as outlined in note 18 to the financial statements. 
Although the defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual, they are sensitive to changes in actuarial assumptions. 
We challenged the valuations prepared by the Group’s pension advisors and, following discussions with management, 
were satisfied that the judgements exercised were appropriate. During their audit, KPMG evaluated the assumptions and 
methodologies used by the Group’s pension advisors and assessed whether the assumptions made were appropriate and not 
materially different from external benchmarks. KPMG reported to us on the assumptions used and the way that our schemes 
had been accounted. 
Property Provisions
The Group has recorded property provisions in the sum of £39.8m as outlined in note 19 to the financial statements, which, by 
their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental. We scrutinised the key elements of judgement with management to assure 
ourselves as to the adequacy and appropriateness of the provisions. Following this review, we were satisfied that the judgements 
exercised were appropriate. As part of the year end audit, KPMG considered the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, 
any developments relating to specific claims, and the prior history of lease obligations, provisions and claims in order to assess 
whether the provisions recorded were appropriate.
Following discussions with the External Auditor, and the deliberations set out above, we were satisfied that the financial statements 
dealt appropriately with each of the areas of significant judgement.
The External Auditor also reported to the Committee on any misstatements that they had found in the course of their work. The 
Committee noted their work and were satisfied that no material amounts required adjustment.
Fair, Balanced and Understandable Assessment
One of the key compliance requirements of a group’s financial statements is for the Annual Report and Accounts to be fair, 
balanced and understandable. The coordination and review of Group wide contributions into the Annual Report and Accounts 
follows a well established and documented process, which is performed in parallel with the formal process undertaken by the 
External Auditor.
The Committee received a summary of the approach taken by management in the preparation of the 2016 Annual Report 
and Accounts to ensure that it met the requirements of the Code. This, and our own scrutiny of the document, enabled the 
Committee, and then the Board, to confirm that the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole, was fair, balanced 
and understandable and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

Internal Controls and Risk Management Systems
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems, including financial, operational and compliance controls.
In order to keep the Committee abreast with latest developments, the Head of Internal Audit reported to each meeting on 
developments and emerging risks to internal control systems and on the evolution of major risks. In addition, the Committee 
reviewed reports issued by both Internal Audit and the External Auditor and held regular discussions with the Group Finance 
Director, the Head of Internal Audit and representatives of the External Auditor. During the course of these reviews, the Committee 
has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant.
Internal Audit
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function including 
its focus, work plan, activities and resources.
At the beginning of the financial year, the Committee reviewed and approved the Internal Audit plan for the year having considered 
the principal areas of risk in the business and the adequacy of staffing levels and expertise within the function. During the year, 
the Committee received regular verbal and written reports from the Head of Internal Audit summarising findings from the work of 
Internal Audit and the responses from management to deal with the findings. Amongst other topics, these included further reports 
on the operations in India, where the control environment continues to mature well.
The Committee monitors progress on the implementation of any action plans arising on significant findings to ensure these are 
completed satisfactorily and meets with the Head of Internal Audit in the absence of management.
External Audit
It is the responsibility of the Committee to monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of KPMG, the External Auditor. 
As reported last year, the Committee has supported the appointment of Stuart Burdass as Senior Statutory Auditor for KPMG, in 
place of Nicola Quayle who has stepped down, in accordance with best practice, after five years in this role. We thank Nicola for 
the thoroughness and commitment she has brought to the audit. In February 2016, we met with KPMG to agree the audit plan 
for the year end, highlighting the key financial statement and audit risks, to ensure that the audit was appropriately focused. In 
addition, KPMG’s letter of engagement and independence was reviewed by the Committee in advance of the audit.
In May 2016, in advance of the finalisation of the financial statements, we received a report from KPMG on their key audit findings, 
which included the key areas of risk and significant judgements referred to above, and discussed the issues with them in order 
for the Committee to form a judgement on the financial statements. In addition, we considered the Letter of Representation that 
the External Auditor requires from the Board.
We meet with the External Auditor privately at least twice a year to discuss any matters they may wish to raise without management 
being present.
Assessment of Effectiveness of External Audit
The Committee obtained feedback on the effectiveness and efficiency of the audit process from key management personnel 
through a short questionnaire. The results were positive, confirming such areas as effective planning, appropriate focus on risk, 
continuity, commitment and integrity. The Committee then reviewed the audit process with KPMG and noted the beneficial effect 
of open discussion of potential issues early in the process.
The Committee concluded that the external audit process was operating effectively and KPMG continued to prove effective in its 
role as External Auditor. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance
32
Audit Tender
The current External Auditor was first appointed for the year ended 1 April 2005 and the external audit had not been tendered 
since then. We reported last year that we intended to put the external audit out to tender, with a view to the successful audit 
firm being appointed to audit the Group’s financial statements for the year commencing 26 March 2016. We concluded the 
tender process for the external audit, as described below, and agreed that, following the completion of the audit of the financial 
statements for the year ended 25 March 2016, KPMG will be re-appointed as the Company’s External Auditor subject to approval 
by shareholders at the AGM on 6 July 2016, and that PwC will be appointed as the Company's External Auditor, subject to 
approval by shareholders, at the AGM in July 2017. This will enable a smooth transition to new auditors, during a year in which we 
are engaged in the process of integrating BRP, particularly into the Company’s accounting systems.
The Committee led a rigorous tender process for the external audit during the winter of 2015 and spring of 2016. We considered 
the range of qualified firms and concluded that three firms should be invited to participate in a formal tender process on the  
basis of:
• experience and track record in delivering quality audit services;
• having the high calibre resources needed to deliver quality audit services to the Group;
• willingness to participate in the audit tender and to deliver the audit services;
• experience in auditing organisations of comparable size and complexity to the Group; and
• neither the Company nor the firm being aware of any apparent conflicts of interest or independence issues.
Once the shortlist had been prepared, each firm was invited to put forward alternative Senior Statutory Auditors (lead audit 
partners) who were interviewed by the Chairman of the Committee and the Group Finance Director. Following feedback from 
the Company on the preferred lead audit partners, each firm was then invited to attend an information day to ensure they fully 
understood our business, systems, controls, risk areas, ways of working and management structure. Each firm was required to 
submit a formal audit proposal document in January which was reviewed by management and the Committee. On 1 February 
2016, each firm presented to the Committee together with representatives of management. Additionally, committee members met 
with each firm without management present.
After deliberation and assessment against predetermined objective criteria, as well as taking into account the views of the Group 
Finance Director, the Committee recommended to the Board that KPMG should be re-appointed as the Company's External 
Auditor for FY17, and that PwC should be appointed as the Company’s External Auditor thereafter. Accordingly, a resolution 
proposing the re-appointment of KPMG as the Company’s External Auditor will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 6 July 2016, 
and a resolution in respect of the appointment of PwC as the Company’s External Auditor will be put to shareholders at the AGM 
in July 2017. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice of External Auditor. The Committee will continue to review the 
auditor appointment and the need to tender the audit, ensuring the Group’s compliance with the Code and any related regulations.

Non-Audit Services
The Committee has also reviewed its policy on non-audit services provided by the External Auditor to ensure that the 
External Auditor remains free from any actual or perceived conflict of interest, in accordance with professional and regulatory 
requirements. The principal requirements of the revised policy are that the External Auditor may not undertake prohibited 
services, which include:
• book keeping;
• the design and implementation of financial information systems or financial controls;
• outsourced internal audit services that relate to internal accounting controls, financial systems of financial statements;
• secondments to the Group where the audit firm secondee acts as an employee of the Group or performs any decision making, 
supervisory or ongoing monitoring function;
• remuneration related services;
• actuarial services;
• management functions; 
• tax services that depend for their effectiveness on a particular accounting treatment; and 
• legal services unrelated to the audit.
The Committee must approve any individual non-audit services above £25,000.
Discretion is used, subject to the controls set out above, in obtaining non-audit services from the External Auditor, although other 
accountancy firms are also used when appropriate. In accordance with the policy, a cumulative summary of non-audit fees paid 
to the External Auditor and third party providers is presented to the Committee on a scheduled basis. 
In view of their knowledge of the Group’s ways of working and the importance of efficient integration of the acquired business, 
KPMG were asked to provide due diligence services in respect of the acquisition of BRP. The aggregate fee for this amounted 
to £198,587.
Other non-audit work comprised the interim review, for which fees of £35,000 were charged, and other small assignments 
to assist with tax compliance and other matters for aggregate fees of £65,815. The Committee believes that there are sound 
commercial and practical reasons for this work being conducted by the External Auditor and that it is not of a nature which would 
affect its independence as External Auditor. 
Whistleblowing Programme
The Group has a whistleblowing programme in all of its operations whereby employees can, in confidence, report on matters 
where they feel a malpractice has taken or is taking place, or if health and safety standards have been or are being compromised. 
Additional areas that are addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to 
the environment.
The programme allows employees to raise their concerns with their line manager or, if that is inappropriate, to raise them on a 
confidential basis. An externally facilitated confidential helpline and confidential email facility are provided to protect the identity of 
employees in these circumstances. Any concerns are investigated on a confidential basis by the Human Resources Department 
and/or the Company Secretary and feedback is given to the person making the complaint as appropriate via the confidential email 
facility. An official written record is kept of each stage of the procedure and results are summarised for the Committee. 
Committee Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis by both the Board and the Committee itself and results are 
summarised for the Committee. The Audit Committee is charged to ensure that arrangements are in place for the proportionate 
independent investigation and appropriate follow up.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 18 May 2016.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
I am pleased to present the Report of the Nomination Committee for 2016. This Report provides shareholders with an overview 
of the activities carried out by the Committee during the year.
On 2 April 2015, it was announced that Richard Rose, having served three terms of three years each, as Chairman of Blueheath and 
then the Company, would be stepping down as Chairman at the AGM on 8 July 2015, in accordance with corporate governance 
best practice. Richard was a superb Chairman. The Company has come a long way in the past few years and Richard did a great 
job of building and chairing the Board. We wish him all the very best in the future. Following this announcement, the Committee 
conducted a search with the assistance of The Zygos Partnership, which concluded, following a thorough selection process by 
the Committee led by me, as Senior Independent Director, with the announcement that Stewart Gilliland had been appointed as 
Chairman with effect from the close of the AGM on 8 July 2015. Stewart’s considerable experience in both the wholesale and 
retail sectors was considered invaluable, as was his thoughtful challenge and insight to Board and various Committee discussions 
since his appointment to the Board in December 2010. As such, he was the outstanding candidate for the role as Chairman. I 
succeeded Richard as Chairman of this Committee upon his retirement from the Board.
On 2 April 2015, we also announced that Mark Aylwin had decided to leave Booker to pursue other opportunities. Mark was 
responsible for the Booker Direct, Chef Direct and Ritter Courivaud businesses. We are very grateful to Mark for his contribution 
to the Company. Mark joined with Richard on the acquisition of Blueheath in 2007, developed our Booker Direct business and 
helped found Chef Direct. We wish Mark all the very best for the future. Rather than replacing Mark we decided to embed the 
strengths of Booker Direct, Ritter Courivaud and Chef Direct into the wider Group structure. These changes have helped take the 
benefits of Booker Direct, Chef Direct and Ritter Courivaud to our national accounts, branch accounts and independent catering 
and retail customers.
During the year the Committee continued to focus on reviewing the Company’s succession plans for appointments to the Board 
to ensure that an appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity was achieved and having regard to the need to ensure 
the progressive refreshing of the Board. This issue was of particular relevance given that both Andrew Cripps and I will have 
completed over nine years of service on the Board in 2016. As a consequence of this review, we engaged The Zygos Partnership 
to undertake a search for candidates with the appropriate skills and experience to join the Board as Non-Executive Directors 
and in the case of Andrew Cripps, ultimately to succeed him as Chairman of the Audit Committee after this year’s interim results 
in October 2016. A detailed search resulted in the appointment on 3 December 2015, following a recommendation by the 
Committee to the Board, of Gary Hughes as a Non-Executive Director. Gary also joined the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
from that date and will succeed Andrew as Chairman of the Audit Committee after this year’s interim results in October 2016. 
Gary has extensive experience in the finance functions of a number of major companies, and most recently chairing the Audit 
Committee of J Sainsbury plc. As such, Gary is ideally suited to take over the Chairmanship of the Audit Committee.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

The search for a candidate with the appropriate skills and experience, having regard to the benefits of diversity (including, but not 
limited to, ethnicity, experience and gender), to join the Board as a Non-Executive Director and ultimately to succeed me on the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees is ongoing.
On 3 December 2015, we announced that Bryn Satherley, having served for ten years as Group Operations Director, would be 
stepping down from the Board and retiring from the Company with effect from 1 April 2016. Bryn has done a brilliant job for the 
Company. He has decided to retire but will remain a good friend of Booker and we wish him all the very best in the future. Rather 
than replacing Bryn, Guy Farrant, Managing Director of Booker Wholesale, was appointed Chief Operating Officer with effect from 
1 April 2016 and Bryn’s responsibilities have been split amongst the other members of the Executive team. 
Looking forward, the Committee will continue to review long term succession plans for the Board, with the aim of ensuring that 
an appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity is maintained.
I should also like to thank my fellow directors for all their support over the past nine years and to wish the Company continued

The Committee has defined Terms of Reference which can be found in the Investor Relations/Legal Documents/2016 section of the 
Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary. The Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment of additional Directors and for reviewing the size, structure and composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity) of the Board and the membership of Board committees to ensure that they have the necessary 
range of competencies, knowledge and experience required for the direction and oversight of the business.
Membership
The following Directors served on the Committee during the year:
Member Period from: To:
Richard Rose 28 March 2015 8 July 2015
Lord Bilimoria (Chairman) 28 March 2015 To date
Andrew Cripps 28 March 2015 3 December 2015
Karen Jones 28 March 2015 To date
Stewart Gilliland 8 July 2015 To date
All members of the Committee are considered to be independent Non-Executive Directors. Richard Rose did not chair the 
Committee when it dealt with the search for and selection of his successor and no other member of the Committee put themselves 
forward as a potential candidate for the Chairmanship. 
No member of the Committee nor any other Director participates in discussions concerning or votes on his or her own re-
election or evaluation of his own performance. Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ 
biographies on pages 20 and 21. Their remuneration is set out in the Remuneration Report. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director. Only members 
of the Committee have the right to attend Committee meetings, however, during the year, Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) was 
invited to attend meetings. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year
Members’ attendance record at meetings they were eligible to attend was as follows:
Committee member Number of meetings attended Percentage attendance
Richard Rose 2/3 67%
Lord Bilimoria 6/6 100%

During the year ended 25 March 2016 the Committee met to:
• review the size, structure and composition of the Board;
• commence the search for a candidate to succeed Richard Rose as Chairman of the Company and following a detailed search 
process, recommend to the Board that Stewart Gilliland be appointed as Chairman of the Company from the conclusion of 
the AGM on 8 July 2015;
• commence the search for a new Non-Executive Director with appropriate skills and experience to ultimately succeed Andrew 
Cripps as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Following a detailed search process, the Committee recommended to the Board 
that Gary Hughes be appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 3 December 2015;
• recommend to the Board that Helena Andreas, whose three-year tenure expired in December 2015, be re-appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director for a further three-year term subject to re-election by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM; 
• commence the search for a new Non-Executive Director with appropriate skills and experience to replace Lord Bilimoria. Lord 
Bilimoria did not participate in the discussions or work of the Committee in relation to this topic;
• recommend to the Board that all of the Directors who have indicated their willingness to stand for re-election be proposed for 
re-election as Directors at the forthcoming AGM;
• review the Committee’s report within the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts and recommend its approval to the Board; and
• recommend revisions to the Board to the Committee's Terms of Reference. 
Since 25 March 2016, the Nomination Committee met on two occasions to:
• discuss progress in the search for a candidate with the appropriate skills and experience to join the Board as a  
Non-Executive Director; and
• recommend the appointment of Karen Jones as Senior Independent Director, with effect from the conclusion of the  
forthcoming AGM.
Board Composition/Succession Planning
The Board plans for its own succession, with the support of the Committee. The Committee remains focused, on behalf of the 
Board, on Board succession planning for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee aims to ensure that:
• the succession pipeline for senior executive and business critical roles in the organisation is adequate;
• processes are in place to identify potential successors and manage succession actively;
• there is a structured approach to developing and preparing possible successors; and
• processes are in place to identify ‘at risk’ posts. 
On at least an annual basis each Director’s intentions are discussed with regard to continued service on the Board and their 
succession is considered in the context of the shape of the overall Board and the corporate governance guidance on Non-
Executive tenure. This transparency allows for an open discussion about succession for each individual, both for short-term 
emergency purposes as well as longer term plans.
As in previous years, we conducted an analysis of the balance of skills on the Board as a whole, taking account of the future 
needs of the business in the light of the business strategy, the Board changes set out above, and the knowledge, experience, 
length of service and performance of the Directors. In accordance with our policy, we also had regard to the requirement to 
achieve a diversity of characters, backgrounds and experience amongst Board members.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Summary of Board Changes
• April 2015 – Richard Rose announced his intention to retire at the conclusion of the AGM on 8 July 2015 and Mark Aylwin 
resigned from the Board;
• June 2015 – Announced that Stewart Gilliland was to succeed Richard Rose as Chairman at the conclusion of the AGM on 
8 July 2015;
• July 2015 – Richard Rose retired as Chairman to be succeeded by Stewart Gilliland; and,
• December 2015 – Bryn Satherley announced his intention to retire in April 2016 and it was announced that Gary Hughes had 
joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director and will succeed Andrew Cripps as Chairman of the Audit Committee from 
October 2016.
Chairman Succession
Richard Rose served three terms of three years each, as Chairman of Blueheath and then the Company. In accordance with 
corporate governance best practice, Richard Rose advised in April 2015 that he would be stepping down as Chairman at the 
AGM on 8 July 2015. 
In preparing the job specification, assessing the time commitment expected (usually two days per month) and agreeing the skills 
and experience desired for a potential successor Chairman, considerable emphasis was placed on identifying a candidate with 
considerable and recent experience of the grocery and wholesale/retail sectors generally and the ability to work closely and 
effectively with the Chief Executive in delivering the Company’s strategy whilst providing the necessary degree of independence and 
challenge. The search for a suitable candidate began within the Board. The search was then widened through the use of an external 
agency, The Zygos Partnership. The Zygos Partnership does not have any connection to the Group other than in respect of the 
provision of these services. The search concluded following a thorough selection process by the Committee led by Lord Bilimoria, as 
Senior Independent Director, with the announcement on 17 June 2015, following a recommendation by the Committee to the Board, 
that Stewart Gilliland had been appointed as Chairman with effect from the close of the AGM on 8 July 2015. Stewart Gilliland’s 
considerable experience in both the wholesale and retail sectors was considered invaluable, as was his thoughtful challenge and 
insight to Board and various Committee discussions since his appointment to the Board in December 2010.
The search for a new Non-Executive Director who it is intended will succeed Lord Bilimoria is ongoing.
Non-Executive Director Search
To assist it in the search for new Non-Executive Directors, the Committee again engaged The Zygos Partnership. The Zygos 
Partnership was provided in each case with a detailed brief of the desired candidate profiles based on merit and against objective 
criteria (including an assessment of the time commitment expected) and their services are being used to conduct a thorough 
search to identify suitable candidates. The Committee considered in both instances a list of potential candidates with the skills, 
knowledge, independence and diversity in its widest sense (gender, nationality, age, experience, ethnicity and background) which 
would benefit the Company. 
The Company did not use open advertising to search for suitable candidates for the roles of Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
as we believe that the optimal way of recruiting for these positions is generally to use targeted recruitment based on the skills and 
experience required.
A detailed search resulted in the appointment on 3 December 2015, following a recommendation by the Committee to the Board, 
of Gary Hughes as a Non-Executive Director. Gary Hughes also joined the Audit and Remuneration Committees from that date 
and will succeed Andrew Cripps as Chairman of the Audit Committee after this year’s interim results in October 2016. Gary 
Hughes has extensive experience in the finance functions of a number of major companies and most recently as the Chair of the 
Audit Committee of J Sainbury plc. As such, Gary Hughes is ideally suited to take over the Chairmanship of the Audit Committee.
 
The search for a candidate with the appropriate skills and experience, having regard to the benefits of diversity (including, but 
not limited to, ethnicity, experience and gender), to join the Board as a Non-Executive Director and ultimately to succeed Lord 
Bilimoria on the Audit and Remuneration Committees is ongoing. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

Skills Balance and Directors’ Performance Evaluation
The Committee also considered the membership of the Board and each of its Committees. The Committee continues to actively 
review the long term succession planning process for Directors to ensure the structure, size and composition of the Board and its 
Committees continues to be effective, thus ensuring appropriate levels of corporate governance and best practice and support 
for the Company as it pursues its strategy. 
As part of its review, the Committee considered the performance and independence of Stewart Gilliland, Helena Andreas, 
Andrew Cripps, Gary Hughes and Karen Jones, each of them having confirmed their willingness to stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Following a rigorous review, the Committee considered that the performance of each of Stewart Gilliland, Helena Andreas, 
and Gary Hughes, as well as Andrews Cripps and Karen Jones, notwithstanding that their length of service as Non-Executive 
Directors is in excess of eight and six years respectively, was effective and accordingly recommended to the Board that they each 
be proposed for re-election as a Director of the Company at the forthcoming AGM. 
Diversity
We value diversity in the Boardroom and see it as a wider topic than simply gender. Our Directors come from different backgrounds 
and each brings unique capabilities and perspectives to our discussions, with a wide range of professional and geographical 
backgrounds. We are committed to maintaining a diverse Board. Appointments to the Board and throughout the Group will 
continue to be made on merit and overall suitability for the role against objective criteria with due regard to the benefits of diversity 
(including, but not limited to, ethnicity, experience and gender). 
We do not consider that quotas are appropriate as a target for ethnic minority or female representation on company boards, since 
they are likely to lead to compromised decisions on Board membership, quality and size. Whilst the Committee has not determined 
to set targets for the number of ethnic minorities or women on the Board, we continue to consider and make appointments based 
on merit. When recruiting, we require any search agency to have signed up to the ‘Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms’ setting out the seven key principles of best practice to abide by throughout the recruitment process.
Statistical gender diversity employment data for the Group can be found in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on  
page 10.
Committee Performance and Effectiveness
The Board additionally undertook an annual review of the Committee’s performance and effectiveness and concluded that the 
Committee operated effectively.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 18 May 2016.

REMUNERATION REPORT
I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2016, which sets out the remuneration paid to the 
Directors in the year ended 25 March 2016.
The Committee’s approach to remuneration remains that it should be kept as simple and comprehensible as possible. As such, 
our Remuneration Policy remains unchanged since 2014. The Remuneration Policy of the Company is intended to ensure: 
• Incentives for Executive Directors and executives are closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of Executive 
Directors, executives and shareholders; 
• Executive Directors’ rewards are correlated with those received by other employees of the business; and
• Executive Directors are not rewarded for failure.
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are 
aligned to growing long term shareholder value. We are satisfied that the outcomes to date have reflected business performance 
and that the targets set are stretching in the context of the market in which we operate and, if delivered, will have added significant 
value for shareholders. 
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place are working well to support the Company’s 
strategy and are helping to retain, recruit and motivate our management team.
In the context of our future performance goals the Committee reviewed and decided to maintain the stretching targets attached to PSP 
awards granted in 2015, which require the executive team to deliver for three years compound annual growth in earnings per share of 
+12% and compound annual growth in total shareholder return of +15% in order to secure the maximum PSP vesting. In that context, 
we were keen to ensure that remuneration was weighted towards variable pay, dependent on performance, thus ensuring a clear link 
between the value created for shareholders and the amount paid to our Executive Directors. As a result, we reviewed the size of awards 
and decided to increase the award potentially payable to Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson) to 200% of salary.
As a result of major changes in the roles and responsibilities of the Executive Directors following the acquisition of BRP, the 
departures of Mark Aylwin and Bryn Satherley, and a benchmarking exercise conducted by PwC confirming that a significant 
variance to the market had arisen in respect of the remuneration of Guy Farrant and Jonathan Prentis, the Committee, taking all 
those factors into account, found it necessary to reconsider and increase Executive Director salaries in 2016 by circa 5%.
In a similar vein, the appointment of a new Chairman and new Non-Executive Directors prompted a review of Chairman and Non-
Executive Director fees. We found our fee level was below the FTSE350 range and accordingly the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Director fees have been rebased to market levels.
No payments were made to Richard Rose on his retirement as Chairman and no payment for loss of office was made to Mark or 
Bryn following termination of their employment.
The Committee will review the existing Remuneration Policy and incentive framework over the next year prior to putting the next 
Remuneration Policy to shareholders for approval in 2017. As the Performance Share Plan expires in 2018 the Committee intends 
to review the plan as part of the overall review of remuneration and intends to put a new long-term incentive plan to shareholders 
for approval in 2017.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this year’s AGM.
This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 18 May 2016.

Key Remuneration Principles
The principles supporting the Executive Directors’ reward packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they continue to 
underpin the Group’s strategy. 
The Committee’s overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. The Company 
wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and executives of the requisite quality. Accordingly, the Committee’s 
policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for 
their contribution. The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when 
determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases. 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The policy for Executive Directors remuneration, set out below, took effect from the date of the 2014 AGM, and is available to 
view in the Investor Relations/Investor Centre/Legal Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from 
the Company Secretary. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

The Committee considers the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it continues to underpin the Group’s strategy. The policy 
set out below applies for three years from the 2014 AGM.

broadly increase in line with the 
range of increases applying to the 
employee population, other than 
where there is a change in role 
or responsibility, where there are 
major changes within the Group

more significant increase, or where 
the Committee judges that there 
is a risk in relation to attracting 
or retaining Executive Directors. 
Any such changes, should they 
occur, will be fully explained 
to shareholders in the next 
Remuneration Report.
Newly promoted or recruited 
Executive Directors may on 
occasion have their salaries set

Notes to Future Policy Table
Bonus 
The Earnings before interest and tax (‘EBIT’) bonus scheme, which is consistent with the FY14 bonus scheme, covers Executive 
Directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the Group. The aggregate 
bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year and no bonus is paid unless 
there is an improvement. The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary. Charles Wilson, 
Chief Executive, does not participate in this bonus scheme. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with 
shareholder interests which arise from his significant shareholding in the Company. Payments to Executive Directors are based 
upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings. The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to 
Executive Directors is less than 15%. 
PSP 
The PSP scheme allows Executive Directors and approximately 1,000 employees to receive share awards, subject to the 
achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period. Awards are made annually and, 
other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2011/14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based. Details of structure and outcome are set out  
on page 55.
For the 2012/15, 2013/16 and 2014/17 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary for 
the Executive Directors. Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum is calculated on a straight line basis, as follows:
• 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per 
annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from 
the award date.
• 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving 
Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as 
measured between March 2012 and March 2015, March 2013 and March 2016 and March 2014 and March 2017.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the 
FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point 
being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The Committee will review the performance measures for the 2016/19 cycle for the Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson), 
in the context of our future performance goals.
Fixed and Variable Pay Mix
Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in 
any incentive schemes) are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable ‘at risk’ reward, linked to 
the performance of the Company. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus 
scheme and does not participate in the PSP. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder

Illustrative scenarios
Below is an illustration of the value that could be received by each Executive Director under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
in respect of 2016/17, showing:
• minimum, which comprises base salary, benefits and employer pension contributions only (equivalent to 15% of base salary) 
(total fixed pay);
• on-target, which includes total fixed pay and assumes an on-target award for the Bonus (50% of salary) and 50% of maximum 
PSP vesting; and
• maximum, which includes total fixed pay and a maximum award under the Bonus (100% of salary) and 100% of maximum 
PSP vesting. 
The salaries included are those that will apply from 1 April 2016. The benefit values included are estimates. The amounts shown in 
relation to Bonus and PSP do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation and the PSP vesting is calculated 
using a share price of 163.5p being the closing share price on 25 March 2016.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Use of Discretion by Remuneration Committee
Malus in Incentive Plans
The Committee has the discretion under both the Bonus scheme and the PSP to claw back bonus and unvested share awards 
in the following circumstances:
• misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to the Company’s prospects, finances or brand reputation; 
and/or
• actions that lead to material misstatement or restatement of accounts.
This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.
Other Uses of Discretion
The Committee will operate the Company’s incentive plans according to their respective rules, the policy set out in the table above 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the incentive plans. These 
include, but are not limited to, determining who participates in the incentive plans, the time and size of awards, measurement of 
performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction and the adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. 
rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends). The discretions that can be applied in the 
case of leavers under the Bonus and PSP are set out in the section on ‘Policy on Payment for Loss of Office’ on page 49.
Any exercises of discretion by the Committee will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant year’s Remuneration Report.
The Committee will also use its judgement as to what is appropriate within the terms of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy,  
to make decisions that do not involve the exercise of discretion.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
The remuneration of any new Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and 
the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion are:
• salary and benefits, including defined contribution pension participation and relocation costs, where appropriate;
• participation in the Bonus: pro-rated for the year of recruitment to reflect the proportion of the year remaining after the date of 
commencement of employment; and
• participation in the PSP: awards would be granted on the same terms and subject to the same performance conditions as 
those which apply to PSP awards granted to existing Executive Directors in the year of recruitment.
The maximum annual level of variable remuneration that may be granted to a newly recruited Executive Director (excluding any 
awards to compensate for incentives forgone on recruitment) would be in line with that of the existing Executive Directors:
• Bonus award: maximum 100% of salary; and
• PSP award: maximum 400% of salary for a full PSP cycle commencing after appointment, plus pro-rated awards in relation to 
PSP cycles outstanding at the time of recruitment (up to a further 150% of salary).
In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, compensate a newly recruited Executive Director for incentives forgone from 
a previous employment as a result of their resignation. The Committee would seek validation of the value of any potential 
incentives forgone.
Awards made by way of compensation for incentives forgone would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of 
performance achieved (or likely to be achieved), the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award. 
Compensation would, as far as possible, be in the form of awards under the PSP in order to immediately align a new Executive 
Director with Company performance. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

Policy on Payment for Loss of Office
Contractual Notice Period and Pay in Lieu
All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the company of 12 months. As an 
alternative, the Company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given 
in the event of gross misconduct.
Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months’ pension 
contributions, and other contractual benefits. Where possible, the Company will seek to ensure that where a leaver mitigates 
their losses by, for example, finding new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss 
of office. The Company’s approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant 
events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company. A bonus element is not normally 
included in the termination payment, however, if the Company enforces the non-compete clause, up to 12 months on target 
bonus will be payable.
An Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under relevant employment 
legislation in the UK.
Under Charles Wilson’s contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his 
employment on 30 days’ notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period. 
Termination by Mutual Agreement
In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the Company for the Board to proactively manage succession planning 
and the development of the senior talent pipeline. In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executive’s departure will 
be by mutual agreement. In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated 
performance in line with expectations and where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession. The Company’s 
experience is that this approach is successful and has previously enabled the Company to recruit a former Executive Director to 
lead Makro on an interim basis immediately after its acquisition.
An Executive Director terminated by mutual agreement will be treated as a ‘good leaver’ for the purposes of the Bonus and PSP 
plans. If the termination date falls during the financial year, they will be eligible to be paid a pro-rated on target bonus and if they 
are employed at the end of the financial year, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
Other than as set out above, the Committee does not anticipate using the discretion provided by the Bonus and PSP plan rules 
in respect of termination payments. There may, however, be unforeseen circumstances where this is in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders. Where such discretion is exercised, explanations will be provided in the next Remuneration 
Report and will comply with the Company’s overall remuneration policy aim that Directors should not be rewarded for failure. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

The Committee would only exercise the discretions available in the Bonus and PSP plan rules relating to:
• whether an award is made or an unvested award forfeited; and
• the extent and timing of any such award or forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example permanent disablement.
Notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of Bonus and PSP awards that vest. The 
Committee would only exercise its discretion to include some or all of the notice period in such calculation in exceptional 
circumstances, such as ill health, and would not do so in circumstances of poor performance.
The Committee has the discretion to determine that an individual should be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the 
PSP. In exercising such discretion the Committee will consider factors such as personal performance and conduct, overall Group 
performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive Director’s departure including, but not restricted to, whether the 
Executive Director is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company. If an individual is not a Good Leaver then they will be treated 
as an Other Leaver, as set out above.
Committee Interaction with Stakeholders
The Committee engages with shareholders on remuneration matters. Discussions were held with a number of shareholders and 
with shareholder representative organisations over the year. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance
51
Legacy Arrangements
The Committee reserves the right to honour any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office not in line with the policy 
set out above where the terms of those payments were (i) entered into with current or former directors before this policy came 
into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant executive was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes payments of variable remuneration under the Bonus scheme and the PSP in line with the 
terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation 
or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining 
remuneration for its Executive Directors. 
Salary increases for Executive Directors will broadly increase in line with the general workforce other than when there is a change 
in role or responsibility, or a significant variance to the market arises, warranting a larger increase.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive Directors to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the benchmark 
policy level while they become established in role. In such cases, salary increases may be higher than the general workforce until 
the target positioning is achieved.
Group employees’ salaries are compared to cross-industry standards to ensure fair pay for that job. The Company does 
not directly consult with employees as part of the process of determining Directors’ remuneration. While formal comparison 
measurements were not used in determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee made decisions in the knowledge 
of incentive arrangements of the rest of the Group, upon which the Committee is briefed regularly.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors is consistent with that of other senior employees. This group of 
approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme. Eligibility to participate in 
the PSP extends to a similar set of around 1,000 employees in total.
Outside the senior employees’ group, the composition of remuneration differs. Of the Group’s average 13,000 employees, 
over 9,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on ‘customer satisfaction’. Customer satisfaction is measured 
independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 202 
branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service. 
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency 
targets at the site at which they are employed. 
In addition from time to time certain incentive arrangements may be introduced for executives and colleagues in order to achieve 
particular objectives.
Eligibility for, and participation in, benefits and incentive plans differs depending on location, seniority, length of service and 
other factors.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods for Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months. All new 
appointments will have 12 month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, 
a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used.
This is in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance

External Appointments 
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock 
exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
The policy for Non-Executive Directors applies for three years from the date of the 2014 AGM, and is available to view in the 
Investor Relations/Legal Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary.

The Board has determined that the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors should be 12 days per annum, other than the 
Chairman whose time commitment should be 24 days per annum. The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out 
in the relevant Non-Executive Director’s letter of appointment. In practice, the Non-Executive Directors exceed the minimum time 
commitment through their involvement in all aspects of the business.
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as 
Directors of the Company. 
Details of Letters of Appointment and Notice Periods for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years subject to termination on one month’s 
notice. In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually.
 
Non-Executive Director appointments are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.

• Taxable benefits – all taxable benefits in kind arising from the individual’s employment in 2015/2016.
• Bonus – the bonus relating to the Company’s performance in the year ended 25 March 2016, to be paid in July 2016.
• PSP exercised during the year – based on the share price at the date of actual vesting.
• Pension Benefits – the value of Company contributions to pension plans or any cash allowances paid in lieu of  
pension contributions. All Executive Directors receive a cash allowance and none are members of a defined benefit pension 
scheme operated by the Group.
• No consideration was paid to third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the Company  
during the year. 
Salary (audited information)
Notwithstanding the review of Executive Director salaries conducted by the Committee in 2015, the Committee found it necessary 
to reconsider Executive Director salaries in 2016 as a result of major changes in the roles and responsibilities of the Executive 
Directors following the acquisition of Budgens and Londis and the departures of Mark Aylwin and Bryn Satherley, and a significant 
variance to the market having arisen.
As a consequence, the Committee requested that PwC undertake a benchmarking exercise based on a company with a market 
capitalisation of £2.6 bn. Based on that benchmarking information, the Committee approved salary increases of circa 5% for each 
of the Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson). 
Whilst these increases are significant, the Committee considers that the increases are fully necessary to ensure the Company 
continues to prosper in a challenging trading environment. 
Bonus (audited information)
The level of pre-bonus earnings before interest and tax (‘EBIT’) achieved in 2016 gave rise to the following awards to the 
Executive Directors: Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Governance
55
Director EBIT award as % of salary
Jonathan Prentis 48.25%
Guy Farrant 48.25%
Bryn Satherley 48.25%
The EBIT bonus scheme covers approximately 1,600 colleagues, including the Executive Directors (other than Charles Wilson). 
The scheme has been in operation since 2007 (albeit that up to 2012 it was based on increases in earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) and is targeted on increasing the Group EBIT year on year. The Group EBIT increase before 
exceptional items of £14.8m to £155.1m resulted in a bonus being awarded to Executive Directors of 48.25% of salary. The 
maximum bonus payable under the scheme to Executive Directors was 100% of salary, had the Group EBIT exceeded £185m, 
an uplift on prior year of £46.05m. If EBIT had not increased year on year no bonus would have been paid. Bonus is paid on basic 
salary as at 31 March each year. The proportion of the total scheme bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors was less than 
15%, in accordance with the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Bonus payments awarded to each Executive Director, other than Charles Wilson who received no bonus, as a proportion of salary 
in the three previous financial years:

Participation
As well as the Executive Directors, approximately 1,000 employees have been granted PSP options. In addition 3,403 employees 
participate in the 2015 SAYE scheme, 2,611 employees participate in the 2014 SAYE scheme and 2,456 participate in the 2013 
SAYE scheme. The Executive Directors have chosen not to participate in any of the current SAYE schemes. 
The high number of employees participating in these schemes is consistent with the Group’s policy of ensuring that the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders. 
Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the 
equity value of the Company has increased from approximately £300m to over £3.1bn as at 18 May. The value of the PSP options 
awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
Statement of Directors’ Shareholdings (audited information)
Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Group’s remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the 
long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders. The Committee sets 
shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal (and/or 
spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Executive Director’s annual base salary. All of the 
Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines. Details of the share interests of all Executive Directors are shown below.

Relative Performance Graph
The Company’s performance from 27 March 2009 to 25 March 2016 measured by Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), is compared in 
the chart below with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). This is considered the most appropriate 
index against which to measure performance following the Company’s inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index in December 2009. 
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over 
a period of time. Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company’s shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
Company’s share price together with any dividends paid. 
The closing mid market price of an Ordinary Share on 25 March 2016 was 163.5p and the price range during the year was 142.4p 
to 190p.

Payments for Loss of Office (audited information)
Richard Rose retired from the Board after the AGM on 8 July 2015. He was paid his fee to date of departure, and did not receive 
any payment for loss of office.
Mark Aylwin stepped down as Managing Director, Booker Direct and as an Executive Director of Booker Group plc with effect 
from 1 April 2015. Mark Aylwin remained an employee of the Group until 17 August 2015 when his employment terminated. He 
assisted the Company with an orderly transition and handover of responsibilities, and continued to receive his base salary and 
contractual benefits in full, until 17 August 2015 when he found alternative employment.
Mark Aylwin received a bonus in respect of the year ended 27 March 2015, which was calculated by reference to the performance 
targets that applied to the 2014/15 bonus plan and was paid in the normal way in July 2015. He was not entitled to any bonus 
payment in respect of the 2015/16 financial year. Awards granted under the Booker Group Performance Share Plan 2008 
continued to vest during Mark Aylwin’s notice period but all unvested awards lapsed on the date his employment terminated. 
Mark Aylwin’s remuneration for the period he was director during 2015 is disclosed in the single figure table.
Bryn Satherley stepped down as Group Operations Director with effect from 1 April 2016 and both his employment and 
appointment as a director of the Company terminated on that date. He assisted the Company with an orderly transition and 
handover of responsibilities, and continued to receive his base salary and contractual benefits in full, until 1 April 2016. Bryn 
Satherley’s remuneration for 2016 is disclosed in the single figure table.
Bryn Satherley did not receive a payment for loss of office. He was eligible to receive a bonus in respect of the year ending 25

in the normal way in July 2016. Bryn Satherley will not be entitled to any bonus payment in respect of the 2016/17 financial year. 
As he retired, Bryn Satherley retained awards granted to him under the Booker Group Performance Share Plan 2008. These 
awards will vest on the normal vesting date, to the extent the performance conditions are met, and will be pro-rated to reflect the 
proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed on the date his employment terminated. 
The arrangements made in respect of Richard Rose’s retirement from the board and the termination of Mark Aylwin and Bryn 
Satherley’s employment are in line with the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.

Gary Hughes was appointed a Non-Executive Director on 3 December 2015.
Non-Executive Directors are paid a fee which is agreed by the Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board, taking into 
account fees paid in other companies of similar complexity. These fees also reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of 
the roles.
Accordingly, higher fees are payable to the Chairman of the Audit Committee (Andrew Cripps), the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee (Karen Jones) and the Chairman of the Nomination Committee (Lord Bilimoria). The Chairman’s fees are agreed by 
the Committee. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Non-Executive Directors’ fee levels are reviewed annually. The Executive Directors approved fee increases which took effect from 
1 December 2015. These fee increases resulted from a review against the market prompted by our recruitment of Non-Executive 
Directors during the year, and is in accordance with our Remuneration Policy. The new base fee, senior independent director fee, 
chair of Committee and committee fees are still at lower quartile for a FTSE350 company.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework'. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report and Directors' Report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is 
unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Booker Group plc 
for the period ended 25 March 2016 set out on pages 66 to 
104. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 25 
March 2016 and of the Group’s and the parent company’s 
profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, 
including FRS101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements 
the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were 
as follows:
Valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes 
£29.6m (2015: £19.7m) Risk vs 2015: 
Refer to page 30 (Audit Committee Report), page 74 
(accounting policy) and page 89 (financial disclosures).
The risk – Significant assumptions are made in valuing 
the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes obligations, 
including in particular the discount rate, inflation rates and the 
average life expectancy as explained in note 19. Small changes 
in the assumptions used could have a significant effect on the 
results and financial position of the Group.
Our response – Our audit procedures included testing of the 
controls over the maintenance of the schemes’ membership 
data, sample testing from that data to the source documentation 
establishing the obligation to members. With the support of our 
own actuarial specialists, we then challenged the key assumptions 
applied by the Group to that data to determine the net defined 
benefit obligations. We critically assessed the inflation rates and 
life expectancy assumptions by comparing them against external 
market data and industry benchmarks. We also compared the 
discount and inflation rates used in the valuation of the defined 
benefit pension schemes against our internally developed 
benchmarks and with other companies reporting as at March 
2016 to ensure that they are consistent with our expectations. In 
addition, we considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in relation to the defined benefit pension schemes.
Property provisions £39.8m (2015: £20.4m) Risk  
vs 2015: 
Refer to page 30 (Audit Committee Report), page 77 
(accounting policy) and page 92 (financial disclosures).
The risk – The Group has recorded provisions on its leasehold 
properties as explained in note 20. The estimation of these 
provisions requires a significant degree of judgement and 
the use of assumptions, including the expected cash flows 
associated with the properties over the remaining lease term, 
the expected utilisation of the properties, expected costs 
related to dilapidations and to removing asbestos and the 
rates used to discount future cash flows to account for risk 
and the time value of money. As such there is a risk that the 
provisions, and associated charges or credits in the statement 
of comprehensive income, are materially misstated through 
the use of inappropriate assumptions and judgement.
Our response – Our procedures included obtaining the 
financial models used to assess the property provisions and 
comparing the methodology used to our interpretation of the 
requirements of the relevant accounting standards. We agreed 
the data input for a sample of properties, such as lease costs 
and expiry dates to the original signed lease agreements 
and expected sub-let income to existing sub-lease income 
agreements, third party valuation reports or where neither 
of those were available to the assumptions made by the in-
house property specialist. We critically evaluated the discount 
rates used to discount forecast cash flows associated with 
the provisions by comparing the specific rates used to market 
data relevant to those cash flows. We critically evaluated the 
expected costs included in the models against the historical 
trend of charges incurred in respect of dilapidations and 
removing asbestos. We assessed the accuracy of the 
models by re-performing the calculation of the provisions. 
We performed sensitivity analysis on the key drivers within 
the financial models, including discount rates, forecast cash 
outflow and inflow and property utilisation rates to ascertain 
the extent of change in those assumptions would be required 
for the provisions to be further increased or decreased. We 
also considered the likelihood of such movements in those key 
assumptions arising. We also considered the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in relation to the property provisions in 
accordance with the relevant accounting standards.
Acquisition accounting in respect of Booker Retail Partners 
(GB) Limited (‘BRP’) £82.8m- net assets (New risk)
Refer to page 30 (Audit Committee Report), page 72 
(accounting policy) and page 81 (financial disclosures).
The risk – In September 2015 the Group acquired Booker 
Retail Partners (GB) Limited, formerly Musgrave Retail Partners 
GB Limited, from Musgrave Group Plc. Accounting for this 
acquisition has involved significant judgement in respect 
of the identification of intangible assets such as brands and 
customers relationships. It has also included assessing the 
fair value of the net assets acquired in particular in respect 
of acquired properties, lease contracts and other property 
liabilities, working capital, and the calculation of amounts 
related to defined benefit pension schemes and taxation.
Our response – Our audit procedures included challenging the 
Directors’ assessment of the fair value of the assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed with reference to evidence provided 
by third parties (such as property surveyors and actuaries). 
We critically evaluated the external valuers engaged by the 
Directors involved in assessing the fair value of properties 
and amounts related to defined benefit pension schemes.

We also used our own specialists to challenge the acquisition 
accounting including the amounts related to defined benefit 
pension schemes and taxation, and the identification of 
intangible assets. We have also considered the adequacy of 
the Group’s disclosures in respect of the acquisition of BRP.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of 
the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £7.6m (2015: £7.1m), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before tax of £150.8m  
(2015: £138.8m), of which it represents 5.0% (2015: 5.1%). 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £0.35m (2015: £0.35m), 
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s seven reporting components, we subjected four 
to audits for Group reporting purposes and the remaining three to 
reviews (including enquiry) of financial information. The latter were 
not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for 
Group reporting purposes, but provided us with additional audit 
coverage. Our work covered 100% of the Group’s profit before 
tax, revenues and total assets (2015: 100%). 
The Group audit team carried out the work on all the  
components at the Group’s offices in Wellingborough, Deeside, 
Uxbridge and Eccles. Component materialities ranged between 
£1.1m and £6m (2015: between £5m and £6m).
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and  
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the  
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 17, concerning the 
principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the 
directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s 
continuing in operation over the three years to 2019; or 
• the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 17, in relation to

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
a) Overview
Booker Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom (Registration number 05145685). The 
Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Equity House, Irthlingborough Road, Wellingborough, 
Northamptonshire, NN8 1LT. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic and 
Directors’ Reports.
b) Basis of accounting
In accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted for use in the EU as at 25 March 2016 (‘adopted IFRS’), International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’) including FRS101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’).  
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. 
The financial statements for the current period have been prepared for a 52 week period to reflect internal management reporting.
c) Basis of consolidation
On 4 June 2007 the Company, then named Blueheath Holdings plc, became the legal parent company of Giant Topco Limited in 
a share-for-share transaction. Due to the relative values of the companies, the former Giant Topco Limited shareholders became 
the majority shareholders with 90.36% of the enlarged share capital. As part of the business combination Blueheath Holdings plc 
changed its name to Booker Group plc and changed its accounting reference date to 31 March. Following the transaction, the 
Company’s continuing operations and executive management were predominantly those of Booker Wholesale Holdings Limited. 
IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’ defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control. Accordingly, the 
combination was accounted as a reverse acquisition i.e. as if Giant Topco Limited had acquired Blueheath Holdings plc in return 
for consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
d) Accounting standards adopted in the period
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued and applied by the Group in these financial statements for the first time. Their 
adoption does not have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
New standards: None
Amendments and interpretations:
• Amendments to IAS19 ‘Defined benefit plans: Employee contributions’
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-12 cycle
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-13 cycle
Their adoption does not have a material effect on the financial statements. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements
71
e) New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for 
financial statements after this reporting period but have not yet been endorsed by the European Union as follows:
Effective for 
accounting 
periods starting 
on or after
IFRS14 ‘Regulatory Deferral Accounts’ 1 January 2016
Amendments to IFRS10, IFRS12 and IAS28 ‘Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception’ 1 January 2016
Amendments to IAS16 and IAS28 ‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation’ 1 January 2016
Amendments to IFRS11 ‘Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations’ 1 January 2016
IFRS15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 1 January 2018
IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 1 January 2018
IFRS16 ‘Leases’ 1 January 2019
The application of these standards and interpretations is not anticipated to have a material effect on the Group’s financial 
statements, other than IFRS16 ‘Leases’ which is currently being assessed.
f) Going concern
The risks noted in the Strategic Report are those known to the Directors at the date of this Report which the Directors consider 
to be material to the Group, but these do not necessarily comprise all the risks to which the Group is exposed. In particular, the 
Group’s performance could be adversely affected by poor economic conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties currently 
unknown to the Directors, or which the Directors currently believe are immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on the 
business, financial condition or prospects of the Group.
In August 2015, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of £120m for a period of 5 years. At the period end, the Group 
had net cash of £127.4m. In addition, the Group complied with all its covenants during the year. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance and considering the risks identified, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its bank facility. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group and Company financial statements.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1. General information continued
g) Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other  
factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the  
estimates about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement and the Directors believe that the most critical accounting policies and 
significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for:
• IAS37 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’. The Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are 
no longer required for trading. Judgement is applied in determining whether leases are onerous. Whilst every effort is made 
to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible to do so. Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a provision is 
established for the difference between amounts contractually payable to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable 
from the tenant (if any). In addition, provisions exist for the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties and the 
expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties. The Directors consider that their estimates, which are 
based upon the advice of an in-house property department who monitor the UK property market, are appropriate. 
• IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’. Following the acquisition of Booker Retail Partners (GB) Limited and its subsidiaries, the 
Directors are required to fair value the assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. There is an exercise of judgement 
involved in identifying and valuing the assets acquired. A summary of the assets and liabilities and the fair value adjustments 
are disclosed in note 9.
• IAS19 ‘Employee benefits’ . Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified 
actuary but significant estimates are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, 
investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations. Sensitivities in relation to key assumptions are disclosed in  
note 18.
• IAS36 ‘Impairment of assets’. In testing for impairment of goodwill and other assets, the Directors make judgements in 
determining the cash generating units (‘CGUs’) within the Group and allocating goodwill to these CGUs. They then make 
assumptions concerning the future development of the CGUs that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast into 
perpetuity. Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible 
that goodwill included in the balance sheet could be impaired. At 25 March 2016, the Directors do not consider that any 
reasonably likely changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the goodwill to become impaired. Sensitivities 
in relation to key assumptions are disclosed in note 11.
• IAS12 ‘Income Taxes’. In applying the Group’s accounting policy in relation to deferred tax, as set out below, the Directors are 
required to make assumptions regarding the Group’s ability to utilise historical tax assets following an assessment of the likely 
quantum and timing of future taxable profits. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that the Directors are confident 
that the Group’s future profits will utilise historical tax assets. Similarly, the Directors are required to make an assessment of 
the quantum and timing of any future utilisation of Advanced Corporation Tax (‘ACT’) and will only recognise ACT when they 
are certain that it can be utilised.
2. Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Group financial statements. 
Intangible assets
a) Business combinations and goodwill
Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill 
represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 
2006, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of 
whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is capitalised and is subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value 
may not be recoverable.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements
73
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs related to the 
acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Any contingent 
consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is 
not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
b) Other intangibles
Customer relationships and know-how are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 5 years, which is considered to 
be the useful economic life, and charged to administrative expenses.
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised when goods are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods net 
of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax. Discounts are accounted for in the period they are earned. Provision is made 
for expected customer returns.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents all costs incurred, net of supplier rebates (see below), up to the point of sale including the operating 
expenses of the trading outlets.
Supplier rebates
A number of different types of rebate are negotiated with suppliers in connection with the purchase of goods for resale.  
Such rebates are only recognised when earned by the Group, which occurs when all obligations conditional for earning the 
rebate have been discharged, and the rebate can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract. These rebates are 
recognised as a credit within cost of sales and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in 
the cost of inventory.
There are two main types of supplier rebates:
a)  Terms, which are generally annual agreements (not always coterminous with the Group’s year end), are signed by the Group 
and the supplier. Rebates are determined relative to volumes purchased or by other conditional arrangements as follows:
• Volume based rebates include overriders, advertising allowances and targeted income. Rebates are accrued based on the 
Group’s purchasing volumes and the current agreement with the supplier. Amounts are recognised once confirmation of 
agreement to that rebate has been received from the supplier
• Non-volume based rebates include marketing support, range promotion and product development. Amounts are recognised 
when the rebate is earned through the completion of any required obligations and confirmed by suppliers
Invoices are issued to suppliers periodically, quarterly or annually, depending on the terms of the agreement. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements
74
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Accounting policies continued
Supplier rebates continued
b)  Promotional funding, which relates to price investments by suppliers through promotional activity. The calculation of funding 
is mechanical and based on a formula agreed in advance of each promotion with the supplier. Funding is recognised in the 
Income Statement as units are sold and is invoiced throughout the year, shortly after each promotion has ended.
Amounts relating to supplier rebates appear in a number of different balance sheet headings at the year end:
• Inventories: Where the rebate earned relates to inventories which are held by the Group at year end, the rebates are deducted 
from the cost of those inventories
• Trade receivables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding at the period end where the Group has no legal right to offset against 
trade payables
• Trade payables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding when the Group has a legal right to offset against payables
• Prepayments and accrued income: amounts due from suppliers in relation to supplier rebates which has been recognised but 
not yet invoiced
• Accruals and deferred income: amounts received in relation to supplier rebates that have not been earned at the year end
Employee benefits
a) Share based payments
The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them. The 
fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the 
period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in 
a separate share option reserve. This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, based on 
related service and non-market vesting conditions that are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as 
an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the 
vesting date.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
b) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as incurred.
c) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet 
date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The defined benefit 
obligation calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses were recognised as at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs. In respect of actuarial 
gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 April 2006 the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in other 
comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Under IAS 19 (2011), the Group determines the net interest expense/(income) for the period on the net defined benefit  
liability/asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to 
the net defined benefit liability/asset at the beginning of the period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit  
liability/asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. 
d) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. An accrual is recognised for the amount 
expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Exceptional items
As permitted by IAS1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’, an item is disclosed separately if it is considered unusual by its nature 
and scale, and is of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. 
Such items are referred to as exceptional items. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements
75
Financial instruments
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so 
classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up 
share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated 
with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, available for sale financial assets, cash and cash 
equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
a) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
b) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits repayable on demand. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on 
demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
d) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost. Costs associated with extending the bank 
facility have been recognised in the income statement. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of 
the transaction.
Guarantees
Third party property guarantees are initially recognised as a financial liability under IAS37 ’Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’. These are measured and recognised at fair value. These property guarantees are included within ‘Provisions’ 
on the balance sheet.
Impairment 
The carrying values of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date to determine whether there is any impairment. In performing the impairment reviews, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is 
recognised in the income statement. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Accounting policies continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on either the weighted average principle or the 
FIFO basis and includes certain warehousing and distribution costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their existing location 
and condition less attributable supplier volume rebates (see above). Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the 
estimated costs of disposal.
Investment in joint ventures
The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity 
method of accounting. The Group records its share of the joint controlled entities’ post tax profit or loss within the income 
statement and its share of the net assets within investments. Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, 
unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture.
Leases
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Where a lease has a minimum fixed increase, the total minimum lease payments are spread over the lease term. The total 
amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the income statement charge relative to the lease 
payments change. The excess of the rent charged over the cash payment in any period will be held on the balance sheet within 
‘Accruals and deferred income’.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Operating segments
IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires that segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information 
that is provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The CODM has been identified as the CEO. In accordance with 
IFRS8, the Group may aggregate operating segments into one reportable segment to the extent that the criteria for aggregation 
in IFRS8 are met. These criteria include consideration of whether the operating segments have similar economic characteristics; 
similar nature of products and services; similar type or class of customers; similar methods used to distribute products or provide 
services; and similar regulatory environments.
The CODM receives turnover information analysed in a number of different ways (for example by customer and product types, by 
delivery channels and between Wholesale, Booker Direct, Chef Direct, and Ritter-Courivaud). However, none of these ‘possible’ 
segments have a unique management structure, products share the same supply chain and distribution channels, and there are 
a large amount of supplier rebates, expenses and assets/(liabilities) that are not specific. It is therefore not possible to analyse, 
and the CODM does not receive, information in respect of profitability or balance sheets in the same way in which turnover is 
analysed. Internal reports reviewed regularly by the CODM focus on the operations of the Group as a whole and report the results 
and financial position on an IFRS basis.
As a result, the Group has not disclosed discrete financial information about any of the ‘possible segments’, which in any event 
would meet the criteria for aggregation under IFRS8, separately in these financial statements. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Where parts of an 
item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment. Labour and associated costs that have been incurred specifically on the ‘Extra’ business centre conversions 
have been capitalised in leasehold improvements and are being depreciated over the lesser of 10 years or the number of years 
remaining on the lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as 
finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately 
from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their 
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements
77
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Freehold buildings  30 years
• Leasehold improvements  lesser of the unexpired term of the lease and 50 years
• Plant and equipment  3–20 years
• Motor vehicles   4 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with an immaterial amount in administrative expenses.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Taxation
Tax expense included in the Income Statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity, or to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets (excluding goodwill) and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill and the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, to the extent that they will probably 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following 
an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the amount which is recognised is 
increased or reduced to the extent that it is then probable or no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
3. Segmental reporting
The Group has considered the principles of IFRS8 as well as its internal reporting, management and operating structure. The 
Directors’ conclusion is that the Group has a single reportable segment, that of wholesaling activities.
Other than the operation in India (which is immaterial), all of the Group’s revenue originates from the UK. The functional currency 
of the Indian operation is Rupees. 
The Group has no significant reliance on any individual customers. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) 
were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Further reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 
2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. The deferred tax asset at 25 March 2016 has been calculated based on 
these rates. 
An additional reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was announced in the Budget on 16 March 2016. This, if enacted, will 
reduce the group’s future current tax charge and the value of its deferred tax asset accordingly.
8. Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

9. Business combination
On 14 September 2015, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Musgrave Retail Partners GB Limited and its subsidiaries 
(‘Budgens and Londis’) for £40m on a cash/debt free basis with a normalised working capital level. This resulted in overall 
consideration of £110.9m being the sum of £40.0m plus net cash acquired of £66.4m and a working capital adjustment of £4.5m. 
Originally, it was acquired by Booker Group plc, but this was subsequently transferred to Booker Wholesale Holdings Ltd.
Through Booker, Budgens and Londis coming together, the Group seeks to become the UK’s leading wholesaler to independent 
retailers by:
• combining the best ranges from Booker, Budgens and Londis to improve the overall choice;
• consolidating buying volumes to improve prices for customers; and
• better utilisation of the supply chain network to reduce costs.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:

Net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities 83.9 (1.1) 82.8
Goodwill 28.1
Cash consideration 110.9
The fair value adjustments made on acquisition have primarily had the effect of:
• increasing the property valuations;
• increasing the pension surplus to reflect valuations of the schemes in accordance with IAS19;
• increasing provisions in respect of rents that are not in line with the market rent; and
• providing for deferred tax liabilities in respect of the above adjustments.
The goodwill is underpinned by the synergies that the Group is expected to obtain from improved cost prices from suppliers and 
logistics efficiencies. None of the goodwill recognised will be deductible for tax purposes.
In the 28 weeks to 25 March 2016, BRP contributed turnover of £340.9m and, a loss (before synergies and accounting policy 
alignment) before interest, tax and exceptional items of £7.5m.
Turnover for the 52 weeks to 25 March 2016 was £680.0m with a loss (before synergies and accounting policy alignment) before 
interest, tax and exceptional items of £9.7m. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

Goodwill arose in the Group from the following:
• the acquisition of Budgens and Londis in September 2015 (see note 9);
• the acquisition of the Big Food Group Limited by Giant Topco Limited in February 2005; and
• the acquisition of Ritter-Courivaud Limited in October 2010.
During the prior period, the Group paid £1m, with a further £1m of contingent consideration payable in accordance with the 
procurement agreement with Provenance Too Limited which holds the intellectual property in Provenance Limited. Provenance 
Too Limited has no other assets or liabilities and the entire consideration has been classified as know-how, since the Group has 
acquired expertise in the sourcing and supply of ‘Fruit and vegetables’.
Under IAS36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if 
indicators of impairment exist. Impairment reviews compare the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and net 
operating assets contained in each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is considered to be its value in use, calculated by reference to the pre-tax cash flow 
projections of each CGU based on the Group’s approved budget for 2017 and three year plan to 2019.  Cash flows beyond this 
period are extrapolated into perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2% (2015: 2%), being the Directors’ estimated view of 
the long term compound growth in the economy.  This is considered appropriate because the CGU is considered to be a long 
term business. The discount rate used reflects the market assumptions for the risk free rate and equity risk premium and also 
takes into account the cost of debt.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the level of sales, gross margin and expenses within 
the business and have been set by the Directors based on their past experience of the business and its industry together with 
their expectations of the market. The level of sales depends upon the size of the markets in which the Group operates together 
with the Directors’ estimations of its market share and competitive pressures. Gross margin is dependent upon the net costs to 
the business of purchasing products together with the level of supplier rebates and income to support sales activities.  Expenses 
are based on the current cost base of the Group adjusted for variable costs and known plans for the business.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
11. Intangible assets continued
The Directors believe that three CGUs exist within the Group:
a) Ritter – goodwill allocated £12.5m (2015: £12.5m)
A pre tax discount rate of 9.4% (2015: 9.7%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require 
an impairment to be made.
b) Budgens and Londis – goodwill allocated £3.1m (2015: n/a)
A pre tax discount rate of 12.0% has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require 
an impairment to be made.
c) Remaining business – goodwill allocated £448.9m (2015: £423.9m)
A pre tax discount rate of 9.5% (2015: 9.7%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require 
an impairment to be made.
Last year, the Directors identified Makro as a CGU. Over the last 12 months this business has been fully integrated into the Booker 
network, with customers being moved between branches to ensure the most efficient result for the Group and the customer. It is 
therefore no longer considered to be a CGU as it does not generate independent cash inflows.
The Directors believe that the assumptions on which the carrying value of intangible and net operating assets is supported are 
reasonable and that no impairment is required.

Loans and other receivables represent amounts receivable from the sale of goods, together with amounts due from supplier 
rebates (see note 15) and are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently held at amortised cost.
Fair value of property guarantees have been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and 
maturity and risk of each guarantee crystallising.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique 
used to determine fair value:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

Liquidity risk
The Group will finance operations and growth from existing cash resources, finance leases and committed borrowing facilities 
to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet both current and future  
forecast requirements.
In August 2015, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of £120m for a period of 5 years. The revolving credit facility 
bears floating interest rates linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.8%. In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, any 
drawn facility and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.

Trade and other payables 616.6 – – – –
2015
Trade and other payables 542.7 – – – –
It is not possible to quantify the timing of the cash flows relating to the property guarantees.
The undiscounted cash flows for borrowings differ from their carrying value in the balance sheet due to the inclusion of contractual 
interest payments and the adjustment for non-cash items including unamortised borrowing costs. The undiscounted cash flows 
for financial instruments reflect the amounts payable on these instruments which differs from the fair value recorded on the 
balance sheet. There is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due 
to their short term nature.
Credit risk
The Group is predominantly a cash sales business with low levels of trade receivables in comparison to total sales for the year and 
has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. It is the Group’s policy that 
all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group has an accounting policy 
to provide for certain overdue trade receivables based on past experience, and believe that there are no significant unprovided 
overdue financial assets.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is relatively small to the Group, as there are no fixed borrowings and the revolving credit facility is only partially 
drawn for a small part of the year. Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings. 
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it 
in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital 
all components of equity are taken into account (i.e. share capital and retained earnings). The Group has £127.4m of net cash as 
at 25 March 2016 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Management of capital therefore focuses around 
its ability to generate cash from its operations. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements
89
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds. The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for 
managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to 
shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
Less than 1% of purchases are denominated in foreign currencies.
The majority of sales are denominated in sterling, with the exception of sales made from the Group’s Indian operation which are 
denominated in rupees.
The Directors do not consider that the Group has significant exposure to movements in foreign exchange and the Group does 
not hold any foreign exchange contracts.
18. Post employment benefits
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit and funded 
defined contribution schemes to provide benefits to both full-time and part-time employees. 
Defined contribution schemes
Pension contributions of £6.4m (2015: £5.3m) were charged to defined contribution schemes in the period. Included within 
accruals is £0.5m (2015: £0.4m) of outstanding pension contributions.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee-administered 
funds to meet future benefit payments.
The main Group pension scheme is the Booker Pension Scheme (‘the Booker Scheme’), a funded defined benefit pension 
arrangement based on final salary and which was closed to new entrants in 2001 with benefits ceasing to accrue from 2002. 
However, active members’ benefits retain a link to their final salaries.
On 14 September 2015 the Group acquired Musgrave Retail Partners GB Limited, which operates the Budgens Pension Scheme 
(‘the Budgens Scheme’) and the Londis Pension Scheme (‘the Londis Scheme’), both trust based occupational defined benefit 
pension schemes. The Londis Scheme was closed to new entrants in 1991 and future benefit accrual in 2009. The Budgens 
Scheme closed to both new entrants and future accrual in 2010, albeit active member’s benefits retain a link to their final salaries.
The benefit obligations as at 25 March 2016 have been calculated by an independent actuary on an IAS19 basis, by rolling forward 
from the results of the latest actuarial funding valuation, which is 31 March 2013, 31 March 2015 and 1 April 2014 for the Booker 
Scheme, the Budgens Scheme and the Londis Scheme respectively.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method.
(a) Major assumptions used by the actuary – weighted average
 2016 2015
Discount rate 3.50% 3.40%
RPI inflation 3.00% 2.95%
CPI inflation 2.00% 1.95%
Rate of increase in salaries 2.00% 1.95%
Pension increases in payment 2.95% 2.90%
The average life expectancy in years of a member is as follows:
 2016 2015
Aged 65 retiring immediately (current pensioner) Male 21.6 21.5
Female 23.9 23.7
Aged 40 retiring at 65 (future pensioner) Male 23.4 22.7
Female 25.8 25.1
At 25 March 2016, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 16 years. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

(g) Sensitivities
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate, RPI inflation, 
salary increases, pension increases, and life expectancy. The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period of reasonably possible changes in these assumptions, which have been determined 
in isolation whilst holding all other assumptions constant:
Discount rate     +/- 0.1%  Decrease/increase in liabilities by £11m
RPI inflation rate     +/- 0.1%  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £9m
Rate of increases in salaries    +/- 0.1%  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £0.4m
Pension increases in payment   +/- 0.1%  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £5m
Life expectancy for current and future pensioners +/- 1 year  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £24m
Changes in RPI inflation impact CPI inflation and pension increases both before retirement and in payment.
(h) Contributions to be paid
Booker Scheme – the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 31 March 2013, which revealed a shortfall of approximately 
£24m. This shortfall was expected to be recovered through Company deficit contributions (£9.6m paid in the year ending  
31 March 2014 and £2.4m paid in the year ending 31 March 2015) and the returns achievable on the assets of the Scheme.  
No contributions have been paid over this period. The contribution schedule will be reviewed following next actuarial valuation of 
the Booker Scheme, which is scheduled for 31 March 2016.
Budgens Scheme – the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 31 March 2015, which revealed a nil shortfall at  
this date.
Londis Scheme – the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 1 April 2014, which revealed a shortfall of £0.5 million 
at this date. This shortfall is expected to be recovered through returns on the scheme assets, and no contributions are required. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

The property provisions principally relate to:
• the onerous leases on property currently vacant or sublet for less than the cost of the underlying head lease;
• the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties; and
• the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties. Although not a health risk, the Group is legally 
required to undertake a programme of removal.
Certain onerous lease provisions relating to vacant properties have been adjusted during the year, following a reassessment of the 
length of time those properties would remain vacant. Additionally, following the acquisition of Booker Retail Partners (GB)Limited, 
a review has been made of the future dilapidation costs on leasehold properties. All of these provision movements result in a net 
£nil charge to the Income Statement.
Approximately £4m is expected to be utilised in the year to March 2017.
Other provisions relate to third party property guarantees, for which the timing and quantum of payments is uncertain. Payment 
could be made on demand and the provision represents management’s current estimate of the future liability.

Company redeemed 1,740,934,613 B shares for 3.5 pence per share (a total of £60.9m) and the shares were cancelled. The 
3,000,150 remaining B shares (a total of £0.1m) have been classified as a financial liability in accruals and deferred income, and 
were redeemed on 30 April 2015 for 3.5 pence per share. Following the redemption, such B shares were cancelled.
On 20 July 2015 the Company issued 1,766,091,414 B shares that were redeemable by the shareholder. On 21 July 2015 the 
Company redeemed 1,764,571,053 B shares for 3.5 pence per share (a total of £61.8m) and the shares were cancelled. The 
1,520,361 remaining B shares (a total of £0.1m) have been classified as a financial liability in accruals and deferred income, and 
were redeemed on 29 April 2016 for 3.5 pence per share. Following the redemption, such B shares were cancelled.
The Board is proposing to implement another capital return to shareholders of 3.20 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £57m, based on the current issued share capital of the company). It is proposed that this is achieved by the issue 
of a new class of ‘B’ shares. The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the AGM on  
6 July 2016.  Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

23. Share based payments
The Group has a number of share schemes for employees. The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based 
payments was £6.9m (2015: £5.3m), all of which related to equity-settled share based payment transactions.
a) Sharesave schemes
The Sharesave scheme has been in operation since 2008 and all employees are eligible to participate once the necessary service 
requirements have been met. Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the average of the market value of a share on the 
three dealing days immediately preceding the offer. Options are exercisable three years after the commencement of the savings 
contract and not more than six months thereafter. The options granted have been fair valued using the Black Scholes option 
pricing model, using the following assumptions:

PSP 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015
The options granted in November 2012 (6.0 million options), October 2013 (4.2 million options), October 2014 (6.9 million options) 
and October 2015 (5.1 million options) to senior employees all had the same conditions. They will vest and become exercisable 
three years from the date of the award, subject to continued employment and the performance conditions mentioned below being 
satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award. The awards are granted in two tranches:
i) Earnings Per Share (EPS) condition 
50% of each award will be linked to an absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving growth of 
6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured at the year end 
prior to the grant and then 3 years later.
ii) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition
50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving growth 
of 8% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 
3 years from the grant date.

24. Operating leases
The Group leases a number of trading properties under operating leases. The leases are typically of 5 to 15 years duration, 
although some have lessee only break clauses. Lease payments are reviewed as contracted and increases applied accordingly. 
The Group also leases certain items of plant and equipment.
Operating lease payments represent rents payable by the Group for certain of its wholesale, distribution and office properties and 
other assets such as motor vehicles. The leases have varying terms, escalation charges and renewal rights.
At the balance sheet date, the Group (including Booker Retail Parters (GB) Limited) had outstanding commitments for future

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
a) Basis of preparation
Booker Group plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(‘FRS101’). The amendments to FRS101 (2013/14 Cycle) issued in July 2014 and effective immediately have been applied. In these 
financial statements, the Company has adopted FRS101 for the first time. In transition to FRS101 there has been no effect on the 
reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary 
in order to comply with Companies Act 2006. The Company has not taken advantage of the FRS101 disclosure exemptions. 
In the transition to FRS101, the Company has applied IFRS1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in 
compliance with FRS101. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
b) New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective 
for financial statements after this reporting period but have not yet been endorsed by the European Union as set out in note 1(e) 
to the group financial statements.
c) Use of judgements and estimates
Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below: 
• IAS36 ‘Impairment of assets’. In testing for impairment of investments and other assets, the Directors have made certain 
assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast  
into perpetuity. Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is 
possible that investments included in the balance sheet could be impaired. At 25 March 2016, the Directors do not consider 
that any reasonably likely changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the investments or other assets to 
become impaired. 
• IFRS2 ‘Share based payments’. The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange 
for services rendered by them. The fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is 
recognised as an employee expense over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in a separate share option reserve. This valuation is based on estimates of the 
number of options that will eventually vest, based on related service and non-market vesting conditions that are expected to 
be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related 
service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial statements and in preparing an opening FRS101 balance sheet at 28 March 2014 for the purposes of the transition to 
FRS101.
Guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make 
a payment under the guarantee.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. The carrying values of investments are reviewed for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Share based payments
The Company has issued equity settled share based payments to employees of a subsidiary. The fair value is measured using 
an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. This fair value is 
accounted as an investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding increase in equity. Where the Company grants options over 
its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of 
investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its consolidated financial 
statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
Taxation
The Company applies the same accounting policy as the group, as set out in note 2 of the Group financial statements.
3. Profit and loss account
The audit fee of £0.1m (2015: £0.1m) for the current and prior period was borne by another group undertaking without recharge.
(a) Employee information
 The Company had no employees throughout this or the previous period.
(b) Directors’ remuneration
The Director’s remuneration is borne by a subsidiary company and it is disclosed in the Remuneration Report. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Tax charge for the period – –
Factors that may affect future current and total tax charge:
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) 
were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Further reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 
2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. The deferred tax asset at 25 March 2016 has been calculated based on 
these rates. 
An additional reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was announced in the Budget on 16 March 2016. This will reduce the 
group’s future current tax charge and the value of its deferred tax asset accordingly. Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 / Financial Statements

Credit risk
The Company is owed £514.4m (2015: £404.4m) by group undertakings.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is relatively small to the Group, as there are no fixed borrowings and the revolving credit facility is only partially 
drawn for a small part of the year. Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

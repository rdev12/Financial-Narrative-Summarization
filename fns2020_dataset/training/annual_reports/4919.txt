 Focus on our franchisees
Amir Zarinabad joined the Chalk Farm branch 
of Domino’s in 1992 as a trainee manager, 
having just ﬁ nished at college, and opened 
his ﬁ rst franchise in 1999. Ajaz Mirza took a 
part-time job as a driver in 1996, while he was 
a student. In 2001, the two joined forces and 
began running stores together.
 
Ajaz says: “I originally came to Domino’s, 
looking for part-time work to get myself through 
university – I didn’t expect it to lead where it 
has. But it’s been fantastic – I’ve got a great 
job that allows me the ﬂ exibility to enjoy a nice 
lifestyle, with a good income, and I’ve been 
instrumental in developing people in the 
business. We’ve got several team members who,
like me, started as drivers or part-time store 
staff and have completed the management 
development programme to the point where 
they are now managing their own stores.”
 
Amir adds: “I joined Domino’s as I was really 
taken with the idea of owning my own store. 
It’s proved to be a really good move and it’s 
great to be part of such a successful brand – 
Domino’s offers a great business model with 
good support for franchisees. I can’t think of 
anything else I would rather be doing.”

I am pleased, in my ﬁ rst year as 
Chairman, to be reporting a year 
of signiﬁ cant achievement both 
operationally and corporately. Proﬁ t 
before tax and exceptional items rose 
24.7% to £23.4m, on system sales 
growth up 18.4% to £350.8m. 
In addition, we opened 52 new 
stores, exceeding our annual target 
of 50 stores for the ﬁ rst time. This 
was an excellent performance given 
both the uncertain economic climate 
and the very tough comparatives we 
were up against from last year.
Corporately it has also been an eventful year with our
move from the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) 
to the Ofﬁ cial List on 19 May 2008 (Admission). 
AIM had served us well since 1999, but with the 
rapid growth we have achieved and our objective to 
broaden our investor base, a change was necessary.
Admission was closely followed by our inclusion in the
FTSE 250 Index and we are conﬁ dent that over 
the long-term this will improve the liquidity and 
marketability of our shares. We were particularly
proud during the last 12 months to have our 
achievements recognised by winning both the AIM 
Investors Company of the Year and the Shares 
Magazine Main Market Company Achievement 
awards, as well as a Catey Award for Best Use 
of Technology.
Our continued expansion this year could not have 
been achieved without the hard work, passion 
and entrepreneurial ﬂ air of our franchisees. We 
have a strong and positive relationship with all of 
our franchisees and together we work very closely

Delivering to the 
highest standards...  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 5
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
in maintaining our position as the leading home 
delivery pizza company in the UK and the Republic of
Ireland. It is particularly pleasing that the impressive 
growth of last year was predominantly achieved in 
partnership with our existing franchisees, who opened
all but one of the new stores. This, combined with 
further consolidation in the ownership of existing 
stores, has increased the average number of stores 
per franchisee. This greater concentration further 
improves the returns our franchisees can achieve 
and makes them signiﬁ cantly more resilient to a 
changing economic climate.  
Our recent strong growth in more challenging times 
keeps us on target to exceed 1,000 stores in the 
next 10 years. In addition, as a result of our recent 
successes in smaller towns, the growing acceptance 
of home delivered meals and the predicted growth 
in population and new housing, we now believe that 
there is capacity for well in excess of 1,000 stores 
in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Our dedicated corporate and commissary teams have
also played an essential part in the success of the 
business over the last year and I would like to thank 
all of them for their focus and professionalism, which
has helped to drive one of the best performances in 
the leisure sector. A unique feature of our business 
model is that as we grow the number of stores and 
system sales, our headcount and costs do not need 
to grow proportionally. This is enhanced when the 
number of stores per franchisee increases, as the 
larger franchisee groups rely less on the corporate 
team to support their activities. We therefore remain 
conﬁ dent that our growth in proﬁ ts can continue to 
out pace the growth in system sales. 
We were delighted to welcome Peter Klauber to our 
Board during the year as an additional, independent
Non-Executive Director. Peter is a former senior 
partner at Ernst & Young and brings a wealth of 
experience to the Board. We also strengthened our 
senior management team in the ﬁ rst quarter with 
the appointment of Adam Batty as General Counsel 
and Company Secretary and Jon Campbell as 
Procurement Director. Adam joined from leading pub
company Mitchells & Butlers plc and was responsible
for the process of Domino’s joining the Ofﬁ cial List. 
Adam is also in charge of the Company’s compliance
with legal, regulatory and governance matters. Jon 
was previously Purchasing Director at Bakkavor, the 
international food manufacturing company, and is
responsible for the cost-effective procurement of
food and non-food items supplied to franchisees as 
well as the re-engineering of our supply chain in a 
number of our key product lines.
Our strategy has been and remains to return 
surplus cash to shareholders. For 2008, the Board 
is proposing a ﬁ nal dividend to shareholders for the 
year of 3.2p per share up 28.0% on last year which, 
if approved, will result in a total dividend for 2008 
of 5.9p per share, up 34.1% on last year. During the 
ﬁ rst half of the year we undertook a programme of 
share buybacks which, combined with the dividend
payments, resulted in a total of £11.8m being 
returned to shareholders in 2008. This represents 
75% of 2008 post-tax earnings and brings the ﬁ ve 
year average of cash returned to shareholders to 
103% of post-tax earnings, totalling £55.6m. It is 
our intention to continue to return surplus cash to 
shareholders in the most effective way possible.
In the current economic climate, we are pleased to 
be able to continue our aggressive expansion plans, 
which are a real cause for celebration. If we deliver 
our target of an additional 50 new store openings 
in 2009, we will create at least another 1,500 new 
jobs in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Our 
business model is proving to be extremely resilient 
during the downturn as people dine out less and 
order from a trusted brand that offers great value for
money. We believe that current market conditions 
will allow us to further increase our market share 
and strengthen our position in the home delivery 
market. We therefore look forward to the future 
with conﬁ dence.

10.0%
 Like-for-like sales
 (2007: 14.7%)
I am delighted to report another 
excellent set of results this year, 
which reﬂ ects great momentum in 
the business with like-for-like sales 
growth of 10.0%, building on the 
very strong performance in 2007. 
This growth has been achieved while 
continuing our aggressive expansion 
programme, with a record 52 new 
stores successfully opened during 
the year, bringing the total number 
of stores at the year end to 553 and 
leaving us on track to exceed our 
target of at least 1,000 stores in the 
next 10 years.
Our growth continues to be driven by our unfaltering
focus and passion for the delivery of our three key 
priorities – namely great quality pizza, outstanding
customer service and innovative marketing that 
resonates with our customers. This combination has 
resulted in total system sales increasing by 18.4% 
and proﬁ t before tax, pre-exceptionals, up 24.7%. 
I am particularly delighted that this growth was 
achieved with our existing franchisees, who between 
them opened 51 of the 52 new stores, moving the 
average number of stores per franchisee – a measure
we have been looking to increase – to 4.2 in 2008, 
up from 3.5 in 2007 and 3.0 in 2006.  
And it’s not surprising to see why there is so much 
internal demand. The average mature store now 
takes 45% more than it did ﬁ ve years ago resulting 
in 47 stores with sales in excess of £1.0m and, of 
the 8,700 Domino’s stores worldwide, 38 of the top 
50 stores are in our territory.

4 An increase in households opting for 
 in-home entertainment accompanied by
 delivered food at the expense of eating 
 or drinking out – a dynamic that has 
 been reinforced by the current economic 
 downturn. We believe many of these 
 customers have come from the restaurant
 sector and, by exceeding their expectations
 in terms of product quality and speed of 
 delivery, these customers will stay with
 Domino’s when the economy becomes 
 more buoyant.

So how do we do it?
Our market
Firstly, we operate in a market that offers strong growth 
potential for a number of different reasons.
Many of the consumer dynamics affecting the market are 
helping to underpin the strength of our business model. 
These dynamics have been primarily driven by social and 
lifestyle changes over the decade, such as: 8 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

Our strategy 
The ﬁ rst part of our strategy is to maximise the 
proﬁ tability of both our franchisees and the Group 
by positioning Domino’s as the best pizza delivery 
company in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. 
This premium positioning has been attained and 
is underpinned by three key elements:
A passion for product quality and menu 
innovation 
Despite the recent downward pressure on food 
prices, key ingredients are still more expensive 
than they were two years ago. In this recessionary 
environment, we believe many of our competitors 
have reduced the quality of their food. At Domino’s 
we have resolutely upheld the quality of our pizza 
and side orders and maintained our stance on no 
genetically modiﬁ ed food, no added hydrogenated 
fats and no monosodium glutamate. Additionally, 
we continue to keep the menu fresh with a constant
stream of new pizzas, side dishes and desserts.
Speed of service
Our average delivery time 
is now a market-beating 
23 minutes  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 9
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
A fanatical focus on speed of service
For the last three years we have focused in-store on
reducing the time it takes to get an order ready for 
delivery and out-the-door (OTD). This gives our drivers
ample time to deliver each order safely. This focus 
has seen the OTD time reduce from 17 minutes in 
2005 to 13 minutes in 2008, which means that the 
average delivery time is now a market-beating 23 
minutes. As a business, we know that the faster the 
customer receives their order, the sooner they are 
likely to reorder.

Andy Smith joined the Domino’s Pizza system 
as a franchisee in 2000. At the time he was 
working in Scotland as the director of a building 
company. Andy’s stores include Gateshead, 
which was one of the very ﬁ rst Domino’s stores 
opened in the UK.
 
Andy says: “I was looking for a change and 
there weren’t many pizza places in Scotland 
at the time. Domino’s had a good business 
proposition and looked like a great opportunity. 
It proved to be a lucrative decision to get in at 
the start and I’ve now got six stores across the 
North East and Scotland.
 
“Working for Domino’s and running my own 
business has brought me into contact with a wide
range of people, from all walks of life. During 
the last nine years I’ve recruited numerous staff 
and seen them develop their careers both within 
Domino’s and elsewhere. It’s a real people 
business and that’s the best thing about it for 
me – I’ve met some real characters.”

Through this strong combination of marketing at 
both a national and local level, we have increased 
our customer penetration and order frequency and 
attracted a signiﬁ cant number of new customers. 
Some 2.7 million households ordered from us during
the year, a third of which were entirely new to the 
brand. Additionally, our e-commerce platform, which
this year celebrates its tenth anniversary, continues to
exceed expectations. Mainly as a result of increased 
spend in highly targeted online marketing in 2008, 
sales grew by an extraordinary 74% while average 
ticket value was 20% higher than regular phone 
orders. E-commerce in 2008 generated 23% of 
delivered sales in the UK (2007: 16%) while online 
sales in the Republic of Ireland reached 7% of 
delivered sales for its ﬁ rst full year of operation.
The relentless marketing activity with which we 
support our brand
As our system sales grow, our franchisees’ contribution
to the National Advertising Fund (NAF) grows, 
allowing us to continue in a virtuous marketing circle.
This year the NAF increased to £18m (2007: £15m), 
which gave us the ability to secure the sponsorship 
of Britain’s Got Talent – another step change in the 
prominence of the brand in the UK. Viewing ﬁ gures 
exceeded everyone’s expectations as it captured 
the nation’s attention. The ﬁ nal show attracted an 
audience of around 14 million, which made it the 
third most watched programme of the year, and we
are looking forward to the next two series of this three
year deal. In the Republic of Ireland, we sponsored 
a number of high proﬁ le shows including X-Factor 
and I’m a Celebrity. Crucially, this greater buying 
power has been complemented by the deﬂ ationary
media market, giving access to an increased number
of advertising slots on prime time television.   Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 11
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Our expansion potential
The second part of our strategy is to pursue an 
aggressive store rollout and we are delighted to 
have exceeded our target of opening 50 new stores.  
This achievement is all the more remarkable given 
the fact that the business model is 100% franchised, 
which clearly limits the control that we have over 
the speed of rollout. It is therefore only through the 
delivery of a highly proﬁ table business model that 
our franchisees invest, enabling us to grow further. 
The new stores opened during the last 12 months 
had sales, on average, 26% higher than those stores
opened in 2007, proving that we are still able to ﬁ nd
exceptional locations and franchisees to operate them.

three 747s of equipment for a MotoGP race in 
Brazil to the transportation of a lorry load of 
4x4s to Antarctica for the Camel Trophy. Then 
one day, he decided it was time to drastically 
change his lifestyle.
 
Sean says: “My wife had just had a baby daughter
and I really wanted to spend more time at home,
so I decided on a career change. I went on the 
Internet and searched for “Cash Business”. The 
results included some information about taking 
a Domino’s franchise.
 
“I ﬂ ew to the interview from Nairobi and that 
was the end of my globe-trotting days. The

Our strategy and business model relies on strong

heavily in ensuring that we have open lines of 
communication. As well as a dedicated franchisee

We have also embarked on an ambitious

We have also invested in new facilities that will enable
us to both improve our efﬁ ciency and to give us the
additional capacity needed to meet our rollout plans.
We are in the process of expanding our facility at 
Penrith, with work nearly completed on doubling its 
capacity, at a cost of £4.0m. We have also acquired 
the freehold land for the new commissary and 
headquarters in Milton Keynes and work is already 
underway. The total cost of this project is estimated at
around £27.0m and the commissary is expected to be
completed by mid 2010 with the head ofﬁ ce following
in the third quarter of 2010. We are currently on 
track to meet both of these targets. We will also 
need to expand the commissary capacity in Ireland 
to meet the increasing demand in that territory and 
are currently investigating various options to achieve 
this goal.

Kevin says: “I really wanted to run my own 
business and develop a brand – but I realised 
that the latter was going to be a very expensive 
process and, with that in mind, I decided to 
look at the options around franchising. With 
Domino’s, I found something that is mid-way 
between the two – a great combination of your 
own business and the support and backing of a 
strong brand.
 
“It was a good choice and I really enjoy it. 
My brothers and I are very hands-on and its 
fantastic watching people come into the store at 
the bottom, get bitten by the Domino’s bug, and 
then work their way up to store manager. We’ve 
now got a very successful business, have built a 
fantastic team of people, and we have a lot of 
fun too.”

The successful delivery of this strategy continues 
to result in strong cash ﬂ ows and we already have 
the debt facilities in place to fund the new Milton 
Keynes commissary development. Accordingly, it is 
the Directors’ intention to continue to return surplus 
cash to shareholders by further share buybacks and 
dividends, or to repay debt.
Our cost controls
In line with this strong organic growth, we have also
focused over the last year on controlling our costs 
and managing our central overhead as effectively 
as possible. After the spiralling food costs of 2007, 
we made purchasing a major focus in 2008. We 
have strengthened our procurement team to utilise 
our growing buying power and, encouragingly, 
many food prices are beginning to come down. 
The procurement team will also be concentrating 
on other major costs such as utilities for both us and 
our franchisees. Our goal is to ensure that a small 
and highly efﬁ cient centre supports an ever-growing 
network of franchised stores.   Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 15

and an unpredictable economic environment. 
Our store opening programme continues apace and
plans for another 50 new store openings this year are
well underway with numerous sites in the pipeline.
We are conﬁ dent that we are well positioned for 
another year of strong growth.

 Focus on our franchisees
Nigel Hall was a director for an IT company 
when, in 1997, he decided to become a 
Domino’s franchisee. He now has ﬁ ve stores 
in and around his home town of Cardiff.
 
Nigel says: “I wanted to run my own business 
and work for myself, and I had always had an 
interest in food and catering. I was looking for 
a franchise and Domino’s had a strong brand 
and a proven operating system and I felt really 
comfortable with the people. At the time, Colin 
and Gerry Halpern were still very involved and 
I knew I could do business with them.
 
“It’s been a fantastic experience and it’s been 
great to be part of a strong and growing success.
I am lucky to have a fantastic team of people 
working with me and every day is different. 
I wouldn’t go back to IT for anything!”

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The principal key performance indicators (KPIs) that management
use to monitor the performance of the Group against its strategy,
in addition to income statement measures of performance, are 
as follows:
Same stores like-for-like sales growth 
The total sales of all stores opened on or before 31 December 
2006 in the Group’s franchisee system in the UK and the Republic 
of Ireland compared to the same period in the prior year that were 
open in both periods being compared. Like-for-like sales growth 
represents a very useful barometer of organic growth, and is an 
accepted measure of performance across all retailing sectors. 
Like-for-like sales in the 450 stores that were open in both periods 
being compared grew by 10.0% against tough comparatives 
(2007: 14.7% growth in 404 stores). Over the last ﬁ ve years the 
average like-for-like growth is 9.6%.
OTD times
The Group’s target is to safely deliver its product to its customer 
within 30 minutes of an order being placed. To accomplish this, 
the focus in-store is on efﬁ ciency and speed of process. OTD is the 
average time it takes to get the customer’s order ready to leave the
store and on its way to be delivered. In the last year this measure 
has improved by 0.5 minutes, a 3.5% improvement on the prior 
year. The average delivery now leaves the store within 13 minutes 
of the order being placed. 76% of stores now have an OTD time of 
less than 15 minutes.

performance...
System sales growth
The total sales of the Group’s franchisee system in the UK and the 
Republic of Ireland, to external customers, compared to the same 
period in the prior year, expressed as a percentage. This represents 
the most useful indicator of the overall strength of the Domino’s 
brand in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. In 2008, system sales
grew by 18.4% (2007: 23.4%) to £350.8m (2007: £296.3m). 
Adjusted proﬁ t before tax (PBT) growth
Group proﬁ t before exceptional items and before the deduction of 
taxation compared to the same period in the prior year, expressed 
as a percentage. PBT growth is a good indicator of the efﬁ ciency 
of the business model. PBT for the period was up 24.7% to £23.4m 
(2007: £18.7m).

Operating and ﬁ nancial review
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer’s review
Continuing to deliver
impressive results...
Financial highlights
The conversion of this sales growth into proﬁ t has 
been strong as we continue to beneﬁ t from the 
underlying operational gearing of our business model.
As a result, operating proﬁ t before exceptional 
charges was up 26.1% to £23.7m (2007: £18.8m), 
proﬁ t before tax before exceptional charges was 
up 24.7% to £23.4m (2007: £18.7m) and diluted 
earnings per share (EPS) before exceptional charges 
was up 28.6% to 10.71p (2007: 8.33p). 
Our cash position continues to remain strong. Net 
cash generated from operations reached £24.3m 
(2007: £24.4m) demonstrating the highly cash 
generative nature of the business. These robust and 
resilient cash ﬂ ows have underpinned the Board’s 
proposal to increase the ﬁ nal dividend by 28.0% 
to 3.2p (2007: 2.5p). At 28 December 2008, the 
Group had cash and cash equivalents of £18.6m 
(2007: £14.6m) and consolidated net debt of 
£8.2m (2007: £1.6m).
The strong trading momentum has 
continued to deliver impressive results
over the period, with total system 
sales growing by 18.4% to £350.8m 
(2007: £296.3m). Group revenue, 
which includes the sales generated 
by the Group from royalties, fees 
on new store openings, food sales, 
ﬁ nance lease and rental income, 
as well as the turnover of stores in 
subsidiary undertakings, grew by 
18.4% to £136.0m (2007: £114.9m).

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Trading results
System sales increased by 18.4% to £350.8m 
(2007: £296.3m). The main drivers of this growth 
were:
> Like-for-like sales growth of 10.0% (2007: 14.7%).
> An increased focus on driving e-commerce sales 
 with growth of 73.7% to £55.9m (2007: £32.2m).
> 52 new store openings.
> Increased average spend per order. 
> Excellent marketing initiatives and the successful 
 sponsorship of Britain’s Got Talent.
The business managed to mitigate the unprecedented
increases in food prices experienced towards the 
end of 2007 and the start of 2008. Raw material 
price increases were passed onto franchisees where 
justiﬁ able, who in turn had time to reﬂ ect them in 
their menu prices. Raw material prices continued to 
rise particularly in the ﬁ rst half of 2008 however, we 
were not impacted by these continuing increases as 
we put the vast majority of our supplies under ﬁ xed 
price contracts in 2008 as well as starting to realise 
some of the early beneﬁ ts of re-engineering our 
procurement processes.
Included in exceptional costs, shown below 
operating proﬁ t, are the costs incurred of £1.0m 
with our move from AIM to the Ofﬁ cial List of the 
Financial Services Authority and to trading on the 
London Stock Exchange’s main market. In addition, 
the Group incurred a net loss on sale of subsidiaries 
and non-current assets and assets held for sale of 
£0.2m (2007: proﬁ t of £0.3m). 
The net interest charge for the year was £0.4m 
(2007: £0.1m). This higher interest cost was incurred 
primarily due to the higher debt in the Employee 
Beneﬁ t Trust (EBT) as a result of the purchase of 2.0m
shares for the incentivisation of senior management. 
Proﬁ t before tax, after exceptional items, increased 
by 19.2% to £22.1m (2007: £18.6m). The ratio of 
proﬁ t before tax (before exceptional items) to system 
sales – a key ratio that highlights the strength of the
underlying operational gearing of our business model
– grew to 6.7% in 2008 (2007: 6.3%). This highlights
the greater efﬁ ciencies gained from the improvements
in our procurement and distribution processes and a 
tight control over overhead expenses in the business.
Taxation
Including the effect of exceptional items, the effective
tax rate in 2008 was 29.3% (2007: 28.7%). This is 
higher than the effective tax rate in 2007 and the 
underlying corporation tax rate of 28%, effective from
1 April 2008, due to the impact of the phasing out 
of the Industrial Building Allowances in the Finance 
Act 2008 and the disallowable costs associated with 
Admission, partially offset by the impact of the lower 
tax rate applicable in the Group’s Irish subsidiary 
company.
Earnings per share (EPS)
Adjusted basic EPS for the period, before exceptional
items, of 10.86p was up 28.1% on the prior year 
(2007: 8.48p). Adjusted diluted EPS for the period, 
before exceptional items, of 10.71p, was up 28.6% 
on the prior year (2007: 8.33p).
Unadjusted basic EPS for the period of 10.12p was up
20.8% on the prior year (2007: 8.38p). Unadjusted 
diluted EPS for the period of 9.97p was up 21.0% on 
the prior year (2007: 8.24p).
Dividends
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend for 
2008 of 3.2p per share. Together with the interim 
dividend of 2.7p per share paid on 29 August 
2008, the total dividend for the ﬁ nancial period 
will be 5.9p per share, an increase of 34.1% on the 
dividend paid for the prior year (2007: 4.4p). The 
total dividend is 1.7 times covered by proﬁ ts after 
tax (2007: 1.9 times).
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual 
General Meeting on 23 April 2009, the ﬁ nal dividend
will be payable on 1 May 2009, to shareholders on 
the register as at 3 April 2009.
Cash ﬂ ow and net debt
The highly cash generative nature of the business 
continues to provide for a strong cash position with 
net cash generated from operations of £24.3m 
(2007: £24.4m). 
 
During the year outﬂ ows of £0.4m of net interest, 
£6.0m of corporation tax and £9.1m of capital 
expenditure and ﬁ nancial investment were incurred.
Overall net cash ﬂ ow before ﬁ nancing was £9.8m, 
after £11.4m capital expenditure of which £9.2m was
spent on the commissary expansion programme.

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The cash generation during the year has allowed us 
to return a further £3.8m to shareholders through 
share buybacks. 
In the period, options over 0.8m shares were exercised
generating an inﬂ ow of £0.7m (2007: £0.7m).
DP Capital Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
the Company, continued to provide leasing support 
to franchisees for their new store equipment as well
as the reﬁ t of existing stores, with new advances 
of £1.0m (2007: £1.3m). After repayments, the
balance outstanding at the year end on these 
leases was £2.8m (2007: £2.8m). These facilities 
are ﬁ nanced by a limited recourse facility and the 
amount drawn down at the end of the year stood 
at £2.4m (2007: £2.4m). 
At the end of the year, the Group’s net debt was 
£8.2m (2007: £1.6m). The increase of £6.6m 
is mainly due to the increase in the EBT loan of 
£4.3m for the 2.0m shares purchased during the 
period and £9.2m capital expenditure on the 
commissary expansion programme. 
The Group monitors the ratio of net debt to 
earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) on a quarterly basis as this 
is one of the ﬁ nancial covenants for the £25m ﬁ ve-
year facility. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA remains 
exceptionally low at 0.3:1 (2007: 0.1:1) against a 
covenant of 2.5:1.
Based on the cash ﬂ ow forecasts and the available 
facilities within the Group, the Directors are of the 
opinion that no additional debt ﬁ nancing is required 
for the Group’s capital expenditure programme 
to 2017.
Banking facilities
At 28 December 2008, the Group had a total 
of £49.0m of banking facilities, of which £22.3m 
was undrawn. The key facility required for the 
expenditure on the new Milton Keynes commissary 
is a £25m ﬁ ve-year facility which attracts an interest 
rate of LIBOR plus 50bps. This facility expires on 
20 December 2012 and includes debt cover and 
ﬁ xed charges cover ﬁ nancial covenants, which are 
monitored and reported on a quarterly basis. The 
Group has been comfortably within these covenants 
at all times. The Group also has a £13m seven-year 
term facility, which is mainly used for the purchase 
of shares into the EBT. This facility also has an 
interest rate of LIBOR plus 50bps and expires on 
31 January 2014.  
Operating and ﬁ nancial review
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer’s review
continued
Capital employed
Non-current assets increased in the ﬁ nancial 
period from £20.2m to £28.4m due to the capital
expenditure of £9.2m on the expansion of the Penrith
commissary and the new Milton Keynes commissary. 
The expansion of the Penrith facility is due to be 
operational in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2009 and the new 
Milton Keynes commissary is due for completion in 
the second quarter of 2010.
Current assets increased from £28.1m to £35.8m. 
This was predominantly due to an increase in trade 
and other receivables of £3.6m and cash and cash 
equivalents of £4.0m.  
Non-current liabilities increased from £10.8m to 
£23.3m, due to the increase of £4.3m in the EBT 
loan and £8.3m draw down of the £25m ﬁ ve-year 
term loan facility for the commissary expansion 
programme. 
Treasury management 
The Group’s main treasury risks relate to the 
availability of funds to meet its future requirements 
and ﬂ uctuations in interest rates. The treasury policy 
of the Group is determined and monitored by 
the Board.
The Group monitors its cash resources through short,
medium and long-term cash forecasting. Surplus 
cash is pooled into an interest bearing account. The 
Group monitors its overall level of ﬁ nancial gearing 
monthly, with our short and medium-term forecasts 
showing underlying levels of gearing well within our 
targets and banking covenants, as discussed earlier 
under cash ﬂ ow, net debt and bank facilities.
In addition, as the Group has a presence in the 
Republic of Ireland, it also buys and sells goods 
and services in currencies other than sterling. As 
a result, the Group is affected by movements in 
exchange rates and the euro in particular. It is the 
Group’s policy to mitigate these effects by agreeing 
ﬁ xed euro rates with its franchisees and suppliers 
wherever possible.  
Conclusion
We are very pleased with another year of strong 
growth ﬁ nancially, particularly given the increasingly 
challenging economic environment. We have 
continued to invest in and grow our business. Long-
term ﬁ nancing at competitive rates, combined with 
the strong cash ﬂ ows generated by the business, 
give us both the conﬁ dence and the opportunity to 
continue to return surplus funds not required by the 
business to shareholders.

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Risk is an inherent part of doing business and the Board is fully committed to identifying, evaluating 
and managing signiﬁ cant risks facing the business, as described in more detail in the Corporate 
Governance section of this Annual Report. A more extensive analysis of risk factors facing the business 
can be found in the ‘Admission to the Ofﬁ cial List’ prospectus prepared for the purpose of Admission 
which is available on our website. The main speciﬁ c risks and uncertainties, which could have a material
impact on Domino’s long-term performance and achievement of its strategy, are as follows:
 Risks speciﬁ c to the business of the Group
The Group is highly 
dependent on key 
contracts and business 
relationships
The Group may not 
be able to achieve 
its planned rate of 
expansion
In relation to securing
new locations, the 
Group cannot predict 
the timing or ultimate 
success of the site 
selection and the 
franchise process
The Master Franchise Agreement (MFA) and the Know-How Agreement (pursuant to which Domino’s Pizza 
Group Ltd (DPG) is granted the right by Domino’s Pizza International Franchising Inc. (DPIF) to establish and
operate the commissaries) are the two contracts that the Group is most dependent on. The term of the MFA
continues indeﬁ nitely until all of the franchise agreements that DPG has with its franchisees have either 
not been renewed or have been terminated. Franchise agreements have an initial term of 10 years and 
can be renewed at the franchisee’s option and the renewed franchise agreement will be subject to further 
renewal in accordance with the terms of the standard franchise agreement at that time. Therefore if all of 
the franchisees do not renew their franchise agreements and DPG cannot ﬁ nd replacement franchisees, 
there would eventually come a time when there are no franchise agreements in effect and therefore the 
term of the MFA (and related Know-How Agreement) would end. The chances of this situation arising are 
remote as to date all franchisees have chosen to renew their agreements for a further term or have sold 
their store to another franchisee who then commences a new 10 year term. 
DPG’s right to grant franchises for new Domino’s stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland is dependent 
on the continuation of the development term of the MFA. The development term is a 10 year renewable 
term that was last renewed with effect from 1 January 2007. The current development term requires DPG 
to increase the number of stores in the territory by 27 stores per year over the next 10 years, from a base 
of 450 stores. If these targets are not met, DPG would not receive a royalty waiver which would mean that 
DPG would have to pay DPIF a higher annual royalty. Currently DPG has signiﬁ cant headroom and if it 
continues opening stores at the rate of 50 per year, the full requirement of the current 10 year development 
term would be met in ﬁ ve and a half years. If DPG has failed to open and maintain the minimum number 
of stores or is in material breach of the MFA, then DPIF is not obliged to renew the development term. This 
would mean that although DPG would continue to serve as the franchisor to all existing stores, it would 
not be able to grant franchises for any new Domino’s stores. The MFA may be terminated by DPIF if DPG 
breaches the agreement, although all potential breaches are within the direct control of DPG. Depending 
on the nature of the breach, DPG may have the right to cure the breach within an allocated time period. 
On termination of the agreement by DPIF, DPIF has the right to require the sale or the assignment to it of 
any stores or franchise agreements at their fair value. The Board considers that their compliance with the 
material terms of the MFA is such that there is very little possibility of termination. 
If the Group is unable to open new stores successfully, the Group’s future growth in revenue and proﬁ ts 
may be adversely affected. The Group currently plans to expand at a rapid rate, opening a targeted 50 
new stores each year (against the requirement of 27 per year). The ability to open the target number of 
stores will depend on a number of factors (for example, general economic conditions and the availability of 
adequate ﬁ nancing for franchisees), some of which are beyond the Group’s control but currently there is a 
plentiful supply of potential sites and strong appetite from both new franchisees and the existing franchisee 
community to open new stores. The Group acknowledges that it is only through the delivery of a highly 
proﬁ table business model that it can convince franchisees to invest, enabling the Group to grow further.
The Group is also dependent on securing successful planning permission in respect of development of new
store sites. However, the Group has an excellent track record of securing suitable sites and getting such 
sites trading by working constructively with planners, landlords, developers and franchisees.

Economic and market 
risks 
Regulatory risks
Consumer taste and 
perception of the brand 
The Group depends, in large part, on the Domino’s brand. The vast majority of stores are owned and 
operated by franchisees who are responsible for delivering the high standards of the Domino’s brand to 
customers. Whilst franchisees are required to operate within the Group’s standards for store operation, 
they are given a degree of autonomy to ensure they operate in a way that suits their local area. The Group 
provides that franchisees must adhere to strict quality, safety and image regulations that the Group enforces 
through the implementation of training and careful monitoring, funded by both the franchisees and the 
Group, and through store visits and frequent appraisals.
One of the key functions of the Group’s business is the manufacture of dough and the distribution of all 
food and packaging items used in the stores by the Group’s own commissaries based in Milton Keynes 
(UK), Penrith (UK), and Naas (Republic of Ireland). The Group works in partnership with its suppliers to 
manage the risk of any delays or interruptions in the supply chain, which may affect franchisees’ trade.
The success of the Group’s sales through channels of e-commerce is highly dependent on the ability of the 
Group to maintain operational and efﬁ cient IT systems in order to facilitate online sales and orders made via
SMS. Furthermore, the Group’s stores utilise IT systems to place delivery orders to the Group’s commissary 
sites and the Group also uses the same IT systems to calculate the royalties payable by each of the stores. 
The Group recognises the essential role that IT plays across its operations in allowing it to trade efﬁ ciently 
so that it can achieve commercial advantage through implementing IT innovations that improve the customer
ordering experience and make life easier for franchisees.
Changes in the general economic climate, such as those caused by the global “credit crunch” can have a 
detrimental effect on consumer expenditure and therefore Group revenues. However, the Group believes 
that a number of prevailing trends beneﬁ t the Group’s business, including a population with increasingly 
greater disposable incomes who are cash-rich and time-poor and an increased trend of busier and more 
hectic lifestyles leaving less time for home-cooking. The Group constantly works with its franchisees to 
ensure that the Domino’s proposition for customers is the most compelling in the home delivery pizza market.
The Group is exposed to ﬂ uctuations in food prices particularly and so works hard to mitigate the impact of 
any cost pressures on itself and its franchisees through ﬁ xed price contracts where appropriate, although there 
are signs that the level of inﬂ ationary pressures on food prices that have been a feature of the last few years 
may be easing in the near term.
The Group’s operations are subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements particularly in relation to 
planning, health and safety, employment, advertising and licensing laws and in terms of regulations over the
Group’s products and services. The Group monitors regulatory developments and has a strong compliance 
regime, both in terms of its own operations and those of its franchisees.  
Food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic
conditions, local and national competition and demographic trends. Any material change in market perception
of the home delivery and convenience food industry, or the Domino’s brand in particular, could adversely 
affect the business of the Group. In addition, increasing government and media initiatives to create greater
awareness of healthy eating could impact on the public’s perception of the convenience food industry. The 
Group recognises the link between a balanced diet, lifestyle and health and therefore provides nutritional 
information on its website to allow customers to make an informed choice and also offers a reduced fat 
mozzarella cheese. The Group works relentlessly to reﬂ ect changes in consumer tastes and improve its 
offering by investing in price, quality and service in order to deliver the optimum home delivery pizza service
to its customers. In terms of marketing power and therefore brand awareness, each store contributes between
four and ﬁ ve per cent of net sales to a national advertising fund which gives signiﬁ cant marketing spending 
power (£18m in 2008) in a currently deﬂ ationary media market.   Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 23

Distribution ﬂ eet
One of the areas where we have already made 
signiﬁ cant progress is within our truck ﬂ eet, which is
already compliant with the Euro V emissions standard,
three years ahead of its implementation. We also 
have a number of other initiatives to reduce our 
environmental impact in this area. These include the 
use of route planning software to minimise mileage,
an on-board system that encourages drivers to drive 
in a manner that minimises fuel consumption, and 
the use of Saltron to improve diesel quality and 
reduce emissions.
Waste and recycling
We aim to keep all our food waste to a minimum 
and constantly review our packaging to see where 
potential improvements can be made. Our boxes 
are already made from 80% recycled cardboard 
and are 100% recyclable.
Our environmental policy
The Group recognises that its day-to-day operations impact the 
environment. It is committed to delivering great tasting, freshly made 
hot pizzas and will aim for continuous improvement in all aspects of its 
environmental performance, while continuing to deliver a great service 
to its customers.
The Group is committed to monitoring its carbon emissions. We have 
already implemented a number of projects which have reduced our 
carbon emissions and have further projects both in progress and planned.
We will continue to look at projects to reduce our carbon footprint.  
The Group has an internal environment group whose purpose is to 
investigate ways of reducing carbon emissions and implementing these 
wherever possible.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an important part of 
the Group’s day-to-day operations and encompasses a broad 
spectrum of activities with regards to the environment, our 
food, responsible growth, our employment practices, and the 
many ways in which we support the communities we operate in.
Carbon footprint
We are working with a local company called TEAM,
using part-funding from the Carbon Trust, which has
calculated our carbon emissions and identiﬁ ed areas
where we can reduce it. Some of these actions have 
already been implemented, for example we have 
increased the temperature in our data centre, hence 
reducing the amount of air cooling needed. 
In addition, we have set up an internal team to 
look at the recommendations and put the plans 
into action. The team will include an environmental 
champion from each area of head ofﬁ ce and we 
will be regularly measuring our carbon outputs to 
ensure any implemented programmes are having a 
positive effect.
Where we build new stores, they include energy saving
devices such as light detectors. In addition, the 
new commissary we are building in Milton Keynes 
is being built to the BREEAM (Buildings Research 
Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) 
Excellent rating – the highest attainable standard.
Our food
The nutritional and allergen information on our top 
selling lines is available on our website and we will 
be adding all remaining products during 2009. 
We are in the process of providing nutritional 
information for an independent website – 
www.whatsmybrand.co.uk – and are in conversation
with the Food Standards Agency regarding the 
Government’s food agenda.
We already offer a low fat mozzarella cheese on 
our menus and are looking at areas where we could 
reduce the salt in our products.

Employment practices
We are an equal opportunities employer and are 
committed to investing in team member advancement
through a broad range of learning and development
initiatives for corporate employees, franchisees and 
in-store teams. 
We regularly communicate with our staff, franchisees
and store teams through our intranet and portal 
systems and our quarterly magazine, Slice. We 
encourage two-way communication and have an 
open door policy. In addition, there is a direct line 
to the corporate HR team for store employees who 
may have issues with their franchisees that they 
cannot resolve directly.
We have also made it compulsory for franchisees to 
have a people management system, approved by 
us, to ensure that all the necessary and up to date
policies, procedures and documentation are in place
and that franchisees are operating best practice in 
human resource management and are protected in 
terms of employment law and health and safety. We 
have outsourced the HR processes and health and 
safety requirements to a leading human resources 
and health and safety consultancy, which manages 
the service and monitors compliance levels.
Responsible growth
As a business, we underpin our expansion plans with
a culture of responsible growth. Where we are opening
new stores, we will always work with planners and 
local residents to ensure that we minimise the impact
on the social environment in terms of noise, odours 
and trafﬁ c. We use a high speciﬁ cation of ventilation
and very few of our stores are open later than 11pm.
We actively encourage our customers not to generate
litter and in a recent survey of 10 areas, conducted 
by Keep Britain Tidy, none of the branded litter
found in the streets came from Domino’s.
Being a good neighbour is crucial to the success 
of our business and we believe in playing a part 
in the life of the communities where our stores are 
located. This has included franchisees participating
in youth schemes run by local police or social 
services, supporting residents group and providing 
educational tours for local schoolchildren.
Special Olympics and 
charitable giving
The Group has a number of systems in place to 
donate to charity both ﬁ nancially and through 
human resource. Our chosen charity in the UK is 
Special Olympics GB and we have donated an 
annual sum of £25,000 each year since 2006. 
In addition, our stores raise money to help athletes
in their local areas. The Special Olympics GB is 
Operating and ﬁ nancial review
Corporate social responsibility
continued
a voluntary organisation that specialises in year-
round, local-level sports training for people with 
learning disabilities as well as local, national and 
international competition.
In the Republic of Ireland, our franchisees contributed
€10,000 to the Barretstown Charity for Children 
with serious illnesses.
In addition, a number of stores raise funds for other 
local charities and employees of our head ofﬁ ce and
commissaries are encouraged to donate a day to help
a worthy cause. This has worked well and examples 
include our entire Estates Team working with Milton 
Keynes Parks Trust to carry out scrub clearance on 
an island in Furzton Lake, Milton Keynes.
Going forward
As a company, we still feel that we can improve 
in the CSR arena and, to this end, in January 2009 
we joined Business in the Community (BITC) to help 
focus our CSR strategy and ensure that it truly is an 
intrinsic part of our business operation.
BITC will be undertaking a programme with us to look
at the way in which we run our business in terms of 
community, environment, marketplace and workplace,
and we will be setting measureable objectives based
on CSR related targets. We look forward to reporting
on our progress in 12 months time.  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 25

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Directors’ report
The Directors are pleased to present their report and the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 
for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2008.
Principal activity, business review and future developments
The Group operates the leading UK home delivery pizza brand. The Group holds the master franchise for the UK and the Republic 
of Ireland of Domino’s Pizza, one of the world’s leading home delivery pizza brands.
The Directors present their report for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2008, which should be read in conjunction with the 
Chairman’s Statement on pages 4 and 5 and the Operating and Financial Review (the OFR) on pages 6 to 24, including the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Review, the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer’s Review and the Corporate Governance Report. Details of the 
Group’s policy on addressing ﬁ nancial risks are given in the OFR and details about ﬁ nancial instruments are shown in note 
28 to the ﬁ nancial statements. Together these sections include information about the Group’s business, its ﬁ nancial performance 
during the year, likely developments and any principal risks and uncertainties associated with the Group’s business. 
Results and dividends
The Group proﬁ t for the period after taxation was £15,664,000 (2007: £13,239,000). This is after a taxation charge of 
£6,485,000 (2007: £5,337,000) representing an effective tax rate of 29.3% (2007: 28.7%).
The Directors recommend the payment of a ﬁ nal dividend of 3.2p per ordinary share, to be paid on 1 May 2009 to members 
on the Register at the close of business on 3 April 2009. Together with the interim dividend of 2.7p per ordinary share paid on 
29 August 2008, the total dividend for the year will be 5.9p compared with 4.4p for the previous year, an increase of 34.1%. 
Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year in which they are paid, or in the case of the ﬁ nal dividend when approved 
by shareholders, such that the amount recognised in the 2008 accounts, as described in note 13, is made up of last year’s ﬁ nal 
dividend and this year’s interim dividend.
Share capital and control
The information in this section is given pursuant to section 992 of the Companies Act 2006 and is correct as at 28 December 2008.
The Company’s authorised share capital was £4,000,000 divided into 256,000,000 ordinary shares of 1.5625 pence each and 
there were 161,440,111 ordinary shares in issue. The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and can be 
held in certiﬁ cated or uncertiﬁ cated form.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are 
set out in the Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles), a copy of which can be viewed on our website or obtained by writing 
to the Company Secretary or requesting a copy from Companies House. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and 
speak at general meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights.
Changes to the Company’s Articles must be approved by special resolution of the Company. New Articles were adopted at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 2008 to incorporate changes introduced by the Companies Act 2006. The Board is responsible 
for the management of the business of the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the provisions of 
the relevant statutes and the Company’s Memorandum and Articles. On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, 
every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote and, on a poll, every member 
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. The Notice of AGM speciﬁ es 
deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be passed at the 
AGM. All proxy votes are counted and the number for, against or withheld in relation to each resolution are announced at the 
AGM and published on the Company’s website after the meeting. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than certain restrictions that may be imposed from
time to time by laws and regulations and pursuant to the UKLA Listing Rules whereby certain Directors, ofﬁ cers and employees of 
the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in ordinary shares of the Company. 
At the AGM held on 24 April 2008, a special resolution was passed to authorise the Company to make purchases on the London 
Stock Exchange (LSE) of up to 10% of its ordinary shares. As at 17 February 2009, 1,750,000 ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of 1.5625 pence each had been bought back and cancelled under this authority at a total cost of £3,752,000, representing 
1.1% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 24 April 2008, the date of the 2008 AGM. The Company engages in share 
buybacks to create value for shareholders, when cash ﬂ ows permit and there is no immediate alternative investment use for the 
funds. Shareholders will be requested to renew this authority at the forthcoming AGM on 23 April 2009. It is the Company’s 
present intention to cancel any ordinary shares it buys back, rather than hold them in treasury.  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 29

capital of the Company.  
Signiﬁ cant agreements – change of control
The Company’s banking arrangements are terminable upon a change of control of the Company. The Company’s agreements 
with Domino’s Pizza International Franchising Inc. do not terminate on a change of control and the Company does not have

takeover except that provisions of the Company’s share schemes and plans may cause options and awards granted to employees 
under such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover.

Employees
The Group employed an average of 330 people in 2008 (2007: 316) at its head ofﬁ ce and three commissaries. Through its 
interest in ﬁ ve stores, the Group indirectly employed on average an additional 158 people in 2008 (2007: 317).
Employment policies
The Group depends on the skills and commitment of its employees in order to achieve its objectives. Staff at every level are 
encouraged to make their fullest possible contribution to the success of the Group. Ongoing training programmes seek to ensure 
that employees understand the Group’s franchisee and customer service objectives and strive to achieve them. The Group’s 
selection, training, development and promotion policies ensure equal opportunities for all employees regardless of factors such as 
gender, marital status, race, age, sexual preference and orientation, colour, creed, ethnic origin, religion or belief, or disability. 
All decisions are based on merit.
Internal communications are designed to ensure that employees are well informed about the business of the Group. These include 
a staff magazine called ‘Slice’ and regular staff brieﬁ ng sessions. Staff opinions are researched through surveys. Employees 
are encouraged to become involved with the ﬁ nancial performance of the Group through a variety of schemes, principally the 
Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP), the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (EMI), the LTIP and the SAYE scheme.
Environmental and social responsibility
The Company acknowledges that it is part of a wider community and recognises that it has a responsibility to act in ways that 
reﬂ ect the environment and the social well-being of others. Details of the Group’s approach to these issues are set out in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report.
 
Political and charitable donations
Cash donations to charities amounted to £25,000 (2007: £31,000). This comprised a sponsorship agreement with the Special 
Olympics GB. There were no political donations (2007: £nil).  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 31
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Supplier payment
Payment terms and conditions are agreed with suppliers in advance. The Group pays its creditors on a pay on time basis which 
varies according to the type of product and service provided by the supplier but is typically between 7 and 28 days. The average 
number of days of payments outstanding for the Group at the ﬁ nancial period end was 24 (2007: 21). The Company has no 
trade creditors as these are assumed and settled by another Group company.
Going concern
The ﬁ nancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂ ows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer’s Review on pages 18 to 20. In addition, note 27 to the ﬁ nancial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its ﬁ nancial risk management objectives; details of its ﬁ nancial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable ﬁ nancial resources together with long-term contracts with its master franchisor, its franchisees and its 
key suppliers. As a consequence, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite 
the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁ nancial statements. 
Events after the balance sheet date
There have been no signiﬁ cant events since the balance sheet date which would have a material effect on the ﬁ nancial statements.
Directors’ responsibility statement pursuant to DTR4
The Directors conﬁ rm that, to the best of their knowledge:
a)  the Group ﬁ nancial statements in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
  Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
  interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies under IFRS, give a true and fair 
  view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t of the Group taken as a whole; and
b)  the management report contained in this report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business 
  and the position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
  uncertainties that they face.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors of the Company and the Group will be proposed at the 2009 AGM.
AGM 
The Notice convening the 2009 AGM to be held at 1 p.m. on Thursday 23 April 2009 is contained in a circular sent to shareholders 
with this report. Full details of all resolutions to be proposed are provided in the shareholder circular.
Directors’ statement of disclosure of information to auditors
Having made the requisite enquiries, the Directors in ofﬁ ce at the date of this Annual Report and Accounts have each conﬁ rmed 
that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware, and each of the 
Directors has taken all the steps he/she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.

Corporate governance report
Directors’ report on corporate governance
The Board recognises that good governance helps the business to deliver the strategy, generate shareholder value and safeguard 
shareholders’ long-term interests, and it is committed to high standards of corporate governance.
Despite being a company listed on AIM until recently, the Board recognised the importance of adhering, so far as practicable, with 
the Combined Code Principles of Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and has continued in its efforts to develop further 
its approach to corporate governance and the effective management of risk in the context of a rapidly expanding business. In 
the run up to and following the accession of the Company to the Ofﬁ cial List and to trading on the LSE’s main market on 19 May 
2008, the Board has focused its efforts on compliance with the Combined Code. The Company does currently qualify as a smaller 
company for Combined Code purposes and as such, following Admission, the Company has been compliant in all respects with 
the Combined Code for the year ended 28 December 2008, except as follows: 
� A.2.2/A.3.1 – Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer becoming Chairman, independence of Chairman
� D.1.1 – Senior Independent Director not attending meetings with major shareholders to listen to their views
These are explained in more detail in the sections below.
However, now that the Company is a current member of the FTSE 250 index, the Board sees 2009 as a transition year for the 
Company, in terms of compliance with the Combined Code, from being a smaller company to a larger company and therefore 
the adherence to the very highest standards of corporate governance. This includes compliance with the Turnbull Guidance as 
explained in more detail below. 
Board composition and independence
As at 28 December 2008, the Board of the Company comprised three Executive Directors, including the part-time Executive 
Chairman, and six Non-Executive Directors, four of whom are independent of management and free from any business or other 
relationship, including those relationships and circumstances referred to in provision A.3.1 of the Combined Code that could 
materially interfere with the exercise of objective and independent judgement. Therefore, following Admission, the Company, 
as a smaller company, is compliant in terms of independence with the Combined Code provision A.3.2. The independent Non- 
Executive Directors play a key governance role in protecting shareholders’ interests and complement the skills and experience of 
the Executive Directors through their range of knowledge, experience and insight from other businesses. All of the Directors bring 
strong judgement to the Board’s deliberations. The biographical details of the Directors are set out on page 25.
Upon Admission, the Company was not fully compliant with the Combined Code, notably as it had, and continues to have, an 
Executive Chairman (Stephen Hemsley) who did not meet the Combined Code’s independence criteria and furthermore who 
was Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer of the Company before his appointment as Executive Chairman on 1 January 2008. However, 
the Directors believe Stephen Hemsley’s appointment as Executive Chairman was, and continues to be, in the best interests of 
shareholders and, given his profound knowledge and experience of the business, is vitally important to the continued success 
of the Group. Cognisant of its prime objective to ensure the Company’s ongoing commercial success, the Board put in place 
the current arrangement to effect the smooth transition of the then Deputy Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Chris Moore, to the role 
of Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and of the Company from its listing on AIM to the Ofﬁ cial List during the year. The Board does not 
envisage that the Chairman of the Board will be an Executive role in the long-term. There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive. Pursuant to this, the Executive Chairman has primary responsibility 
for setting a vision for the Company and formulating its strategy, leading and running the Board and ensuring there is effective 
communication with shareholders. The Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Chris Moore, has executive responsibilities for the operations and 
results of the Group, developing the executive and senior management team and making proposals to the Board for the strategic 
development of the Group. Clear divisions of accountability and responsibility exist and operate effectively for these positions.
Under the Company’s Articles, all Directors have to submit themselves for re-election at least every three years if they wish to 
continue serving and are considered by the Board to be eligible. New Directors are submitted for election by shareholders in 
their ﬁ rst year following appointment and therefore Peter Klauber, who joined the Board as an independent Non-Executive 
Director on 30 September 2008, will be subject to election by shareholders at the AGM in April 2009. Both Colin Halpern and 
Nigel Wray have served on the Board of the Company for nine years, albeit Colin Halpern was an Executive Director until the 
end of 2007 before becoming a Non-Executive Director. Due to their respective material shareholdings in the Company, neither 
Colin Halpern nor Nigel Wray is considered an independent Non-Executive Director for Combined Code purposes. However 
the Chairman and the rest of the Board have conﬁ rmed that both Colin Halpern and Nigel Wray bring extensive knowledge and 
business experience to the Board that is invaluable to the continued success of the Group. Therefore, both Colin Halpern and 
Nigel Wray will retire and offer themselves for re-election at this year’s AGM and annually thereafter. Lee Ginsberg and Dianne 
Thompson will also retire by rotation and offer themselves up for reappointment at the AGM in 2009. More information about the 
Directors standing for reappointment is set out in the AGM Notice.
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are set out on page 40. The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment
which are available for inspection at the registered ofﬁ ce of the Company during normal business hours and at the place of the 
AGM for at least 15 minutes before and until the end of the meeting.   Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 33
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Following Admission, the Board consisted of three Executive Directors and ﬁ ve Non-Executive Directors, three of whom were 
deemed independent for the purposes of the Combined Code. In order to transition towards the Combined Code requirement 
for larger companies that requires that at least half of the Board consists of independent Non-Executive Directors and as an 
additional arrangement to mitigate any governance concerns over having an Executive Chairman, in September 2008 the 
Board, in conjunction with the Nomination Committee, decided to invite Peter Klauber to join the Board as additional, fourth 
independent Non-Executive Director. When the Nomination Committee drew up the speciﬁ cation for an additional independent 
Non-Executive Director, it was immediately apparent that Peter Klauber possessed the skills and attributes being sought and, 
following a series of meetings with each of the members of the Nomination Committee, Peter Klauber was invited to join the 
Board. It was felt unnecessary to use the services of an external consultant.
Following Admission, Michael Shallow, an independent Non-Executive Director, was appointed as the Senior Independent 
Director.  Michael Shallow’s responsibilities include being available to shareholders if they have concerns which are not 
resolved through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer or Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer or for which such contact 
is inappropriate. Whilst the Senior Independent Director is available to meet major shareholders in accordance with provision 
D.1.1 of the Combined Code, post Admission no such meetings have taken place. However, the Executive Directors have, during 
2008, had many meetings with major shareholders and during 2009 the Senior Independent Director will be available to attend 
such meetings. The Senior Independent Director is a member of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the 
Nomination Committee.
The Board requires all Non-Executive Directors to be independent in their judgement. The structure of the Board and the integrity 
of the individual Directors ensure that no single individual or group dominates the decision making process.
Board responsibilities 
The Board normally meets 10 times a year, as well as annually devoting one day to a Board strategy conference. The Board 
has a formal schedule of matters reserved for Board decision in order to ensure its overall control of the Group’s affairs. These 
include the determination of strategy, the approval of ﬁ nancial statements, indebtedness levels, major acquisitions, disposals and 
investments, authority levels for expenditure, treasury policies, risk management, the internal control framework and succession 
planning for senior executives (following appropriate recommendations from the Nomination Committee).  
Matters requiring Board and Committee approval are generally the subject of a proposal by one or more of the Executive 
Directors submitted to the Board, together with supporting documentation, as part of the Board or Committee papers circulated 
prior to the relevant meeting. At each Board meeting, the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer briefs the Directors on results, key issues and 
strategy. During Board meetings, the Non-Executives regularly make further enquiries of the Executive Directors and seek further 
information which is provided either at the relevant meeting or subsequently.
All Directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in conducting their duties. The role of the Company Secretary is to ensure that all procedures are followed 
and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. The Company Secretary reports to the Chairman in respect of his 
core duties to the Board. The removal of the Company Secretary is a matter speciﬁ cally reserved for decision by the Board. 
Any questions shareholders may have on corporate governance matters, policies or procedures should be addressed to the 
Company Secretary. 
All new Directors receive a personalised induction programme, tailored to their experience, background and particular areas of 
focus, which is designed to develop their knowledge and understanding of the Company’s culture and operations. The programme 
will usually include an overview of the business model and the Board processes, meetings with the Executive team and senior 
managers, site visits and brieﬁ ngs on key issues. The Board also recognises the importance of ongoing training and education, 
particularly regarding new laws and regulations which are relevant to the Group. Such training or education is obtained through 
the Company or through external advisors, as necessary.
The Company provides insurance cover and indemnities for its Directors and ofﬁ cers, although no cover exists in the event the 
Directors or ofﬁ cers are found to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Board processes
The Board governs through a number of Board Committees – the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees – to which
certain responsibilities and duties are delegated. These Committees are properly authorised under the constitution of the Company
to take decisions and act on behalf of the Board within the parameters laid down by the Board. The Board is kept fully informed of 
the work of these Committees and any issues requiring resolution will be referred to the full Board as appropriate. A summary of 
the operations of these Committees is set out below.
The effectiveness of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees is underpinned by their Non-Executive Director 
membership, which provides independent insight on governance matters. Copies of each Committee’s Terms of Reference are 
available on our website. All of the Terms of Reference are compatible with the provisions of the Combined Code.  34 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

Corporate governance report continued
The Board scheduled 10 meetings in the year ended 28 December 2008, together with a strategy and business planning day.  
Ad hoc meetings were also convened to deal with matters between scheduled meetings as appropriate. The table below shows 
the attendance of Directors at regular Board meetings and at meetings of the Nomination, Remuneration and Audit Committees 
during the year.

1 Colin Halpern ceased to be a member of both the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee on 19 May 2008.
2 Peter Klauber was only appointed to the Board on 30 September 2008 and to the Remuneration Committee on 19 November 2008.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Board comprises an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience and as part of this leads the process for Board appointments and the re-election and succession of Directors, as 
well as making recommendations for the membership of statutory committees. The Committee is chaired by Dianne Thompson 
and its members are Colin Halpern and Michael Shallow. The Company Secretary also attends in his capacity as Secretary of the 
Committee. The Nomination Committee is also responsible for reviewing the output of the Board effectiveness review. It met twice 
during the year to consider increasing the number of independent Non-Executive Directors on the Board following Admission 
and to recommend the appointment of Peter Klauber to the Board. The results of the Board effectiveness review were only made 
available in late December 2008, therefore the Committee will meet to discuss the results in early 2009. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee’s role is to determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration of the Executive Directors. 
It also monitors the levels and structure of remuneration for senior management. John Hodson chairs the Committee, which, 
following Admission, is composed entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors (pre Admission, Colin Halpern was a member 
of the Committee). The other Committee members following Admission are Dianne Thompson, Michael Shallow and (with effect 
from 19 November 2008) Peter Klauber. At the invitation of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board normally attends meetings 
and the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer attends as appropriate. The Company Secretary also attends in his capacity as Secretary of 
the Committee.
The Committee met three times this year. The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee and an explanation of how it applies 
the Directors’ remuneration principles of the Combined Code, are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 46.
Audit Committee
Following Admission, the membership of the Committee is composed entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors (pre 
Admission, Colin Halpern was also a member of the Committee but due to the fact that he is not considered independent 
for Combined Code purposes, he stepped down from the Committee prior to Admission). Michael Shallow, who has recent 
and relevant ﬁ nancial experience is the Chairman of the Committee and has been the Chairman throughout 2008. The other 
Committee member is John Hodson. Partly due to the fact that the Company only became a member of the FTSE 250 midway 
through 2008 and as such is a smaller company for Combined Code purposes, the Company does currently comply with the 
Combined Code provision C.3.1 which requires the Committee to consist of two or more independent Non-Executive Directors. 
As part of the Company’s transition to a larger company for Combined Code purposes, the Nomination Committee will discuss 
which of Dianne Thompson or Peter Klauber (as additional independent Non-Executive Directors) is best placed to be appointed 
to the Committee during 2009.  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 35
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, the Financial Controller and representatives of the 
external auditors regularly attend meetings. The Company Secretary also attends in his capacity as Secretary of the Committee. 
The Committee met twice this year. When appropriate, the Committee has regular private meetings with the external auditors 
during the year and the Audit Committee Chairman holds preparatory meetings with senior management prior to Committee 
meetings.
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to review the ﬁ nancial statements, to review the Group’s internal control 
and risk assurance processes, to consider the appointment of the external auditors, their reports to the Committee and their 
independence, which includes an assessment of their appropriateness to conduct any non-audit work.
The Committee met twice during the year to review the draft annual and interim reports before recommending their publication 
to the Board. The Committee also discussed with the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, the Financial Controller 
and the external auditors the signiﬁ cant accounting policies, estimates and judgements in preparing these reports. The Committee 
also sought the views of the external auditors on the internal control environment. Prior to Admission, the Committee was briefed 
on any matters relating to staff raising concerns about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁ nancial reporting or behaviour in the 
business. Following Admission, a dedicated “whistleblowing” facility has been set up for all employees. The Committee will review 
all whistleblowing returns generated and sanction any necessary follow-up action recommended by senior management.  
The Company does not have a formal internal audit function. The Committee and Board have considered, and will continue to 
consider on an annual basis, the need for an internal audit function. When considering the requirement for an internal audit 
function, the factors taken into account were the scale and complexity of the Company’s activities and the fact that a number of 
other functions within the Company provide advice and assurance on specialist areas such as health and safety, regulatory and 
legal compliance. 
The Committee keeps under review the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
The engagement and independence of external auditors is considered annually by the Committee before it recommends its 
selection to the Board. The Committee has satisﬁ ed itself that Ernst & Young LLP is independent and there are adequate controls 
in place to safeguard its objectivity. Ernst & Young LLP is also subject to professional standards which safeguard the integrity of the 
auditing role. There is no formal policy in place at the date of this report but the Committee applies criteria for employing external 
auditors and identiﬁ es areas where it is inappropriate for Ernst & Young LLP to work. A formal policy in line with the Auditing 
Practice Board’s Ethical Standards will be adopted during 2009. This will prohibit the external auditors from providing certain 
additional services to the Group such as bookkeeping, internal audit, valuations and ﬁ nancial systems design and implementation. 
No such services have been provided in 2008. The external auditors are, however, permitted to provide assurance services such 
as reporting accountants work and tax services.   
Details of this year’s audit and non-audit fees are given in note 6 to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Board effectiveness evaluation  
During the year ended 28 December 2008 (post Admission), a formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the 
Board, its committees and each Director’s own contribution was conducted with the assistance of an external independent 
consultant. The process included detailed questionnaires for each Director.
1)  The evaluation considered the processes of the Board and its Committees, their effectiveness and the range and balance of 
  skills demonstrated by the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
2) Output from the Board effectiveness review is considered by the Nomination Committee to ensure that the appropriate 
  balance of skills, knowledge and experience is represented on the Board and that the Board and its Committees continue to 
  work effectively. 
Overall, the review concluded that the Board and its Committees function effectively and that governance and Board processes 
are robust. It was also noted that there is a high level of professionalism in the strategic and entrepreneurial leadership of the 
Company. The review conﬁ rmed that each Director’s performance continues to be effective and that each Director continues to 
demonstrate commitment to the role.
The Senior Independent Director also met with the Non-Executive Directors and used a tailored questionnaire to assess the 
Executive Chairman’s performance and effectiveness. This review also took into account the views of the Executive Directors. 36 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

Corporate governance report continued
Management of the Group – Executive Committee
The Board delegates responsibility for implementing the Group’s strategic plan and for management of the Group to the 
Executive Committee, which comprises the three Executive Directors and seven members of senior management with valuable 
operational experience, all of whom are Directors of the Group’s main operating company, DPG. The Committee is chaired 
by the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer. The Company Secretary also attends in his capacity as a Director of DPG. The attendance of 
senior management/departmental heads facilitates the communication of the Committee’s decisions to the rest of the Group. 
The Committee has authority for decision-making in all areas except those reserved for Board decision and meets formally 
every week. The Committee is responsible for implementing Company strategy and policy, for monitoring the performance and 
compliance of the business and for reporting on these matters to the Board. 
Risk management and internal controls
Accountabilities
Accepting that risk is an inherent part of doing business, the Group’s risk management systems are designed both to encourage 
entrepreneurial spirit and also to provide assurance that risk is fully understood and managed. The Board has overall responsibility
for risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group’s objectives and the Board is fully committed to 
identifying, evaluating and managing signiﬁ cant risks facing the business. Executive management is responsible for implementing 
and maintaining the necessary control systems.  
Background
The Group has a 10 year rolling business plan to support the delivery of its strategy of long-term growth and returns for 
shareholders. Every business function derives its objectives from the annual plan as well as by reference to the longer term plan 
and these are cascaded to managers and staff by way of personal objectives. Key to delivering effective risk management is 
ensuring the Group’s employees have a good understanding of the Group’s strategy and its policies, procedures, values and 
expected performance. An internal communications programme provides employees with a clear description of the Group’s 
purpose and goals, accountabilities and the scope of permitted activities. This gives all of the Group’s employees a good 
understanding of what is expected of them and ensures that people are empowered to take decisions at the appropriate level.
The Board recognises that, from time to time, employees of the Group may face ethical dilemmas in the normal course of business 
and therefore the Group provides clear guidance based on its values, which have been revisited and revised since Admission to 
better reﬂ ect the Group’s business today and how it operates. The values (and associated code of conduct) set out the standards 
that the Group wishes to uphold in how people are treated and also provide relevant guidance in dealing with other employees, 
suppliers, franchisees and ultimate customers. 
The Group is in the early stages of implementing a balanced scorecard approach in relation to bonuses, good governance and 
managing risk more generally. This will unite the Group’s resources around its customers, franchisees, people, operations, 
community and ﬁ nance. The scorecard will operate at every level/business unit within the Group. It will enable the business to 
be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard for all stakeholders.
Risk management
The Group’s brand and reputation is fundamental to its continued growth and success and therefore active management of 
operational and other risks is seen as being critical in ensuring that these are maintained as valuable assets. Therefore, the Board 
is fully committed to identifying, evaluating and managing signiﬁ cant risks facing the business and following Admission is currently 
in the process of upgrading its processes and protocols to enable it to do so more formally. A key part of this is the formal creation 
of a key risk register which contains the key risks faced by the business including their impact and likelihood as well as the controls 
and procedures in place to mitigate these risks. Risks are prioritised according to their expected likelihood of occurring and impact 
if they were to occur, both on the business and on employees and stakeholders in the business. The content of the register will be 
signed off by the Board in April 2009 and in future will be determined through regular discussions with senior management and 
the Board. Prior to Admission, the Board conducted a more informal process based around discussions of material risks and the 
assessment of mitigation strategies with senior management. The key risks and uncertainties we face are summarised in the OFR 
on pages 21 and 22.
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Company’s system of internal controls and for reviewing the effectiveness of 
the system. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Nevertheless, the Board places great 
emphasis on improving the Group’s position, either through its risk mitigation strategy or in monitoring controls to limit the impact 
in the event that risks actually materialise. Accountability for implementing Board strategies and the system of internal control at 
an operational level sits with management. There is a Group-wide process for clearly establishing the risks and responsibilities 
assigned to each level of management and the controls which are required to be operated and monitored.  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 37
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The Group’s risk management processes and system of control procedures include the following:
A) Control Environment – the presence of a clear organisational structure and well deﬁ ned lines of responsibility and delegation 
  of appropriate levels of authority.
B) Risk Management – business strategy and plans are reviewed by the Board (see the reference above to the creation of a key 
  risk register).
C) Financial Reporting – a comprehensive system of budgets and forecasts with monthly reporting of actual results against targets.
D) Control and Monitoring Procedures – ensuring authorisation levels and procedures and other systems of internal ﬁ nancial 
  controls are documented, applied and regularly reviewed. 
In conjunction with its advisors as part of the Admission process, during the year the Group conducted a review of the effectiveness
of internal controls and the Board is satisﬁ ed that the controls in place remain appropriate and meet the requirements of the 
Combined Code. Such review examined all material controls, including ﬁ nancial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management systems.
The Audit Committee has also met and sought feedback from the external auditors as part of its review of the interim and annual 
ﬁ nancial statements, as discussed in the Audit Committee section above.
This process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group was in place on an informal basis 
prior to Admission. Post Admission the review of the effectiveness of internal controls and development of the risk register noted 
above have been completed such that for the 2009 ﬁ nancial year end the Group’s internal controls will accord with Turnbull 
Guidance. For the current year this process has not been in place for the entire period under review up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and Accounts as required under Turnbull Guidance.
Monitoring  
The Board oversees the monitoring system and has set speciﬁ c responsibilities for itself and the various Committees as set out 
above. The minutes of the Audit Committee are distributed to the Board and each Committee submits reports from time to time for 
formal discussion. These all provide assurance that the Group is operating legally and in accordance with approved ﬁ nancial and 
operational policies. In addition, our external auditors play a key role in the monitoring process. 
Relations with stakeholders
The Board is committed to having a constructive dialogue with all stakeholders to ensure that the Group understands what is 
important to them and to allow the Group the opportunity to present its position. Engagement helps the Group identify new 
risks and opportunities to ensure that its long-term strategy is sustainable. The Board ﬁ nds that working with stakeholders in 
partnership can help deliver shared goals, especially in the case of the Group’s franchisees. The Group might not be able to 
satisfy all stakeholder concerns all the time but engagement assists the Group in balancing competing demands. 
The Group is committed to maintaining a good dialogue with shareholders through proactively organising meetings and 
presentations, as well as responding to a wide range of enquiries. The Board recognises the importance of communicating 
appropriately any signiﬁ cant Group developments. During the year, the Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer met with most of the leading shareholders. The Senior Independent Director is also available for shareholders as 
required. Institutional investors and analysts are also invited to brieﬁ ngs by the Company after the announcement of its interim 
and preliminary results. An investor relations summary is produced for each Board meeting by the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and 
feedback is given on recent meetings with shareholders, via the advisors who organised the meetings.
It is normal that institutional shareholders may be in more regular contact with the Group than others, but care is exercised 
to ensure that any price-sensitive information is released to both institutional and private shareholders at the same time, in 
accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
The AGM offers the opportunity to communicate directly with all shareholders. The whole Board attends the meeting and is 
available to answer questions from shareholders present. Notice of the AGM and related papers are sent to shareholders at 
least 20 working days before the meeting. All proxy votes received in respect of each resolution at the AGM are counted and the 
balance for and against, and any votes withheld are indicated. The results are announced at the meeting and published on the 
Company’s website after the meeting.

Report on Directors’ remuneration 
Introduction
This report sets out the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration for the forthcoming year, and, so far as practicable, for 
subsequent years, as well as information on remuneration paid to Directors in the ﬁ nancial year to 28 December 2008.   
The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and in line with 
the recommendations of the Combined Code and the UKLA Listing Rules.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) has delegated authority from the Board to determine the annual salaries, 
incentive arrangements (short and long-term), service agreements and other employment conditions for the Executive Directors. 
The Committee also oversees remuneration arrangements for our senior executives to ensure they are also aligned with 
shareholder interests. The terms of reference of the Committee are available for inspection on our website.
Remuneration arrangements following Admission to the Ofﬁ cial List
Prior to Admission, a new long-term incentive plan (New LTIP) was introduced under which it is intended the Executive Directors 
will receive future long-term incentive awards. This plan was introduced following a review of our existing arrangements against 
best practice investor guidelines. Full details of the New LTIP, along with details of the former arrangements under which awards 
were granted prior to Admission, are set out below along with other changes to our remuneration structure that have been made 
in relation to our move to the Ofﬁ cial List.  
Remuneration Committee members and advisors
Following Admission, the Committee consists solely of the Company’s independent Non-Executive Directors, John Hodson 
(Chairman), Michael Shallow, Dianne Thompson and Peter Klauber (from 19 November 2008).  Prior to Admission, the Committee
consisted of John Hodson (Chairman), Dianne Thompson, Michael Shallow and Colin Halpern. No other person was a member 
of the Committee at a time when any matter relating to the Executive Directors remuneration for 2008 was considered.
The Committee met three times during the year under review to consider and approve, amongst other things:
� the conclusions of a review of Executive Directors and senior management remuneration;
� proposed salary increases and changes to other compensation elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration;
� liasing with trustees of the EBT regarding LTIP awards to the Executive Directors and senior management;
� setting performance measures and targets for new annual bonuses and share based remuneration and evaluating whether 
 performance conditions have been met for existing remuneration arrangements; and
� the launch of a new SAYE offering upon maturity of the existing scheme.
No Committee member has any personal ﬁ nancial interest, conﬂ ict of interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day 
involvement in running the business. Other Directors and employees who attend some or all of the meetings and who provided 
material advice or services to the Committee at the invitation of the Chairman during the year were:
Stephen Hemsley   Executive Chairman
Chris Moore  Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
Lee Ginsberg   Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer 
Nigel Wray  Non-Executive Director 
Colin Halpern  Non-Executive Vice Chairman 
Adam Batty  Company Secretary (from 18 February 2008) and Secretary to the Committee
No Executive Director attended the part of the meeting dealing with matters relating to his own remuneration.  
The Committee also received advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS), an external consultancy with wide experience of 
executive remuneration on UK listed companies, whom it appointed whilst the Company was listed on AIM. This advice related to 
developing its remuneration policy, particularly in relation to long-term incentive plans, setting the performance conditions and in 
benchmarking the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior management. HNBS has no other connection with the Group. 
Mayer Brown International LLP and Norton Rose LLP have advised the Committee on legal and regulatory issues during 2008. 
BDO Stoy Hayward LLP also provided a broad range of tax, share scheme and advisory services to the Group during 2008.  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 39
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Remuneration policy principles
Our remuneration policy for senior management, including Executive Directors, is based on the following core principles:
� total remuneration should be set at a level sufﬁ cient to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior employees 
 of the highest calibre;
� remuneration should be weighted towards variable pay with a below median base salary vis-à-vis comparable benchmarks 
 and above market incentive opportunity linked to the delivery of superior performance;
� short and long-term performance targets should be speciﬁ c, measurable and fully aligned with the Company’s business objectives;
� signiﬁ cant opportunities to acquire Company shares should be provided as part of encouraging a wider share ownership 
 culture; and
� the interests of management should be fully aligned with those of shareholders.

Whether particular performance conditions are met is assessed by the Committee following sign off of the audited Annual Report 
and Accounts. This process ensures that incentive payments are made following independently audited results being known. 
Remuneration received in respect of each of these elements by the Executive Directors is shown on pages 44 to 46. 
Remuneration policy is reviewed on a regular basis against the principles set out above and with any developments in investors’ 
best practice taken into account as appropriate. For example, while not directly relevant to the Company, the Committee has 
considered the Company’s current remuneration policy in light of the recent FSA’s recent letter to Chief Executives of UK ﬁ nancial 
institutions. The conclusion of the Committee was that the current remuneration structure at the Company remains appropriate in 
light of the good practice suggestions of the FSA.
Balance between ﬁ xed and variable pay
Based on the remuneration structure that will operate for 2009, for achievement of target levels of performance, more than 50% 
of total remuneration will be delivered from performance related elements of our remuneration structure. For performance above 
target levels, a higher proportion of total remuneration will be delivered via performance related pay. The performance conditions 
for each variable element are the same for each Executive Director. 40 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
Service agreements
It is the Company’s policy for the notice periods of Executive Directors to normally be of 12 months or less.  
The Executive Directors current contracts, which are all dated 13 May 2008, provide for rolling 12 month periods, terminable 
by the Company giving one year’s notice, or by the Executive Director giving six months notice. The contracts include provisions 
on non-competition and non-solicitation. If an Executive Director’s employment is terminated (other than pursuant to the notice 
provisions in the service agreement or by reason of resignation or unacceptable performance or conduct), for any unexpired 
notice period the Company will pay a sum calculated on the basis of basic salary and any accrued annual bonus entitlement 
(taking into account bonus payments in the previous three ﬁ nancial years), together with beneﬁ ts. There would be no special 
payments made after a change in control. 
Salaries and beneﬁ ts in kind for Executive Directors
In setting the base salary of each Executive Director, the Committee takes into account market competitiveness and the 
performance of each individual Executive Director, any changes in position or responsibility and pay and conditions throughout the 
Group. This structure takes account of the reward structure in place for executives below Board level, and that used by comparable 
companies, which, following Admission, for 2009 purposes included FTSE 250 companies and restaurant/leisure companies with 
broadly similar market capitalisation or turnover or both. In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors also receive beneﬁ ts in 
kind which principally comprise pension contributions, life assurance, a healthcare scheme and use of a company car. 
In 2008, the rate of base salary increases for the Executive Directors (over 2007 ﬁ gures) was between -21% and 15% (the decrease
is attributable to the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer moving to the role of part-time Executive Chairman at the beginning of 2008). 
Salaries received by the Executive Directors in the 2008 ﬁ nancial year are set out below and shown on page 44. 
The current base salary levels, set for the ﬁ nancial year ending 28 December 2009, are as follows:
� Executive Chairman:   £190,000 (2008: £190,000)
� Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer:   £262,000 (2008: £230,000)
� Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer:   £215,000 (2008: £200,000).
The increase to the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s salary is reﬂ ective of his performance in post and the results of a recent 
benchmarking exercise. It was the Committee’s intention at the time of the promotion of the current Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
from Deputy Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer that there would be phased increases to bring him into line with the Committee’s policy of 
achieving a threshold rate of pay for a Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer of the size of the Company and that his 2008 and 2009 increases 
fully reﬂ ect this based on continued excellent performance. The increase awarded to the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer similarly took into 
consideration the results of a benchmarking exercise which highlighted that he had fallen below market for a FTSE 250 Finance 
Director and the enhanced responsibilities following Admission. The revised salary levels continue to reﬂ ect the Committee’s policy 
paying a below median base salary with an above market incentive opportunity.
Annual performance bonus (APB)
Annual incentive targets are set each year by the Committee to take account of current business plans and conditions, and there 
is a threshold performance below which no award is paid. The purpose of the APB is to reward participants’ performance over 
the previous ﬁ nancial year. In 2008, bonus awards were based solely on achieving and exceeding challenging adjusted PBT
1
 
growth targets.
In 2008, the maximum bonus opportunity available for Executive Directors, based on adjusted PBT
1
 performance, was 100% of 
base salary. 
APB awards made to Executive Directors for 2008 are shown on page 44 and, at 100% of salary, reﬂ ected adjusted PBT
1
 growth 
performance which exceeded the targets required for a maximum payout.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ (ABI) Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee ensures that 
the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance (ESG) 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there 
is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters and takes due 
account of issues of general operational risk when structuring incentives.

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
For 2009, adjusted PBT
1
 will be retained as the sole performance measure. However, following the detailed remuneration 
review, the maximum bonus opportunity available will be increased to 150% of salary for the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and 125% 
of salary for the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, to ensure that overall remuneration package in terms of both quantum and structure 
remains appropriate following the Company’s move to the Ofﬁ cial List and inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index. The maximum bonus 
opportunity of the Executive Chairman will remain unchanged at 100% of salary. The revised maximum bonus opportunities 
require a signiﬁ cantly higher level of adjusted PBT
1
 to be earned than the maximum payout achieved in 2008 based on a 
challenging sliding scale of targets. With regard to the 2009 bonus structure, to achieve their respective maximum potential 
APB in 2009, the Executive Directors will have to achieve or surpass 110% of the stretching adjusted PBT
1
 budget ﬁ gure for 2009, 
which is considered extremely challenging by the Committee.
LTIP
The Executive Directors and senior management have historically been eligible, at the discretion of the trustees of the EBT, to be 
awarded an interest in the growth in value of a speciﬁ c sub-fund of the EBT, represented by the increase in value of Domino’s 
shares. 
Awards prior to Admission 
Awards made prior to Admission have normally operated with a ﬁ ve year performance period with vesting determined by 
performance against challenging adjusted EPS and adjusted PBT targets. With regard to the awards made during the year under 
review (prior to Admission), for vesting to take place, the Company’s adjusted PBT
1
 and adjusted EPS
2
 are required to double by 
the end of the ﬁ ve year performance period. However, vesting may be accelerated if at any time during the performance period 
the EPS and PBT targets set are achieved (following the publication of the relevant set of Annual Report and Accounts).
The status as at 28 December 2008 of each LTIP cycle in respect of which awards could have vested at the date of this report is 
shown in the table on page 45, on the basis of our performance against the measures explained above. The table also shows 
awards which are yet to vest.
New LTIP
Immediately prior to Admission, a review of the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements vis-à-vis institutional investors’ best 
practice guidelines (speciﬁ cally those of the ABI and the recommendations set out in the Combined Code) was conducted and 
a new LTIP arrangement was introduced. Awards under the New LTIP (which will replace the LTIP detailed above for Executive 
Directors and senior management in future years) will continue to be structured as an interest in the growth in value of the 
Company’s shares. However, the New LTIP will operate with the following key features:
Maximum award limit
Awards will be limited to 300% of salary in any ﬁ nancial year (600% of salary in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment 
and retention).
The Committee’s intention, as set out at the time of Admission, had been to restrict future awards to 100% of base salary and 
100% of the bonus paid in the prior ﬁ nancial year. However, in light of the continued strong performance of the Company, the 
new share ownership guidelines introduced and to ensure that the overall remuneration package remains appropriate as referred 
to above in relation to the APB, the Committee considers that awards are likely to be required of up to 300% of base salary in 
future ﬁ nancial years if the Company is to be able to continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior executives of the necessary 
calibre. This is considered particularly important given the Company’s approach to setting base salary at below median of 
appropriate benchmarks.

Performance conditions
Performance will be tested over three years subject to the following challenging adjusted EPS
2
 growth condition:
        Level of vesting
Average annual compound EPS growth
Less than RPI +9%     0%
RPI +9%     25%
RPI +12% (or better)     100%
Between RPI +9% and RPI +12%     Straight line vesting between 25% and 100%
For the avoidance of doubt, this condition can only be tested at the end of three years with the award lapsing if the condition is 
not met at that time.
EPS is a key internal long-term measure of ﬁ nancial performance used by the Board. As a result, the Committee considers it to be 
the most appropriate measure to use to incentivise and reward Executive Directors and senior management.
Other share option plans
Each Executive Director also has the opportunity to participate in the HMRC approved savings-related share option scheme. 
Further details on this share plan are provided in note 30 to the ﬁ nancial statements. Executive Directors are not eligible to 
participate in any other Company share option plans.
Share-based awards and dilution
We ensure that the aggregate of all share-based awards does not exceed the guidelines laid down by the ABI. These guidelines 
provide that outstanding awards granted to employees over new issue shares under the Company’s employee share schemes 
when aggregated to new shares issued in relation to exercised historic share awards should not exceed 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital in any 10 year rolling period. Shares issued or to be issued under awards or options granted before the 
Company was admitted to trading on AIM in 1999 are excluded from this limit. 
Share ownership guidelines
The Committee has decided that all Executive Directors shall be required to attain a shareholding of at least one times their 
annual salary and therefore Lee Ginsberg will be required to attain such a shareholding during 2009. All other Executive Directors 
currently satisfy this requirement. In addition, the Committee has determined that from 2010, the Executive Directors will be 
required to hold, on vesting, one third of the total value of future awards under the New LTIP in Domino’s shares for a minimum 
period of two years following vesting. Full participation in the New LTIP from 2010 onwards will be conditional on this.
Retirement beneﬁ ts
The Committee reviews the pensions arrangements for the Executive Directors to ensure the beneﬁ ts provided are consistent with 
those provided by other similar companies and take account of changes in relevant legislation. The Company does not offer 
a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme. Instead, it makes contributions to an approved pension scheme of the Executive Director’s 
choice. In 2008, the Company contribution to each Executive Director was 10% of basic salary to the pension plan of their choice.  
The Company’s policy in relation to contributions to Executive Director’s pension arrangements is that contributions are made up 
to 15% of salary.
Save as set out above, there are no other pension arrangements for the Executive Directors.
Executive Directors’ outside appointments
We recognise the potential beneﬁ ts to the individual and to the Company of involvement by Executive Directors as Non-Executive 
Directors in companies outside the Group. Subject to pre-agreed conditions, and with prior approval of the Board, each Executive 
Director is permitted to accept one appointment as a Non-Executive Director in another company. The Executive Director is 
permitted to retain any fees paid for such service. Currently, none of the Executive Directors hold any other directorships of listed 
companies.

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Non-Executive Directors
Unless otherwise determined by the Board, Non-Executive Directors are appointed for terms of three years with a maximum term 
of nine years. The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company but their terms are set out in letters of 
appointment. There is no provision for termination payments and the appointments are terminable on one month’s notice.
Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee with additional fees for chairing of the Remuneration Committee and the Audit 
Committee. No additional fee is paid for chairing the Nominations Committee. The fees are approved by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Executive Directors, based on a review of the fees paid in companies of a similar size and the anticipated 
time commitment of the Non-Executives. A review of the fees was last carried out in 2008 and a further review will be carried out 
in 2010. None of the Non-Executives participate in the Company’s bonus arrangements, share schemes or pension arrangements.  
Colin Halpern, appointed Non-Executive Vice Chairman in January 2008, is seconded to the Company from HS Real LLC under 
the terms of a management agreement originally entered into in 1999. Colin Halpern has played an integral part for 16 years in 
building our business and continues to provide regular advice and assistance to the Executive Directors, with a speciﬁ c focus on 
acting as an international ambassador for the Company. The management fees reﬂ ect the transition from Executive Director to 
Non-Executive Director and are reviewed annually. The ﬁ gure for 2008 was agreed before Admission and equated to £260,000, 
including expenses. Colin Halpern’s appointment as a Non-Executive Director was renewed at the 2008 AGM of the Company 
and it is the Board’s intention that both Colin Halpern and Nigel Wray will put themselves forward for re-election at the AGM on 
23 April 2009 and at each subsequent AGM for as long as they remain members of the Board, taking into account the Combined 
Code provisions A.3.1 and A.7.2.

Performance graph
The graph opposite shows the Company’s performance 
measured by total shareowner return (TSR) for the ﬁ ve years to 
28 December 2008 compared with the TSR performance of 
the AIM Index and the FTSE 250 Index over the same period. 
TSR is the product of the share price plus reinvested dividends. 
The AIM index has been selected for this comparison because 
up until Admission, this was the index in which the Company’s 
shares were quoted and it provides a broad based comparator 
group of retail and non-retail companies. The FTSE 250 Index 
(excluding investment trusts) has been the index in which the 
Company’s shares have been quoted since Admission. TSR 
provides a useful, widely used benchmark to illustrate the 
Company’s performance over the last ﬁ ve years.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
in relation to the Group ﬁ nancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare Group ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year which present fairly the ﬁ nancial position 
of the Group and the ﬁ nancial performance and the cash ﬂ ows of the Group for that period. In preparing these Group ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors 
 and then apply them consistently;
� present information, including accounting policies, in a manner which presents relevant, reliable, comparable and 
 understandable information;
� provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁ c requirements in IFRS is insufﬁ cient to enable users to 
 understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s ﬁ nancial position and ﬁ nancial 
 performance; and 
� state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁ nancial 
 statements.
The Directors conﬁ rm they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements. The Directors 
conﬁ rm that the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the developments and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties it faces.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁ nancial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Group ﬁ nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 
1985 and 2006 and with regard to the Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors’ are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and IFRS as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group ﬁ nancial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements. The 
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁ c information presented in the Chairman’s Statement and the OFR 
that is cross referred from the Review of the Business section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reﬂ ects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
2006 Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review by the Listing Rules of the FSA, and we report if it does not. We are not required to 
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group ﬁ nancial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the OFR, the Corporate 
Governance Report, the Five Year Summary and Corporate Information. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of 
the Group ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁ nancial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
� the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the 
 state of the Group’s affairs as at 28 December 2008 and of its proﬁ t for the 52 weeks then ended; 
� the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
 IAS Regulation; and
� the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group ﬁ nancial statements.

Notes to the Group ﬁ nancial statements
At 28 December 2008
1. Authorisation of ﬁ nancial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
The ﬁ nancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 
2008 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 17 February 2009 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s
behalf by Lee Ginsberg. Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc is a public limited company (Company) incorporated in the United Kingdom 
under the Companies Act 1985 (registration number 03853545). The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its 
registered address is Domino’s House, Lasborough Road, Kingston, Milton Keynes, MK10 0AB. The Company’s ordinary shares 
are listed on the Ofﬁ cial List of the FSA and traded on the main market of the LSE.  
The Group’s ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as they apply 
to the ﬁ nancial statements of the Group for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2008.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group’s ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as they apply to
the ﬁ nancial statements of the Group for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2008 and applied in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements for the 
52 weeks ended 28 December 2008.
The Group ﬁ nancial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) 
except when otherwise indicated.
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the amounts 
reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the 
year. The nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
Key source of estimation uncertainty
The key source of estimation uncertainty that has a signiﬁ cant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year is the estimation of share-based payment costs. The estimation of share-based 
payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model, consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation 
model chosen and the estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, inputs for which arise from judgments relating 
to the probability of meeting non-market performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees.
Basis of consolidation
The full year consolidated ﬁ nancial statements incorporate the results and net assets of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings drawn up to the nearest Sunday to 31 December each year. The interim results are prepared for the ﬁ rst 
26 weeks of the relevant full period.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control comprises the power to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating 
policies of the investee so as to obtain beneﬁ t from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting 
rights; currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights; or by way of contractual agreement. The ﬁ nancial statements of 
subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are prepared for the same reporting period as the 
parent company and are based on consistent accounting policies. All inter-company transactions and balances between Group 
entities, including unrealised proﬁ ts arising from them, are eliminated upon consolidation.
Minority interests represent the portion of proﬁ t and loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is 
presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders’ equity
Interests in associates
The Group’s interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence and which are neither subsidiaries
nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post acquisition changes in the 
Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments. 
The Group’s income statement reﬂ ects the Group’s share of the associate’s results after tax. The Group statement of changes in 
equity reﬂ ects the Group’s share of any income and expense recognised by the associate outside proﬁ t and loss.  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 55
 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
2. Accounting policies continued
Interests in associates continued
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the 
Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate’s identiﬁ able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the 
carrying amount of the associate and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the associate’s identiﬁ able assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group’s share 
of the associate’s proﬁ t or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Financial statements of associates are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to bring the accounting policies used in line with those of the Group; to take into account fair values assigned at the date of 
acquisition and to reﬂ ect impairment losses where appropriate. Adjustments are also made in the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements to 
eliminate the Group’s share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates.
Foreign currencies 
Foreign operations
The income and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the monthly average rate of exchange ruling throughout the 
year. The balance sheet of the overseas subsidiary undertaking is translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising, if any, are included within equity and transferred to the Group’s translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed.
The Group utilised the exemption available in IFRS 1 whereby cumulative translation differences were deemed to be zero at 
1 January 2006 (the date of transition to IFRS).
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date.  
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the
identiﬁ able net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an 
asset on the Group’s balance sheet in the year in which it arises and is not amortised. Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition 
of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
Goodwill is recognised on the purchase of further minority interests under the parent entity extension method, whereby the entire 
difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary and the minority interest’s share of the assets and liabilities 
reﬂ ected in the consolidated balance sheet at the date of the acquisition of the minority interest is reﬂ ected as goodwill.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed 
for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if events or changes indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.  
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, 
usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2006 (the date of transition to IFRS) was tested for impairment at the date of 
transition and was recorded at its carrying amount under UK GAAP.
Intangible assets
Computer software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Externally acquired computer software
and software licences are capitalised at the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the speciﬁ c software. Internally developed 
computer software programs are capitalised to the extent that costs can be separately identiﬁ ed and attributed to particular 
software programs, measured reliably, and that the asset developed can be shown to generate future economic beneﬁ ts. These 
assets are considered to have ﬁ nite useful lives and are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives 
of each of the assets, considered to be between three and ﬁ ve years.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 56 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

2. Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. 
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes 
costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight line method on the following 
bases:
� Freehold buildings and leasehold properties – 50 years, or the lease term if shorter.
� Plant, equipment, ﬁ xtures and ﬁ ttings and motor vehicles – at rates varying from 10% to 50%.
� Leasehold building improvements – over the life of the lease.
� Freehold land is not depreciated.
Land and buildings under construction and non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated.
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate on an annual basis.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁ ts are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is derecognised.
All property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, when there are 
indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Prepaid short leasehold costs
Prepaid short leasehold property costs are classiﬁ ed as non-current prepayments. On initial recognition these assets are held at 
cost and subsequently at amortised cost over the length of the lease.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classiﬁ ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through sales rather than continuing 
use. This condition is regarded as met if a sale is expected to materialise within 12 months after the balance sheet date and the 
asset is available for immediate disposal in its present condition. Non-current assets classiﬁ ed as held for sale are measured 
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. After classiﬁ cation as assets held for sale, no further depreciation 
is provided for on the assets.
Leases
Group as lessee
Leases are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the Group. All other leases are classiﬁ ed as operating leases.
Assets held as ﬁ nance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between the 
reduction of the lease liability and ﬁ nance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest in the 
remaining balance of the liability. Assets held under ﬁ nance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life 
of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are 
capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term. Payments made to acquire operating leases are treated as prepaid lease 
expenses and amortised over the life of the lease.
Group as lessor
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful lives. 
Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and beneﬁ ts of ownership of the asset, the arrangement is classiﬁ ed as a 
ﬁ nance lease and a receivable is recognised for the initial direct costs of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Finance income is recognised in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of return on the remaining net 
investment in the lease.  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 57

Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in 
use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂ ows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is 
considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses 
may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable 
amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in proﬁ t or loss. After such a reversal 
the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a 
systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable
that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ t will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably 
measured.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a ﬁ rst in, ﬁ rst out basis. Net realisable 
value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to disposal.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 7 – 28 days terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value
and recoverable amount. Provision is made when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered in full. Balances are written off 
when the probability of recovery is considered remote.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured 
initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised 
respectively in ﬁ nance revenue and ﬁ nance cost.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the taxation authorities, based 
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the tax 
bases and the accounting bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is calculated on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 58 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

Income taxes continued
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, with the following exceptions:
� where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
 not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting proﬁ t nor taxable proﬁ t or loss;
� in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where 
 the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
 not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
� deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ t will be available against 
 which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or losses can be utilised. 
Income tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the  income tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax relates to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction on either the same taxable 
entity, or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously in each future period in which signiﬁ cant amounts of deferred tax liabilities are expected to 
be settled or recovered.
Derecognition of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities
A ﬁ nancial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing ﬁ nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modiﬁ ed, such an exchange or modiﬁ cation is treated as a derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees 
incurred are recognised in proﬁ t or loss.
Pensions
The Group contributes to the personal pension plans of certain staff. The contributions are charged as an expense as they fall 
due. Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as an accrual at that date. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Capital reserve – own shares
Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc shares held by the Company and the Group are classiﬁ ed in shareholders’ equity as “Capital Reserve
 – Own Shares” and are recognised at cost. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase or sale of 
such shares.
The EBT has waived its entitlement to dividends. The Group will meet the expenses of the trust as and when they fall due.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic beneﬁ ts will ﬂ ow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration net of returns, rebates and value-added taxes.
The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue from pizza delivery, commissary and equipment sales is recognised on delivery to customers and franchisees.
Revenue from franchise fees is recognised on commencement of the franchisee trading.
Royalties
Royalties are based on Domino’s Pizza store sales to customers and are recognised as the income is earned.
Rental income
Rental income arising from leasehold properties is recognised on a straight line basis in accordance with the lease terms.
Finance income
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Finance lease interest income is recognised as set out in the leasing accounting policy.  Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 59

2. Accounting policies continued
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are generally expensed as incurred. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction
of an asset are capitalised while the asset is being constructed as part of the cost of that asset.
The policy is adopted for all assets that meet the deﬁ nition of qualifying assets under IAS 23.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs should commence when:
� expenditures for the asset and borrowing costs are being incurred; and
� activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when the asset is substantially ready for its intended use. If active development is 
interrupted for an extended period, capitalisation is suspended. When construction occurs piecemeal and use of each part is 
possible as construction continues, capitalisation for each part ceases on substantial completion of that part.
For borrowing associated with a speciﬁ c asset, the actual borrowing costs less any investment income on temporary investment 
of those borrowings are capitalised. To the extent funds are borrowed generally and used for the purpose of obtaining a 
qualifying asset, the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation shall be determined by applying a capitalisation rate 
to the expenditure on that asset. The capitalisation rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the 
borrowings of the entity that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made speciﬁ cally for the purpose of 
obtaining a qualifying asset.
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which,
because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders
to understand better the elements of ﬁ nancial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to 
assess better trends in ﬁ nancial performance.
Share-based payments
The Group provides beneﬁ ts to employees (including Directors) in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for rights over shares (equity-settled transactions). The cost of the equity-settled 
transactions with employees and Directors are measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date at which the relevant employees become fully entitled 
to the award. Fair values of employee share option plans are calculated using the Black-Scholes and Binomial models. In valuing 
equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares 
of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁ ed, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisﬁ ed.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and the Directors’ best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest on achievement 
or otherwise of non-market conditions or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vested as 
described above. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income 
statement, with the corresponding increase in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁ ed or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, 
the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense 
is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modiﬁ cation, based on the 
difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modiﬁ ed award, both as measured on the date 
of the modiﬁ cation. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet 
recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the 
award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense 
in the income statement. The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled 
awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before

New standards and interpretations not applied
The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, become effective
after the current year end and have not been early adopted by the Group:
          Effective date
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
IFRS 2 – Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting conditions and cancellations     1 January 2009
IFRS 3 – (Revised) Business combinations       1 July 2009
IFRS 8 – Operating segments       1 January 2009
International Accounting Standards (IAS)
IAS 27 – (Revised) Consolidations       1 July 2009
IAS 1 – Amendment – Presentation of Financial Statements (revised September 2007)   1 January 2009
IAS 23 – Borrowing cost (revised)       1 January 2009
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
IFRIC 16 – Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation     1 October 2008
The amendment to IFRS 2 restricts the deﬁ nition of vesting conditions to include only service conditions (requiring a speciﬁ ed 
period of service to be completed) and performance conditions (requiring the other party to achieve a personal goal or contribute 
to achieving a corporate target). All other features are not vesting conditions, and whereas failure to achieve such a condition was 
previously regarded as a forfeiture (giving rise to a reversal of amounts previously charged to proﬁ t) it must be reﬂ ected in the 
grant date fair value of the award and treated as a cancellation, which results in either an acceleration of the expected charge, 
or a continuation over the remaining vesting period, depending on whether the condition is under the control of the entity or 
counterparty. The Group is currently assessing its impact on the ﬁ nancial statements, although it is not expected to be material.
The key features of the revised IFRS 3 include a requirement for acquisition-related costs to be expensed and not included in 
the purchase price; and for contingent consideration to be recognised at fair value on the acquisition date (with subsequent 
changes recognised in the income statement and not as a change to goodwill). The standard also changes the treatment of non-
controlling interests (formerly minority interests) with an option to recognise these at full fair value as at the acquisition date and a 
requirement for previously held non-controlling interests to be fair valued as at the date control is obtained, with gains and losses 
recognised in the income statement.
Whilst the revised IAS 1 will have no impact on the measurement of the Group’s results or net assets it is likely to result in certain 
changes in the presentation of the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements for the forthcoming year.
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will be required to disclose ﬁ nancial and descriptive information about its reportable segments.
Whilst the criteria used to identify the reportable segments differs from that currently applied in accordance with IAS 14, there will 
be no effect on reported income or net assets.
The remaining new standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have an effective date of after these 
ﬁ nancial statements detailed above have not been early adopted by the Group and the Directors do not anticipate that the 
adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s reported income or net assets in the 
period of adoption.

included 12 corporate stores at the date of the transaction). As a result of this transaction, certain legal and property provisions 
were made (see note 26). In the previous period partial resolution relating to the conditions for the provisions made in relation to 
the sale of the subsidiary undertakings was reached and as a result £58,000 of the provisions created was released. These items 
are reported in the proﬁ t on sale of subsidiary undertakings line on the income statement.

During the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2007 the Group’s IFRS 2 charge relating to reversionary interests in ordinary shares 
granted in 2004 was increased as the performance targets set were forecast to be achieved earlier than expected, resulting in an 
accelerated charge of £174,000, included in the share-based payments charge above. This charge was not and will not become 
deductible for taxation purposes (note 11). This charge had no impact on the cash ﬂ ow of the Group during the period.

11. Taxation continued
(b) Reconciliation of the total tax charge continued
The standard UK rate of corporation tax was reduced to 28% from 1 April 2008. On the basis that the Group’s deferred tax assets
and liabilities were not expected to materially crystallise before 1 April 2008 the Group’s deferred tax balances were recognised at 
28% at 30 December 2007.
In April 2008 legislation was introduced to withdraw industrial buildings allowances. For Domino’s this has the effect of preventing 
the Group from fully relieving the cost of the commissary buildings against its trading proﬁ ts chargeable to corporation tax. For 
the purpose of IAS 12 this will reduce the tax base of the commissary buildings without having a corresponding impact on their 
accounts base. The initial recognition exemption is not available in these circumstances. The recognition of the resulting deferred 
tax liability has led to an increase in the effective tax rate of 2.09 percentage points from 27.19% to 29.28%. The deferred tax 
liability is expected to reverse over the period that the commissary buildings are recovered.
(c) Temporary differences associated with Group investments
At 28 December 2008, there was no recognised deferred tax liability (2007: nil) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted
earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries, or its associates, as:
� there are no corporation tax consequences of the Group’s UK subsidiaries or associates paying dividends to their parent 
 companies; and 
� the Group has determined that undistributed proﬁ ts of its Irish subsidiary will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. 
 The temporary difference associated with the investment in the Group’s Irish subsidiary, for which deferred tax has not been 
 recognised aggregate to £5,524,000 (2007: £3,340,000).
There are no income tax consequences for the Group attaching to the payment of dividends by the Group to its shareholders.

12.  EPS
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing proﬁ t for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS are calculated by dividing the proﬁ t attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would have 
been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

EPS before exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense 
which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better the elements of ﬁ nancial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior 
periods and to assess better the trends in ﬁ nancial performance.
To this end, basic and diluted earnings from continuing operations per share is also presented on this basis and using the weighted
average number of shares for both basic and diluted amounts as per the table above. The amounts for EPS from continuing 
operations before exceptional items are as follows:

For the stores in the franchisee system, the Group has entered into commercial leases, taking the head lease, and then subletting 
the properties to the franchisees. These leases have an average duration of between 10 and 25 years. Under the terms of the 
franchise agreement the franchisee is granted an initial period of 10 years to operate a Domino’s Pizza delivery store under the

27.  Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s ﬁ nancial risk management objectives consist of identifying and monitoring those risks, which have an adverse impact
on the value of the Group’s ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities or on reported proﬁ tability and on the cash ﬂ ows of the Group.
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial liabilities comprise bank loans, bank revolving facilities, other loans and ﬁ nance leases. The Group 
has various ﬁ nancial assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps or ﬁ nancial foreign currency contracts.
It is, and has been throughout 2008 and 2007 the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments are credit risk, price risk, liquidity risk and cash ﬂ ow interest rate 
risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has invested in operations outside the United Kingdom and also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other 
than sterling. As a result the value of the Group’s non-sterling revenues, purchases, ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities and cash ﬂ ows 
can be affected by movements in exchange rates, the euro in particular. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its currency 
exposures by agreeing ﬁ xed euro rates with franchisees and suppliers wherever possible. The Board does not consider there to be 
any signiﬁ cant unmitigated risk in relation to the Group’s proﬁ t before tax.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in the sterling against euro exchange rates 
with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s equity (due to changes in the carrying value of euro denominated assets in 
subsidiaries with a sterling functional currency and sterling denominated assets in subsidiaries with a euro functional currency):
          Increase/

          –10 53
2007        +10 (57)
          –10 71
Credit risk
Customers who trade on credit terms and obtain ﬁ nance leasing from the Group are predominantly franchisees and it is 
considered that the franchisee selection process is sufﬁ ciently robust to ensure an appropriate credit veriﬁ cation procedure. 
There are no signiﬁ cant concentrations of credit risks within the Group.
In addition, trade debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not 
signiﬁ cant. Since the Group trades only with franchisees that have been subject to the franchisee selection process and provide 
guarantees as required under the franchisee agreements, there is no requirement for collateral.
It is Group policy that cash deposits are only made with banks that have been approved by the Board and have a high credit rating.
Price risk
The Board considers that the Group’s exposure to changing market prices on the values of ﬁ nancial instruments does not have 
a signiﬁ cant impact on the carrying value of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities. As such no speciﬁ c policies are applied currently, 
although the Board will continue to monitor the level of price risk and its exposure should the need occur.
Liquidity risk
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations with cash collection targets set throughout
the Group. All major investment decisions are considered by the Board as part of the project appraisal and approval process. In 
this way the Group aims to maintain a good credit rating to facilitate fund raising. 82 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

Interest rate risk
The Board has a policy of ensuring a mix of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating rate borrowings. Whilst ﬁ xed rate interest bearing debt is not 
exposed to cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to beneﬁ t from a reduction in borrowing costs when 
market rates are declining. Conversely, whilst ﬂ oating rate borrowings are not exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is 
exposed to cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk as costs are impacted by changes in market rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held 
constant, of the Group’s proﬁ t before tax (through the impact on the period end ﬂ oating rate cash balances and borrowings). 
There is no impact on the Group’s equity.

Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it remains a strong credit rating and healthy capital 
ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue 
new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the periods ended 28 December 2008 and 
30 December 2007. 
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by EBITDA. The Group includes within net debt, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings, bank revolving facilities, less cash and cash equivalents.

cost of debt for the Group. 
Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are excluded from the above analysis as the fair value approximates

During the period 754,051 (2007: 1,402,298) ordinary shares of 1.56p each with a nominal value of £11,782 (2007: £21,911) 
were issued at between 13.16p (2007: 13.16p) and 210.00p (2007: 210.00p) for total cash consideration received of £653,000 
(2007: £700,000) to satisfy share options that were exercised. 
During the period the Company bought back a total of 1,750,000 (2007: 3,725,000) ordinary shares of 1.56p each for a total 
value of £3,783,000 (including costs of £31,000) (2007: £8,346,000 (including costs of £136,000)). The average price for which 
these shares were purchased was 214.34p (2007: 220.39p) per share.
Nature and purpose of reserves
Share capital
Share capital comprises the nominal value of the Company’s ordinary shares of 1.56p each.
Share premium

Capital reserve – own shares
This reserve relates to shares held by an independently managed EBT. The shares held by the EBT were purchased in order to 
satisfy outstanding employee share options and potential awards under the LTIP and other incentive schemes. At 28 December 
2008, the Trust held 7,377,699 (2007: 6,609,878) shares, which had a historic cost of £7,897,090 (2007: £4,402,810). These

Employee share option
On 24 November 1999 participants in the Domino’s Pizza Group Limited (unapproved) Share Option Scheme (which had been 
in place since 31 March 1999) had the option of exchanging options over shares in Domino’s Pizza Group Limited in return for 
equivalent options over ordinary shares in the Company under Domino’s Pizza Share Option (unapproved) Scheme.
On 23 March 2004, the Company established the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (EMI Scheme).
All employees are eligible for grants of options under these schemes, which are approved by the Board. The options vest over a 
three year period and are exercisable subject to the condition that the growth in basic EPS in any ﬁ nancial year between grant and 
vesting exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index in the previous ﬁ nancial year by at least 5%.
The options lapse after 10 years or in certain other circumstances connected with leaving the Company. There are no cash 
settlement alternatives and all awards are equity settled. In respect of all outstanding options under these schemes, options may 
be exercised as follows:
One year after date of grant – maximum 1/3 of options held
Two years after date of grant – maximum 2/3 of options held
Three years after date of grant – in full
The weighted average fair value of each option granted in 2008 was 31.2p (2007: 28.1p). 86 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

The fair value of both options and reversionary interests granted is estimated at the date of granting using a Black-Scholes model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which they were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the period ended 28 December 2008:

The expected life is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected 
volatility reﬂ ects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the 
actual outcome. No other features of the options/reversionary interests were incorporated into the measurement of fair value, 
and non-market conditions have not been included in calculating fair value. 88 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
in relation to the Company ﬁ nancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law the Directors have 
elected to prepare the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The ﬁ nancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those ﬁ nancial 
statements, the directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
� state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
 explained in the ﬁ nancial statements; and 
� prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
 continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁ nancial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the Company ﬁ nancial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
We have audited the parent company ﬁ nancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 
2008, which comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 10. These parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁ nancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc for the 52 weeks ended 
28 December 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be 
audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
parent company Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration, the Chairman’s Statement, the OFR, the Five Year Summary and Corporate Information. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the parent company ﬁ nancial statements, and of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the 
part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
� the parent company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
 Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 28 December 2008; 
� the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited  have been 
 properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
� the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company ﬁ nancial statements.

 Annual Report & Accounts 2008
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The parent company ﬁ nancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice. The balance sheet is presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 
thousand (£000) except where otherwise indicated.
No proﬁ t and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and the 
Company has taken the exemption under FRS 1 not to present a cash ﬂ ow statement.
The Company has taken the advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and 
not disclosed information required by that standard, as the Group’s consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, in which the Company is 
included provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 Financial Disclosures.
Investments
Shares in subsidiary companies and ﬁ xed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for any impairment. Where shares 
have been issued as part of the consideration for an acquisition these are accounted for at their nominal value in accordance with 
the exemption under Sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Provision is made against the carrying value of investments where there is impairment in value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less or to 
receive more, tax, with the following exceptions:
� Provision is made for tax on gains from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of ﬁ xed assets, or gains on disposal 
 of ﬁ xed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is 
 a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available 
 evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets 
 and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
� Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be 
 suitable taxable proﬁ ts from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Capital reserve – own shares
Treasury shares held by the EBT are classiﬁ ed in capital and reserves, as ‘Capital reserve – own shares’ and recognised at cost. 
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase or sale of such shares.
The EBT has waived its entitlement to dividends. 
Share-based payment transactions
Directors of the Company receive an element of remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees
render services as consideration for equity instruments.
The awards vest when certain performance and/or service conditions are met, see note 9 for the individual vesting conditions for 
the various schemes.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award. Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing 
equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 
the Company (market conditions). The ﬁ nancial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of 
subsidiary undertakings are not recognised by the Company until such options are exercised. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁ ed, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisﬁ ed.

Notes to the Company ﬁ nancial statements continued
At 28 December 2008
1. Accounting policies continued
Share-based payment transactions continued
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired, management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as 
described above. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income 
statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁ ed or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, 
the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense 
is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modiﬁ cation, based on the 
difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modiﬁ ed award, both as measured on the date of 
the modiﬁ cation. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet 
recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the 
award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense 
in the income statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions in respect of equity settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only 
to awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 3 January 2005.
Provisions for liabilities
A provision is recognised when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured 
initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised 
respectively in ﬁ nance revenue and ﬁ nance cost.

1 Adjusted EPS means diluted earnings per share before operating and non-operating exceptional items.
2 Adjusted PBT means proﬁ t before tax and before operating and non-operating exceptional items.
The contractual life of each interest is ﬁ ve years and all awards may be equity settled. The fair value of reversionary interests, 
which may be equity-settled, is estimated as at the date of granting using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which they were granted. 
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the valuations in 2007 and 2008:
          2008 2007
Dividend yield (%)       3.8 3.8
Expected volatility (%)       20.0 15.0 – 20.0
Historical volatility (%)       21.2 18.8 – 24.1
Risk-free interest rate (%)       4.3 5.3 – 5.8
Expected life of reversionary interests (years)       4.1 4.0

The expected life of the reversionary interests is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may occur.
The expected volatility reﬂ ects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not 
necessarily be the actual outcome. No other features of the reversionary interests were incorporated into the measurement of fair 
value, and non-market conditions have not been included in calculating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of each reversionary interest granted during the year was 34.0p (2007: 32.0p). For further details 
regarding the reversionary interests granted and outstanding, see the Report on Directors’ Remuneration.

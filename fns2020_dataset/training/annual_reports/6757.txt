Chairman’s Statement 2007
For Gooch & Housego, 2007 has been a year that has seen
continued growth of the traditional business set against a
background of change as we put in place people and
systems to take the company forward. We have completed
an important acquisition, strengthened the Board and senior
management team, and are nearing completion of two
major projects – the construction of a new UK facility and the
reorganisation of Gooch & Housego PLC into a globally
integrated business. We have continued to perform well
despite the challenges that we have set ourselves. 
Acquisitions continue to be part of our strategy and a number
of opportunities have been considered this year. The acquisition
of SIFAM was significant and timely. It has broadened the
technology and product portfolio of Gooch & Housego, created
opportunities for new product development and contributed
key people and skills at a time when we are establishing
new management structures as an integrated business.
We have made a number of changes to the Board in the past
year. Terry Scribbins, previously Director of Operations in
Ilminster, joined the board as Chief Operating Officer in
December 2006. More recently, Peter Quinn has joined the
Board and will be taking up the position of Chief Finance
Officer following the retirement of Ian Bayer at the end of
2007. Most recently, Paul Heal has agreed to join the Board
as a non-executive director with effect from January 2008. 
I would like to thank members of the Board for their
contribution this year, and wish Ian Bayer a happy
retirement. I would also like to thank the entire workforce for
making this another record year.
Over the past year we have reinforced Gooch & Housego’s
already strong position in its sector and we have a number of
exciting projects and opportunities that we believe will
underpin future growth. We have plenty of work still to do
but I remain optimistic and believe that the company is well
placed to take advantage of opportunities that it creates and
that present themselves.
Dr Julian Blogh
Chairman
20 December 2007
For Gooch & Housego, 2007 has been a year that has seen continued growth of the
traditional business set against a background of change as we put in place people and
systems to take the company forward. We have completed an important acquisition,
strengthened the Board and senior management team, and are nearing completion 
of two major projects – the construction of a new UK facility and the reorganisation 
of Gooch & Housego PLC into a globally integrated business. We have continued to
perform well despite the challenges that we have set ourselves. Performance
For the year ended 30 September 2007, Group turnover
increased by 20.9% to £30.67m (2006: £25.36m), despite
the impact of the weakening US Dollar. Profit before tax,
after charging amortisation of £0.47m (2006 restated:
£0.38m), increased by 21.6% to £6.64m (2006 restated:
£5.46m). Profit before tax and goodwill amortisation
increased by 22.0% to £7.11m (2006 restated: £5.83m).
Basic earnings per share rose by 29.9% to 24.3p (2006
restated: 18.7p) while basic earnings per share before
goodwill amortisation increased by 28.8% to 26.8p (2006
restated: 20.8p).
Group operating profits improved by 24.0% to £6.72m (2006
restated: £5.42m). 
A Globally Integrated Business
The way in which we now plan and manage Gooch &
Housego as an integrated optical solutions provider is
reflected in this review, which for the first time reports on
the performance of the business under two groupings that
reflect their products and markets – “Components and
Materials”, and “Instrumentation and Life Sciences”.
Comprising Gooch & Housego UK Ltd (G&H UK, located in
Ilminster, UK), Cleveland Crystals, Inc. (CCI; Cleveland, Ohio),
NEOS Technologies, Inc. (NEOS; Melbourne, Florida),
Landwehr Electronic GmbH (LE; Norderstedt, Germany), and
SIFAM Fibre Optics Ltd (SIFAM; Torquay, UK), the Components
and Materials businesses manufacture highly complementary
optoelectronic components and materials. They serve the
same markets, they frequently share the same customers,
and as we harmonise products and manufacturing activities
there is increasing cross-fertilisation between operations.
Similarly, the Instrumentation and Life Sciences businesses,
comprising Optronic Laboratories, Inc. (OLI; Orlando, Florida)
and ChromoDynamics, Inc. (CDI; Lakewood, New Jersey), offer
similar collaborative opportunities in respect of the manufacture
high-value optical measurement and imaging instruments.
The links between these businesses are equally strong, with
OLI providing design engineering and manufacturing services
to CDI. Although a wide range of markets and applications
are addressed it is the emerging life sciences market that is
currently offering the greatest potential.
Over the last year we have established global sales, product
management, strategic marketing and new product
introduction organisations spanning our Components and
Materials activities. Our objectives are to drive growth by
engaging with our key customers as a strategic supplier,
improving our understanding of the world market and
extending our geographic reach. The information gained will
be used to fine tune our new product development and
inform our acquisitions strategy.
To achieve these objectives we have strengthened the senior
management team and have been fortunate in being able to
benefit from the influx of experience that came with the
acquisition of SIFAM. In parallel we are putting in place the IT,
communications and financial infrastructure needed to
operate as a globally integrated business. These efforts will
culminate in the launch of the new, re-branded Components
and Materials business in January 2008.
Over the past year we have made considerable progress in our drive to transform 
Gooch & Housego PLC from a group of small but exceptional companies into a world
leading, globally integrated business of sufficient critical mass to provide a solid
foundation for our next phase of growth. At the same time we have maintained
growth in revenues and profits and been active in acquisitions and new product
development to underpin future growth.

Components and Materials
The contribution of the Components and Materials businesses
to Group turnover increased from £22.05m in 2006 to
£27.54m this year.
This increase in sales was led by G&H UK and NEOS, where
sales increased to £8.66m and £7.80m respectively (2006:
£7.52m and £6.38m respectively). 
LE increased sales by 28.8% to £3.28m (2006: 2.54m) while
CCI sales were down slightly to £5.40m (2006: £5.60m) due
to the impact of the US Dollar’s movement against Sterling.
SIFAM, which was acquired on 4 May 2007, contributed sales
of £2.40m for the 5 months from the date of acquisition to
30 September 2007.
Components and Materials contributed £7.90m (2006
restated: £6.08m) to operating profits. Notably G&H UK and
NEOS increased operating profit by over 30% and contributed
£3.27m and £3.03m respectively.
Instrumentation and Life Sciences
OLI, currently the only trading company in this segment,
contributed £3.13m (2006: £3.32m) to Group turnover, with
the apparent year-on-year reduction resulting from the
impact of the US Dollar’s movement against Sterling.
Instrumentation and Life Sciences suffered a loss of £0.15m
(2006 restated: profit £0.27m) in the year. The loss is due to
a full year of research and development expenditure at CDI
where costs increased to £0.51m (2006: £0.16m). 
Taxation
An overall tax rate of 32.8% (2006 restated: 38.1%) was
recorded for the year. The year-on-year reduction is a result
of adjustments in respect of prior years, additional costs
being tax deductible and the use of capital allowances
acquired with SIFAM. The overall tax rate is above the UK
corporation tax rate of 30% due to overseas profits,
predominantly US-based, being taxed at a higher rate.
Balance Sheet
The Group balance sheet remains strong with shareholders
funds increasing by £6.48m to £25.53m. 
Intangible assets increased to £6.68m as a result of the
acquisition of SIFAM. Tangible assets increased due to the
building of the new Ilminster factory. Working capital has also
increased as a result of a 20.9% increase in Group turnover
and the impact of the acquisition of SIFAM.
Cash flows
The Group cash flows remain strong with cash inflow from
operating activities increasing by 14.1% to £6.54m. The
movement from net funds of £2.90m to net debt of £0.98m
primarily results from the cash element of the purchase price
of SIFAM (£2.35m) and £4.43m spent on plant, property and
equipment, predominantly the new G&H UK factory in
Ilminster.
Dividends
Reflecting the Group’s continuing strong performance, the
Directors are proposing a final dividend of 3.0p making a
total for the year of 4.5p. This represents an increase of 7.1%
over last years total of 4.2p and is covered 5.8 times by post
tax earnings. The shares went ex-dividend on 5th December
2007, and following approval at the Annual General Meeting
on 13th February 2008, the dividend will be paid to
shareholders on 14th February 2008.
Financial Results
Chief Executive’s Review continued Looking back over the year from a trading point of view we
have been successful in increasing revenues in all of our
Components and Materials activities and in all of our key
geographical markets, despite increasingly unpredictable
market conditions as the year progressed.
Components and Materials
Acousto-optics – We experienced a significant increase in
demand for acousto-optics that resulted in a noteworthy
performance by our Melbourne facility, closely followed by
our production unit in Ilminster. We were able to respond to
this increase in demand by coordinating optics and
electronics manufacturing activities in Melbourne, Ilminster
and Norderstedt. A further benefit of this global approach to
the acousto-optic market has been a reduction in lead times.
Precision Optics – The manufacture of precision optical
components and optics made from crystalline materials such
as quartz was the business upon which Gooch & Housego
was founded nearly sixty years ago, and it remains one of
our core competencies today. Output from the Ilminster
facility has increased over the past year, driven by the
internal demand for optical elements for our acousto-optics
business and our success in expanding into the European and
US markets. This increase has been achieved despite the
space constraints that apply until we are able to relocate to
the new Ilminster factory early next year. 
Electro-Optics and Non-Linear Materials – We have reinforced
our leading position in the electro-optic (Pockels cell) market
during the past year as a result of sales wins achieved
through a combination of quality, performance and reliability.
Our primary market for non-linear optics is the supply of very
large aperture crystals for the world’s largest laser systems
that are being constructed for nuclear fusion research. Although
a very specialised market, our Cleveland facility leads the
world in this technology and output has increased this year
with laser systems under construction in the US and Europe.
Fibre Optics – As a result of the acquisition of SIFAM in May
this year, Gooch & Housego now has a strategically important
fibre optics capability, the rationale of which is discussed
elsewhere in this review. The integration of SIFAM has
progressed well, with the business exceeding its earnings
forecast in the five months that it has been part of the Group.

Instrumentation and Life Sciences
Instrumentation – The traditional high-end optical
measurement instrumentation business of Optronic
Laboratories, Inc. (OLI) has seen a small US$ revenue growth
and flat profits (resulting in small decreases after currency
translation). While disappointing, this result is not
unexpected and is behind the decision to develop new
products that will open up new, high growth markets,
particularly in life sciences. In addition to working with
ChromoDynamics, Inc. (CDI) on the development of a
biomedical imaging system, OLI will be introducing a new
product in January 2008, aimed at the microscopy and life
sciences market.
Biomedical Imaging – CDI has made excellent progress 
over the past year and has passed several key milestones. 
In particular, CDI has completed development of its initial
biomedical imaging system, the HSi300, which is currently
being evaluated in research, microscopy and molecular
diagnostics applications. A proof of concept study assessing
the potential for the HSi300 to assist in the diagnosis of early
stage cancer has been successfully completed. 
Chief Executive’s Review continued UK Factory and Corporate Headquarters
One of the most significant investments we are currently
making is the construction of the new factory and corporate
headquarters in Ilminster. The development has progressed
rapidly, particularly during the last six months, and is on
target for handover from the developers commencing in
December 2007. The relocation will be phased over
approximately two months to minimise disruption. Where
necessary we have built up buffer stocks to maintain
continuity of supply to our customers. The new factory will
be one of the most significant milestones in the history of
Gooch & Housego in Ilminster, and will facilitate a new era 
of growth.
Acquisitions and New Product Development
Over the past year we have continued to take a proactive
approach to acquisitions. We see growth being driven by a
combination of organic new product development and
acquisitions. The acquisition of SIFAM addressed both of these
objectives and brought a guided wave optics capability that
perfectly complements the conventional optics expertise of
Gooch & Housego. 
Fibre optics is becoming a ubiquitous technology, and for
Gooch & Housego to be able to provide its customers with a
complete range of optical solutions it is essential that we
have an in-house capability. In fact, in SIFAM we have a
world class capability, which will help us to take a leading
market position and maintain a competitive edge.
SIFAM and Gooch & Housego share many customers and are
active in the same market sectors. Both companies have
developed on parallel courses over the last five years, and
have shared ambitions to reach up the value chain through
the development of a systems capability, while taking care
not to compete with existing customers.
Perhaps the most obvious area in which G&H and SIFAM
have complementary capabilities is the manufacture of
components for industrial and medical laser systems. G&H is
the leading manufacturer of components for traditional solid
state lasers. SIFAM is a leading supplier of fused fibre optic
combiners, a critical component in all fibre lasers. The
acquisition therefore reinforces our position as a leading
supplier to the laser industry.
SIFAM will also play an important role in our new product
development plans. There are a number of exciting new
products that we can now bring to market by leveraging the
combined capabilities of SIFAM and the other members of
the Group, in applications ranging from biomedical imaging
to laser components.
Directors and Employees
I would like to thank my fellow directors and employees 
for their contribution to another successful year for Gooch &
Housego, and for their help and understanding in implementing
the considerable changes that are taking place.
I would particularly like to thank Ian Bayer, Finance Director,
who will be retiring at the end of 2007. Ian has been with
the company for eight years and has made a major
contribution to our successes over that period. On behalf of
everyone in the company I would like to wish Ian a happy,
healthy and well-earned retirement.
I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Peter
Quinn and Paul Heal to the board. Peter will formally take
over as Chief Financial Officer with effect from 2nd January
2008 following Ian Bayer’s retirement. Peter brings extensive
experience in financial and operational roles in technology
businesses, including several NASDAQ quoted US companies.
Paul Heal will join the board on 2nd January 2008 as a non-
executive director. Paul has been a Partner with
PricewaterhouseCoopers for more than twenty years and the
Board and its committees will benefit from his financial and
corporate governance experience.
Prospects
We will continue to invest in our core competencies, reach up
the value chain and deliver growth through the introduction
of new products (supported by a strong intellectual property
portfolio) and by acquisition. 
Our established products continue to be in demand, and 
we have a pipeline of new products at various stages of
development. With these products we will seek to reinforce
our position in our established markets, and with others, 
such as those under development at CDI, OLI and SIFAM we
aim to gain a foothold in the potentially high growth
biomedical market.
Notwithstanding the less predictable market conditions
referred to earlier I believe the Group is well positioned for
continued growth.

Substantial shareholdings
As at 20 December 2007, the under-mentioned had notified
the company that they held an interest in 3% or more of its
issued ordinary share capital:
Shareholder Number % holding
+ +++++ ++++++++++ +++++++++ ++++++++
Gooch/Virgin Family Trusts 4,386,516 23.1
Insight Investment Management 1,756,398 9.2
F&C Asset Management 996,960 5.2
Black Rock Investment 901,980 4.7
Management
Rensburg Sheppards Investment 646,486 3.4
Management
Montanaro UK Smaller Companies 590,327 3.1
Investment Trust PLC
+ +++++ ++++++++++ +++++++++ ++++++++
Save for these interests, the directors have not been notified
that any person is directly or indirectly interested in 3% or
more of the issued ordinary share capital of the company.
Financial Risk Management
The group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks
that include credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and
interest rate risk.
The group operates a central treasury function, headed by the
Group Finance Director, responsible for all debt and liquidity
management, foreign exchange and interest rate management.
The group does not undertake speculative financial
transactions or utilise off balance sheet financing vehicles.
Credit risk – The group regularly monitors the credit status of
its customers and applies appropriate credit limits to each of
them to ensure that exposure to any particular customer is
not excessive.
Liquidity risk – The group activity maintains a mixture of
long-term and short-term debt finance that is designed to
ensure the group has sufficient funds available for operations
and planned strategic expansions.
Foreign currency risk – The group’s principal currency
exposure is in respect of the trading results generated in US
dollars by its US subsidiaries. The group originally hedged its
investments in its US subsidiaries by part financing them with
US dollar loans, although these loans have now been repaid.
As a result, the Board is considering further changes to the
structure of the US subsidiary group to further reduce the
group’s currency exposure.
Interest rate risk – The group has both interest bearing assets
and interest bearing liabilities. Interest bearing assets comprise
cash deposits, all of which earn interest at variable rates. The
group has a policy of using a mixture of fixed and variable
rate debt instruments which allows it to ensure it is able to
consider the most commercially suitable financing options
whilst exercising control over future interest payments.
Donations
The group made donations of £7,466 (2006: £4,080) to
various local charities during the year. No political donations
have been made during the current or previous year.
Employees
The group is committed to including all employees in the
performance and development of the business. An
established employee appraisal and reward scheme is in
operation and employees are appraised regularly with
relevant development support provided by the group.
The group attaches considerable importance to informing and
involving its employees on matters which concern them and
in the achievement of its business objectives. The group has
a formal employee communication plan involving regular
meetings between management and employees and the
provision of a comprehensive employee handbook.
Employment of Disabled Individuals
It is the policy of the group that disabled individuals, whether
registered or not, should receive full and fair consideration for
all job vacancies for which they are suitable applicants.
Employees who become disabled during their working life
will be retained in employment wherever possible and will
be provided help with any necessary rehabilitation and
retraining. The group is prepared to modify procedures or
equipment, wherever this is practicable, so that full use can
be made of an individual’s abilities.
Directors’ Report continued Corporate Governance
The Board recognises the importance of good corporate
governance and has, after taking into account the size and
stage of development of the group, put in place procedures it
considers appropriate. The group currently has a Non Executive
chairman and two Non Executive Directors who advise the
Board on business and corporate governance issues. 
The Audit Committee, which consists of the three Non
Executive Directors, is responsible for ensuring that the
financial performance of the group is properly monitored,
controlled and reported on. The Committee has met with the
auditors on two occasions during the year to review issues
relating to the financial statements and internal financial
control systems.
The Remuneration Committee, which consists of three Non
Executive Directors and the Chief Executive Officer, has met
during the year, and a summary of the committee’s report 
is on pages 14 to 16.
Paul Heal will be joining from 2 January 2008 as a Non
Executive Director and will be Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the
group’s system of internal financial control. The system can
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against
material misstatements and losses. Among the procedures
designed to maintain an appropriate control environment are
the following:
l Annual budgets are prepared for each company.
Monthly reports enable the board to compare
performance against budget and to take action where
appropriate.
l Procedures are in place to identify any major business 
risks and evaluate their potential financial effects.
l Internal financial controls are in existence which 
provide reasonable assurance of the maintenance of
proper accounting records and the reliability of financial
information used within the business.
The Board is also aware that it is responsible for the 
group’s systems of internal control, not just those relating to
financial controls. The Board regularly assesses the controls in
place, taking into account the size and stage of development
of the group.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the
Annual Report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the
Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards
and applicable law). The financial statements are required by
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company and group and of the profit and loss of the group
for that period.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
l select suitable accounting polices and apply them 
consistently;
l make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
l state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
l prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company and the group will continue to operate; and
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the
above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the company and the group and to
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditors are unaware.
Each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken in his duty as a Director to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the
company’s auditors are aware of that information.
International Financial Reporting Standards
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will apply
to the consolidated financial statements of the group for the
year ending 30 September 2008. The Directors have
commenced a project to convert to IFRS and the restatement
will be completed prior to the half year review being
announced in May 2008. The key areas of impact are
expected to be accounting for business combinations,
amortisation of goodwill, research and development
expenditure and deferred tax.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a
judgement, at the time of approving the financial
statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the
company and the group have adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
auditors to the company will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting.
Approved and signed on behalf of the Board of Directors by:
G C W Jones
Director
20 December 2007
Directors’ Report continued The Remuneration Committee members at 30 September
2007 were Dr J Blogh, Dr E G Arthurs, Gareth Jones and Jan
Melles.
Policy on Directors’ Remuneration
It is an objective of the group to attract and retain Directors
of high caliber and reward them in a way which encourages
the creation of value for shareholders. The Committee
undertakes the determination of Executive Directors’ annual
remuneration packages and these are reviewed with effect
from 1 October each year. No Executive Director plays a part
in the discussion about his own remuneration. 
Executive Directors are paid a basic salary together with annual
bonus payments based on the achievement of group earnings
per share related targets. In addition, certain Executive
Directors participate in share option schemes and receive
benefits in kind, including medical expenses and insurance.
Non Executive Directors are paid a fee to attend board
meetings and to serve as members of the Audit and
Remuneration committees. Further payments may be made
in respect of further services provided at the request of the
company, although no such payments have been made
during the current or previous year. 
Directors’ Pension Arrangements
During the year the company contributed to a money
purchase pension scheme on behalf of the Executive
Directors. Contributions to a scheme on behalf of continuing
Directors amount to 8% of the Director’s basic salary.
Directors’ Contracts
Gareth Jones currently has a rolling service contract
terminable on twelve months’ notice. Ian Bayer has a service

Share option schemes
Policy
The board believes a share based incentive scheme is an
important element in promoting closer alignment of the
interests of shareholders and Executive Directors.  The policy
is to make periodic grants of share options under appropriate
schemes in place at the time of grant.
The group currently has two share based incentive schemes.
These are detailed below:
Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option
Scheme
The Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option
Scheme has had two grants of share options, one in 2004,
and one in 2005. These share option awards were to 
3 Executive Directors and 4 senior employees. No further
awards have been made under this scheme.
Performance criteria
The share options may be exercised on the achievement of
certain financial performance criteria. 50% of each allocation
of options may be exercised from the earliest exercise date if
the earnings per share figure for the group, based on the most
recent audited annual financial statements, has improved by
a rate equivalent to the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index
plus 3%. The remaining 50% of each allocation of options may
be exercised from the earliest exercise date if the earnings
per share figure for the group, based on the most recent
audited financial statements, has improved by a rate equivelant
to the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 6%.
Senior employees share options also have performance
criteria attached and can only be exercised if these
conditions are met, details of the performance criteria is
given in note 26 of the financial statements.

Note:
a Performance criteria met
b Performance criteria not yet been met
Gareth Jones and Ian Bayer both exercised and immediately sold 107,200 shares at 420p in the year (2006: nil). On 29
November 2007, both Gareth Jones and Ian Bayer exercised and immediately sold 40,000 shares at 425p. Long-Term Incentive Plan
A Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) was set up in 2007 and
an award was made on 13 August 2007 to three Executive
Directors and two senior employees. 
Performance criteria
The share options may be exercised on the achievement of
certain financial performance criteria after the three year
vesting period has elapsed. Firstly, the Total Shareholder Return
(“TSR”) over the vesting period needs to exceed that of the
FTSE AIM Index. If the TSR criteria is met, then the following
determines what percentage of the grant is released:
l If over the vesting period the Return on Capital 
Employed (“ROCE”) exceeds 20% then 25% of each
allocation of options may be exercised from the earliest
exercise date. 
l If ROCE exceeds 35%, 100% of the allocation of options
may be exercised from the earliest exercise date.
Senior employee share options have the above performance
criteria attached and can only be exercised if these
conditions are met; further detail is given in note 26 of the
financial statements.

We have audited the group and parent company financial
statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of Gooch & Housego
PLC for the year ended 30 September 2007 which comprise
the group profit and loss account, the group and company
balance sheets, the group cash flow statement, the group
statement of total recognised gains and losses and the
related notes. These financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out
in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We
also report to you whether in our opinion the information
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report
includes that specific information presented in the
Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Review that
is cross referred from the Business Review section of the
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report,
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises only the financial
highlights, the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the
Chief Executive’s Review and the Report of the Remuneration
Committee. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made
by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the group’s and the
parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2007 and of
the group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
l the financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
l the information given in the Directors’ Report is 
consistent with the financial statements.

disclosure in note 2.
The results for the comparative period have been restated to reflect the requirements of FRS 20 “Share-based Payment”.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of
certain fixed assets, and have been prepared in accordance
with applicable UK accounting standards and the UK
Companies Act 1985.
Change in accounting policies
The group has adopted FRS 20 “Share-based Payment”
during the current financial year which has resulted in a
change in accounting policy. Consequently, the comparative
figures for the year ended 30 September 2006 have been
restated.
The adoption of FRS 20 has resulted in an increase in group
employee costs of £199,000 for the year ended 30
September 2007 and £320,000 for the comparative year
ended 30 September 2006. An equivalent amount has been
credited to retained earnings in each year. 
Due to share-based payments tax treatment not mirroring
the accounting treatment a deferred tax asset arises each
time an expense is charged to the profit and loss account. 
As a result a deferred tax asset of £112,000 has been
recognised in the group balance sheet at 1 October 2005,
which reduces the deferred tax liability by that amount. 
An equivalent amount has been credited to reserves.  
In the year ended 30 September 2006, the deferred tax asset
increased by £66,000 resulting in a further reduction of the
deferred tax liability. The balance sheet has been restated to
reflect this change and the corresponding credit of £66,000
has been taken to the profit & loss account.
Further details in respect of the accounting policy for share-
based payments are set out below.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results
and state of affairs of the company and its subsidiaries. The
subsidiaries are consolidated using acquisition accounting and
are included in the consolidated result from the date of
acquisition.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated upon consolidation.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of
the company has not been presented as the company has
taken advantage of the exemption in section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985.
Goodwill
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of the
acquisition consideration over the fair value of the acquired
entity’s assets and liabilities. Goodwill arising on the
acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and amortised on a
straight line basis over the Directors estimated useful
economic life of goodwill. This is individually assessed for
each acquisition and details are provided in note 12.
Turnover
Turnover is the total income receivable by the group in the
ordinary course of business for goods supplied as a principal
and for services provided, exclusive of applicable sales taxes.
Turnover is recognised upon the transfer of substantial risks
and rewards to the customer, which is usually on despatch.
Turnover on long term contracts reflect costs incurred to date
plus an estimate of profits attributable to work performed to
date. For this purpose the estimate of attributable profits will
include a proportion of the total profits anticipated to be
made on the contract.
Research and development 
Expenditure on research and development is written off in
the year which it was incurred.
Pension schemes
The company operates three money purchase pension schemes
for Directors and staff. The assets of the schemes are held in
separately administered funds. The pension charge
represents contributions payable to the funds during the year.
All US subsidiaries operate a 401(k) profit sharing plan
covering substantially all employees. Expenses under the
plan are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Share-based payments
The company operates share reward programmes which
grants share options to certain employees. These programmes
are subject to both market and non-market related vesting
conditions. Option grants are measured at fair value which is
then charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line
basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to
reflect expected and actual forfeiture during the vesting
period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-
market performance conditions. The fair value is determined
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
In the company balance sheet, share-based payment costs
associated with employees of overseas subsidiaries are
accounted for as an increase in investment and reserves. 
The investment cost increase is transferred to the group profit
and loss account on consolidation.
For the year ended 30 September 2007
Notes to the Financial Statements Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into sterling at rates ruling at the
balance sheet date. Exchange differences which arise on the
settlement of transactions and on the translation of other
monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the profit and
loss account.
The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into
sterling at the average rates of exchange prevailing during
the year. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are
translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the balance sheet
date. Exchange gains and losses arising from foreign currency
loans taken out to finance overseas investments are offset
against the retranslation of the subsidiaries opening net
assets. The net exchange difference is taken to the statement
of total recognised gains and losses.
Leased assets
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance
leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets. Assets
acquired by finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of
the lease term and their useful lives. Assets acquired by hire
purchase are depreciated over their useful lives.
Finance leases are those which substantially all the benefits
and risks of ownership are assumed by the group. Obligations
under such agreements are included in creditors net of future
finance charges. The finance element of each rental payment
is charged to the profit and loss account so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the net obligation
outstanding in each period.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the
profit and loss account as incurred.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost or valuation 
of the fixed assets, over their useful lives, at the following 
annual rates:
Freehold buildings 2-3% Straight line
Short leasehold improvements over term Straight line
of lease
Plant & machinery 10-20% Straight line
Fixtures, fittings & computers 10-33% Straight line
Motor vehicles 25% Reducing
balance
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or capital work 
in progress.
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any
permanent diminution in value. Where overseas borrowing is
required to finance the investment in overseas subsidiaries,
the investment is retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at
balance sheet date.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost
and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in
bringing each product to its present location and condition,
including a reasonable proportion of manufacturing
overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Long-term contract balances included in work in progress
comprise costs incurred on long-term contracts, net of any
amounts transferred to trading expenditure, after deducting
foreseeable losses and related payments on account. Costs
include all direct material and labour costs incurred in
bringing a contract to its state of completion at the year end,
including an appropriate proportion of indirect expenses.
Provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made in the
period in which such losses are foreseen. Long-term contract
balances do not included attributable profit. The amount by
which customer billings exceed the turnover recognised on a
contract is shown as a payment on account.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing
differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their
recovery is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities have not been discounted.
Financial liabilities
Finance costs associated with financial liabilities are charged
to the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument.
Issue costs are accounted for as a deduction against the 
gross debt received and are amortised over the period of 
the instrument.
Financial instruments
The group does not use derivative financial instruments to
hedge its exposure to interest rate risk or currency risk.
Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount
will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the
business. Such assets are available for immediate sale in their
present condition, management are committed to and have
initiated a plan to sell the asset which, when initiated, was
expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months.

Factors affecting the future tax charge
The Finance Bill 2007 contained provisions relating to the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect
from 1 April 2008. It was also announced that industrial building allowances will be phased out over three years commencing 
1 April 2008. The rate change was substantively enacted in June 2007 and the company has reflected the rate change within its
deferred tax provision. The change of rate has reduced the deferred tax asset carried forward in the UK by approximately £27,000.
The provisions to abolish industrial building allowances are expected to be contained in the Finance Bill 2008 and, if fully enacted,
are likely to impact the tax relief available for the capital allowance expenditure incurred at the new headquarters and
manufacturing site at Dowlish Ford. Based on the expenditure incurred to 30 September 2007 this change would increase future
tax liabilities by approximately £6,000 per annum, once the allowances were fully phased out.
Overseas tax losses of £606,000 (2006: £100,000) are available to offset against future profits of the group. Tax losses in the UK
which may be utilised against future profits are £2,243,000 (2006: £nil). No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of
these tax losses. The UK tax losses became available on the acquisition of a subsidiary during the year. These losses have not been
recognised as a deferred tax asset as significant decelerated capital allowances are available before the trading losses can be
utilised.

The Directors have proposed a final dividend of £568,000 for the year ended 30 September 2007 which is equivalent to 3.0p 
per share. This dividend has not been accounted for with the 2007 financial year as it is yet to be approved.
11  Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
number of ordinary share outstanding during the year. The weighted average of Ordinary shares in issue during the year was
18,377,144 (2006: 17,999,162).
All share options which the performance criteria has been met at 30 September 2007 and 30 September 2006 which have an
exercise price lower than the average market price of the group’s share price in the period since issue have been included in the
diluted weighted average number of shares. The dilutive weighted average number of shares in issue during the year was
19,170,388 (2006: 18,435,688).
A reconciliation of the earnings used in the earnings per share calculation is set out below:

more accurately reflects the trading performance of the group.

relief exemptions available under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 apply to this transaction and as a result the investment

At 30 September 2006, freehold land and buildings includes property which was revalued to £360,000 from an historical cost of
£52,290. The revaluation was at 30 September 1988 by independent qualified valuers, Greenslade Taylor Hunt, on an open market
basis for existing use. Under the transitional rules of FRS 15 ”Tangible fixed assets” the revaluation has not been updated. If the
property had not been revalued then its carrying value at balance sheet date would have been £36,000 (2006: £37,000).
During the year, the previously revalued property has been transferred to assets held for resale. The remaining freehold land and
buildings are carried at cost less depreciation.
Plant & machinery purchased under finance lease agreements had a cost of £832,000 (2006: £900,000) and a net book value of
£605,000 (2006: £630,000).

21  Financial instruments
The group’s financial instruments comprise bank overdrafts, bank loans, cash at bank, finance leases and various items such as
trade receivables and trade payables that directly arise from its operations. The group has not entered into derivative transactions,
nor does it trade in financial instruments as a matter of policy. The main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are
interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board’s policy on these risks is described in the Directors’ report.
Operations are financed through a mixture of retained profits, cash reserves, bank overdrafts, bank loans and finance leases. Other
than finance leases the Board’s policy is to use variable rate borrowings. Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of an
overdraft facility.

The company operates two share reward programmes which grant share options to certain employees. The company has ceased
granting share options under the Gooch & Housego PLC 2004 Company Share Option Scheme and now only grants share options
under the new Long Term Incentive Plan “LTIP”. Currently, 3 Executive Directors and 6 senior employees of the group have share
options over the ordinary share capital of the company.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of the grant. The
contractual life of an option is 10 years and is subject to continued employment.
The remuneration report details the Executive Directors share options and the performance criteria which are needed to be met
for them to exercise their option. 
Four senior employees within the group have 483,358 share options outstanding relating to the Gooch & Housego PLC 2004
Company Share Option Scheme. These options are subject to specific performance criteria, namely that their subsidiary audited
pre-tax profits for the relevant year will be at least US$500,000 and the subsidiary pre-tax profits will be not less than 95% of the
agreed budget.
Two senior employees within the group have 16,184 LTIP share options outstanding. The performance criteria attached to these
options is the same as the LTIP share options granted to Executive Directors. 
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value
calculations. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions in the calculations are as follows:
Grant date
+ +++++ +++++ +++++ +++++ ++++++ ++++ ++++++ ++++ ++++++ ++++ +++++++ +++ ++++++ + + +

Risk free rate
Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield
Fair value per option
+ + + +++++ +++ ++++++++ ++ ++++++++ ++ ++++++++ ++ +++++++++ + +++++++++ + ++++++ + + +
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected 
period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the
assumed option life.

On 4 May 2007, the company acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of SIFAM Fibre Optics Limited and SIFAM Limited, its

based in the United Kingdom and were acquired for a total consideration of £5,150,000, including acquisition costs. Acquisition
accounting has been used in consolidating SIFAM Fibre Optics Limited and its subsidiary SIFAM Limited from the date of acquisition.
In the period since 4 May 2007, the acquisition utilised £369,000 of the group’s net operating cash flows, paid £25,000 in respect
of interest, £nil in respect of taxation and £179,000 in respect of capital expenditure.
In its last financial year to 30 September 2006, SIFAM Fibre Optics Limited and SIFAM Limited made a profit after tax of £220,000.

Limited at 4 May 2007 and the fair values are provisional. The adjustment to tangible fixed assets reflects the upward valuation 
of the freehold property to market value at the date of acquisition and the deferred tax represents the surplus of capital allowances
claimed over depreciation charged.

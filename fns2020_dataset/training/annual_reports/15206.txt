Symphony 
Environmental 
T echnologies plc, 
dedicated to finding 
technical solutions 
to the world’s 
environmental  
and public health 
problems by making 
plastic smarter .
We care passionately about health 
and the environment. Over the 
years we have identified areas in 
which Symphony can make a 
difference, not just in our home 
country of Great Britain, but all 
around the world.
Since 2012 the Group has been 
broadening its horizons, looking at 
the wider health and environmental 
issues that could be solved through 
innovation. In the last year alone, 
we have launched new ranges of 
d
2
p masterbatch that provide 
anti‑fungal performance in plastic 
products. Our anti-bacterial d
2
p is 
already on the market, and other 
variations and applications are in 
development. d
2
p complements 
our world‑leading, controlled‑life 
masterbatch d
2
w (which converts 
plastic at the end of its useful life 
into a biodegradable material).
Our quality-control and anti-
counterfeiting d
2
Detector device 
is proving its worth, and our d
2
t 
masterbatch range of d
2
t Tag 
and T race technologies provide 
brand owners with the reassurance 
that their products can be 
identified as genuine.

w is a masterbatch system which, 
when included at the manufacturing 
stage, turns ordinary plastic at the end 
of its useful life into a material with a 
different molecular structure. At that 
stage it is no longer a plastic and has 
become a material which is inherently 
biodegradable in the open environment 
in the same way as a leaf.

Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report a significant uplift in all areas of the  
SEL business with revenues increasing by 46% to £7 .19 
million (2012: £4.94 million) with an operating loss before 
non-recurring items of just £159,000. 
This compares to an operating loss of 
£2.18 million in 2012. Our EBITDA loss 
before non-recurring items was £10,000 
compared to an EBITDA loss of £2.02 
million in 2012.
The SEL business performed well with an 
EBITDA profit of £0.22 million compared 
to a loss of £1.75 million in 2012. All of our 
major markets performed well compared 
to 2012, and more importantly, a number 
of very significant prospects continued 
to develop during the year. 
In 2013 sales of our d
2
w controlled-life 
plastic technology (which makes plastic 
oxo-biodegradable) grew by 46%. The 
main growth-drivers include legislation 
and Corporate Social Responsibility 
(“CSR”). We announced during the year 
that Pakistan had mandated the use of 
oxo-biodegradable technology for 
disposable plastic products. As seen 
elsewhere, sales have started slowly 
while grace periods are allowed and 
enforcement becomes effective. This 
has been seen in the UAE and parts of 
Africa where similar legislation is in place, 
and sales are now increasing.
Sales of d
2
w were made to our 
Distributors in 51 territories during the 
year and many of these sell through to 
other territories within their distribution 
agreements. Most territories do not yet 
have a legal requirement to use oxo-bio 
and sales are driven by CSR. Brand 
owners and manufacturers do not want 
to see their plastic products lying on the 
beach or in the open environment 
decades from now. The number of signed 
agreements with distributors increased 
from 72 to 76 during the year.
For our d
2
p anti-microbial product range, 
an exciting development during the year 
was the completion of a two year 
collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceutica 
(a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) and 
signature of an agreement with them, to 
bring an entirely new product to the 
market. d
2
p is included in plastic at the 
manufacturing stage and gives it anti-
microbial and anti-fungal properties. This 
development is significant for Symphony 
as it opens up major revenue possibilities 
where protection from bacteria and fungi 
is required. 
During the year we reduced our cost base 
by improving operational efficiencies, 
and a one-off charge of £76,000 was 
incurred during this process. Excluding 
non-recurring items, our cost base 
reduced from £4.21 million in 2012 to 
£3.53 million in 2013.
As previously stated, the Board’s 
strategy is to commercialise SRT. Having 
carefully considered the options, the 
initial steps will be to establish a 
separately funded entity with dedicated 
resources that is autonomous from the 
Group. As this will no longer form an 
integral part of the business, a full 
impairment charge of £494,000 has been 
made against all capitalised development 
costs in SRT. SRT has a novel process for 
efficiently recycling scrap tyres, and a 
patent has been applied for. The main 
drivers for this are legislation that 
requires more recycling, and prevents 
disposal of tyres in landfill or by burning in 
the open environment. The SRT process 
delivers high-value recycled raw 
materials which can be used again in 
quality manufacturing processes. 
Although the recycling business will no 
longer be an integral part of Symphony’s 
business, the Group will retain an interest 
in the new entity as a minority 
shareholder and as IP Licensor, from 
which it is expected that the Group will 
benefit going forward.
Our business strategy has been 
consistently in line with the UK 
Government’s policy of creating foreign 
exchange earnings through an export-
driven economy. The Group has 
developed a growing number of licensed 
and independent Distributors to market 
and sell its products. The business is not 
reliant on any one market or event, and the 
downside risk is therefore limited, but the 
upside is potentially unlimited. Over the 
years the Management have successfully 
expanded Symphony’s network, markets 
and products, and having laid these firm 
foundations we expect good levels of 
growth going forward.
I would like to thank the Board, the staff, 
and our Distributors for all their creative 
work in 2013, and we look forward to a 
very successful 2014.

Chief Executive’s review
I am pleased to report that in the year under review we 
successfully achieved many important changes for the 
business, in several fundamental areas. 
Our long-term business strategy is 
working, and the foundations established 
for a more rapid and stronger 
performance going forward. 
The business has continued to diversify 
into synergistic products, technical 
services and applications. For d
2
w our 
main revenue generating brand, a robust 
investment programme has been 
maintained which is helping to drive  
the business forward with expanding 
opportunities, markets and sales.  
Overall, product cost reduced and 
volumes increased.
Our d
2
p and d
2
t technologies are still  
in their infancy albeit some sales have 
resulted for d
2
p. We have maintained our 
investment programme which is based 
on several J/V projects with prospective  
end user customers. SEL has absorbed 
the cost for creating new IP formulations 
as well for work with independent 
laboratories and universities. These two 
technologies are synergistic with d
2
w  
as they can be supplied to the same 
customer base through the same 
distribution network, and therefore 
commercialisation is expected to be 
more rapid. 
The results for 2013 show an improved 
financial performance, with increasing 
revenues, higher margins and a lower 
overhead cost base. In addition, the main 
business drivers continued to improve, 
such as legislation, distributor-
performance and product expansion and 
improvement. A growing number of 
important opportunities, negotiations 
and product trials have commenced or 
continued in the period under review.
These opportunities extend across 
much of our global distribution  
network, and include the d
2
p, d
2
t  
and d
2
w product ranges.
Investment continued into the tyre 
recycling division, and opportunities for 
the commercial development phase 
moved further forward.
Our business model has been about 
investing for the future, and aiming for 
more than ordinary performance.

Trading results
Total Group revenues were higher at 
£7.19 million (2012: £4.94 million), and 
Group gross profit margins increased 
from 44% to 49%. These factors resulted 
in a 65% increase in the contribution from 
gross profit from £2.15 million in 2012 to 
£3.55 million in 2013. Gross margins were 
increased due to efficiencies and cost 
reductions in the supply chain.
Sales to the Americas increased from 
£2.11 million in 2012 to £3.41 million in 
2013 and represented 47% of 2013 
revenues (2012: 43%). Sales to UK and 
Europe increased from £1.38 million in 
2012 to £1.50 million in 2013 and 
represented 21% of 2013 revenues (2012: 
28%). Sales to the Rest of the World 
increased from £1.45 million in 2012 to 
£2.29 million in 2013 and represented 
32% of 2013 revenues (2012: 29%). 
Overheads before non-recurring items 
decreased by 16% to £3.53 million (2012: 
£4.21 million) which included a net 
write-back of provisions against 
receivables of £0.05 million (2012: 
provision of £0.39 million). Total staff 
costs were marginally lower at £2.01 
million (2012: £2.16 million).
In addition to these expenses, the Group 
incurred non-recurring costs of £570,000 
(2012: £nil). Of these costs £76,000 relate 
to expenditure to obtain ongoing cost 
efficiencies. This included closing down 
one of its UK facilities with the operation 
being transferred to Head Office. As 
mentioned above, £494,000 is an 
impairment provision against capitalised 
development costs for SRT and is 
detailed later in my review. 
Including the non-recurring items, the 
Group made an operating loss of £0.73 
million in 2013 compared to an operating 
loss of £2.18 million in 2012. This resulted 
in loss before tax of £0.78 million in 2013 
compared with a loss before tax of £2.20 
million in 2012. 
Excluding the non-recurring items, the 
Group made an EBITDA loss of £10,000 
(2012: loss £2.02 million) and an operating 
loss of £159,000 (2012: loss £2.18 million).
The Group reports a loss for the year  
of £0.71 million (2012: loss £2.22 million) 
with basic loss per share of 0.55 pence 
(2012: loss per share 1.74 pence). 
The business invests in scientific and 
technical excellence, and I believe that 
Symphony is now not only the market-
leader but also the technical leader of the 
industry. Development costs of £0.12 
million were capitalised in 2013 (2012: 
£0.36 million), and the net book value of 
capitalised development costs at the end 
of the year amounted to £0.91 million. 
Further development expenditure of 
£0.38 million (2012: £0.32 million) was 
charged directly to profit and loss. 
Capitalised development costs represent 
4% of expenses as detailed above.  
Within the total amount of £0.91 million 
capitalised to date, and less amortisation 
and impairment, are: £0.19 million relating 
to d
2
w products which have been 
developed and are being sold; and the 
balance of £0.72 million, relating to 
further environmental plastic applications 
still in development and where we believe 
significant revenues will be generated in 
the foreseeable future. As stated earlier, 
£0.49 million of capitalised development 
costs relating to SRT was impaired.
The Group’s primary selling currency is 
the US Dollar. The Group self-hedges 
where possible by purchasing in US 
Dollars and has banking facilities in place 
in order to secure rates going forward. As 
at 31 December 2013 the Group had a net 
balance of US Dollar assets totalling 
$0.56 million (2012: $0.32 million). 
Segmental analysis
The Group operates two business 
divisions which are classified as 
segments in the financial report, being 
the Plastics Division (Symphony 
Environmental Limited or “SEL ”) and  
the Recycling Technologies division 
(Symphony Recycling Limited or “SRT”). 
SEL includes d
2
w, d
2
p, d
2
t, and the 
d
2
Detector, be they additives or finished 
products. SEL, which currently generates 
all the Group revenues, saw sales 
increase by 46% during the year with 
total revenues increasing to £7.19 million 
(2012: £4.94 million) due to growth in new 
and established markets. This, together 
with the rise in gross margins and the 
reduction in overheads, resulted in an 
EBITDA profit of £0.22 million in 2013 
compared to a loss of £1.75 million in 2012. 
Within SEL no sales were made for d
2
t,  
but there were small initial sales for d
2
p.
SRT has no revenues to date and incurred 
expenditure of £0.81 million for the year, 
resulting in an EBITDA loss of the same 
amount (2012 expenditure and EBITDA 
loss: £0.27 million). 10 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Cashflow
The Group consumed £0.81 million  
from operations (2012: cash generated 
£0.45 million). This was due to higher 
receivables at the 2013 year-end 
resulting from increased sales, and a 
reduction in payables. The Group has a  
£1 million trade finance facility with HSBC 
Bank plc of which £0.58 million was drawn 
down as at 31 December 2013 (£0.22 
million as at 31 December 2012). The 
invoice-finance facility increased in line 
with receivables. In addition to these 
facilities, the Group borrowed a further 
£650,000 through unsecured loans.
The Group had cash in the bank of 
£130,000 at the year-end (2012: 
£336,000), plus trade receivables of £1.16 
million (2012: £545,000) and continues to 
work comfortably within its facilities.
Symphony Recycling Technologies
As previously stated, the Board’s 
strategy is to commercialise SRT. Having 
carefully considered the options, the 
initial steps will be to establish a newly 
incorporated company with a third-party 
into which the Group will inject the 
business of SRT through a licence 
agreement. The newly incorporated 
company will seek additional third-party 
financing and operate autonomously 
from the Group. As SRT will no longer 
form an integral part of the Group, a full 
impairment charge of £494,000 has been 
made which reflects the costs incurred  
to develop the recycling business to this 
stage. The Group will retain an interest as 
a minority shareholder in the new entity 
and as IP Licensor, from which it is 
expected that the Group will benefit 
going forward.
Outlook
In particular we have been notified of  
a new contract award through one of  
our distributors for d
2
w from a major 
supermarket group. The volumes 
indicated, but not yet verified, are 
significant. The delivery programme 
starts from April, with full roll-out before 
the 2014 year-end. This follows more than 
two years of development work which 
demonstrates the length of time it can 
take to close a major sale opportunity. 
In addition to the above, several other 
trials for d
2
w are in their final phase, and 
further updates will be communicated to 
the market in due course.
Positive changes in legislation are driving 
momentum for d
2
w in several markets, 
albeit timing and volumes are still 
unknown, but what is known is that our 
sales outlets continue to expand in 
number and volume.
Trials and negotiations for d
2
p and d
2
t are 
showing favourable results on several 
fronts and we have high expectations of 
seeing initial revenues commence over 
the next year. d
2
t is a suite of tagging and 
tracing technologies which will assist 
brand-owners and governments to 
reduce counterfeiting of products.
We believe that 2014 will show a further 
strengthening of our operating 
performance, and we look forward  
to the year ahead with confidence.

Innovation and technology
Symphony has its own laboratories 
and test facilities in the UK where our 
technical teams test, develop, and 
continuously improve our products. 
We continue to invest in R&D as we 
strongly believe that it is essential to 
answer the world’s health and 
environmental problems. Over the 
last year we have invested in new 
equipment and worked extensively 
with universities and scientific 
centres all over the world. 12 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Plastic is lightweight, flexible, 
strong, durable, heat sealable, 
impervious to moisture, 
recyclable and reusable, but 
whether by intent or accident, 
some plastic will always find 
its way into the land 
environment and oceans, 
creating an eyesore and 
polluting the environment.

w is Symphony’s core product, being 
successful in global markets for over 
15 years. It is a masterbatch which, when 
included at the manufacturing stage, 
turns ordinary plastic at the end of its 
useful life, in the presence of oxygen, 
into a material with a different 
molecular structure. At the end of that 
process it is no longer a plastic and has 
become a material which will biodegrade 
in the open environment in the same 
way as a leaf.
Recent developments
Over the years many governments  
have realised the potential of 
oxo-biodegradable plastic and its 
benefits for the environment. Every  
year we have positive outcomes, and 
more legislation comes into force  
to ban regular plastic and allow only 
oxo-biodegradable plastic to be used  
for shopping bags and other short-life 
plastic products. 
The U.A.E. was the first country to 
legislate and they have announced that 
as from 1 January 2014 they have 
extended the range of plastic products 
that must be oxo-biodegradable. 
Symphony has ESMA approval for U.A.E. 
which is mandatory for all suppliers. 
Pakistan announced similar legislation  
as from 1 April 2013. Countries in the 
Balkans have recognised the benefits  
of oxo-biodegradable plastic, as have 
several countries in Africa. In 2012 
Intertek published “A Life Cycle 
Assessment of Oxo-biodegrdable, 
Compostable and Conventional Bags”, 
which showed that the environmental 
credentials of d

of bio‑based and conventional plastics.  www.symphonyenvironmental.com

The Carbon Value
In the process of degradation, d
2
w allows 
the transfer of valuable carbon material 
to the eco-system.
Studies have demonstrated that one of 
the benefits of d
2
w oxo-biodegradable 
technology is that the carbon content of 
the plastic is ultimately shared with living 
organisms in the environment*.
Further studies have also shown that the 
carbon based organic materials developed 
as the result of the degradation 
mechanism are biodegradable and 
therefore absorbed by living organisms  
in the soil**.
This is not the case with conventional 
plastic that tends to capture the carbon 
for many decades or hydro-degradables 
that release the carbon immediately  
as CO

fungal contamination whilst preserving 
the aesthetic and functional properties of 
the products. The anti-fungal ingredient  
is used globally in a variety of applications.  
It acts to prevent growth of fungi, bacteria 
and algae that can cause discolouration, 
staining and odours, and which are a 
danger to human health. Produced as  
a masterbatch to be added at the 
manufacturing stage, it provides excellent

continued support of our customers, 
shareholders, communities and staff. 
We have established goals that the 
company and its people are trying to 
achieve daily. We understand that in 
today’s world it is difficult to be a 
responsible individual, and even more 
difficult to implement change towards 
a better future. It is essential to establish 
best practices, support individual 
ambitions, and strengthen the 
relationships with our communities 
around the world.

Principal activities and business review
The primary business activities of the Group are the development and supply of environmental plastic products to a global market, 
and the development of waste to value projects. The Group also supplies other flexible polythene and related products.
A review of the business is given in the Chairman’s Statement on page 4 together with the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 8 to 10. 
Future developments are summarised in the Outlook section of the Chief Executive’s Review on page 10.

performance indicators.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors have identified and continually monitor the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group. These may change over time 
as new risks emerge and others cease to be of concern. The principal risks of the Group are detailed below.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group sells products in many countries and so generates revenues in US Dollars and Euros. Foreign exchange rates fluctuate 
and, as such, assets created in foreign currencies are liable to constant revaluations into their Sterling equivalent. The Group 
mitigates this risk by purchasing, where practicable, in currencies to match revenues. The Group also has exchange facilities with its 
bank to use as and when appropriate.
Competition risk
The Group faces competition from suppliers of similar products which could affect revenues and/or gross margins. The Group 
mitigates this risk by employing a large number of distributors globally who can concentrate on any competition issues within their 
market, and also by differentiating the Group’s products by branding and marketing activities.
Raw material pricing and availability
The Group uses commodity and speciality materials in the make‑ up of its products. There is a risk of price volatility and material 
availability. The Group mitigates this risk by using more than one supplier of its products and continually researching separate supply 
alternatives for the materials used.

The loss for the year after taxation amounted to £707,000 (2012: loss £2,224,000).
The Directors have not recommended a dividend.
Research and development
The Group is involved in the research and development of environmental plastic products, and waste to value systems.
The Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year and their interests in the shares of the Company are shown in the Remuneration Report.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report, and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have 
elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs). The parent Company’s own financial statements continue to be prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable laws). Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs and profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs or UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that: 
• so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ Report 22 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Going concern
Management have prepared a cash flow forecast for the ensuing twelve months from the approval of the financial statements where 
a forecast increase in sales will lead to increased cash through the use of the invoice discounting facility. Operating results for the 
start of 2014 have been in line with these forecasts. The Group has continued to make significant investment into new product 
development and anticipates sales growth from the launch of some of these products in the forthcoming year. Having reviewed the 
cash flow forecasts and the available headroom within existing facilities the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient cash 
resources to meet debt obligations as they fall due. For these reasons, the Directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Corporate governance
The Group is committed to developing and adhering to high standards of corporate governance. As an AIM listed company, 
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc is not required to and does not apply the UK Corporate Governance Code as issued by 
the UK’s Listing Authority, however, it seeks to follow the principles of good governance as far as management believes it is practical 
for a Group of its size, nature and circumstances. 
Financial risk management policies
The Group’s financial risk management policies are detailed in note 3 to the financial statements.
Auditor
A resolution to appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditor for the ensuing year will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Notes to the Annual Report and Accounts
1 General information
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc (“the Company”) and subsidiaries (together “the Group”) develop and supply 
environmental plastic additives and products, and develop waste to value systems.
The Company, a public limited company, is the Group’s ultimate parent company. It is incorporated and domiciled in England (Company 
number 3676824). The address of its registered office is 6 Elstree Gate, Elstree Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, WD6 1JD, England. 
The Company’s shares are listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and as a level 1 ADR in New York.
2  Summary of significant accounting policies
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and also as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB).
The accounting policies have remained unchanged from the previous year.
Going concern
Management have prepared a cash flow forecast for the ensuing twelve months from the approval of the financial statements where 
a forecast increase in sales will lead to increased cash through the use of the invoice discounting facility. Operating results for the 
start of 2014 have been in line with these forecasts. The Group has continued to make significant investment into new product 
development and anticipates sales growth from the launch of some of these products in the forthcoming year. Having reviewed the 
cash flow forecasts and the available headroom within existing facilities the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient cash 
resources to meet debt obligations as they fall due. For these reasons, the Directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Business combinations completed prior to date of transition to IFRS
The Group has not restated business combinations which took place prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
Accordingly, the classification of the combination remains unchanged from that used under UK GAAP . The assets and liabilities are 
recognised at date of transition, and are measured using their United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) 
carrying amount.
Business combinations exemption
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiary undertakings.
The acquisition of Symphony Environmental Limited (formerly Symphony Plastics Limited) on 9 December 1999 was accounted for 
under merger accounting under UK GAAP and has been treated in this manner under IFRS as the business combination exemption 
has been adopted in these Annual Report and Accounts. The merger accounting method requires assets and liabilities to not be 
adjusted to fair value and the results of the subsidiary to be included as if it had always been part of the Group. Therefore, the results 
of the Group include both the results pre and post-acquisition.
Segment reporting
In identifying its operating segments, management generally follows the Group’s service lines which represent the main products 
and associated items provided by the Group.
There are currently two service lines, “Plastics” and “Recycling Technologies (Recycling Tech)”. The Plastics service line includes all 
activities in relation to the sale of plastic products and their associated items. This includes the sale of plastic degradable additives, 
finished goods, non-degradable products and d
2
Detectors. The Recycling Technologies segment includes all activities involved in 
the development of tyre and rubber recycling systems.
Each of the operating segments is managed separately as each of these service lines requires different technologies and other 
resources as well as marketing approaches. All inter-segments transfers are carried out at arm’s length prices.
The measurement policies the Group uses for segment reporting under IFRS 8 are the same as those used in its financial 
statements. Corporate assets which are not directly attributable to the business activities of any operating segment are not 
allocated to a segment.
Segment information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 for all periods presented. IFRS 8 only requires disclosure of 
segment information.
Revenue
Degradable and non-degradable goods, and associated products (plastics segment)
Revenue is stated at the fair value of the consideration receivable and excludes VAT and trade discounts. 30 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Annual Report and Accounts 
continued
2  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The Group’s revenue is from sale of goods and revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions have 
been satisfied:
a) ownership of the significant risks and rewards has been transferred to the buyer. This may be based upon shipment or delivery 
depending upon specific contractual terms, whereby the Group relies on INCOTERMs (a series of pre-defined commercial terms 
published by the International Chamber of Commerce) to assess this;
b) the amount of revenue can be measured effectively whereby the Group sells goods after receipt of confirmed orders;
c) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and
d) the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Non-recurring items
Expenditure is classified as non-recurring where the cost is considered to be material, one-off, and will not continue in future.
Intangible assets
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there is a market for 
the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in 
generating such benefits;
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and 
prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The nature of the Group’s activities in the  
field of development work renders some internally generated intangible assets unable to meet the above criteria at present.
Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset and is shown within administrative expenses and is included at the 
following rate:
d
2
w and other additives   – 15 years straight line.
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have 
been met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future 
technical problems at the time of recognition. Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date.
Trademarks
Trademarks represent the cost of registration and are carried at cost less amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of 
that asset as follows:
Trademarks    – 10 years straight line.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that 
asset as follows:
Plant and machinery   – 20% reducing balance.
Fixtures and fittings   – 25% reducing balance.
Fixtures and fittings Elstree Gate  – 10% straight line.
Motor vehicles    – 20% reducing balance.
Office equipment    – 25% straight line.
The residual value and useful economic lives are reconsidered annually.
Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-
generating unit level. Those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual 
assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. www.symphonyenvironmental.com

BUSINESS 
REVIEW
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in 
use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. All assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment 
loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. 
Cost is determined on the basis of purchase value on a first-in first-out basis.
Leased assets
In accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 17, the economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee 
if the lessee bears substantially all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset. The related asset is recognised 
at the time of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments 
plus incidental payments, if any, to be borne by the lessee. A corresponding amount is recognised as a finance leasing liability. The 
interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to profit or 
loss over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to profit or loss on a straight line 
basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Group. The pension costs charged against profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the 
accounting period.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Tax losses available to be carried forward as 
well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they 
are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in profit or loss, except where they either 
relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited 
directly to equity, or where they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income the deferred tax change is 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Financial assets
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets. Financial 
assets are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which they 
were acquired.
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
The Group currently has the following financial assets:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are categorised as loans and receivables. Trade receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Trade receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or 
reversal of impairment is recognised in profit or loss.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using the original effective 
interest rate. 32 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Annual Report and Accounts 
continued
2  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for 
inclusion in any of the other categories of financial assets. The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets are the equity investments 
in Bin Hilal LLC, American Plastic Technologies LLC and Oxobioplast Inc.
The equity investments in Bin Hilal LLC, American Plastic Technologies LLC and Oxobioplast Inc. are measured at cost less any 
impairment charges, as their fair values cannot currently be estimated reliably. Impairment charges are recognised in profit or loss.
An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least at each balance sheet date.
A financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the financial asset is 
transferred and that transfer qualifies for derecognition. A financial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash 
flows of the asset have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. A financial asset that is transferred qualifies for 
derecognition if the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains 
nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Finance lease receivables
Goods sold under finance leases are recognised as a sale on date of the finance lease agreement or if later, when substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the lessee. The capital element of future lessee obligations is included in 
assets in the statement of financial position.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are credited to profit and loss over the periods of the leases and represent a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals receivable under operating leases are credited to profit and loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables, bank overdraft, bank loans and other loans. These are 
classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair values net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are charged to profit and loss, where applicable, on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the period in which they arose.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled 
or expires.
Equity settled share-based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2007 are recognised 
in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where 
employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of the instrument granted are determined using the Black-
Scholes model. This fair value is appraised at the grant date. The fair value is charged to profit and loss between the date of issue and 
the date the share options vest with a corresponding credit taken to equity.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
• “Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares;
• “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue; and
• “Retained earnings” represents non distributed reserves. www.symphonyenvironmental.com

STATEMENTS
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing 
standards have been published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policy for the first period 
beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are 
expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have 
been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2015)
The IASB aims to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety with the replacement standard to 
be effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2015. IFRS 9 is the first part of Phase 1 of this project. The main phases are:
Phase 1: Classification and Measurement.
Phase 2: Impairment methodology.
Phase 3: Hedge accounting.
In addition, a separate project is dealing with derecognition. Management have yet to assess the impact that this amendment is 
likely to have on the financial statements of the Group. However, they do not expect to implement the amendments until all chapters 
of the IAS 39 replacement have been published and they can comprehensively assess the impact of all changes.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments and Presentation
Amendments to IAS 32 are effective for accounting period commencing 1 January 2014. This adds application guidance to address 
inconsistencies in applying IAS 32’s criteria for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities in the following two areas (1) the 
meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off” and (2) that some gross settlement systems may be considered 
equivalent to net settlement.
The Group’s management have yet to assess the impact of these new standards.
3  Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk. The 
Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained 
unchanged from previous years.

safely and profitability. Short-term flexibility is achieved through trade finance arrangements and overdrafts.
Having reviewed the maturity of financial liabilities and the forecast cash flows for the forthcoming twelve month period, the 
Directors believe that sufficient cash will be generated from trading operations to meet debt obligations as they fall due.
The maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 December 2013 is summarised as follows:

Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk where possible, but this is offset by the availability of trade finance 
arrangements which are transaction specific to meet liquidity needs and so have variable interest rate terms.
Sensitivities have been looked at in the range of an absolute rate increase of 5% or a decrease of 1% which enable an objective 
calculation to be made depending on any interest rate changes in the future. Any rate changes would be outside the control of 
the Company.

Currency risk
The Group operates in overseas markets and is subject to currency exposure on transactions undertaken during the year. The Group 
hedges the transactions where possible by buying goods and selling them in the same currency. The Group also has bank facilities 
available for hedging purposes.

Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying value of financial assets at the balance sheet date, summarised 
as follows:
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
Loans and receivables:
 Trade receivables 1,162 545
 Finance lease receivables 25 42
 Cash and cash equivalents 130 336
1,317 923
The credit risk associated with the cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-
rating agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from trade receivables. The seven largest customer balances at the end of 
the year make up 68% (2012: 77%) of the above trade receivables.
In order to manage credit risk the Directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history, third-party credit 
references and use of credit insurance. These limits are reviewed regularly.
The maturity of overdue debts is set out in note 16. During the period debts totalling £15,000 (2012: £88,000) were written off.
Capital requirements
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are monitored regularly to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity and its exposure to 
interest rate risk is mitigated. Management consider the capital of the Group comprises the share capital and interest bearing loans 
and borrowings as detailed in note 25. The Company satisfies the Companies Act 2006 requirement to hold £50,000 issued and 
authorised share capital. The rule that 25% must be paid up is also satisfied, by reference to note 18. 36 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

4  Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those actions.
In preparing these accounts the following areas were considered to involve significant judgements and estimates:
Capitalisation of development costs
Judgements and estimates relating to the capitalisation of development costs are detailed in note 2.
Recoverability of capitalised development cost
Judgements and estimates relating to capitalised development costs are detailed in note 12.
Share option judgements
Judgements and estimates relating to share-based payment charges are detailed in note 18.
Going concern
Judgements and estimates relating to going concern are detailed in note 2.
Bad debts
Provisions for bad debts are shown in note 16. Bad debt provisions are made when there is objective evidence of impairment. Where 
there is no provision then it is due to adequate credit insurance being in place, or cash has been received since the end of the year, or 
adequate information exists to support the recoverability of the debt.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
Judgements and estimates relating to a deferred tax asset are detailed in note 9a.
5  Segmental information
Management currently identifies the Group’s two service lines as operating segments as further described in note 2. These 
operating segments are monitored and strategic decisions are made on the basis of adjusted segment operating results including 
one-off items such as employee settlement costs.
The segmental results for the year ended 31 December 2013 are as follows:

The tax assessed for the year is different from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23% (2012: 24%). The change in the 
rate of standard corporation tax is due to the rates being changed by UK Government legislation. The differences in tax assessed 
against the standard rate of corporation tax are explained as follows:

Change in tax rate (171) (102)
Recognised in the year 97 41
Deferred income tax asset carried forward 1,142 1,216
The deferred tax asset relates to tax losses. There are tax losses of approximately £12,900,000 (2012: £12,900,000).
Of these tax losses, a negative deferred tax adjustment of £74,000 has been recognised in this year’s accounts (2012: negative 
£61,000) resulting in a total asset recognised of £1,142,000 (2012: £1,216,000). There is a total potential tax asset of £2,580,000 
using a rate of 20%, being the corporation tax rate UK Parliament has currently set.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on sensitising management forecasts to estimate the future taxable profits 
against which the losses will be relieved. Judgements have been made in respect to continuation of profitability going forward based 
upon current sales leads and market receptiveness to anticipated product launches. Other key estimates relate to foreign exchange 
rates. Sales made in early 2014 have been materially consistent with the forecasts supporting the recognition of the deferred 
tax asset.
10  Loss per share and dividends
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the (loss)/profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per 
share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed conversion of all dilutive options and warrants.
Reconciliations of the profit and weighted average numbers of shares used in the calculations are set out below:
Basic and diluted 2013 2012
Loss profit attributable to equity holders of the Company £(707,000) £(2,224,000)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 128,010,884 127,907,254
Basic loss per share (0.55) pence (1.74) pence

Total of weighted average shares together with dilutive effect of weighted options 128,010,884 127,907,954

No dividends were paid for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £nil). The effect of options in 2013 and 2012 are anti-dilutive.
17,626,500 options were outstanding at the end of the year which may become dilutive in future years. 
The loss before non-recurring items is £137,000 (2012: £2.22 million) and the basic and diluted loss per share using the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares of 128,010,884 (2012: 127,907,254) is 0.11 pence (2012: loss 1.74 pence). 40 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The Group relies on the continued development of its product range and in so doing is maintaining satisfactory goals in fulfilling its 
strategy (see Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review). After taking this into account together with the considerations 
of liquidity risk, see note 3, the Directors do not believe that there are any indicators of impairment other than detailed below.
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the policy set out in note 2. In capitalising these costs, judgements are made 
relating to ongoing feasibility and commerciality of products and systems being developed. In making these judgements, cashflow 
forecasts are used and these include significant estimates in respect to sales forecasts and future foreign exchange rates.
The Group has recognised an impairment charge of £494,000 in the year against an individual asset within the Recycling Tech 
division comprised of capitalised development costs. Following a strategic decision taken by the Directors to look to complete the 
development of the product outside of the Group, it was determined that the asset should be fully impaired. 42 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The Directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. There is a provision of 
£270,000 for the impairment of receivables (2012: £349,000). The maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date equates 
to the carrying value of trade receivables. Further disclosures are set out in note 3.
Included in trade receivables at 31 December 2013 are debtors which are past due but where no provision has been made as there 
has not been a change in the credit worthiness of these debtors and the amounts are considered recoverable. As of 31 December 
2013 trade receivables of £27,000 (2012: £134,000) were past due and not impaired. The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is 
as follows:
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
More than three months but less than six months 11 76
More than six months but not more than one year 16 58
27 134
Due to the different markets that the Group operates in, trade terms vary from cash on shipment of goods to payment under letter 
of credit due 120 days from shipment.
Trade receivables are secured against the facilities provided by the Group’s bankers.
Lease agreements in which the other party, as lessee, is to be regarded as the economic owner of the leased assets give rise to 
accounts receivable in the amount of the discounted future lease payments. These receivables amounted to £25,000 as of 
31 December 2013 (2012: £42,000).
The receivables under finance leases for 2013 are as follows:

The leases, which relate to d

Detectors, are typically cancellable after the first six months and run for a period of two years. The 
contracts include an option to purchase the leased equipment at any time between the initial six month period and the full term of 
two years. The purchase price lies between 33% and 75% of the gross investment at the inception of the lease, resulting from the 
timing the option to purchase is exercised.

24  Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant post balance sheet events.
25  Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on the face of 
the statement of financial position.
The Group’s goal in capital management is to maintain a capital-to-overall financing ratio of 1:1 to 1:3.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure, i.e. equity and financial liabilities. The Group 
manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics 
of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Capital for the reporting periods under review is summarised as follows:
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
Total equity 2,429 3,133
Cash and cash equivalents (130) (336)
Capital 2,299 2,797
Total equity 2,429 3,133
Borrowings 1,342 529
Overall financing 3,771 3,662
Capital-to-financing ratio 0.61 0.76
The ratio-decrease during 2013 is due to the increase in borrowings, being two new loans taken out during the year. The Group will 
aim to improve the capital-to-finance ratio during 2014 by reducing the level of borrowings by increasing sales as a result of 
strengthening the product portfolio in new and established markets.
26  Capital commitments
The Group had capital commitments totalling £nil at the end of the year (2012: £33,000).

Notes to the Company Balance Sheet
27  Principal accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP).
Fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that 
asset as follows:
Plant and machinery   – 20% reducing balance.
Fixtures and fittings   – 25% reducing balance.
Motor vehicles    – 20% reducing balance.
Office equipment    – 25% straight line.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have 
passed to the Company, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. 
The capital elements of future obligations under the leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the 
balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire 
purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pension costs
Company pensions are operated within the Group pension scheme. The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for 
employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group. The annual contributions payable in respect to 
the Company are charged to the profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more 
tax, with the following exception: deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more 
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can 
be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating profit.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less amounts written off.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its 
financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of the financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, 
those financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance 
costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is classified 
as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity. www.symphonyenvironmental.com

Equity-settled share-based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2007 are recognised 
in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where 
employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values are determined by reference to the fair value of the instrument 
granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions. 
The fair value is charged to the profit and loss account between the date of issue and the date the share options vest with a 
corresponding credit taken to shareholders’ funds.

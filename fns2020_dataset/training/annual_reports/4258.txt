WHAT MAKES US STAND OUT WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS DO WITH OUR CHIPS
THE POTENTIAL FOR SHORT -RANGE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
EXPANDS BY THE DAY AND OUR WORLD LEADING, SINGLE CHIP 
MODEMS ARE ALLOWING COMPANIES TO PRODUCE AMAZING PRODUCTS.
HERE ARE SOME ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING AREAS WHERE OUR
CHIPS PLAY A KEY ROLE:
SINGLE CHIP 
SOLUTIONS
KNOWING OUR
CUSTOMERS
EXPANDING OUR
PORTFOLIO
THE BEST
ARCHITECTURE
We operate in some of the
most competitive markets
in the world, where success
demands an extraordinary
degree of silicon integration,
and ease of use.
From the outset, CSR 
has focused on ease of
application, with software-
rich, single chip wireless
modem solutions. We also
provide example designs,
to help our customers
bring complete products
rapidly into production. 
As well as standard
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips,
we make variants with
additional functions that
reduce the cost, space
and time to bring new
products to market. 
Our on-chip DSP and 
our FM tuner , for example,
lower the cost of solutions
for markets such as
wireless stereo headsets,
and phones with built-in
radio receivers. 
The wireless industry moves
at an almost frantic pace,
and competition between
technologies is fierce.
Our gifted team of
designers has a long track
record in making the right
technology choices, and
the right implementation
decisions. We also place
great emphasis on
understanding the needs
and ambitions of our
clients, striving to build
partnerships that allow 
us to share and refine
‘product roadmaps’ – 
to our mutual benefit.
T o this end, we now have 
a presence in 10 countries,
plus a large network of
distributors, major R&D
centres in Europe 
and the USA and almost 
all our offices provide local
application support. 
Progress in short-range
wireless communication
technologies is catalysing
an incredible array of new
electronic products, and
CSR has evolved rapidly
from its Bluetooth roots 
to exploit these
opportunities. We have
combined Bluetooth with
an integrated FM receiver ,
launched a Wi-Fi chip,
announced that we will be
providing GPS to our
customers for less 
than $1, confirmed that 
we will be producing UWB 
(Ultra Wideband) and
announced our support 
for Wibree. 
These technologies 
open up many new
applications, and enhance
our growth potential
substantially. Our ability to
offer a broad range of
wireless technologies
helps us deal with the
world’s largest electronic
manufacturers, who seek
out broadly based suppliers
as trusted partners to help
bring world-beating
products to market.
CSR started life with a
great idea – an innovation
that allowed radio circuitry
to be manufactured using
low-cost CMOS
technology , enabling us 
to produce single-chip
solutions that combine
radio and digital circuitry .
From day one, our chips
were optimised for battery-
powered applications.
For product manufacturers,
this has meant major cost
savings, in terms of bill of
materials and the physical
space needed for new
functions. All, critically , for
only a marginal increase in
power consumption. 
Our focus on integrating as
much circuitry as possible
has now driven the
evolution of five generations
of Bluetooth, and two of
Wi-Fi chips. As a result
over the last few years, we
have solved a major
problem for portable
device designers, with
innovations that allow
multiple radios to co-exist.
HANDSETS MONO HEADSETS
MP3 PLAYERS
Mobile phones are the
universal portable device,
and manufacturers need
new wireless
technologies to help
them add new functions.
Bluetooth is well
established in this
market, and we’re now
working on ‘dual mode’
(cellular plus Wi-Fi)
phones.
Our share of this major
Bluetooth market
continues to grow, with
devices that improve
performance and lower
costs. This established
application is now being
joined by wireless
headsets for VoIP (Voice
over Internet Protocol)
communications.
The newest MP3 players
are going wire-free with
Bluetooth – for stereo
headphones – and some
have the ability to act as 
a headset and/or hands-
free accessory to a
phone as well.
PCs
Our exciting new solution
for the major market for
hands-free telephony
includes integrated
echo/noise cancellation.
And this is just the first of
many high volume
applications in the
automotive sector .
The percentage of
Notebook computers
that are being supplied
with Bluetooth is
considerable and
growing. The wireless 
link is used in many ways,
from mouse interfacing
and synchronisation with
cellphones, to audio
connections.
STEREO HEADSETS
2006 saw the
introduction of numerous
mobile phones that can
use Bluetooth to stream
stereo music wirelessly 
to headphones – our
stereo headphone
solution is the most
integrated and offers the
best audio quality for this
growing application.

21 “ 2006 WAS A RECORD YEAR. 
WE HA VE MAINT AINED OUR MARKET
SHARE AND OUR CLEAR LEADERSHIP
IN BLUETOOTH DESIGN WINS”
Changing the way the world connects
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006
CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
CSR delivered another record year
and strengthened its position in a fast
growing but developing marketplace.
Our revenues grew by 45% to 
$705 million, we shipped over 
250 million Bluetooth units and our
diluted earnings per share were up
32% to $0.82.
This was achieved despite the
performance for the second half
being tempered by over ordering
from a key account, followed by 
a market shift to lower end phones
(which do not yet contain the
Bluetooth capability) which reduced
anticipated sales. As a result, our
share price, having risen in the first
half of the year to around the £12.00
to £14.00 mark fell back in the
second half to the £6.50 level.
New markets, including the Bluetooth
market, exhibit high growth rates but
are also volatile. When growth is at 
the 100% level, as we have seen in
previous years for CSR, the volatility
element is masked as a consequence
of supply constraints. However, as
growth rates fall back to 40-50%, still
a high and very respectable growth
rate for any business, this volatility
becomes visible and the organisation
needs to develop appropriately.
We have now strengthened our key
account management, along with
improving the understanding of the
market dynamics within each of our
Business Segments to ensure we are
able to understand and anticipate
changes better.
Nevertheless 2006 was a record year.
We responded quickly to changes 
in market demand, began shipping
UniFi products to address new
emerging markets and maintained
our clear design win leadership in
Bluetooth at around 60%.
Bluetooth remains our core strength
and we believe that the market will
continue to be strong in 2007 and
beyond, driven by the global growth
in mobile telephony. Our ability to
offer handset manufacturers increased
functionality on a single chip will be
the cornerstone of our future success.
Furthermore, our recent acquisitions
of NordNav T echnologies AB and
Cambridge Positioning Systems
Limited secures our position in GPS
technology and will underpin our
desire to incorporate location finder
technology on the chip at a price far
below that currently on offer.
Of equal importance are applications
beyond the phone handset and
headset which show great promise.
Our recently announced partnership
with Sony, to provide wireless
technology for the PlayStation 3, 
is a landmark contract that extends
our reputation for winning important
business from category leaders.
STRENGTHENING 
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE
Within CSR, we have strengthened
the infrastructure as we move from 
a small business to a medium-sized
company and now to a major player
in the UK’ s technology sector.
Chief among recent developments 
is the establishment of Business
Segments which will bring sharper
focus to our markets, aligning resources
more accurately to opportunities.
ERP is now fully functioning across
the business, improving efficiency
and enabling us to track products
around the world from wafer
assembly plants in the Far East to
customers around the globe. We
have also strengthened our Human
Resources function, putting in place
several measures which will enable
us to follow best practice, including
the introduction of a company-wide
performance evaluation process.
CHANGES TO YOUR BOARD
John Scarisbrick is nearing completion
of his first year as Chief Executive
Officer. John has taken the reins 
with skill and determination, bringing
strong leadership to his position. 
We were delighted to announce 
the appointment of Sergio Giacoletto
in January 2007 as a non-executive
director. As Executive Vice-President
of Oracle Corporation Europe, Middle
East and Africa, Sergio gives your
Board the benefit of both proven
management ability and extensive
experience in high technology,
international markets.
I should also comment on my own
position. I joined the Board back 
in 2003 with the task of leading the
Company into the public arena with
our flotation in March 2004 and
06 | 07 building a new board to serve the
needs of a listed company and its new
shareholders. I have been proud and
honoured to serve CSR as Chairman
for the last three years. Over that time,
CSR has grown significantly from a
company with revenues of $68 million,
in 2003, to $705 million by 2006,
whilst building a strong global position
in the Bluetooth market and launching
into other wireless standards with
UniFi 802.11 a/b/g. Your Board 
has also built a solid base of good
governance but it is with these
demands in mind and the time
required that I am conscious that it 
is increasingly difficult to do full justice
to the demands which CSR has
rightfully placed upon my time. 
As a consequence I have decided
that I should stand down. I am
delighted that Ron Mackintosh, 
who has served on your Board since
2004 as a non-executive director,
more recently as Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee and who
knows the Company well, will become
Chairman on 2 May 2007. I know that
in his capable hands the Board will
further develop and give high quality
leadership to the Company.
LOOKING AHEAD
In 2006, CSR faced a number of
challenges, not least a rigorous testing
of our ability to respond to short-term
variations in demand from major
customers. I am pleased to report 
that our response was immediate and
aggressive. In addition, the flexibility
and speed of response from our
manufacturing partners, TSMC and
ASE was also critical and they receive
our wholehearted thanks.
I have no doubt that the wireless
sector will continue to grow and
present extensive opportunities to
CSR. The need to react to short-term
issues with agility is well understood
by your management team and the
lessons learnt during 2006 will prove
invaluable in the coming years.
I wish to thank all our stakeholders for
their support through the year . Without
the abilities and knowledge of our
manufacturing partners, suppliers
and customers we would not be able
to translate ideas into the innovative
applications that are transforming 
the lives of consumers worldwide.
Finally, the Board’ s sincere thanks go
to all our staff. Whether they are based
in Cambridge, Asia, Europe or the
USA, the determination of our people
to respond so well to the dynamics 
of the business is the single greatest
reason behind our continued success.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
2006 was a mixed year for CSR.
Clearly our share price performance
was disappointing. As previously
reported, we experienced lower than
anticipated demand for our headset
chips starting in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter we saw the
effects of a shift in mix to lower end
phones at our customers – which
further reduced demand below 
the level we expected. This was a
challenging change for the Company
to deal with. Importantly , these were
not losses of share, or even the rate
of design-wins – both of which
remained generally strong throughout
the period – rather they were shifts 
in end-consumer demand to which
we had to respond. I’m pleased to
say that CSR’ s management team
rose to these short term challenges
well, quickly reducing hiring,
expenses and the orders on our
foundry and assembly partners to
slow inventory growth. This effective,
disciplined approach when the going
gets tough served us well and is an
important organisational capability 
in the competitive and dynamic
global markets we serve. 
As well as responding to these 
shifts in our customers’ demand, 
CSR continued to make real progress
elsewhere. The Company grew diluted
EPS by 32%, revenues by 45%, while
winning more than 500 new Bluetooth
designs world-wide – around 60% of
the total – holding more than half the
unit market and shipping over 250
million Bluetooth chips. 
John Scarisbrick
Chief Executive Officer Our design-win market share
was around three times that of 
the nearest competitor and over 
ten times that of the number three
player. We maintained a strong new
product pipeline, starting extensive
sampling and design-in of our 5th
Generation Bluetooth devices and
began customer shipments of UniFi,
our first Wi-Fi solution.
We continued to build a strong
diversified chip business at CSR in
2006. On a common foundation of
superior radio, chip, software and
packaging technologies, we continued
to expand the depth and breadth of
the markets we serve. This model
has strong operational leverage. 
So, for example, the technologies we
develop for the mobile phone market
also form the basis of the Bluetooth
chips we use for our class-leading
headset devices as well as those
found in game console controllers 
like Sony’ s PlayStation 3, automotive
applications and music players etc. 
This model, of foundation technologies
serving multiple product market
spaces, allows us to tailor our offering
in each of these markets – for
instance to encourage attach rates 
in the competitive space of lower 
end mobile phones and to develop
the lowest cost system solutions for
high performance headsets while
effectively re-using much of our
foundation technology investment.
This forms a strong combination of
businesses serving diverse markets. 
The mobile phone market is the
largest we serve and, not surprisingly,
the most competitive. We won nearly
half of the GSM Bluetooth handset
design-wins in 2006 – down slightly
on 2005. The percentage of mobile
phones attaching Bluetooth grew to
over 35% for the year. In this market
we work with our customers to
engineer our devices to the right price
point to drive volume and attach rate,
especially into lower end phones.
This involves using the smallest chip
size, with lowest raw silicon cost
technology and using our least
expensive packaging – Wafer Level
Chip-Scale Packaging (WLCSP) – 
a technology in which CSR leads the
world. CSR’ s Bluetooth chips have
the highest performance radios, with
the smallest packages and are keenly
priced. T ogether with a strong new
product flow we expect a strong
performance in the handset market 
in 2007 – with attach rates reaching
between 40% – 50%.
Our new product pipeline focusing 
on the mobile phone opportunity 
was strengthened in 2006 by the
introduction of our 5th Generation
BlueCore5 FM part, a state of the art
Bluetooth chip integrated with a high
performance stereo radio. Multiple
design-ins are underway. We also
developed UniVox Mobile – a solution
to add VoIP into the GSM mobile
phone space. This will allow
subscribers using phones with this
technology to make low cost calls via
VoIP operators like Vonage or Skype
when near a supported Wi-Fi access
CSR’s vision is to change the way 
the world connects. We see a
specific opportunity here. For some
considerable time the ‘last mile’ the
last connection between, originally,
the traditional phone system and a
customer’s premises was the focus of
innovation and market growth. Digital
connections proliferated through
cable-modems, digital-subscriber-
lines (DSL), wireless telephony and
wireless local loop technologies. Now
we see that much of the growth and
opportunity, much of the value, in the
last mile is now behind us. Where the
real excitement, the real value
opportunity lies, is in the last 25
metres – inside homes and offices.
This is about connecting the last mile
broadband internet connection to a
multiplicity of devices for audio, video
and control. It might be a Bluetooth
headset allowing hands-free
connection to a mobile phone, or an
Internet Radio – classically styled as a
consumer friendly table top appliance
– tuning into an unlimited number 
of streaming audio sources. It could
include Bluetooth equipped TVs;
sensibly muting when an incoming
mobile phone call is detected, or long
lasting VoIP (Voice over Internet
Protocol) phones using the low cost
tariffs of the next generation of phone
service providers. These will be
demanding markets to create,
needing the highest quality radios,
with ultra-long battery life, extensive
software and systems support and 
all delivered on low cost platforms –
all CSR core strengths.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW

point. In January 2007 we acquired
NordNav T echnologies AB and
Cambridge Positioning Systems
Limited to add more products to this
pipeline. The software based eGPS
technology which CSR now has 
will allow the addition of the highest
performance location capability on
any CSR Bluetooth equipped phone
for less than one dollar. This is truly 
a breakthrough in price performance
and will herald an era of ubiquitous
location awareness in the coming
years. The flow of compelling new
CSR wireless devices for the handset
market will continue beyond these
technologies. We’ve announced
support for Wi-Fi in combination with
Bluetooth to be in a future variant –
most likely when the uptake of 
Wi-Fi in phones moves from its
current low levels. We’ll also add
Wibree over time. Wibree is entirely
complementary to our Bluetooth
technology and will extend the
pervasion of wireless connectivity
into completely new areas. Ultra
Wideband (UWB) is also on our
roadmap for the mobile phone
market. UWB will allow the transfer 
of photos, videos or music files at 
the highest speeds ever achieved
over a metre or so distance – and
open up new business opportunities
for CSR in this space. 
CSR’s business model is to take
these foundation technologies and
re-use them across a diverse range 
of other markets – adding substantial
revenue opportunities in the process.
This diversity is already very evident –
with around 55% of CSR’ s 2006
revenue being beyond the mobile
phone market in the headset, PC,
Automotive and Consumer spaces.
Beyond the handset market, 
we continued to make progress in 
the Bluetooth headset marketplace
where we won more than four times
the design-wins of all our competitors
combined. In this market we engineer
complete solutions based on our
foundation Bluetooth technology –
ensuring that the headset
manufacturer has the lowest possible
cost for all the parts required to make
a headset. In this we have a distinct
advantage – since we are able to
include important functions like the
battery charger circuits right on the
same chip as the Bluetooth device. 
Again, new product introductions
characterised our efforts in this
market with the introduction of our
5th Generation Bluetooth technology
in a headset variant– adding a
powerful Digital Signal Processor
(DSP) to the Bluetooth radio chip. 
In premium headsets, this DSP can
be used to run special CSR software
to reduce echo and background
noise. T o further differentiate CSR’ s
product offering, we also built a
network of third party DSP software
suppliers to add further noise
cancellation, text to speech and
other functions to CSR’ s headset
solutions. We are also introducing
products to support the low cost
mono headset market, specifically
BlueVox QFN – a complete reference
design that supports the highest
audio quality levels that can be built
by OEMs with an electronic bill of
materials of less than $6. We expect
entry level Bluetooth headsets to
thrive in 2007 at the resultant
attractive resale price points. 
Nowhere exemplifies the pervasion 
of wireless connectivity, however,
more than our non-cellular business
(PC, Automotive and Consumer). In
2006, the range of CSR Bluetooth
enabled products in these markets
was quite remarkable – ranging from
the controllers in Sony’ s PlayStation 3
game console, to T omT om, Garmin
and other Personal Navigation
Devices, Samsung’ s world-first
Bluetooth enabled Yepp T9 MP3
music player and a myriad of other
devices. The revenue contribution
from these and other design-wins 
in 2006 was significant – and will
grow considerably in 2007. The pace
of pervasion is exciting – with new
and novel applications frequently
announced. Recently the first TV 
with integrated Bluetooth was
qualified by Samsung, and the
leaders in the Voice-over-Wi-Fi 
and DECT cordless phone spaces; Accton and SunCorp announced
adoption of CSR’ s UniVox VoIP
technology for their product 
ranges – opening completely new
markets for CSR. 
CREATING THE RIGHT 
WORKING ENVIRONMENT
As you can see from the map on
pages 4 and 5, we now operate 
in ten countries. However, 
although our locations are diverse,
CSR adopts a truly global approach
to business and its customers. 
You will often find engineers from 
labs in one geography working 
to help a customer in a completely
different location, as it is routine to
have complete solution development
spread across a world-wide team
collaborating together. 
At the end of 2006, CSR’ s headcount
had increased to 923 from 688 a year
earlier. About 70% of our employees
have technical qualifications – and
some 60% are employed in new
product research and development. 
We focus on attracting the most
talented people – and then on creating
an environment where the best people
can do their best work. Committed,
motivated and given the flexibility to
perform, our teams act quickly and
execute at speed. Above all else, 
the results outlined in this report 
bear testament to the dedication 
and expertise of our people.
I would also like to take this
opportunity to extend my thanks 
to John Whybrow, our Chairman,
who will be stepping down at our
forthcoming AGM. John has been 
an excellent leader of the Board 
and has successfully overseen a
sustained period of growth for the
Company . Ron Mackintosh, who has
served as a non-executive director 
of CSR since 2004, will succeed
John as Chairman. Ron is also hugely
experienced and I am confident will
continue the high quality leadership
of the Board to which we have
become accustomed.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
In 2007 we expect the Bluetooth
market to continue to grow driven 
by increasing attach rates in mobile
phones, pull through of headsets 
and the strong growth of Bluetooth
beyond the mobile phone in
computing, automotive, gaming 
and music devices. Building upon 
its investments for the mobile phone
segment, CSR will continue to
diversify into associated markets.
As a result of the extraordinary 
talent in CSR throughout the world,
we continue to develop technologies
that are changing the way the 
world connects.  Leveraging these
leadership foundation technologies
into diverse products and markets,
we are developing the products 
and solutions to help our customers
create the wireless products that
consumers want. We will continue 
to do this in 2007, growing and
diversifying CSR’ s business.

WE ARE NUMBER 1 IN OUR MARKET
Ours is the most advanced technology
available and, not surprisingly , it lies at 
the heart of many of the world’ s most
innovative wireless products.
We work with the market leaders 
in every category in which we operate. 
From handsets and headsets to MP3
players, game consoles, satellite navigation
systems, PCs and cars, CSR technology
underpins the futures of the most
demanding manufacturers.
Our customers’ leadership depends 
on our leadership. rate to rise to between 40% – 50% 
in 2007 as low end phones start 
to incorporate Bluetooth.
HEADSETS
During 2006, a total of 100 mono
headsets were Bluetooth qualified. 
Of these, we won 90, an impressive
90% of all mono headsets qualified. 
In the same period, stereo headset
qualifications numbered 57, with CSR
winning 44, or 77%. Overall, we
succeeded in securing 84% of all
headset design wins during the year . 
Manufacturers and consumers simply
prefer the CSR experience – and it’ s
an experience which is enhanced by
our close working relationship with
innovative companies through our
Extension Partner Programme. The
Programme has enabled us to add
‘best-of-breed’ performance to our
existing capabilities in many key areas
including; speech recognition; text to
speech and speech to text; noise
suppression and echo cancellation;
and HiFi quality at ‘LoFi’ prices.
In early 2007 we produced a 
reference design for low cost mono
headsets. By reducing the electronic
bill of materials to less than $6,
we expect the selling price of mono
headsets to fall and for consumer
adoption to increase.
PC, AUTOMOTIVE AND CONSUMER
Our market share in the PC,
Automotive and Consumer sectors 
is around 70% and provides diversity
beyond our traditional handset and
headset businesses.
PC opportunities continue to grow 
fast with new wireless applications
rapidly becoming established, 
such as streaming audio to headsets
and transferring pictures between 
the PC and Bluetooth-enabled
cameras, displays and printers. 
In MP3 players, we were proud to 
be chosen by Samsung as partners
for one of the first wireless MP3 players,
the innovative Y epp T9 player .
The market for game console 
and controller chips is well over 
100 million units per year and Sony,
the category leader , specified CSR 
for the ground-breaking new
PlayStation 3. Using our proprietary
FastStream low latency technology ,
PlayStation 3 gamers experience 
the ultimate in response times. 
For example, on a soccer simulation
game, a virtual striker will shoot as
soon as the appropriate button is
pressed, with none of the delayed
actions that can be experienced in
other wireless systems. The result? 
A better gaming experience for 
our customers’ customers.
In Automotive, in-car communications
for Audi, BMW and Saab, among
others, rely on CSR technology .
2006 saw excellent growth in 
both the built-in and after markets,
largely driven by interest in the 
CSR-equipped satellite navigation
systems offered by T omT om in 
Europe and Garmin in the USA.
WORKING WITH THE BEST
We hate wires. Consumers hate
wires. So we work with the leading
companies, on many of the most
exciting developments in consumer
electronics, to take the world wire-free.
As you can see on these pages, 
the category leaders trust CSR
technology. Our client list includes:
—Nokia – in handsets
—Motorola – in headsets
—Sony – in gaming
—Dell – in PCs
—TomT om and Garmin – 
in satellite navigation
HANDSETS
The handset market continues 
to drive our business.
Competition is most active in the
handset market. However , although
the chip pricing environment remains
competitive, the differentiation and
quality of the chip manufacturers’
product offering is of high importance
to the handset manufacturer in its
choice of chip supplier . Nearly half 
of all Bluetooth GSM handsets qualified
during the year incorporated our chips
and we continued to supply four of 
the top six mobile manufacturers.
The attach rate – the percentage 
of handsets sold which feature
Bluetooth technology – rose again 
in 2006. It has now increased from
14% in 2004 to 25% in 2005 to over
35% in 2006. We expect the attach

WE HAVE A KEENER COMPETITIVE EDGE
We help our customers bring new 
and exciting products to market.
But why are ours the chips 
of choice? Why do category leaders
such as Nokia, Motorola, Sony, 
Dell, BMW and many more choose 
to build relationships with CSR above
all others?
One reason is because we – like they –
are leaders. With a history that extends
back to the first days of Bluetooth, 
we pioneered many of the industry
standards. We are also technologists
who understand what can be 
achieved and are inspired and
energised by the challenge. 
But the primary reason concerns the
technical excellence of our products…  18 | 19
EXPLOITING OUR ADVANTAGE
The world’ s leading manufacturers
trust CSR to consistently deliver
competitive advantage in key areas:
SIZE
Size matters. With consumers
demanding greater capability from
smaller devices, size is a critical
commercial battleground – particularly
in sectors such as headsets and
handsets. CSR is the industry’ s
pioneer, the first company to integrate
all wireless technology on a single chip,
and our current target is to reduce the
size of a thin die from 670 um to a
maximum of 400 um. In 2006, we put
FM radio on the chip and we’re now
helping customers incorporate GPS
technology in their devices.
COST
In our industry, cost is closely
associated with size. Essentially , 
our costs are lower because we
generate more chips from a wafer,
driving greater value from our
investment. The size of chip is the
single biggest determinant of cost
and we design smaller. Secondly, 
we integrate as many technologies
as possible onto the chip in order 
to provide greater design freedom
and make it less expensive for
customers to design and build
around our products. Finally,
because CSR chips provide more
reliable connections, we can deliver
lower lifetime costs to manufacturers.
POWER CONSUMPTION
Traditionally, capabilities such as
Bluetooth can quickly drain batteries.
Not so with CSR chips. In terms of
power consumption, our products
are equal to or better than the
competition, typically using 20% 
to 50% less power. For example a
headset based on CSR technology
can remain on standby yet use only
one millionth of the power required 
by a 60W light bulb. This means 
that our manufacturers can specify
less powerful – and therefore smaller,
lighter and less costly – batteries,
which enables them to offer more
attractive products and greater
value to consumers. 
CO-EXISTENCE
The more wireless technologies
incorporated into a handset, 
the greater the potential for
communication problems.
Understandably, consumers – 
and therefore manufacturers – 
want both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in 
a phone because each is a perfect
solution to a different communication
requirement. For example, they 
may want to download video by 
Wi-Fi while talking via Bluetooth 
or stream video from a home 
library through Wi-Fi and listen to 
the soundtrack through Bluetooth. 
But Wi-Fi and Bluetooth operate 
on the same frequency. CSR’s
capabilities in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
mean that, using our solutions, 
both can be used simultaneously ,
with no noticeable degradation. 
INTEROPERABILITY
In a wireless world, communication 
is everything. Our technology is
proven both in the laboratory and 
in the marketplace. In the laboratory , 
we have developed hundreds 
of workarounds. In fact our
Interoperability T est Library is 
the largest in the industry and has
dealt with over 10,000 different
interoperability issues. Manufacturers
know that with CSR, the connection
will work. Phones will work with
headsets which will work with 
MP3 players which will work 
with PCs which will work with
keyboards and so on. 
EASE OF DESIGN
We provide market-leading chips 
and the software that makes them
work. CSR is effectively a ‘one-stop-
shop’, with chips and software –
such as BlueCore – supplied together .
Interoperability is built into the chip,
so it doesn’t have to be designed 
into the device itself.
FUNCTIONALITY
We help manufacturers seize market
opportunities by constantly looking 
to build new functions into our
design. TV capability, GPS location
technology, FM radio… we go further
than others to help our customers
win new customers.

WE CONTINUE TO MEET CONSUMER DEMANDS
The world is going wireless. This isn’t just 
a prediction or a minor trend – it is a fact 
of business life in consumer electronics.
Whatever new products or applications 
are developed to meet emerging consumer
demands, there will be a key role for CSR
technology to play in transforming great 
ideas into practical reality . 22 | 23
TOMORROW
Bluetooth is the gold standard of
wireless communication and CSR’ s
understanding of the technology 
and dedication to its long-term
development has changed the way 
the world connects.
We remain committed to Bluetooth –
at the same time, we will continue to
invest resources to explore the
potential of other wireless technologies
in order to meet the demands of
manufacturers.
On these pages we feature a snapshot
of some of the exciting technologies
and applications that are likely to drive
the consumer electronics marketplace
in the coming years.
WI-FI AND WIRELESS VOIP
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are different, 
but they complement each other well.
Whereas Bluetooth is better at 
ad-hoc connections, Wi-Fi is more
suited to an office environment such
as downloading emails, transferring
MP3 files, carrying wireless VoIP
telephone calls and so on. Although
Wi-Fi is currently most closely
associated with PCs and laptops 
as the technology behind wireless
internet, in future it will form the heart
of new telephony systems. It will be
possible to provide a seamless link
from mobile to VoIP so consumers
can use a single phone at home, in
the car and at work.
Our UniFi chip provides low power,
small size and high performance Wi-Fi
capabilities. Our UniVox phone design
reduces the manufacturing cost of a
wireless VoIP phone to an electronic
bill of materials from $24 and increases
the battery life to over 20 hours on a
call and over 400 hours waiting for a
call. Just as important, it offers the
best Bluetooth co-existence, so
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi can sit alongside
each other in the same product.
GPS
The early application for GPS
technology in phones was in response
to ‘911’ legislation in the US. This
required location-finder capability 
to be built into handsets so that the
emergency services could identify 
the location of a caller . For the future,
GPS has many interesting, highly
creative possibilities. 
In terms of its traditional location-finder
capability , a handset with a CSR chip
incorporating GPS could be used 
for satellite navigation, helping
consumers to find the nearest coffee
shop, petrol station or hotel. Beyond
that, businesses could use GPS to
communicate to potential customers
in particular locations. For example, 
a supermarket could text time-
sensitive special offers to shoppers
within a certain radius of the store.
UL TRA WIDEBAND
UWB increases the speed of data
transmission that Bluetooth can
handle. We aim to bring together the
best of Bluetooth and the best of UWB
by integrating both onto a single chip.
A key issue that we will resolve is the
comparatively heavy power
consumption of UWB.
Our Bluetooth chips are already 
faster than our competitors’ products.
With UWB, that speed will increase 
by up to a hundred times, dramatically
extending the chip’ s possibilities. 
For example, UWB-based Bluetooth
will be able to upload and download
vast multimedia files and handle
tasks such as synchronising Outlook
diaries between the PC and the
phone with ease.
WIBREE
Developed by Nokia, Wibree is an
extension to Bluetooth that opens 
up new ways in which Bluetooth 
can be used. How? Because 
Wibree offers greatly reduced 
power consumption and so can be
incorporated in small devices that 
only require button batteries. 
As part of the Wibree consortium, 
we are working to incorporate Wibree
technology on Bluetooth chips. In the
future, a simple mobile phone handset
could act as a remote control device
for central heating, TV , burglar alarm
system and many more. It sounds
complex – but with our help it will
become part of everyday life. 
WIRELESS PCs
A key focus during 2006 was our work
with Dell and Microsoft to successfully
develop the world’ s first Windows PC
to ship with only a wireless keyboard

continued and mouse. This has not been
possible in the past because a wired
keyboard and mouse have been
necessary in order to install any
wireless peripheral. 
The Dell XPS M2010 is now in
production and we are confident 
that in the future all PCs will ship 
with wireless peripherals.
THE CSR VISION
The move to wireless technology 
is unstoppable. Consumers want
wireless applications, manufacturers
are developing new solutions that
meet those demands – and we are
committed to remaining right at the
front of the wireless industry .
Respected as the industry pioneer,
recognised as the catalyst for an 
evolving marketplace and acknowledged
as the leading voice in wireless
communications, we have become
established as a broader supplier of
silicon into the phone. New, consumer-
driven features such as GPS location-
finder capability are being brought to
market as a direct result of our design
team’s know-how and capabilities.
Looking ahead, we have the vision 
and the expertise to bring a new range
of wireless technologies to market. Our
portfolio and roadmap encompasses 
a broad spectrum of technologies for
personal and local area networking. 
In every case – with every enhanced
feature or new innovation we introduce
– we become an increasingly valuable
partner for the most demanding OEM
and ODM customers.
The outlook for CSR remains 
excellent as we continue to offer
complete systems solutions for
wireless applications including
software. Our future is rich with promise
and we are poised to reap the rewards
of market leadership as our industry
pushes back the boundaries of
wireless communication.
“As the leader in headsets for business users, 
we understand the importance of delivering 
innovative products quickly. Partnering with CSR on 
the Voice Dongle solution enabled Plantronics to rapidly
develop a fully interoperability tested VoIP product.”

BUSINESS REVIEW
CSR plc is the holding company 
of an international group of
companies with its headquarters 
in Cambridge, UK. CSR plc listed 
on the London Stock Exchange 
in March 2004 and is a constituent 
of the FTSE 250 Index. 
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
CSR designs and supplies single 
chip wireless devices. Through 
its BlueCore range of products, 
CSR is the market leader in the 
supply of single chip solutions for 
Bluetooth wireless voice and data
communications, providing low 
cost, high performance integrated
circuits (IC’ s or silicon chips) to
manufacturers of a wide range of
electronic devices including mobile
phones, headsets, laptop PC’ s,
personal digital assistants (PDA’ s), 
PC peripherals, games consoles,
stereo headphones, MP3 players
and automotive based systems. 
We supply over 450 end customers
including Apple, Dell, LG, Motorola,
NEC, Nokia, Panasonic, RIM,
Samsung, Sharp, Sony, TomTom 
and T oshiba. CSR is also diversifying
beyond Bluetooth, namely Wi-Fi, 
FM, UWB (Ultra Wideband), Wibree
and with the recently announced
acquisitions, Global Positioning
Systems (GPS).
CSR is organised around its 
research and development team 
of 609 staff as at the year end (2005:
454). The majority of these are based
in Cambridge, UK, with teams in
Aalborg, Denmark; Lund, Sweden;
Dallas and Detroit in the US; Sophia
Antipolis, France and Bangalore,
India. Our sales and marketing
function is centred in Cambridge, 
UK with sales liaison offices in Dallas,
in the US; T aipei, T aiwan; Seoul,
South Korea; T okyo, Japan and our
new office in Shanghai, China which
opened in November 2006.
CSR is a ‘fabless’ semiconductor
company. All wafer fabrication,
assembly and test, and shipping 
is subcontracted to Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC) and Advanced
Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) 
in T aiwan. Manufacturing is currently
located principally in T aiwan to
minimise production cycle time 
and inventory , simplify logistics 
and to take advantage of a common
language and culture. During 2006,
CSR expanded the number of 
TSMC wafer fabrication sites it uses
to four different sites in T aiwan and 
a fifth in the USA. Similarly, we plan 
to qualify an assembly and test site
outside T aiwan in 2007. By increasing
sourcing options, we are better
placed to deal with any unplanned
interruptions at any single location, 
as well as having access to additional
capacity to respond to increases 
in demand. 
24 | 25 providing technical support to
product developers to encourage
them to design products using CSR’ s
IC’ s. For this purpose, we provide a
range of development kits and tools.
STRATEGY
CSR’ s objective is to be the 
supplier of choice of single chip
solutions for wireless voice and data
communications. Key elements of
our strategy include:
Bluetooth in Handsets
CSR’ s core strength is in mobile
handsets and our strategy is to
maintain our position in this market.
We believe we are well positioned 
to develop hardware and software
solutions to address the existing 
and future applications for Bluetooth
in handsets and also in the wireless
headsets with which they connect.
We plan to continue to offer
increased software content to 
enable new products to provide
complete solutions for customers.
The software also improves the
robustness and flexibility of our
solutions and helps to distinguish
them from competing offerings. 
CSR will continue to increase the
functionality of our IC’ s and develop 
on-chip application software. 
CSR will then be able to further 
reduce the total cost of our complete
Bluetooth system to our OEM and
ODM customers.
Beyond Bluetooth in Handsets
We also plan to continue to add 
value beyond Bluetooth, in the
mobile phone market. We believe 
our single chip, radio frequency and
software design expertise, combined
with our knowledge of integrating
wireless solutions with customers’
products, positions us well to pursue
opportunities for solutions in new and
developing wireless communications
standards. Focussed on top tier and
innovative ODM’ s, we are developing
products that incorporate Bluetooth
and other valuable features. These
add value by adding functionality to
the Bluetooth chip to do things along
with Bluetooth. We are already doing
this with FM, as well as our UniFi chip
for SIP/IMS/VCC (session initiation
protocol/ IP multi-media subsystem/
voice call continuity) and fixed mobile
converged phones and hence
extending the range of our products.
In addition we are working on UWB,
for very high speed downloads;
Wibree and with our recent
acquisitions GPS.
Beyond Handsets
The third element of our strategy is to
take the products and technologies
we have developed for handsets 
and develop, at relatively low cost,
derivatives for other marketplaces.
We are already doing this in the PC
sector, as well as games consoles,
stereo headphones, MP3 players
and automotive based systems.
We have developed excellent
relationships at all levels with TSMC
and ASE. This has served us well 
and provided us with leading-edge
manufacturing technology and 
strong support in satisfying capacity
requirements and controlling costs.
Using this production process has
enabled CSR to successfully ship
over 500 million Bluetooth single 
chip devices, lifetime to date, whilst
aggressive cost management has
maintained margins as selling prices
come down. This encourages adoption
of our technology in the products 
of current and potential customers.
CSR sells to Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEM’ s) and Original
Design Manufacturers (ODM’s),
principally through our own direct
sales force and, in North America,
through sales representatives. 
We also market our IC’ s through 
a network of distributors. 
Our marketing efforts are supported
by a team of applications engineers
who provide technical support and
assistance to existing and potential
customers in designing, testing and
qualifying systems that incorporate
our products. 
This support is generally provided
without charge to customers who
have the potential to purchase large
volumes of products. An important
part of our marketing effort involves

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT
The markets in which CSR operates
are intensely competitive and are
characterised by rapid technological
change, evolving industry standards
and declining average selling prices.
CSR’ s primary competition includes
Broadcom and T exas Instruments.
We provide our customers with 
a number of benefits ranging from
small size, low cost and low power
usage to excellent co-existence,
interoperability, design and
functionality. All these areas are
discussed in more detail on pages 
18 to 19.
OPERATING REVIEW
The Bluetooth market grew strongly
in 2006 to over half a billion units 
from between 310 and 320 million 
in 2005 (2005: source IMS). 
This considerable growth was 
driven by increased attach rates in
mobile phones with the associated
pull through of headsets and more
significant shipments into
applications beyond the mobile
phone including PCs, automotive
and consumer devices.
OPERATIONAL STATUS AND 
DESIGN WINS IN 2006
CSR has maintained its leading
position in the Bluetooth market, 
with the majority of design wins 
listed on the Bluetooth website 
in 2006. CSR defines a design win 
as an end product or module listed
on the Bluetooth.com website
identifying one of CSR’ s BlueCore
parts as the Bluetooth solution being
used. As a rule these design wins 
will be an indicator of future revenue
although some design wins are for
products, such as mobile phones,
which sell in more volume than 
others whilst some listed qualified
products never go to production.
In total, CSR won over 530 new
designs in 2006 (2005: 460) of 
which 49% (2005: 59%) were in the
cellular market (mobile phones and
headsets.) CSR’ s strong position 
with the top tier mobile phone
manufacturers continued with
notable wins with LG, Nokia,
Motorola and Samsung. 
Revenue increased for the sixth
consecutive year to $704.7 million 
and represented a 45% increase 
on 2005 revenue ($486.5 million). 
Cellular
CSR believes attach rates of
Bluetooth into mobile phones grew 
to over 35% in 2006 from 25% in
2005. CSR expects the mobile
phone attach rate to increase to
between 40% and 50% in 2007. 
As widely reported,  the second half 
of 2006 saw a product mix shift away
from mid and high end handsets
which contain Bluetooth towards
lower end handsets which do not yet
contain Bluetooth. The majority of
new Bluetooth product qualifications
in the handset segment were for mid
and high end handsets. Whilst the
Bluetooth attach rate for low end
handsets remains relatively low, we
expect Bluetooth attach rates in the
low end to increase. BlueCore5 FM,
CSR’ s integrated single chip
Bluetooth with a high performance
FM stereo tuner, was qualified in
November 2006. Recent significant
design-in activity for BlueCore5 FM
(customer intent, supported by
engineering programmes, to use
CSR’s Bluetooth products) give 
CSR confidence that it is well placed
to benefit from an increase in attach
rates in low end phones.
In 2006, CSR achieved 122 of the 
362 product qualifications in the
mobile phone segment. CSR once
again performed strongly with top 
tier OEM’ s in the higher volume 
GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications) handsets with 
99 of the 226 GSM mobile phone
qualifications during 2006, which 
is 44% of all GSM mobile phone
qualifications. In the lower volume
CDMA handsets CSR has a low
market share as CDMA related
qualifications continued to be in
conjunction with Qualcomm for 
the analogue/RF only portion of 
26 | 27
BUSINESS REVIEW 
continued to show strong growth over the
coming years, as more phones
incorporate MP3 players and more
MP3 players include Bluetooth. In the
stereo headset market, CSR secured
77% (2005: 69%) of the available
designs for customers such as
Motorola, Nokia, Jabra and Samsung.
CSR has a strong new product
pipeline for the mobile phone market.
In addition to the best performing
BC5 FM part, CSR has announced 
a Bluetooth only ROM variant. 
In addition design activity for UniFi,
the industry’ s first single chip
IEEE802.11a/b/g embedded
solution, continues to be strong. 
For the VoIP market, CSR has
launched the UniVox reference design,
which allows for a voice-over-Wi-Fi
cordless phone to be produced for
an electronic bill of materials from 
as low as $24. In February 2007 , 
CSR launched UniVox Mobile which
provides a simple, low cost strategy
for developing dual mode handsets.
The dual mode handset employs Wi-
Fi for indoor connectivity via access
points but is also integrated with
normal cellular connectivity for
outdoor mobile calls. CSR’ s UniVox
Mobile provides a complete
subsystem to add dual mode 
wireless VoIP to GSM/ GPRS phones
for the mass global market at the
lowest cost and with the lowest
power consumption. CSR has 
been awarded significant design 
wins with Accton and SunCorp for
phones based on the UniVox
reference design. The first UniFi
silicon was delivered to customers 
in 2006. As we had expected, UniFi
revenues in 2006 were modest and
are expected to become more
significant in 2007.
CSR has also launched its ground
breaking E5000 software GPS
solution for mobile phones. With
technology coming from the NordNav
T echnologies AB and Cambridge
Positioning Systems Limited
acquisitions, this will allow the highest
performance location technology 
to be integrated on a CSR equipped
mobile phone for less than $1.
Non Cellular
Bluetooth is increasingly being
incorporated into applications
beyond the traditional cellular
segment including PCs, gaming,
music and automotive. In 2006, there
were 398 end products and modules
qualified in the non-cellular sector,
43% of all product qualifications.
In the consumer sector, music and
gaming applications have received
significant media coverage in 2006.
Bluetooth is being used in games
consoles and Bluetooth connectivity
for MP3 players is gaining traction,
initially via plug-in adaptors enabling
stereo headphones to be connected
wirelessly. CSR has won a number 
of designs for MP3 players including
Samsung’ s innovative Yepp T9
player. In the gaming sector CSR’ s
Bluetooth chips are used in Sony’ s
PlayStation 3 console and controller.
The automotive market provides 
a significant growth opportunity 
as the number of car manufacturers
offering Bluetooth connectivity
increases. CSR secured 75% 
(2005: 77%) of all designs with
automotive customers. CSR
technology is used by Audi, 
BMW and Saab, among others. 
In addition to built-in Bluetooth, used
predominantly for hands-free calls 
via the car HiFi system, there is a
significant aftermarket serviced by
clip-on handsfree Bluetooth devices. 
2006 saw strong growth in both 
the built-in and aftermarkets. 
Growth in the aftermarket was 
largely driven by interest in the CSR-
equipped satellite navigation systems
offered by T omT om in Europe and
Garmin in the US.
The PC market for Bluetooth
continues to grow with penetration 
of Bluetooth in laptops rising to 
over 20% in 2006 up from the high
teens percent in 2005. We expect
penetration rates to grow further 
as the stereo headphone market
grows, VoIP calls using cordless
headsets paired to PCs increases 
and the bandwidth of Bluetooth,
using UWB, increases in 2007 
the Bluetooth system. In 2006 
27% of all handsets qualified with
Bluetooth were CDMA handsets.
The headset market grew
significantly in 2006 compared to
2005, driven by the proliferation of
Bluetooth mobile phones and new
legislation in many countries making
it illegal to drive whilst using a mobile
phone without a hands-free system.
For 2006 as a whole, CSR believes
that the handset to headset pull-
through was between 20% and 
25%. The headset market is prone to
variable levels of promotional activity,
double-ordering and inventory build.
In the second half of 2006 changing
purchasing patterns at a headset
customer led to CSR experiencing 
a lower level of demand than had
originally been anticipated. Overall,
CSR believes that end customer
demand for headsets remains strong
with design activity reflecting this. 
CSR remains the clear market 
leader in the headset segment with
84% of all design wins in 2006. Our
customers value our comprehensive
system solution, low parts count 
and very long battery life. CSR’ s close
working relationship with innovative
companies through its Extension
Partner Programme, has enabled 
it to add ‘best-of-breed’ performance
to existing capabilities in key areas
such as speech recognition, text to
speech and speech to text, noise
suppression and echo cancellation.
CSR expects that headset attach
rates will increase driven largely by
the availability of low-cost headsets.
In Q1 2007 , CSR has announced a
reference design for such a headset
with an electronic bill of materials of $6.
CSR’ s leading position in the mono
headset sector continued with 90%
of qualified design wins (2005: 89%).
Notable design wins included Ben
Q,GN Netcom (Jabra brand),
Motorola, Nokia, and Samsung. 
2006 saw growth in stereo
headphones which can be used 
for both phone calls and listening 
to music. CSR expects this market  Changing the way the world connects
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006
and beyond, allowing very fast 
file transfer. CSR achieved a 
100% (2005: 71%) share of all 
laptop designs including Fujitsu
Siemens, LG and Panasonic 
as well as more PC peripherals
(including printers, cards and
dongles) than any other competitor
including with Dell and Canon.
OPERATIONAL
T o further support CSR’ s advanced
production processes, production
began to ramp up in 2006 at a fifth
TSMC wafer fabrication facility in
Washington, USA. CSR is already
qualified on four sites in Taiwan. 
CSR is a world leader in WLCSP
(Wafer Level Chip-Scale Packaging),
giving our customers the smallest
package sizes (ideal for slim phones),
integrated modules and the lowest
cost. Working with our assembly 
and test partner ASE, CSR has
further extended its lead in this
technology with the development 
of the first 300mm wafer, fine pitch
WLCSP solution for the BlueCore 5
and UniFi product families. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
CSR devotes substantial effort 
to research and development, 
which underpins and sustains 
our success. We are conscious 
of the need to ensure adequate
financial and human resources 
are available for research and
development, and these issues 
and future planning are considered
at operational level and at each 
Board meeting. In 2006, research
and development costs were 
$109.3 million (2005: $60.3 million)
representing 15.5% (2005: 12.4%) 
of turnover. 
We have the experience, skills 
and track record to design the
software for GPS, UMA (Universal
Mobile Access) and fixed-mobile
converged phones and hence 
extend our range of products 
going forward. In the longer term
CSR’ s research and development
expenditure is expected to reach 
at least 17% of revenue.
PATENTS
As a result of our research and
development efforts and recent
acquisitions, CSR has over 100
granted patents and a significant
number of further applications in
progress. At the year end, CSR 
was alerted to a complaint filed by 
the Washington Research Foundation
in the Federal Court of Seattle,
Washington alleging patent infringement
against four companies Matsushita,
Panasonic, Nokia and Samsung. 
The complaint refers to certain U.S.
patents owned by the University of
Washington claimed to be relevant 
to Bluetooth chips. CSR believes the 
suit is without merit in relation to CSR’ s
Bluetoothchips. CSR will defend its
products vigorously and, to this end,
moved to intervene in the legal action
on 30 January 2007.
EMPLOYEES
Headcount has increased from 
688 at the end of 2005 to 923 at 
the end of 2006. This predominantly
reflects continued investment in
engineers to support new R&D
projects and further recruitment 
in sales, marketing, applications
engineering and operations to
support business growth.
CSR’ s employees are key
contributors to its success. 
We encourage good employee
relations across all our operations
and require that this is facilitated 
by regular meetings and scheduled
briefings attended and supported 
by senior management. 
Regular Group-wide briefings 
are held with all staff. In addition,
scheduled meetings are held at team
and department levels to consider
commercial, strategic, financial and
human resource issues. Key findings
from these meetings are discussed
at a weekly meeting of senior
management for CSR’ s operations
worldwide. These have been an
important element in supporting 
our rapid growth. CSR also operates
a number of incentive plans, which
enables employees to participate
directly in the success of the

BUSINESS REVIEW 
continued In January 2007 , Cambridge Silicon
Radio Limited achieved certification
against the internationally recognised
environmental management
standard ISO 14001. As part of 
the environmental management
system (EMS), the Company has
defined and implemented an
environmental policy and objectives,
endorsed by the CEO and backed 
by the Board of Directors. 
The Company’ s environmental 
policy includes commitment to:
—Employee consultation 
and training;
—Legal compliance and due
consideration of other stakeholder
environmental requirements, and
future expectations; and
—Assessment of CSR’ s activities 
and product related environmental
impacts to identify objectives and
targets for continual improvement
of environmental performance.
CSR has, through assessment of 
its environmental impacts, identified
objectives for the creation of
programmes to improve its
environmental performance in the
following areas:
—Fossil fuel energy consumption 
at its UK locations;
—Mains water consumption at its 
UK locations;
—Compliance with the restriction 
on the use of certain hazardous
substances in electrical and
electronic equipment (‘RoHS’) and
related global market legislation,
including exceeding RoHS
requirements by including CSR
manufactured test equipment in
this programme;
—Creation of a programme to
instigate substitution or reduction
of environmentally harmful
materials incorporated into CSR
products to acceptable levels
where practicable.
European RoHS legislation came 
into force in July 2006 and CSR’ s
standard integrated circuits are fully
compliant. CSR is also constantly
monitoring and evaluating
requirements of upcoming
environmental legislation. RoHS
equivalent legislation in China and 
UK legislation related to the European
Waste from Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE) Directive are due
to become effective in 2007. CSR is
evaluating the impact of this new
legislation upon our products and will
put into place appropriate processes
to ensure compliance as required.
Furthermore, CSR is also evaluating
new ‘greener’ materials which go
beyond the requirements of existing
legislation to address future customer
requirements. CSR has processes in
place to make sure customers are
supported with up to date materials
information and laboratory analysis to
prove environmental compliance of
CSR’ s products. During 2006, CSR’ s
environmental compliance processes
have also been audited by a number
of customers, which has resulted in
CSR being accredited to their world
class environmental requirements.
CSR recognises the importance of
ensuring that its key suppliers have
appropriate policies and practices 
on SEE matters. Key suppliers are
selected and assessed based on
certification to appropriate global
standards, such as ISO 14001,

The Annual Report contains certain
forward looking statements.
Statements containing the words
‘believes’, ‘intends’, ‘expects’,
‘plans’, ‘seeks’, ‘anticipates’, and
other words of similar meaning are
forward looking. These statements
are made by the directors in good
faith, based on the information
available to them up to the time of 
the approval of this report. By their
nature, forward looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events and
depend on circumstances that will 
or may occur in the future. Actual
results may differ from those
expressed in such statements,
depending on a variety of factors.
These factors include consumer 
business. Subject to the discretion 
of the remuneration committee and
the rules and applicable performance
conditions of the incentive plans,
employees can participate in the
group’ s cash bonus and share 
option plans. Employees are also
encouraged to invest in the group
through participation in the Save 
As You Earn (‘SAYE’) option scheme.
We also recognise our responsibilities
to ensure fair treatment of all employees
in accordance with national legislation
in the territories in which we operate.
Equal opportunities for appropriate
training, career development and
promotion are available to all
employees, regardless of any physical
disability, gender, religion, race, age
or nationality. In particular, having
regard to their aptitudes and abilities,
we give full and fair consideration to
applications for employment received
from disabled persons. Where existing
employees become less able bodied,
it is the group’ s policy wherever
practicable to provide continuing
employment under normal terms 
and conditions. Provisions for
pension are available for all employees
either through participation in the
state pension schemes operated 
by the country in which the employee
is resident or provision of a defined
contribution pension scheme. Such
defined contribution schemes are
maintained in accordance with legislative
requirements, custom and practice
and Company policy as appropriate.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
CSR recognises the importance 
of social, environmental and ethical
(SEE) matters and during 2006,
continued to work towards
compliance with the ABI disclosure
guidelines on social responsibility.
This includes the Company’ s 
impact through its operations on 
the environment, on the safety and
well being of our employees, and 
end users of our products as well 
as those who contribute to the
process of the development and
manufacture of CSR’ s products
through its suppliers, distributors 
and customers. Changing the way the world connects

and market acceptance of the
Company’ s products and the
products that use the Company’ s
products; decreases in the demand
for the Company’ s products; excess
inventory levels at the Company’ s
customers; declines in average
selling prices of the Company’ s
products; cancellation of existing
orders or the failure to secure new
orders; the Company’ s failure to
introduce new products and to
implement new technologies on 
a timely basis; the Company’ s failure
to anticipate changing customer
product requirements; fluctuations 
in manufacturing and assembly and
test yields; the Company’ s failure to
deliver products to its customers on 
a timely basis; disruption in the supply
of wafers or assembly or testing
services; the timing of significant
orders; increased expenses
associated with new product
introductions, masks, or process
changes; the commencement of, 
or developments with respect to, 
any future litigation; the cyclicality 
of the semiconductor industry; 
and overall economic conditions.
CSR undertakes no obligation to
update the forward looking
statements contained in the annual
report or any other forward looking
statements it may make.
BUSINESS RISKS
There are a number of potential risks
and uncertainties which could have 
a material impact on the Group’ s long
term performance:
Fabless Business Model
The Company uses independent
suppliers to manufacture, assemble 
and test all of its products. As a result,
the Company’ s business model is less
capital intensive. TSMC, the world’ s
largest semiconductor manufacturer
is the Company’ s wafer foundry. 
ASE performs all of the assembly and
testing of CSR’ s IC’ s. CSR is therefore
reliant on these independent suppliers
to provide the required capacity to
manufacture, assemble and test all 
of its products and to provide high
quality products on time. 
The Company maintains an internal
manufacturing support group 
which directs product supply , helps
ensure a high level of quality and
reliability and works with the wafer
foundry and production assembler 
to resolve issues.
Product Design Cycle
The design cycle for the Company’ s
IC’ s in Bluetooth enabled products 
can take up to 24 months to
complete and volume production 
of products using the Company’ s 
IC’ s can take an additional six months
or more. This lengthy design cycle
makes forecasting product demand
and the timing of orders difficult for
the Company . In addition, the delays
inherent in lengthy design cycles
increase the risk that the Company’ s
customers may seek to cancel or
modify orders.
Product recall or 
delays in new products 
The Company’ s products are complex
and may contain undetected hardware
and software errors or failures when
first introduced or as new versions 
are tested. The resolution of these
errors could cause the Company 
to invest significant capital and other
resources and divert its technical 
staff from other development efforts.
If CSR delivers products with errors,
defects or bugs, its credibility and 
the market acceptance and sales 
of its products could be harmed,
causing significant customer
relations and business reputation
problems as well as potentially
significant product recall costs.
Transitioning to smaller 
geometry process technologies
T o remain competitive, the Company
expects to continue to transition 
its semiconductor products to
increasingly smaller line width
geometries. This transition requires
modification to the manufacturing
processes and the re-design of 
some products as well as standard
cells and other integrated circuit
designs that may be used in multiple
products. This may result in 
30 | 31
BUSINESS REVIEW 
continued New revenue sources
The Company’ s future success 
is dependent upon our ability 
to develop new semiconductor
solutions for existing and new
markets, introduce these products 
in a cost-effective and timely manner ,
and convince leading equipment
manufacturers to select these
products for design into their 
own new products. 
Reliance on success 
of customers’ products 
The Company relies on equipment
manufacturers to select our products
to be designed into their products.
Furthermore, even if an equipment
manufacturer selects CSR’ s product,
we cannot be assured that their
product will be commercially
successful. As a result, sales of 
the Company’ s products are largely
dependent on the commercial
success of customers’ products. 
Inability to protect the 
Company’s intellectual property
The success of CSR depends on 
our ability to protect our intellectual
property and trade secrets. Despite
prudent steps taken by the Company
to protect its proprietary rights, third
parties may attempt to copy aspects
of CSR’ s products and seek to use
information that CSR regards as
proprietary. There is a risk that the
Company’ s means of protecting its
intellectual property rights may not 
be adequate and weaknesses or
failures in this area could adversely
affect CSR’ s business.
Infringement of third party 
intellectual property rights
Companies in the semiconductor
industry often aggressively protect
and pursue their intellectual property
rights. Claims against the Company
could adversely affect our ability to
market our products, require us to 
re-design products or seek licences
from third parties, and seriously harm
the Company’ s operating results. 
In addition, the defence of such claims
could result in significant costs and
divert the attention of the Company’ s
management or other key employees.
Identification and successful
integration of acquisitions
The Company expects to continue 
to review acquisition targets as part
of its strategy. Market conditions 
may lead to increased competition
for targets and as a result higher
acquisition prices or fewer value-
creating prospects.
The integration of acquisitions 
also involves a number of unique
risks, including diversion of
management’ s attention, failure 
to retain key personnel of the
acquired business, failure to realise 
the benefits anticipated to result 
from the acquisition, system
integration and risks associated 
with unanticipated events or liabilities.
Management of the Company are
constantly considering and reviewing
risk. In addition the Company has 
put in place formal processes for 
the identification and, where possible,
the management of significant risks
which are reviewed regularly by
senior management. This is formally
reported on a regular basis to the
Audit Committee, as a result of 
which the directors are aware of the
potential cost and resources involved
in managing these risks. Details on
the identification and management 
of risks are also addressed on pages
42 and 43 in the Corporate
Governance Report. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Company’ s
financial statements under IFRS
requires management to make
estimates and judgements that 
affect the reported amount of 
assets, liabilities, turnover and
expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities.
On an ongoing basis, CSR evaluates
estimates, including those related 
to uncollectable accounts receivable,
inventories, investments, intangible
assets, income taxes, financing
operations, warranty obligations 
and contingencies and litigation. 
reduced manufacturing yields, 
delays in product deliveries and
increased expenses.
Product Life Cycle; Declining Prices
The life cycle of the Company’ s IC’s
can be relatively short. The average
selling prices of the Company’ s IC’ s
will generally fall over the product’s
life cycle. 
The Company’ s ability to increase
turnover, therefore, depends on its
ability to increase unit volume and 
to introduce new products that are
accepted by customers.
T erms of Sale
Sales are made under the 
Company’ s standard conditions 
of supply, in response to customer’ s
purchase orders or under separately
negotiated terms and conditions 
with certain customers. 
Industry practice does, however,
mean that customers may from time
to time seek to re-schedule and cancel
orders on relatively short notice. As a
result, backlog may not be an accurate
indicator of future turnover. Customer
order cancellations and changes in
product specifications could result in
a loss of turnover and excess inventory .
Seasonality
Principally all of the Company’ s
customer design wins have been in
products with consumer electronic
applications. As a result, CSR expects
its business to be subject to seasonality ,
with increased turnover in the period
April to November with a slowdown
in activity in December and into the
first quarter of the following year.
Cyclicality
The semiconductor industry is
cyclical and has experienced
significant downturns, often in
connection with maturing products
and declines in general economic
conditions. Such periods have
reflected production overcapacity,
excess inventory levels and
accelerated erosion in average 
selling prices. Changing the way the world connects
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006
The Company’ s estimates are 
based on historical experience 
and on various other assumptions 
that CSR believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results 
of which form the basis for making 
the judgements about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily apparent from other
sources. Because this can vary in
each situation, actual results may
differ from the estimates under
different assumptions and conditions.
CSR believes the following 
critical accounting policies 
and estimates are important 
in understanding the Group’s
Consolidated Financial Statements:
Inventory valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for excess or obsolete
inventory are recorded based upon
assumptions about future demand
and market conditions. If actual
market conditions are less 
favourable than those projected by
management, additional inventory
provisions may be required.
Impairment of non current 
assets including goodwill
An annual impairment test is
performed in respect of goodwill. 
In addition CSR assesses its non
current assets for possible
impairment if there are events or
changes in circumstances that
indicate that carrying values of 
the assets may not be recoverable.
Indicators of potential impairment
include changes in the Group’ s
strategy and business plans, failure
to meet performance projections
included in our forecasts of future
operating results, and a slowdown 
in the worldwide economy or the
semiconductor industry. 
The assessment for impairment
entails comparing the carrying value 
of the non-current asset with the
recoverable amount of the asset, 
that is, the higher of net realisable
value and value in use. Value in use 
is usually determined on the basis 
of discounted estimated future net
cash flows. Significant management
judgement is required in the forecasts
of future operating results that are
used in the discounted estimated
future net cash flows. The estimates
we have used are consistent with 
the plans and estimates that we 
use to manage our business. 
It is possible, however, that the 
plans and estimates used may 
be incorrect. If our actual results, 
or the plans and estimates used in
future impairment analyses are lower
than the original estimates used to
assess the recoverability of these
assets, we could incur additional
impairment charges.
Provisions and Liabilities
Provisions and liabilities are
recognised in the period when it
becomes probable that there will 
be a future outflow of funds resulting
from past operations or events that
can be reasonably estimated. 
The timing of recognition requires 
the application of judgement to
existing facts and circumstances,
which can be subject to change.
The carrying amounts of provisions
and liabilities are reviewed regularly
and adjusted to take account of
changing facts and circumstances.
Any change in the carrying amount
would result in a charge or credit 
to profit for the period in which the
change occurs.
Research and Development
Expenditure on research activities
undertaken with the prospect of
gaining new scientific or technical
knowledge and understanding, is
expensed in the income statement 
as incurred.
Where a product can be identified, 
its cost can be measured, it is
technically feasible and it is probable 
32 | 33
BUSINESS REVIEW 
continued estimate of shares that will eventually
vest. The fair value of the majority of
options granted is measured by use
of a Black-Scholes model, taking 
into account the terms and conditions
upon which the options were
granted. For certain share options
which include total shareholder 
return related conditions, the fair 
value is estimated through the use 
of a Monte-Carlo simulation.
The amount recognised as an
expense is adjusted to reflect the
actual number of shares that vest.
Non-market vesting conditions 
are included in assumptions about 
the number of shares that are
expected to become exercisable.
The estimates of the number of
shares that are expected to become
exercisable are reviewed at each
balance sheet date. The impact 
of the revision of original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in the income
statement and a corresponding
adjustment to equity. The proceeds
received net of any directly attributable
transaction costs are credited to
share capital (nominal value) and
share premium (the balance) when
the options are exercised.
Share options and Taxation
In the UK and US the Group is
entitled to a tax deduction for
amounts treated as compensation 
on exercise of certain employees
share options under each jurisdiction’ s
tax rules. This gives rise to a
temporary difference between 
the accounting and tax bases and
hence a deferred tax asset is
recorded. This asset is calculated 
by comparing the estimated amount
of tax deduction to be obtained in 
the future (based on the Group’ s
share price at the balance sheet date)
with the share-based payment
expense recorded in the income
statement. If the amount of estimated
future tax deduction exceeds the
cumulative amount of share-based
payment expense at the statutory
rate, the excess is recorded directly 
in equity , against retained earnings.
As explained above, no share-based
payment expense is recorded in
respect of options granted before 
7 November 2002. Nevertheless 
tax deductions have arisen and will
continue to arise on these options.
The tax effects in relation to these
options are recorded directly in equity ,
against retained earnings.

it will generate future economic
benefits, development costs are
capitalised and amortised on a
straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the respective product.
The Company believes its current
process for developing products is
essentially completed when products
have achieved the ‘Transfer to
Production’ status as it is only then
that technical feasibility of the products
to be manufactured and sold to the
commercial marketplace is confirmed.
Accordingly, development costs
incurred after the establishment of
technical feasibility have not been
significant and, therefore, no costs
have been capitalised to date. 
Where no internally-generated
intangible asset can be recognised,
development expenditure is
recognised as an expense in 
the period in which it is incurred.

The share option schemes allow
Group employees to acquire shares
of the Company.

No expense is recognised in respect
of these options. The shares are

continued
CSR places significant focus on
controlling product costs and during
2006, has aggressively reduced
costs in line with average selling
prices. As a result, gross margins
have been maintained at over 46%.
Operating costs have increased by
55% in 2006 over 2005 (2005: 94%)
as CSR continues to invest in R&D 
for current wireless solutions as 
well as new projects. Investment 
in applications engineers and sales
people continued during 2006 and
general and administration costs
have increased to support the
growing levels of business.
Operating profit was $149.0 million 
at 21.1% operating margin 
compared to $111.9 million and 
23% operating margin in 2005.
Investment income 
Investment income increased to 
$6.1 million in 2006 compared to
$3.2 million in 2005 as a result of
increased levels of cash and cash
equivalents, as well as higher UK 
and US interest rates.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was 
$43.2 million (2005: $31.2 million)
giving an effective tax rate for the year
of 28% (2005: 27.3%). This is below
the statutory rate of 30% principally
due to the availability of enhanced tax
relief on UK R&D expenditure.
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share (diluted) 
was $0.82 for 2006, an increase 
of 32% compared to $0.62 for 
2005. Basic earnings per share was 
$0.86 compared to $0.67 for 2005.

movements in working capital
resulting in a cash outflow of 
$93.9 million (2005: $21.0 million).
This increase in working capital
reflects the continued growth of the
business and the higher levels of
inventory as a result of revenue in 
the second half of 2006 being lower
than our initial expectations. 
Capital expenditure of $45.7 million
(2005: $18.7 million) reflects the
continued investment in test and
computer equipment and CAD
software required to support current
and future R&D projects as well as
the purchase of production testers 
to enable more cost effective testing.
This expenditure represents 6.5% 
of revenue (2005: 3.8%). CSR’ s
longer term target for expenditure 
on tangible and intangible assets is
estimated at 4% to 5% of revenue.
Net tax paid was $17.8 million 
(2005: $8.1 million) and cash outflow
from financing was $2.3 million
principally due to repayment of
obligations under financial leases
(2005: inflow of $0.2 million).
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY
The issued share capital at 
29 December 2006 was
130,206,208 ordinary shares of 
0.1 pence each (2005: 127,879,155). 
As a result of the funds raised
through the initial public offering in
March 2004 and the subsequent
positive operating cashflows, 
CSR has a total of $147.5 million 
of treasury deposits, cash and cash
equivalents at 29 December 2006
(2005: $124.4 million).
Dividend policy
The Company currently intends 
to retain future earnings to fund 
the development and growth of 
the business. Any payment of future
dividends will be at the discretion 
of the Board after taking into account
various factors, including the
Company’ s financial condition, operating
results, current and anticipated cash
needs and plans for expansion.
Foreign exchange 
and treasury policy
CSR has well defined and consistently
applied policies for the management
of foreign exchange and interest 
rate exposures. There has been 
no change since the year end in 
the major financial risks faced by 
the Company. The Audit Committee 
of the Board reviews and agrees
policies for managing foreign exchange
and interest rate exposure risks. 
The Company’ s financial instruments
comprise cash and cash deposits
and items such as trade receivables
and creditors which arise in the
normal course of business. It is 
the Company’ s policy not to enter 
into speculative transactions.
Substantially all of the Company’ s
sales and costs of sales are
denominated in US dollars, the
Company’ s functional currency. 
A majority of the Company’ s
overhead costs and other fixed 
costs are denominated in sterling. 
This exposure to different currencies
would result in gains or losses with
respect to movements in foreign
exchange rates and the impact of
such fluctuations could be material.
Accordingly, the Company enters 
into hedging transactions pursuant 
to which it purchases sterling under
forward purchase contracts in order
to cover the majority of its sterling
exposure. These transactions
necessarily involve judgements and
assumptions about future expense
levels, and, as a result, do not entirely
eliminate the Company’ s exposure 
to currency fluctuations. Further,
whilst the hedging transactions
provide fixed currency rates for
periods covered by the contracts, 
the transactions will not protect 
the Company from long term
underlying movements in currency
rates. The average US dollar/sterling
rate achieved in 2006 was 1.80 
and 2007 contracts are in place 
at an average of 1.86.

FINANCIAL POSITION
Goodwill arose on the acquisitions 
of Clarity and UbiNetics during 2005.
Intangible assets include the net
book value of the Group’ s software
licences of $19.3 million (2005: $10.9
million) which support R&D, along
with the $12.4 million of in-process
R&D and customer contracts
purchased as part of the acquisitions
last year (2005: $14.5 million).
Trade receivables increased to 
$87.2 million (2005: $62.5 million) 
as a result of the increased levels 
of business. Days’ sales outstanding
increased slightly to 45 days 
(2005: 42 days).
Inventory stands at $106.5 million
(2005: $69.7 million), which represents
105 inventory days. This high level 
of inventory reflects a lower level of
revenue in the second half of 2006
than expected when wafer orders
were placed with our sub-
contractors in Q3. Actions to address
levels of inventory have been taken
with our sub-contractors but with 
13 to 18 week delivery lead times 
the impact from these actions will 
be mainly felt in Q1 2007. However , 
CSR aims to keep sufficient inventory
to meet the often short customer
order lead times in this industry 
which results in inventory days of
between 75 and 95 days. 
ACQUISITIONS
CSR made no acquisitions during
2006, however two acquisitions 
were completed in January 2007.
On 12 January 2007, the Company
completed the acquisitions of the
entire issued share capital of NordNav
T echnologies AB (‘NordNav’) and 
the entire issued share capital of
Cambridge Positioning Systems
Limited (‘CPS’). NordNav, based 
in Stockholm, Sweden, has been
acquired for an initial cash
consideration of $40 million. 
A further cash consideration 
of up to $35 million may be payable 
subject to achievement of specified
milestones. CPS, based in
Cambridge, UK, has been acquired
for a total cash consideration of 
$35 million. Both NordNav and CPS
were private companies, with
significant holdings by venture 
capital institutions. The initial cash
consideration for the acquisitions has
been and any deferred consideration
will be financed entirely from CSR’ s
existing cash resources.
These acquisitions, when combined,
will allow CSR to provide software-
based high performance GPS
suitable for mass-market mobile
handsets, PNDs (Personal Navigation
Devices), PCs and other portable
devices. By adding this software to
CSR’ s Bluetooth chips, CSR will be
able to offer the most competitive,
complete and technically advanced
mobile GPS solution available 
at a very low additional cost. 
CSR expects to offer its first GPS
products during the first half of 2007.
The acquisitions are a further step 
in CSR's strategy of diversification
which already includes Wi-Fi, FM,
UWB and Wibree.

STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Company supports the
principles of corporate governance
contained in the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance which 
is appended to the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority.
The Board is accountable to the
Company’ s shareholders for good
governance. The Company has
throughout the year complied with
the majority of the provisions of the
Combined Code – Principles of Good
Governance and Code of Best Practice.
The statements below describe how
the Company has applied the principles
identified in the Combined Code and
areas where the Company is presently
working towards compliance.
THE BOARD
As at 29 December 2006, the Board
comprised eight members all of whom
served throughout the year , being the
Chairman, Mr John Whybrow, four
executive directors and three non-
executive directors. The four executive
directors were Mr John Scarisbrick,
Chief Executive Officer; Mr Paul
Goodridge, Finance Director; 
Mr James Collier, Chief T echnical
Officer and Mr Glenn Collinson,
Executive Vice-President. 
The non-executive directors, were 
Mr David T ucker , Mr Ron Mackintosh
and Mr Anthony Carlisle. The Board
is satisfied that an appropriate
balance was in place throughout 
the year to enable the Board to
perform its responsibilities effectively .
Mr Whybrow has acted as Chairman
of the Company since its flotation 
in March 2004. T o coincide with the
completion of his three year term of
appointment, Mr Whybrow indicated
in the Autumn of 2006 that he wished
to stand down as Chairman and from
the Board at a future date, and it was
agreed that the Board should take
steps to identify a new chairman to
take the position during 2007.
The appointment to key positions
within the Company has received
attention as part of succession
planning. The Board as a whole 
was asked to contribute to the
consideration of a suitable
replacement, and Mr Tucker 
as Senior Independent Director 
co-ordinated the process of
discussions with each director.
It was determined that knowledge 
of the sector in which the Company
operates and continuity were key
considerations in identifying a
suitable replacement. After due
consultation, it was determined 
that Mr Mackintosh, an existing 
non-executive director and chairman
of the Remuneration Committee
should be invited to take the position
of Chairman of the Board. In arriving
at this decision the Board had due
regard for Mr Mackintosh’ s
independence and his considerable
experience in both senior executive
and non-executive capacities in
international technology companies.
The Board had also given due
consideration to Mr Mackintosh’ s
experience and knowledge of CSR,
where he has been a non-executive
director since May 2004. 
Mr Mackintosh did not participate 
in the decision to invite him to act 
as Chairman of the Board.
The Board discussed with 
Mr Mackintosh his commitments 
as chairman designate of 
Northgate Information Solutions plc,
non-executive director of software
company royalblue group plc,
chairman of software company
SmartStream T echnologies Ltd 
and chairman of Differentis, 
a privately owned IT consultancy
which he co-founded in July 2000.
The Board is satisfied that 
Mr Mackintosh is able to devote the
necessary time commitments to the
role of Chairman of the Board.
T o assist in an orderly handover, 
Mr Whybrow has agreed to remain 
as Chairman until the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting to 
be held on 2 May 2007 when he 
will stand down from the Board. 
Mr Mackintosh will assume the role

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE REPORT In accordance with the provisions of
the Combined Code, consideration
has been given to the independence
of all the non-executive directors. 
The Board considers all the 
non-executive directors to be
independent of management 
and free from any business or other
relationship that could materially
interfere with the exercise of
independent judgement.
The Board meets regularly during 
the year as well as on an ad-hoc
basis as required by time critical
business needs. The Board is
responsible to shareholders for the
effective and proper management
and control of the Company and 
has a formal schedule of matters
reserved for its decisions. Its primary
roles are to determine and review
Company strategy and policy,
consider acquisitions and disposals,
assess requests for major capital
expenditure and give consideration
to all other significant financial
matters. This process is undertaken
following discussions in conjunction
with senior executive management
who in turn are responsible for the
day to day conduct of the Group’ s
operations and for reporting to the
Board on the progress being made 
in meeting the objectives. The Board
met eight times during the year and
the attendance of each of the
directors is shown on page 43. 
During the year, as part of its formal
business, the Board reviewed a
paper prepared by the Company
Secretary which summarised the
findings of the detailed Board
performance evaluation conducted 
in 2005 and the actions taken during
2006 arising from that review. 
The Board considered each of the
findings and discussed the extent 
to which areas which that review had
identified as benefiting from attention
had been satisfactorily addressed.
This included the opportunity provided
to the Board to meet with senior
management below Board level,
greater opportunities for the executive
and non-executive directors to meet
outside of routine Board business
and the degree of rigour applied 
to succession planning. 
In each of these areas, progress had
been made, with members of senior
management invited to attend and
report to the Board on their areas of
responsibility at each board meeting,
time allotted to informal meetings of
the directors and a presentation to a
meeting of the Nomination Committee
on succession planning across all
functional areas through to Board
level. The Board was also satisfied
that the other areas identified had
received appropriate attention.
The overall conclusion was that 
the Board and its Committees 
were performing appropriately. 
The Chairman holds regular 
meetings with all the directors
individually. In addition, prior to 
the year end, the Chairman held 
a meeting with the non-executive
directors to discuss the performance
of the executive directors. 
In accordance with the Company’ s
Articles of Association, all directors
are required to retire and submit
themselves for re-election at least
once every three years. It is the policy
of the Board that non-executive
directors are appointed for an initial
term of three years, following which 
it will be reviewed and as appropriate,
extended for a further period not
exceeding three years. Non-executive
directors should not generally serve
for more than nine years. 
During 2007 the letters of
appointment for Mr Tucker, 
Mr Whybrow and Mr Mackintosh 
have fallen or will fall due for 
review following the completion 
by each of their initial three year 
term of appointment. 
The letter of appointment for 
Mr Tucker has been extended for 
a 2 year period to 24 January 2009.
As a result of the decision that 
Mr Whybrow is to stand down from 
of Chairman Designate with effect
from 22 February 2007 and will be
appointed as Chairman with effect
from 2 May 2007. His appointment
will be for a three year term. For the
present, Mr Mackintosh will remain
chairman of the Remuneration
Committee, but it is the intention 
that he will relinquish the position
during the course of the current
financial year , although he will remain 
a member of the Committee. He will
also continue as a member of the
Nomination Committee and will take
the role of chairman of that committee
with effect from 2 May 2007. 
He will stand down as a member 
of the Audit Committee, but may
attend meetings by invitation. 
With effect from 4 January 2007, 
Mr Sergio Giacoletto was appointed
a non-executive director. As a result
of Mr Giacoletto’ s appointment, 
the proportion of non-executive
directors represents half the Board.
As a consequence of Mr Whybrow
standing down from the Board in 
May 2007 and Mr Mackintosh’ s
appointment as Chairman, the
proportion of non-executive directors
will not comply with the Code. It is 
the intention of the Board to appoint
an additional non-executive director
during 2007.
Mr David Tucker is the Senior
Independent Director. Mr Goodridge
has throughout the year been the
director responsible for health and
safety within the Group. The directors
possess diverse business experience
in spheres complementary to CSR’ s
activities, as well as other sectors.
Biographies of the directors are
shown on page 44. Mr Brett Gladden
served as Company Secretary
throughout the year.
The division of responsibilities
between the non-executive Chairman
and Mr Scarisbrick, CEO is sufficiently
clear in the opinion of the Board 
that it is not required that they be
formally documented. Changing the way the world connects
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006
the Board following the Annual General
Meeting on 2 May 2007, his existing
letter of appointment which expires in
March 2007 has been extended until
2 May 2007. A new letter of appointment
will be entered into for Mr Mackintosh
reflecting his appointment to the
position of Chairman.
On appointment, all directors are
advised that they have access to the
advice and services of the Company
Secretary and, in addition, that they
are entitled to seek independent
professional advice in the furtherance
of their duties, if necessary, at the
Company’s expense.
In accordance with the Company’ s
Articles of Association, directors are
granted an indemnity from the
Company to the extent permitted by
law in respect of liabilities incurred as
a result of the performance of their
duties in their capacity as directors 
to the Company. The indemnity 
would not provide any coverage to 
the extent that a director is proven to
have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
The Company has also arranged
insurance coverage in respect of legal
action against the directors and officers.
COMMUNICATIONS WITH
SHAREHOLDERS
Principally via the executive directors,
the Company seeks to build on a
mutual understanding of objectives
with its major shareholders through
regular meetings and presentations
following announcements of each
quarter’ s results. The Senior
Independent Director , Mr David T ucker ,
is available to meet institutional
shareholders should there be
unresolved matters they wish to 
bring to his attention. During the year ,
Mr Mackintosh met with shareholders 
to discuss the policies of the
Remuneration Committee. Although 
the non-executive directors are not
asked at present to meet with the
Company’ s shareholders as a matter 
of course, their attendance at the
Annual General Meeting is required.
Corporate information is also available
on the Company’ s website,
www.csr.com. 
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
The Board has three committees,
Remuneration, Audit and Nomination.
During the year, the Chairman and
non-executive directors were each
members of the Remuneration, 
Audit and Nomination Committees.
As a result of the amendment made
during the year to the Combined
Code which allows the Chairman of
the Board to sit on the Remuneration
Committee where he is considered
independent at the time of
appointment, it was decided that Mr
Whybrow should attend the meetings
as a member , rather than by invitation.
Mr Mackintosh is presently chairman
of the Remuneration Committee.
There is no immediate intention for 
Mr Mackintosh to relinquish this role,
notwithstanding that he will be taking
on the role as Chairman of the Board
with effect from 2 May 2007. It is
however the intention of the Board 
to keep this matter under review 
in connection with the intention of 
the Board to appoint an additional
non-executive director during 2007.
Mr Whybrow remained a member 
of the Audit Committee throughout
the year. This was considered
appropriate in view of his experience
in similar roles in other companies
and the contribution he provided 
to the business of the committee.
With effect from 4 January 2007 
and the appointment to the 
Audit Committee of Mr Giacoletto, 
Mr Whybrow has stood down as 
a member of the Committee but 
may continue to attend meetings 
by invitation. In accordance with 
the Combined Code, the duties 
of the Committees are set out in
formal terms of reference. These 
are available from the Company
Secretary and can be found on the
Company’ s website, www.csr.com.
Membership of the Committees is
shown on page 44. The Company
Secretary acts as secretary to each 
of the Committees.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Mr Ron Mackintosh is the Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee. 
The other members of the
40 | 41
CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE REPORT
continued During 2006, the Committee met 
a total of eight times, seven of which
were as part of the formal business 
of the Board, to discuss the
appointments of a non-executive
director and separately on one
occasion to discuss in detail
succession planning throughout 
the organisation, which meeting 
Mr Scarisbrick also attended.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Mr David Tucker is the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. The other
members of the Committee at 
29 December 2006 were Messrs
Carlisle, Mackintosh and Whybrow.
With effect from his appointment, 
Mr Giacoletto is also a member of 
the Committee. The Board is satisfied
that Mr T ucker , a chartered accountant
with extensive experience through 
his past and present involvement as
chairman of the audit committees 
of various listed companies, brings
recent and relevant experience to the
Committee. Mr Whybrow, Chairman
of the Board also served on the
Committee. The Board considers 
this to have been appropriate, 
given his experience in other listed
companies as well as the
contribution to and the benefit
derived from his participating in
matters which the Committee
considers. With the appointment of 
Mr Giacoletto on 4 January 2007 to
the Board and all of its Committees,
Mr Whybrow has stood down as 
a member of the Audit Committee. 
The experience and expertise of 
the members of the Committee 
are summarised on page 44. 
The attendance of its members 
is shown in the table on page 43.
The Committee met five times during
the year and reported its conclusions
to the full Board. The Committee
invites the Chief Executive Officer , the
Finance Director, the Internal Auditor
and senior representatives of the
external auditors to attend meetings
as appropriate to the business being
considered. In addition, the Committee
has the right to invite any other
employees to attend meetings 
where this is considered appropriate.
The Committee is responsible for the
development, implementation and
monitoring of the Company’ s policy
on external audit and for overseeing
the objectivity and effectiveness 
of the auditors. 
The Committee recommends the
appointment and re-appointment 
of the Company’ s external auditors
and considers the scope of their audit
work, the terms of their appointment,
their fees and the cost effectiveness
of their work. During 2006, as part of
its formal business, the Committee
met on four occasions with the external
auditors. On two occasions the
Committee also held separate
meetings with the external auditors 
at which no executive director or
employee of the Company was present.
The Committee is aware of and has
approved the audit and non-audit
services which have been provided 
by the Company’ s external auditors,
Deloitte & T ouche LLP during 2006.
Those non-audit services concerned
advice on tax matters which was
considered to be appropriate, given
their in-depth knowledge of the affairs
and financial practices in the Group.
The Committee is satisfied that,
notwithstanding this work, Deloitte &
T ouche LLP have retained objectivity
and independence during the year.
Deloitte & T ouche LLP have been the
Company’s auditors since July 2002
and the cost, scope and effectiveness
of the audit are reviewed regularly. 
In 2005 the Board requested that a
formal review of the external Auditor
be undertaken with due regard for
good governance and to ensure
shareholders are receiving the best
available service. 
This review commenced in December
2005 and was completed in March
2006. Following the review, the Board
concluded that it was appropriate 
to recommend to shareholders that
Deloitte & T ouche LLP be re-appointed
and this was approved at the Annual
General Meeting held on 2 May 2006.
Committee at 29 December 2006
were Messrs Carlisle, Tucker and 
Whybrow. With effect from his
appointment, Mr Giacoletto is 
also a member of the Committee.
The principal function of the
Committee is to establish and review
the terms and conditions for the
executive directors, and the overall
policy framework for the remuneration
of other senior executives and the
Group as a whole. The Committee
met three times during the year and
the attendance of its members is
shown in the table on page 43.
The report to shareholders on how
directors are remunerated, together
with details of individual directors’
remuneration are shown on pages 
49 to 58.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Mr John Whybrow is the Chairman 
of the Nomination Committee. 
The other members of the
Committee at 29 December 2006
were Messrs Carlisle, Mackintosh
and Tucker. With effect from his
appointment, Mr Giacoletto is also 
a member of the Committee. 
The Committee meets as appropriate
to consider appointments to the
Board and to consider succession
planning at senior levels within the
Company. The Committee reviews
the composition of the Board,
particularly in relation to the diversity
of skills, experience and term 
of office and seeks to ensure that
both executive and non-executive
directors have the necessary skills
and attributes for the future success 
of the Group. The Committee 
retains external search consultants
as appropriate and during 2006
engaged Career Mentoring
International to assist in the
appointment of an additional 
non-executive director which was
completed with the appointment 
in January 2007 of Mr Giacoletto.  In relation to the appointment of external
auditors and in order to safeguard
auditor independence and objectivity,
the Committee has a policy of permitted
services which details the services
that can be provided by the Company’ s
auditors and those services which
require specific approval by the
Committee. The policy also details
services that the Company’ s auditors
are not permitted to provide. The
policy has been complied with
throughout the year.
The Committee reviews, where
practicable, all proposed
announcements to be made by 
the Company to the extent they
contain financial information. 
The Committee also monitors and
reviews the effectiveness of the
Group’ s internal control systems,
accounting policies and practices,
risk management procedures 
and compliance controls as well 
as the statement on internal controls
before they are agreed by the 
Board for each year’ s annual report. 
The Chairman of the Committee
attends the Company’ s Annual General
Meeting to respond to any shareholder
questions that might be raised
concerning the Committee’ s activities.
INTERNAL CONTROL
Philosophy and policy
The objective of the directors and
senior management is to safeguard
and increase the value of the business
and assets of the Company. Part of
this objective requires the development
of relevant policies and appropriate
internal controls to ensure proper
management of the Company’ s resources
and the identification of risks which
might serve to undermine them.
The Board is ultimately responsible
for the Company’ s system of internal
control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The systems and
processes established by the Board
are designed to manage, rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives and provide
reasonable, not absolute, assurance
against misstatement or loss. 
The Board has delegated responsibility
for the review of practices and
procedures to the Audit Committee.
The Company’ s senior management,
in conjunction with external advisers
are responsible for undertaking
periodic reviews of the suitability 
of current systems on which they
report to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee reviews the
findings to ensure the effectiveness
and efficiency of the processes
implemented by senior management.
This includes discussions with senior
management of the Company and
consideration of reports that have
been submitted. These findings are 
in turn discussed by the full Board.
The Board is satisfied that this
process accords with the internal
control guidance for directors set 
out in the Turnbull Report ‘Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on
the Combined Code’ and that
through its interface with management,
the Board is aware of the major risks
facing the Company and the steps
taken by the Company where possible
to mitigate such risks. The risk
evaluation process described in 
this report has been in place for 2006
and up to the date of approval of the
annual report and financial statements.
MANAGING RISKS
A summary of the structures and
processes in place to identify and
manage risks across the Group 
are set out below and opposite.
Risk profiling
There is an ongoing process to
identify and evaluate risks faced by
the Company, through the conduct of
regular meetings by the Company’ s
senior management. Findings are
reported to the Audit Committee
together with recommended actions
and a timetable for implementation. 
A list of prioritised risks is refreshed
on a regular basis to reflect changes
to the business and any observations
or proposals arising from events since
the last review. The schedule, along
with other management information,
is used to develop an overall
assurance plan for the Company .

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE REPORT
continued Controlling risk
The Company has policies which
address a number of key business
risks, including financial, treasury 
and health and safety . The policies are
made available to relevant employees
through policy manuals, an intranet
site and also via employee briefings 
on specific topics as appropriate. 
During 2006, a formal review of the
Company’ s treasury policies was
undertaken by Ernst & Y oung LLP , 
the results of which were reported 
to a meeting of the Audit Committee. 
The report concluded that overall
practice within the Company was
acceptable. Where the report identified
areas which might benefit from
improvement, action is being taken
and progress is reported to meetings 
of the Audit Committee.
The Company also has a formal
whistle-blowing policy which was 
up-dated during 2006 and has 
been communicated to employees.
The policy provides information 
on the process to follow in the event
any employee feels it appropriate 
to make a disclosure. The Audit
Committee received a report on the
revised policy and the process for its
communication to employees prior to
its release. As a result, the Committee
is satisfied that the policy provides an
adequate basis for employees to make
representations in confidence to the
Company and for appropriate and
proportionate investigation. 
The Group carries out a programme 
of management self-assessments over
the status of key business risks through
formal reviews which consider the risks
faced by the business, how these
might be mitigated and who within the
Company is responsible for implementing
agreed actions. Where appropriate,
external advisers are appointed in
order to support this process. 
MONITORING AND MANAGING 
THE STATUS OF RESIDUAL RISK
The actions arising from external and
internal assessments are consolidated
and during 2006 the results were
reported to the Audit Committee. 
The Committee assesses the findings
and proposed actions for addressing
residual risks and also advises on
areas for further attention.
INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS
The Company has a comprehensive
system for regular monitoring and
reporting of financial performance 
and assessing the adequacy of the
Group’ s systems of internal controls.
Risk assessment and evaluation is an
integral part of the annual planning
cycle. This includes assessment 
of the Group’ s strategic direction,
objectives and financial returns and 
the risks in achieving them. 
As part of the planning cycle, a detailed
budget is prepared by management
and thereafter is reviewed and formally
adopted by the Board. The budget 
and other targets are regularly updated
via a rolling forecasting process and
regular business review meetings are
also held involving senior management
worldwide, at which the Company’ s
overall performance is assessed. 
The results of these reviews are in 
turn reported to and discussed by 
the Audit Committee and the Board
at each meeting. A summary of the key
financial risks inherent in the Company’ s
business is given on pages 30 to 33.
These processes are supported 
by discreet reviews conducted by
external advisers, as determined 
by the Committee, in addition to 
the routine audits. 
During the year , the Committee
reviewed the effectiveness of the
Group’ s internal audit function, its
relationship with the external auditors
and oversaw the development of 
the function during the year since 
the appointment of an internal auditor 
in October 2005. The Committee
approved the internal audit plan 
and at subsequent meetings, 
reviewed progress against the plan. 
The Committee considered the 
results of the audits undertaken by 
the internal audit function and the
adequacy of management's 
response to matters raised. 
The Board confirms that it has
reviewed the effectiveness of the
system of internal controls for the 52
weeks ended 29 December 2006.
ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS
The table below shows the
attendance of each of the directors 
at meetings of the Board and its
Committees held during the 52
weeks ended 29 December 2006. 
A comprehensive file of briefing
papers and a meeting agenda is
provided for each director in advance
of each meeting. Decisions are taken
by the Board, in conjunction, where
appropriate, with the recommendations
of its Committees and advice from
external consultants and executive
management. In addition, during
those months when a Board 
meeting is not scheduled, a pack 
of management reports, including
financial analysis is sent to each of
the directors.

and for the Group was 57 (2005 : 62).
DONATIONS
The Company and employees

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY
STATEMENT
The directors are responsible for
preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements. The directors
are required to prepare financial
statements for the Group in accordance
with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and have also
elected to prepare financial statements
for the Company in accordance with
IFRS. Company law requires the
directors to prepare such financial
statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting
Standards, the Companies Act 1985
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1
requires that financial statements
present fairly for each financial year
the Company’ s financial position,
financial performance and cash
flows. This requires the faithful
representation of the effects of
transactions, other events and
conditions in accordance with the
definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and
expenses set out in the International
Accounting Standards Board’ s
‘Framework for the Preparation 
and Presentation of Financial
Statements’. A fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance 
with all applicable International
Financial Reporting Standards.
Directors are also required to:
—properly select and apply
accounting policies; 
—present information, including
accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable,
intention to issue ordinary shares
other than pursuant to the Company’ s
employee share schemes. The
directors recommend that you vote 
in favour of Resolutions 8 and 9 to
maintain the Company’ s flexibility 
in relation to future share issues,
including any issues to finance
business opportunities should
appropriate circumstances arise.
A Special Resolution will be proposed
(Resolution 10 in the Notice of Meeting)
to renew the directors’ limited authority
last granted in 2006 to repurchase
ordinary shares in the market. The
authority will be limited to a maximum
of 6,514,668 ordinary shares (being
5% of the Company’ s issued share
capital at the date of this report) and
also sets the minimum and maximum
prices which may be paid. 
The directors believe it is
advantageous for the Company 
to have the flexibility to make market
purchases of its own shares. In the
event that shares are purchased,
they would either be cancelled 
(and the number in issue would be
reduced accordingly) or, subject 
to the legislation referred to below,
retained as treasury shares. The
directors will only make purchases
after consideration of the possible
effect on earnings per share and the
long term benefits to shareholders.
The Companies (Acquisition of Own
Shares) (T reasury Shares) Regulations
2003 allow shares repurchased by
the Company to be held as treasury
shares that may be cancelled, sold 
for cash or used for the purpose 
of employee share schemes. The
Company holds no shares in treasury
but the directors currently intend that
any shares which are repurchased will
be held in treasury. However there is
no present intention to acquire shares
and deal with them in this way. The
authority contained in the Special
Resolution will expire 15 months after
it is given or , if earlier , at the conclusion
of the Annual General Meeting to 
be held in 2008 but it is the current
intention of the directors to renew 
this authority annually. Changing the way the world connects
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006
comparable and understandable
information; and
—provide additional disclosures
when compliance with the specific
requirements in IFRS is insufficient
to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions,
other events and conditions on the
entity’ s financial position and
financial performance.
The directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company, for
safeguarding the assets, for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other
irregularities and for the preparation
of a directors’ report and directors’
remuneration report which comply
with the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements
differs from legislation in other
jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors at the date 
of the approval of this report 
confirms that:
—so far as the director is aware,
there is no relevant audit
information of which the
Company’ s auditors are unaware,
and
—the director has taken all the steps
that he ought to have taken as a
director to make himself aware of
the relevant audit information and
to establish that the Company's
auditors are aware of that
information.
This confirmation is given and 
should be interpreted in accordance
with the provisions of s234zA of the
Companies Act 1985.
The directors, having prepared the
financial statements, have permitted
the auditors to take whatever steps
they consider appropriate for the
purpose of enabling them to give
their audit opinion.

GOING CONCERN
After making due enquiries, 
the directors have a reasonable
expectation at the time of approving
the financial statements that the
Group has adequate financial
resources to continue to operate 
for the foreseeable future and,
consequently, continue to use the
going concern basis for preparing 
the financial statements which follow.
AUDITORS
Deloitte & T ouche LLP are the
Company’ s auditors and have
expressed their willingness to
continue in the office of auditors and
therefore, in accordance with Section
385 of the Companies Act 1985, 
a resolution for their re-appointment
will be proposed at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
continued INTRODUCTION
The Board presents the 
remuneration report for the 52 
weeks ended 29 December 2006.
The Board sets the Company’ s
remuneration policy . The Remuneration
Committee (‘the Committee’) makes
recommendations to the Board
within its agreed terms of reference
(available on the Company’ s website
www.csr.com or from the Company
Secretary at the Company’ s registered
office) on the Company’ s framework
of executive remuneration and its
cost. It also determines on behalf 
of the Board, specific remuneration
packages for each of the executive
directors and for the Chairman. 
The Committee administers the
Company’ s share incentive plans 
for employees and monitors and
provides guidance on the level and
structure of remuneration for senior
management who report to the 
Chief Executive. The Board itself
determines the remuneration of the
non-executive directors. No director
plays a part in any discussion about
their own remuneration.
Mr Mackintosh is chairman of the
Committee. There is no immediate
intention for Mr Mackintosh to
relinquish this role, notwithstanding
that he will be taking on the role as
Chairman of the Board with effect
from 2 May 2007. It is however the
intention of the Board to keep this
matter under review in connection
with the intention of the Board to
appoint an additional non-executive
director during 2007. The other
current members of the Committee,
all of whom are independent non-
executive directors within the
definition of the Code, are set out on
pages 40 and 41. As a result of the
amendment made during the year 
to the Combined Code, Mr Whybrow,
Chairman of the Board, attended
meetings of the Committee as a
member . The Company Secretary
acts as secretary to the Committee.
Mr Giacoletto was appointed as a
member of the Committee on 4
January 2007. None of the members
of the Committee has any personal
financial interest (other than as
shareholders), conflicts of interests
arising from cross-directorships or
day-to-day involvement in running
the business of the Company. 
A detailed evaluation of the
performance of the Committee 
was conducted during 2005, which
was the subject of a further review 
in 2006, in regards to which more
information is contained in the
Corporate Governance report 
on page 39.
The Committee has access to
detailed external research from
independent consultants. During 
the year professional advice has 
been provided by New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP and Slaughter and
May. Both advisers were appointed
by the Committee. Slaughter and
May act as legal advisers to the
Company generally. New Bridge
Street Consultants LLP provides 
no other services to the Company.
The Committee determines policy 
for the remuneration of the executive
directors and is consulted and
provides guidance on the broader
remuneration policies for the Group
below Board level based on the
recommendations of the Chief
Executive Officer and the other
executive directors. Further information
on meetings held and attendance 
by the members of the Committee 
is disclosed in the Corporate
Governance report on page 43. 
The Directors’ report on
remuneration for the period ended 
30 December 2005 was approved 
by the shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting held in May 2006.
As required by the Companies Act,
shareholders will be invited to approve
this report at the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 2 May 2007.
This report has been prepared in
accordance with Schedule 7A to 
the Companies Act 1985. The report
also meets the relevant requirements
of the Listing Rules of the Financial
REMUNERATION REPORT Changing the way the world connects
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006
A detailed review of the remuneration
policy of the Board was undertaken
prior to the Company’ s flotation and
in November 2005 at the time of the
appointment of John Scarisbrick as
Chief Executive Officer Designate.
The Committee considers that the
present policy is appropriate and do
not intend making changes to the
structure or basic terms of the incentive
arrangements for executive directors.
BASIC SALARY
An executive director’ s basic salary 
is reviewed by the Committee prior 
to the beginning of each year and
when an individual changes position
or responsibility. When making a
determination as to the appropriate
remuneration, the Committee
considers remuneration practices
within the Group as a whole and
where considered relevant, consults
objective research on companies
within the Company’ s and Group’ s
UK listed peers with an international
focus. The target salary is at the
median, with the opportunity to go
above this level, subject to sustained
individual performance. With the
exception of Mr Scarisbrick, who is
paid part of his remuneration in US
Dollars and part in Pounds Sterling,
the executive directors are paid in
Pounds Sterling. Details of the basic
salary of the executive directors for
the period ended 29 December 2006
are set forth in the table on page 56.
Current salaries at February 2007 are:
James Collier £257,250
Glenn Collinson £231,000
Paul Goodridge £231,000
John Scarisbrick $735,000
Increases of 5% took effect from 
1 January 2007 which have been 
felt appropriate in order to maintain
the policy of mid-market base pay 
set against UK listed companies 
of similar size and international 
focus and reflecting that the
Company is competing in a global
market. The Committee still feels 
that UK listed companies are the
correct benchmark yet will keep 
this under review as the Company
develops and expands further. 
Services Authority and describes
how the Board has applied the
Principles of Good Governance
relating to directors’ remuneration. 
The Act requires the auditors to
report to the Company’ s members 
on certain parts of the Remuneration
Report and to state whether in their
opinion those parts of the report have
been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act
1985. The report has therefore been
divided into separate sections for
audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive remuneration packages
are designed in order to attract,
motivate and retain employees 
of the highest calibre required by 
the Group in order to achieve its
objectives, to meet the needs of
customers and enhance value to
shareholders. There are five main
elements of the remuneration
package for executive directors and
senior management, which include
medium and long term incentives
comprising basic annual salary,
benefits-in-kind, the opportunity to
participate in a money purchase
pension, a cash bonus plan and
participation in the Company’ s share
incentive plans.
The Company’ s policy is that a
substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive
directors should be performance-
related. The payment of both cash
bonuses and the vesting of share
incentives are subject to meeting
performance conditions established
by the Committee at the beginning 
of each performance period reflecting
what, at that time, the Committee
considers to be demanding targets.
These targets are set taking
appropriate account of the challenging
and rapidly evolving market in which
the Group operates, and the
expectations of the investment
community on the Company’ s
potential future performance.

REMUNERATION REPORT 
continued BENEFITS-IN-KIND
The executive directors receive
certain benefits-in-kind, comprising
private medical insurance, life
assurance of four times basic salary,
and personal accident insurance and
subsistence expenses. Mr Scarisbrick
has been provided with a relocation
allowance and homebuyer protection
to facilitate re-location to Cambridge,
where the Company’ s head office is
located, subject to his moving in the
next two years.
CASH BONUS PLAN 
The Committee is responsible for
determining on what basis to
incentivise employees, including
executive directors, through a cash
bonus plan. The Committee
establishes against defined targets
the minimum threshold at which a
bonus will be payable and the
maximum potential award. In setting
appropriate bonus thresholds and
targets, the Committee may refer 
to the objective research on a
comparator group as noted on 
page 50.
For the cash bonus plan applicable 
to executive directors in 2006, the
targets were set after considering 
the Company’ s budgeted operating
profit and market expectations. 
The budget was agreed based upon
objectives which were considered 
to be appropriate and stretching
against the background of an
operating profit for the year ended
December 2005 of $112 million. 
Achievement of targets based 
on the Company’ s financial and 
strategic objectives and the personal
performance of individual directors
would result in determination by 
the Committee of the appropriate
size of the bonus having regard to
actual performance against the
targets. The maximum potential
bonus payable for the 52 weeks
ended 29 December 2006 to 
Mr Scarisbrick was equivalent to
100% of salary and for the other
executive directors was 80% of salary . 
The bonus paid to the directors for the
52 weeks ended 29 December 2006
are as follows;
J D Y Collier £73,255
G Collinson £65,780
P G G Goodridge £65,780
J C Scarisbrick $191,100
As explained earlier in this report, 
the policy of the Company is that 
a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive
directors should be performance-
related. When considering the
conditions for the cash bonus plan 
to apply in 2007, the Committee
determined that it would give further
emphasis to the performance-related
element of the remuneration of the
executive directors as a whole by
permitting a maximum bonus
potential of 100%. T argets for the
bonus plan for 2007 have been
determined by taking into account
the financial targets and strategic
objectives of the Company , with due
regard for market expectations in
addition to personal objectives set for
each of the executive directors.
The Committee considers this to 
be consistent with bonus schemes
operated by the Company’ s UK 
listed benchmark group and with
maintaining a mid market competitive
remuneration position whilst taking
appropriate account of the fact that
the Company is competing in a
global market.
SHARE OPTION PLANS
The Company has four share 
option plans, intended to facilitate 
the motivation and retention of
employees. T wo of the plans were
established prior to the Company’ s
flotation, being the Founders Share
Option Plan and the Global Share
Option Plan. Whilst not all the awards
under these two plans have fully
vested, the schemes are closed for
the purpose of any new awards, 
and neither scheme was used during
2006 for grants to executive directors
or to other employees.
Following shareholder approval at the
2004 Annual General Meeting, the
Company established the CSR plc
Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’). 
The reason for the introduction of 
this scheme was to incentivise the
executive directors and employees
whilst aligning their interests more
closely with those of the Company’ s
shareholders. The Committee has
responsibility for supervising the
CSOP and the grant of options in
accordance with its rules.
Options granted to executive
directors and senior managers 
may be exercised between three 
and ten years after the date of grant,
subject to the Company satisfying
predetermined performance
conditions. The performance criterion
is based on growth in the Company’ s
Earnings Per Share (EPS). With the
exception of awards made quarterly to
Mr Scarisbrick during 2006 which,
pursuant to the terms of his
recruitment are based on the EPS
condition prevailing at the time he
entered into his service agreement in
November 2005, for those awards
made in 2006 no options will vest if the
growth in EPS is below a compound
12% per annum plus RPI. If the
Company’ s EPS growth exceeds a
compound 12% per annum plus RPI,
30% of the options awarded will vest.
If the Company’ s EPS growth
exceeds a compound 14% per
annum plus RPI an additional 50% 
of the share options will vest. If the
Company’ s EPS growth exceeds a
compound 17% per annum plus RPI
all options will vest. No re-testing is
permitted. The criteria, which was
determined at the start of 2006, was
considered by the Committee to be
challenging and appropriately aligned
with shareholder interest to achieving
continued improvement in the
financial performance of the Company
closely linked to sustained growth
over the three years.
The rules of the CSOP do not 
allow for options to be granted at 
a discount to the Company’ s share
price at the date of grant. Changing the way the world connects
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006
conditions determined by the
Committee in December 2005. 
As was reported in the Committee’ s
report for the period to 30 December
2005, the Committee had previously
determined that in respect of the
CSOP grants, the performance
conditions had been satisfied for a
shortened performance period to 
30 December 2005.
The Company operates an Inland
Revenue approved SAYE Share
Option Scheme for eligible employees
under which options may be granted
at a discount of up to 20% of market
value. Executive directors are eligible
to participate in the SAYE Share
Option Scheme.
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS 
At the Annual General Meeting held 
in May 2005, shareholders approved
the introduction of a new Share Award
Plan called the CSR Share Award
Plan. Awards are made to executive
directors and other employees at the
discretion of the Committee. Awards
for all participating employees are
subject to a three year retention
period and the requirement that,
subject to certain mitigating factors,
the participant is an employee at 
the end of the retention period. 
In addition, for executive directors
and other senior employees, vesting
of the Share Awards is subject to
stretching targets based on T otal
Shareholder Return, (‘TSR’) over the
fixed three year retention period with
an additional requirement that the
Company should have achieved a
sustained improvement in underlying
financial performance over the same
three year period. In measuring the
TSR, it is averaged over the three
month periods prior to the beginning
and the end of the retention period.
The Committee will assess the
performance of the Company’ s TSR
performance against a comparator
group of UK and overseas
companies. The constituent
members of the comparator 
group are shown on page 54.

The Company’ s policy is to grant
options to executive directors at the
discretion of the Committee up to a
maximum of 200% of salary, taking
into account individual performance.
Pursuant to the rules of the CSOP ,
the Committee also reserves to its
discretion the right to grant awards 
at a higher proportion of basic 
salary and which, in exceptional
circumstances only, could be up 
to 400% of basic salary. 
Under the service agreement 
entered into with John Scarisbrick,
awards equivalent to 400% of his
basic salary were made in equal
instalments of a quarter every three
months commencing December
2005 and concluding in September
2006. These options cannot be
exercised until the third anniversary 
of each grant and will be dependent
upon achieving the EPS performance
condition pursuant to the rules of the
CSOP for awards in place when 
Mr Scarisbrick commenced
employment in 2005.
It is intended that awards made in
2007 to executive directors will vest
according to stretching EPS targets
which for 2007 awards will provide
for the proportion of the award that
vests to increase against pre-
determined thresholds set by the
Committee subject to the Company
meeting or exceeding those
thresholds. No options will vest if 
the growth in the Company’ s EPS 
is below a compound 12% per
annum plus RPI. If the Company’ s
EPS growth meets or exceeds a
compound 12% per annum plus RPI,
30% of the share options will vest. 
If the Company’ s EPS growth meets
or exceeds a compound 14% per
annum plus RPI an additional 50% 
of the share options will vest. If the
Company’ s EPS growth meets or
exceeds a compound 17% per
annum plus RPI all options will vest.
Following his retirement in February
2006, John Hodgson exercised all
those options granted to him under
the Global Share Option Plan and 
the CSOP in accordance with the

REMUNERATION REPORT 
continued international companies that are
either customers, suppliers or
competitors of CSR in the
telecommunications and
semiconductor industries with 
whom the Committee considers the
performance of the Company can
most appropriately be compared.
There is no intention to change the
comparator group from that
established for the awards made 
in 2005 and 2006. 
For the awards made in 2006 and to
be made in 2007 the Committee has
determined certain thresholds which
have to be satisfied in order for part or
all of the award to vest. 
If the TSR performance is below 
the median of the comparator group,
no shares will vest. If the performance
is at median, 30% of the shares will
vest, whilst for performance between
median and the upper quartile the
proportion of shares which will vest 
is determined on a straightline basis
pro-rata between 30% and 100%.
For performance in the upper quartile
or higher , 100% of the shares will vest.
The award lapses if the performance
condition has not been satisfied at
the end of the retention period.
In the event that the TSR performance
meets the conditions of vesting, 
the Committee will, prior to vesting,
also consider the underlying financial
performance of the Company and
whether in light of this performance,
vesting should be permitted. 
The Committee will in a year in 
which an award vests, report to
shareholders on the underlying
financial performance which was
considered when approving vesting. 
The adoption of TSR as the primary
performance criterion, which applies
to executive directors and other
senior employees, was chosen to
ensure that the vesting of benefits
was directly aligned to the interests 
of shareholders. The inclusion 
within the performance criteria of 
the consideration of the underlying
financial performance of the
Company was adopted to ensure
that at the vesting of the award
appropriate account is taken of the
extent to which the Company’ s own
performance has contributed to the
growth in shareholder value. These
criteria were adopted following
consultation with the Company’ s
advisers and institutional shareholders.
The Committee considers that 
these performance conditions are
appropriate for the form of award 
and are suitably stretching.
The share awards are intended to
reward strong relative performance,
whilst share options will continue 
to reward absolute performance. 
In accordance with the rules of 
the CSR Share Award Plan, the
Committee will reserve the right to
grant awards at a proportion of basic
salary normally up to a maximum of
100% of salary (200% in exceptional
circumstances). 
Under the service agreement entered
into with Mr Scarisbrick on 1 November
2005, awards equivalent to 200% 
of his basic salary were made in equal
instalments of a quarter every three
months commencing in December
2005 and concluding in September
2006. These awards will not vest until
the third anniversary of each award
and subject to the satisfaction of the
performance conditions.
Following his retirement in February
2006, John Hodgson exercised those
options granted to him under the
CSR Share Award Plan in accordance
with the conditions determined by
the Committee in December 2005.
As was reported in the Committee’ s
report for the period to 30 December
2005, the Committee had previously
determined that the performance
conditions had been satisfied for a
shortened performance period to 
30 December 2005.

Contributions are determined as a
percentage of the employee’ s gross
basic salary. Details of the actual
contributions made by the Group to
the UK Pension Plan on behalf of the
executive directors are set out in the
table on page 57. 
With the exception of Mr Scarisbrick,
who is entitled to retire at age 58,
normal retirement age is 65 for
employees and executive directors. 
Other than basic salary, no element 
of the directors’ remuneration is
pensionable. 
Pursuant to the terms of his service
agreement, Mr Scarisbrick has elected
for a cash payment equivalent to 20%
of his gross salary , from which tax and
other statutory deductions are made.
This payment is in lieu of a contribution
of 20% of his gross salary to the
Group’ s UK and US pension plans for
the twelve month period ended 29
December 2006.
No significant amendments are
proposed to be made to the terms
and conditions of any entitlement

share incentive plans. 
The level of award is considered 
each year in the light of performance.
The Company monitors the awards
of shares made under the various

continued ISSUE OF SHARES
Necessary for the successful
recruitment of and pursuant to the
service agreement with Mr Scarisbrick,
he was on 15 December 2005
conditionally awarded 100,000
shares in the Company. The shares
vest in three instalments dependent
on continued employment and
payment by Mr Scarisbrick of the
nominal value of the shares.
Commencing 30 November 2008

SHARE OWNERSHIP
During 2006 the Board adopted 
as part of its remuneration policies, 
a requirement for executive directors
to hold ordinary shares in the Company
in order to be eligible to participate
fully in the share incentive plans. 
The policy reflects the Company’ s
belief that its executive directors
should also be shareholders.
Executive directors have five years
from introduction of the requirement
or appointment to the Board in 
which to establish a shareholding
which can be satisfied through the
retention of shares derived from the
exercise of vested awards under 
the Company’ s share incentive plans.
The executive directors are required
to hold shares equivalent to 100% 
of their basic annual salary.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The graph adjacent shows the
Company’ s performance, measured
by total shareholder return, compared
with the performance of the FTSE
250 index. 
The FTSE 250 index has been
selected for this comparison 
because it is a broad equity index 
of which CSR plc is a constituent
company. The graph covers the
period since the Company was listed
on the London Stock Exchange.

It is the Company’ s policy that
executive directors should have
contracts of an indefinite term.

contract which is subject to one 
year’ s notice from the Company.
Each of Mr Collier, Mr Collinson 
and Mr Goodridge have service
agreements requiring them to give 
six months’ notice to the Company.
Mr Scarisbrick has a service
agreement requiring that he give 
three months’ notice to the Company .

In the event of termination, a director
would be entitled to a payment not
exceeding one year’ s basic salary. 
In an appropriate case, the Company
would have regard to the departing
director’ s duty to mitigate loss.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
All non-executive directors have
specific terms of engagement provided
in formal letters of appointment and
their remuneration is determined by
the Board within the limits set by 
the Articles of Association and based
on independent surveys of fees paid
to non-executive directors of similar
companies which are considered
annually. The non-executive directors
are appointed for a fixed term,
subject to re-appointment by the
shareholders. All non-executive
directors are appointed for a fixed
three year term, with the exception of
Mr T ucker whose letter of appointment
was renewed in January 2007 for 
two years. The terms and conditions

inspection at the Company’ s
registered office during normal
business hours on request to the
Company Secretary and up to 15
minutes prior to and at the Company’ s

The fees payable to non-executive
directors were reviewed in December
2006. It was determined that the fees
would remain unchanged, subject to
further review during 2007 to coincide
with the appointment of a new
Chairman of the Board. The basic fee
paid to each non-executive director
for the 52 weeks to 29 December
2006 was £36,000. An additional 
fee of £5,000 was paid for the
chairmanship of the Audit Committee,
whilst for acting as chair of the
Remuneration Committee, the fee
paid was £5,000. Mr T ucker who is
the senior independent director was
paid £5,000 for acting in that capacity .
Non-executive directors do not
receive any bonus, do not participate
in awards under the Company’ s share
schemes and are not eligible to join
the Company’ s pension schemes. 
Mr Mackintosh who is proposed 
for re-election and Mr Giacoletto 
who is proposed for election at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting,
being non-executive directors, 
do not have a service contract.

  The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements. The directors are required to prepare financial statements
for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and have also elected to prepare financial statements for the
Company in accordance with IFRS. Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’ s financial position,
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards
Board’ s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved 
by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards. Directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’ s financial position and financial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company , for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for 
the preparation of a directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Changing the way the world connects
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
We have audited the Group and individual Company financial statements (‘the financial statements’) of CSR plc for the period ended 29 December
2006 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and individual Company balance sheets, the consolidated and individual
Company cash flow statements, the consolidated and individual Company statements of changes in shareholders’ equity , the statement of
accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 37. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’ s members, as a body , in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’ s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and 
for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’ s members as a body , for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement 
of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether , in our opinion, the information given in the directors’ report is
consistent with the financial statements,
In addition, we report to you if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether 
the board’ s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’ s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information as described in the contents section contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the 
Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state 
of the Group’ s affairs as at 29 December 2006 and of its profit for the period then ended;
• the individual Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as applied 
in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, of the individual Company’ s affairs as at 29 December 2006; 
• the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group’ s financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
• the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs 
As explained in Note 2, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
has also complied with the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. In our opinion the financial statements give a true 
and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’ s affairs as at 29 December 2006 and of its profit for the period then ended.

CONSOLIDA TED CASH FLOW ST A TEMENT  52 weeks ended 29 December 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS   For the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2006
1 General information
CSR plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered office is given on page 89.
The nature of the Group’ s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group
operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial
statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures; and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures
The directors anticipate that the adoption of this Standard in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the standard comes into effect for periods commencing 
on or after 1 January 2007.
All Standards and Interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective have been considered and those that are applicable have been
applied in these financial statements.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European
Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial information has been prepared on the basis of all applicable IFRS, including all International Accounting Standards (IAS), Standing
Interpretations Committee (SIC) interpretations and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and effective before 29 December 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The financial statements cover the 52 week period from 31 December 2005 to 29 December 2006, the comparatives are presented for the 
52 week period from 1 January 2005 to 30 December 2005. The financial statements are reported on a 52 week basis to be consistent with 
the Group’ s internal reporting.
During 2006, the Group decided on the early adoption of IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions.’ This has resulted in 
a retrospective change in accounting policy for recording the grants of equity instruments in the Company to employees of its subsidiaries. 
The retrospective application of this Interpretation has resulted in a restatement of the Company-only financial statements for the 52 weeks 
ended 30 December 2005. There is no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In 2005, the effect of the restatement on the 
Company-only financial statements was to increase the carrying amount of the Company’ s investment in subsidiaries by $3,167,000 
and increase trade and other payables by $3,167,000.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of CSR plc (the Company) and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) drawn up to the dates indicated in the primary financial statements. Control is achieved where the Company has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary , adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those 
used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair value,
at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the
acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess of 
the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of the acquisition
below the fair vale of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities of a subsidiary , associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually . Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss 
and is not subsequently reversed. Changing the way the world connects

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS   For the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2006
Continued
2 Accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill (continued)
On disposal of a subsidiary , associate or jointly controlled entity , the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit 
or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, 
VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Royalty income is recognised upon shipment of the royalty earning product by the licencee. 
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered on a percentage of completion basis. 
Revenue from post contract support is recognised over the period of performance. The excess of service fees and post-contract support 
invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred income.
Revenue is shown net of estimated provision for credit notes and returns.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or , if lower , at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability . Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of CSR plc is the US dollar . T ransactions in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation 
are included in the net profit or loss for the period. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts (see below for details of the Group’ s
accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly . Exchange
differences arising, if any , are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’ s exchange retranslation reserve. Such translation differences are
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Differences between contributions payable
in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Taxation
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year . T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group’ s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences, unused carried forward tax losses and unused carried  2 Accounting policies (continued)
T axation (continued)
forward tax credits can be utilised. However , such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from:
• goodwill; 
• the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit 
nor the accounting profit;
• investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity , in which case deferred tax 
is also dealt with in equity .
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when
they relate to income taxed levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight 
line method, on the following basis:
Computer equipment 2 to 3 years
T est equipment 2 to 5 years
Office equipment 3 years
Furniture and fittings 5 years
Leasehold improvements minimum lease period
Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, 
if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In general residual values are zero or negligible, due to the technical and specialised nature of assets held. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or , where shorter , 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible fixed assets are stated at cost or fair value for items acquired in business combinations, net of amortisation and any provision for
impairment. No amortisation is provided on assets in the course of construction. On other intangible fixed assets amortisation is provided at rates
calculated to write off the cost or fair value, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Software licences licence term
Customer contracts and relationships 3 years
Purchased R&D 4 years
Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, 
if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In general residual values are zero or negligible, due to the technical and specialised nature of assets held. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or , where shorter , 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. 68 | 69

2 Accounting policies (continued)
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’ s product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified (such as a new device or software);
• the project from which the asset arises meets the Group’ s criteria for assessing technical feasibility; 
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably .
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can
be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for
impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately .
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as 
income immediately .
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, those overheads that 
have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the FIFO method. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Trade receivables
T rade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require
delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. 
Investments consist of money market deposits in USD, GBP , Euros and Indian Rupees. Interest income is recorded as it accrues over the period 
of the investment at rates fixed at the time of inception. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
T rade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses foreign exchange
forward contracts to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s policies approved by the board of directors, which provides written principles 
on the use of financial derivatives. The Group hedges forecast GBP expenditure for the following 11 to 15 months.  2 Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments (continued)
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates. Changes in the fair 
value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the
recognition of an asset or liability , then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had
previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability . For hedges that do not result in the recognition 
of an asset or a liability , amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitment 
or forecasted transaction affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement 
as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur , the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit 
or loss for the period.
Provisions
Provisions for warranty and returns costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the Group’ s liability .
Provision is made for onerous contracts at the fair value of the minimum unavoidable lease payments.
Share-based payment
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied 
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, including share options with non-market based vesting conditions.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the majority of share options in issue. The expected life used in the model has been
adjusted, based on management’ s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability , exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For certain share options which include TSR related conditions; the fair value is estimated through the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Inventory valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded based upon assumptions
about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favourable than those projected by management, additional
inventory provisions may be required. The carrying amount of inventory at 29 December 2006 was $106.5 million (2005: $69.7 million).
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating
units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the
cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of 
the goodwill at 29 December 2006 was $52.0 million (2005: $52.7 million).
Provisions
Determining the level of provision required for returns and warranty claims, requires management to review the historic levels of usage whilst
considering the growth in the business and other changes which have occurred in the manufacturing cycle. The carrying amount of the provision 
at 29 December 2006 was $4.1 million (2005: $3.9 million).

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the single cash-generating unit.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined from a value in use calculation. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the Group. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. 11 Goodwill (continued)
The calculation has been based on the most recent cash flow forecasts for the next 3 years which have been approved by management. 
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11%.
At the time of the acquisitions in 2005 the acquired entities included brought forward tax losses. These were not recognised at the time of the 
acquisition as it was not considered probable that taxable profit would be available against which these losses could be utilised. During 2006, 
a deferred tax asset has been recognised for some of these losses and, in accordance with IFRS 3, an equivalent adjustment has been made to goodwill.
The charge of $745,000 was included in administrative expenses.

The average credit period taken on trade receivables is 45 days (2005: 42 days). An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts
within trade receivables of $92,000 (2005: $162,000). This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
T reasury deposits
T reasury deposits represent bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, treasury deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Group’ s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances 
for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned 
by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
Interest rate risk
The Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations of interest rates other than those on interest-bearing balances. The majority of cash balances 
are held at fixed rates of interest.
17 Derivative financial instruments
Currency derivatives
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. The instruments purchased are denominated in GBP .
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed is as below:
2006 2005
$’000 $’000
Forward foreign exchange contracts 89,441 87,791
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next 12 months (2005: 14 months) and are renewed 
on a revolving basis to cover between 11 and 15 months forward.
At the balance sheet date, the fair value of the Group’ s currency derivatives is shown below:
2006 2005
$’000 $’000
Forward foreign exchange contracts 4,522 (3,828)
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. The fair value of currency derivatives that 
are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounting to $4,522,000 (2005: liability $3,828,000) has been deferred in equity .
Amounts of $1,775,000 (2005 : $590,000) and $288,000 (2005 : $121,000) respectively have been transferred to the income statement 
and fixed assets in respect of contracts matured in the period. 76 | 77

tax asset has been recognised in respect of $9,600,000 (2005: $850,000) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 
the remaining $76,500,000 (2005: $58,850,000) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams within certain subsidiary entities. Included in
unrecognised tax losses are losses of $36,400,000 (2005: $22,800,000) that will expire in 18-20 years. Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely .
At 29 December 2006 there were no recognised or unrecognised deferred tax liabilities (2005: $nil) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted
earnings of certain of the Group’ s subsidiaries, as the Group has no liability to additional taxation should such amounts be remitted due to the 
availability of double taxation relief.

27 Share-based payments
CSR plc has grants and awards in the following Share Schemes which result in charges to the Income Statement:
Global share option scheme
The Company has a share option scheme for all employees of the Group, under which share options were issued prior to flotation, at a price based 
on the most recent private funding round. All employees were granted options on joining CSR. These options have a vesting period of 5 years, 
with 20% of options vesting 1 year after grant, then the remainder vesting in equal quarterly instalments over the remaining 4 years. Other options 
(in addition to those related to employees joining) were also granted under this scheme. In all cases if the options remain unexercised after a period 
of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. No grants have
been made under this scheme since flotation.
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Company introduced a new scheme at flotation called the CSR plc Share Option Plan. The following grants have been made under the scheme:
Flotation grant
On the Company’ s flotation in February 2004, the Company issued share options to all employees, at a price based on the share price on the day 
of flotation. The vesting period is 3 years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Performance grants
On the Company’ s flotation in February 2004, and in May 2005, May 2006 and certain other dates (relating to employees joining) the Company
issued share options at a price based on the average share price over the preceding three days. The vesting period of these grants is 3 years and
vesting is dependent meeting certain EPS based performance conditions. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the 
date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Starter grants
The Company grants options to new starters to assist in recruitment. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average share price on the 
three days preceding the grant date or the immediately preceding dealing day . The vesting period of the options is over a period of five years with
40% vesting after two years and 5% vesting each quarter thereafter . Grants are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The Company has also issued starter grants to senior employees that vest after three years.
CSR Share Award Plan
In May 2005, following approval of shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, the Company introduced the CSR plc Share Award Plan, 
which allows for options to be granted for exercise at a future date at a price equivalent to the nominal value of the Company’ s shares of £0.001. 
The following awards have been made:
Retention Awards
The Company issues certain employees with rights to purchase shares at nominal value (£0.001) as a method of staff retention. The vesting period 
of these share awards is 3 years. If the share awards remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the awards expire. 
Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Performance Awards
The Company issues certain employees with rights to purchase shares at nominal value (£0.001) as a method of staff incentivisation. The vesting 
period of these share awards is 3 years. The vesting of the awards is also subject to the Company satisfying two performance conditions. The first is 
the T otal Shareholder Return of the Company’ s shares when compared to a basket of companies selected at the time an award is first granted. 
In order for the shares to vest, the Company must have met or exceeded certain TSR thresholds compared with the TSR performance of the basket 
of other companies. In the event the Company satisfies any one of the TRS thresholds, the Remuneration Committee then considers the extent 
of any improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company . 27 Share-based payments (continued)
SAYE Schemes
The Company operates a SAYE scheme, whereby employees are allowed to subscribe to a monthly savings amount for a period of 3 years; at the end 
of the three year period, the employee is allowed to either receive their saved amount plus interest or purchase shares in the Company at a price based
on the average share price on the three days prior or the immediately preceding dealing day to each contract invitation date, discounted by 20%. 
This scheme is open to all employees subject to Inland Revenue approved limits on total investment, and invitations are issued every six months.
Employees have a period of six months following the conclusion of each contract to exercise their option to purchase shares.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was £11.33. The options outstanding at 
29 December 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of £2.96, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6 years. In 2006, options 
were granted on 1 March, 31 March, 3 May , 25 May , 1 June, 2 August, 1 September , 1 November and 15 November . The aggregate estimated fair 
value of the options granted on those dates is $22,296,000. The weighted average fair value of these options was $10.40. In 2005, options were
granted on 29 March, 4 April, 5 May , 1 November and 15 December . The aggregate estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates 
is $7,575,000. The weighted average fair value of these options was $4.23. 
The fair values of the share option and share award grants were based on the following inputs:

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’ s share price over the period since flotation. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on management’ s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability ,
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’ s share price over the period since flotation. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted based on management’ s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability , exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations. The adjustments for the performance conditions are reflected in the proportion of options anticipated to vest. 82 | 83

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on management’ s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability , 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
Retention award
The fair value was based upon the share price on the date of grant.
Performance Awards
The fair value was based upon Monte-Carlo simulation of the performance of the 40 comparator companies included in the TSR conditions of the
award. Following the de-listing of TTP Com during the year , this company was removed from the comparator group in accordance with the provisions 
in the Plan rules and will not be replaced.
Expected volatility for each Company was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the individual Company’ s share price over the longer 
of the period from flotation and 3 years from the date of grant.
Early vesting of share options
On 15 December 2005, the Remuneration Committee determined that options granted to John Hodgson, then Chief Executive Officer , 
could be exercised early in conjunction with his retirement, effective 28 February 2006. It was also determined that the performance conditions 
applying to each options grant would be assessed as at December 2005, which it was agreed had been satisfied. Accordingly , all options granted 
under each of the CSR Share Award Plan, the CSR Global Share Option Plan and the CSR plc Share Option Plan vested effective 28 February 2006.
The incremental fair value of $637,000 was expensed over the remaining vesting period. The incremental fair value was measured based upon the
share price at the date of the modification, following the acceleration of the performance period.
Share option charges
The Group recognised total expenses of $7,836,000 (2005: $2,408,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2006 
and 2005 respectively . 28 Retirement benefits scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately 
from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. 
The total cost charged to income of $4,347,000 represents contributions payable to this scheme by the Group at rates specified in the rules 
of the plan. As at 29 December 2006, contributions of $894,000 (2005: $468,000) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been 
paid over to the scheme.
29 Events after the balance sheet date
On 12 January 2007, CSR plc acquired the entire issued share capital of Cambridge Positioning Systems Limited for a total cash consideration 
of $35 million. Also on 12 January 2007, CSR plc acquired the entire issued share capital of NordNav T echnologies AB for an initial cash 
consideration of $40 million. A further cash consideration of up to $35 million may be payable subject to future performance objectives being 
met by NordNav. The acquisitions were financed entirely from CSR’ s existing cash resources.
It is too early to give an indication of the goodwill likely to arise as a result of these acquisitions as the purchase price allocation is yet to be finalised.

The amounts disclosed for 2003 and earlier periods are stated on the basis of UK GAAP because it is not practicable to restate amounts for periods
prior to the date of transition to IFRS. 
The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS that resulted in a restatement of the 2004 financial statements on transition were as follows:
• A charge was recognised in respect of share options falling under the scope of IFRS 2;
• The deferred tax asset was increased as a result of the additional tax benefit in the year from the recording of share-based payment charges;
• Computer software was reclassified on the balance sheet so as to be intangible assets;
• Amounts were reclassified on the balance sheet between treasury deposits and cash and cash equivalents;
• T ax liabilities were shown separately on the balance sheet;
• Liabilities related to the purchase of intangible licences under payment plans were reclassified as finance leases;
• Provisions were split between those greater than one year and less than one year . The only period effected by the transition was 2004; 
2005 was presented under IFRS.
Detailed disclosures for the effect of the transition to IFRS were given in the 2005 financial statements. SHARE AND CORPORA TE INFORMA TION

CUSTOMERS
EXPANDING OUR
PORTFOLIO
THE BEST
ARCHITECTURE
We operate in some of the
most competitive markets
in the world, where success
demands an extraordinary
degree of silicon integration,
and ease of use.
From the outset, CSR 
has focused on ease of
application, with software-
rich, single chip wireless
modem solutions. We also
provide example designs,
to help our customers
bring complete products
rapidly into production. 
As well as standard
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips,
we make variants with
additional functions that
reduce the cost, space
and time to bring new
products to market. 
Our on-chip DSP and 
our FM tuner , for example,
lower the cost of solutions
for markets such as
wireless stereo headsets,
and phones with built-in
radio receivers. 
The wireless industry moves
at an almost frantic pace,
and competition between
technologies is fierce.
Our gifted team of
designers has a long track
record in making the right
technology choices, and
the right implementation
decisions. We also place
great emphasis on
understanding the needs
and ambitions of our
clients, striving to build
partnerships that allow 
us to share and refine
‘product roadmaps’ – 
to our mutual benefit.
T o this end, we now have 
a presence in 10 countries,
plus a large network of
distributors, major R&D
centres in Europe 
and the USA and almost 
all our offices provide local
application support. 
Progress in short-range
wireless communication
technologies is catalysing
an incredible array of new
electronic products, and
CSR has evolved rapidly
from its Bluetooth roots 
to exploit these
opportunities. We have
combined Bluetooth with
an integrated FM receiver ,
launched a Wi-Fi chip,
announced that we will be
providing GPS to our
customers for less 
than $1, confirmed that 
we will be producing UWB 
(Ultra Wideband) and
announced our support 
for Wibree. 
These technologies 
open up many new
applications, and enhance
our growth potential
substantially. Our ability to
offer a broad range of
wireless technologies
helps us deal with the
world’s largest electronic
manufacturers, who seek
out broadly based suppliers
as trusted partners to help
bring world-beating
products to market.
CSR started life with a
great idea – an innovation
that allowed radio circuitry
to be manufactured using
low-cost CMOS
technology , enabling us 
to produce single-chip
solutions that combine
radio and digital circuitry .
From day one, our chips
were optimised for battery-
powered applications.
For product manufacturers,
this has meant major cost
savings, in terms of bill of
materials and the physical
space needed for new
functions. All, critically , for
only a marginal increase in
power consumption. 
Our focus on integrating as
much circuitry as possible
has now driven the
evolution of five generations
of Bluetooth, and two of
Wi-Fi chips. As a result
over the last few years, we
have solved a major
problem for portable
device designers, with
innovations that allow
multiple radios to co-exist.
HANDSETS MONO HEADSETS
MP3 PLAYERS
Mobile phones are the
universal portable device,
and manufacturers need
new wireless
technologies to help
them add new functions.
Bluetooth is well
established in this
market, and we’re now
working on ‘dual mode’
(cellular plus Wi-Fi)
phones.
Our share of this major
Bluetooth market
continues to grow, with
devices that improve
performance and lower
costs. This established
application is now being
joined by wireless
headsets for VoIP (Voice
over Internet Protocol)
communications.
The newest MP3 players
are going wire-free with
Bluetooth – for stereo
headphones – and some
have the ability to act as 
a headset and/or hands-
free accessory to a
phone as well.
PCs
Our exciting new solution
for the major market for
hands-free telephony
includes integrated
echo/noise cancellation.
And this is just the first of
many high volume
applications in the
automotive sector .
The percentage of
Notebook computers
that are being supplied
with Bluetooth is
considerable and
growing. The wireless 
link is used in many ways,
from mouse interfacing
and synchronisation with
cellphones, to audio
connections.
STEREO HEADSETS
2006 saw the
introduction of numerous
mobile phones that can
use Bluetooth to stream
stereo music wirelessly 
to headphones – our
stereo headphone
solution is the most
integrated and offers the
best audio quality for this
growing application.

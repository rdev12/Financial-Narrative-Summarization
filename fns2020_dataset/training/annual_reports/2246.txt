“d igitally-distributed sales at 
Bloomsbury are up by 71%. the 
g roup’s cash has been deployed in 
acquisitions which have sustained 
dividend growth at a compound 
annual rate of 7% over the past 6 
years. Bloomsbury has no net debt. 
And Bloomsbury businesses continue 
to develop in the growth economies 
of india and the middle east.”
Jeremy wilson Chairman
B
loomsbury’s robust performance over  
the past year has been achieved enjoying the 
new advantages and benefits of the digital 
revolution. 
The Chief Executive’s Report which follows this Chairman’s 
Statement provides detailed commentary on a publishing 
company addressing, in all aspects of its strategy, the 
opportunities and risks which these conditions present. 
That strategy, largely set in 2008, continues to develop. 
Despite the economic back-cloth throughout that period, 
it has led to steady growth in a company undergoing 
a fundamental transformation in its business model. 
The intention is to continue along this path, sharing the 
weight of traditional trade publishing with non-trade 
activity (the latter now accounts for 61% of the Group’s 
operating profit and 33% of its revenue) and driving new 
propositions, improved customer service, efficiency, and 
profit out of the digital opportunity.
Digitally-distributed sales at Bloomsbury are up by 71%. 
E-book sales of £9.1 million now represent 9% of total 
Group revenue. The Group’s cash, in a world where interest 
rates have been sedated by central bank policy, has been 
deployed – but not exhausted – in acquisitions which have 
sustained dividend growth at a compound annual rate 
of 7% over the past 6 years. Bloomsbury has no debt and 
the Group’s businesses continue to develop in the growth 
economies of India and the Middle East.
Strategy execution does not happen by accident. The 
relentless drive and strong leadership of the Chief 
Executive and Founder, the skill, competence and 
experience of the Executive Directors and the Executive 
Committee, the commitment and dedication of every 
member of a group expanded and enhanced by 
acquisitions, and the external perspective, wise counsel 
and strategic sign-posting provided by the Non-Executive 
Directors, has been central to delivering this performance. 
The Board recognises their contribution. On behalf of all 
those stakeholders whose interests it represents, it offers its 
sincere and grateful thanks.

Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
“Bloomsbury has succeeded in 
developing itself into a wholly 
integrated trade and academic 
publisher in the major markets 
around the world. We are now 
recognised as one of the finest 
publishers of both general and 
academic books. this is an early 
delivery of our strategic vision for 
o ne g lobal Bloomsbury, integrating 
our operations in trade and academic 
publishing in Britain, America, 
Australia and india.”
nigel newton 
Chief Executive
Overview
t
he Group delivered an excellent performance 
for the year with growth in both revenue 
and profits. Continuing profit before tax and 
highlighted items for the year of £12.5 million 
was up 3% on the year ended 29 February 2012 of £12.1 
million. Continuing profit before tax was £9.8 million, up 
16% on the year ended 29 February 2012 of £8.5 million. 
Continuing revenue was up 1% to £98.5 million (2011/12: 
£97.4 million). 
Bloomsbury has succeeded in developing itself into a 
wholly integrated trade and academic publisher in the 
major markets around the world. We are now recognised 
as one of the finest publishers of both general and 
academic books. This is an early delivery of our strategic 
vision for One Global Bloomsbury, integrating our 
operations in trade and academic publishing in Britain, 
America, Australia and India. In May, we were voted 
Academic, Educational and Professional Publisher of 
the Year at the Bookseller Industry Awards. In March, 
the Independent Publishers Guild voted Bloomsbury’s 
Academic & Professional division Independent Publisher of 
the Year. Both are notable achievements less than five years 
after we launched our academic division. We beat even the 
university presses, established hundreds of years ago, to 
these awards this year. The power of the Bloomsbury brand 
resonates and crosses over from our trade bestsellers to 
attract academic authors as the whole brand becomes 
stronger than the sum of its parts due to successful brand 
initiatives like our public engagement programme The 
Bloomsbury Institute. The judges singled out the power of 
our brand.
During the year, our trade authors have also been singled 
out for exceptional recognition, with extra sales being 
driven as a result of short-listings for major prizes including 
the Man Booker Prize and winning the Orange Prize. In 2012 
we made the title acquisitions which will underpin what 
should be a very strong 2013/14 in the Adult division as we 
publish a wide range of bestsellers from Paul Hollywood’s 
Bread (which reached number 1 in The Times Bestseller List) 
to Khaled Hosseini’s stunning And The Mountains Echoed 
which was published in May following his bestseller The Kite 
Runner, to Elizabeth Gilbert’s masterpiece The Signature of 
All Things and Samantha Shannon’s remarkable first novel 
The Bone Season, both published in October. Our Adult 
division’s strength in cookery publishing, which saw us win 
Waterstone’s Book of The Year in December with Polpo, 
will increase in 2013 with the first publication in the new 
partnership with MasterChef.

chief executive’s revie W
We are doing this from a tightly controlled cost base with 
an intense drive for savings. During the year our print 
purchasing was put out to tender: buying as a Group for 
the first time since our numerous acquisitions, we have 
reduced our print expense having secured favourable 
volume-based deals from fewer suppliers. We have been 
cutting other costs in the business, with underlying 
administration costs being down by 1% year on year. 
This includes a tight control of Head Office expenditure – 
where our rent is only £28 per square foot. A further cost 
reduction plan has been implemented for 2013.
We are industry leaders in our digital strategy with a wide 
range of digital initiatives producing good returns. Our 
knowledge hub programme has made huge progress. 
We successfully launched the Churchill Archive in October 
2012 and Drama Online in February 2013 both to praise 
and good early sales. The Churchill Archive was described 
by the judges of the Independent Publishers Guild’s digital 
publishing award as ‘a dynamite digital product’ to which 
Bloomsbury ‘has added stacks of value to the material’. 
The Churchill Centre has acquired access to the Churchill 
Archive from Bloomsbury for every secondary school in the 
USA, UK and Canada in a ground breaking initiative.
We made two academic acquisitions in the year, Fairchild 
Books and Applied Visual Arts Publishing. In the year ended 
28 February 2013 our non-trade divisions accounted for 
61% of the Group’s operating profit before highlighted 
items and 33% of the revenue. We now have 20 publishing 
specialisations in our stable and are market leaders in 
subjects from the Classics and Drama to Fashion Studies, 
Theology and Continental Philosophy. The Independent 
Publishers Guild judges said, when giving Bloomsbury its 
award: “Judges singled out the division for the breadth 
of its academic and professional publishing and its clear 
vision for what it wishes to achieve. Even allowing for the 
resources at its disposal, they recognized a Group with a 
true entrepreneurial and independent spirit…It has used 
its money wisely and made everything work exceptionally 
well.” The Booksellers Award judges said “Success has been 
due to organic growth and innovative business models – 
and it has completely redefined Bloomsbury as  
a publisher”.
These acquisitions join the 18 other acquisitions made in 
recent years by Bloomsbury. They have enabled the Group 
to change the shape of its business, to exploit the potential 
in portfolios which adapt readily to the emerging digital-
based business model and balance the transformation of 
its traditional trade business with the annuity income more 
possible in its new business structure. 
The Churchill Archive online has almost one million pages accessible 
on demand to libraries worldwide. All secondary schools in the UK, USA 
and Canada will be granted access to the entire archive.
Drama Online is a subscription service providing a resource for plays, 
critical analysis and performance featuring pre-eminent drama lists.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Excluding acquisitions and the Harry Potter series (which 
had a strong previous year following the release of the 
final film in August 2011) title sales in the underlying 
business were up year on year. This performance was, 
importantly, achieved without dependence on any 
single runaway bestseller. This is a sign of strength in the 
Group as our portfolio broadens. Total title sales included 
digitally-distributed sales of £10.0 million, which saw 
excellent growth year on year of 71% from £5.9 million in 
2011/12. Within this e-book sales continue to grow strongly, 
increasing by 61% to £9.1 million and now representing 
9% of total Group revenue (2011/12: 6%) and 13% of the 
Adult revenue (2011/12: 9%). Increasing the number of 
available e-book titles is a key part of our strategy and we 
now have 9,000 titles, 1,000 more than a year ago.
Richard Mollet, Chief Executive of The Publishers 
Association, said: “The Publishers Association’s Statistics 
Yearbook 2012 shows that British publishing is a healthy 
industry which continues to grow. The continued increase 
in digital sales across different disciplines illustrates the 
shift of readers to e-book reading. Such growth has been 
achieved as British publishers have been able to invest in 
new exciting, innovative products and in great authors 
thanks to the strong framework provided by copyright 
law, which continues to be the cornerstone of stability for a 
creative industry like publishing”.
Bloomsbury’s core attributes of entrepreneurship, 
innovation, publicity flair and tight control of costs have led 
to the delivery of One Global Bloomsbury, and the future 
performance we have now set the stage for as we enjoy 
the synergies and sales advantages of having delivered 
a unified worldwide publishing group. In our strategy 
for growth we are targeting 50% of profit to be digital 
within five years, with Bloomsbury being the number one 
applied visual arts and independent humanities and social 
science publisher in Europe. Over that time we aim to be 
the number one publisher of choice in cookery, sport and 
natural history, with an Information division which has a 
global base delivering increasing revenues from digital 
knowledge hubs.
financial results
Group financial results are summarised in the table below.
Continuing revenue has increased by 1% to £98.5 million. 
The majority of our revenue derives from title sales, which 
were up by 3% year on year to £87.0 million. The mix 
within title sales is increasingly moving towards digital 
and away from print. Print sales fell by £1.9 million, 2%, to 
£77.0 million, but digital sales rose by £4.2 million, 71%, to 
£10.0 million, leading to a total title sales increase of £2.2 
million. Rights and services revenue, which is primarily 
from copyright licensing, had another good performance 
with revenues of £11.5 million, £1.1 million down on the 
exceptional result in 2011/12 but significantly ahead of 
2010/11. 
Underlying revenue, which excludes the result of the 
two businesses we acquired during the year, Fairchild 
Books and Applied Visual Arts Publishing, was down by 
£4.9million, 5% to £92.5 million, principally due to lower 
sales of Harry Potter titles in the absence of a new film. This 
was more than mitigated by the £6.0 million contribution 
to revenue from our new acquisitions in the year. 
The continuing operating profit margin before highlighted 
items increased to 12.6%. In 2012/13 production, marketing 
and distribution costs were all a smaller percentage of sales 
than in 2011/12. 
The launch of our Indian publishing business in New Delhi 
in August was a success. Its performance was better than 
anticipated, with a loss of £0.2 million, as a result of sales 
exceeding expectations including our first number one 
bestseller in India and rigorous cost control.
The academic acquisitions, the set-up of our business 
in India and other strategic initiatives have resulted in 
£0.3 million of costs which, together with intangible 
amortisation, are highlighted separately in the financial 
statements.

Continuing diluted earnings per share, excluding 
highlighted items, were 13.11 pence, down from 13.27 
pence in 2011/12 largely as a result of the tax credit from 
overseas losses in that year. Total continuing diluted 
earnings per share for the year were 10.46 pence, up from 
9.54 pence in 2011/12.
The Group’s net cash balance increased to £14.6 million at 
28 February 2013 from £12.6 million at 29 February 2012. 
This movement includes £1.7 million outflow for acquisition 
investment and the receipt of £2.2 million for the disposal 
of Bloomsbury Verlag.
Divisional review
Academic & Professional – fulfilling promise
Bloomsbury took a strategic decision in 2008 to build an 
academic and professional business that was not reliant 
on the UK retail sector. The commercial aim of the new 
division is to build a sustainable business that matches the 
combined revenue of our Trade divisions. 
The division has built up a significant holding in humanities 
and social sciences publishing, with a vibrant and 
growing tax and law business. Its acquisitions include 
Methuen Drama, Berg Publishers, Tottel Publishing, 
Arden Shakespeare, Bristol Classical Press, Continuum 
International, Fairchild Books and Applied Visual Arts 
Publishing. 
The combination of excellent title sales in the key UK and 
US markets, two further acquisitions and some longer-term 
licensing deals have meant that 2012/13 was a good year 
for the division, despite very strong 2011/12 comparatives.
 
The Academic & Professional division generated 29% of 
Group continuing revenue this year (2011/12: 24%) and 
42% of the Group continuing operating profit before 
highlighted items (2011/12: 34%). Export revenues now 
account for half of divisional revenue, with a significant 
and growing proportion of revenues from e-books and 
digital, annuity-based services. The division’s results are 
summarised below:
chief executive’s revie W
Bloomsbury Academic publishing has 20 publishing specialisations 
and are market leaders in Classics and Drama to Fashion Studies, 
Theology and Continental Philosophy.
Bloomsbury Professional has a growing range of attractively priced 
online subscription services for tax, law and financial reporting.  These 
complement the division’s e-book and print titles for the professions.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Bloomsbury continued its strategy of acquiring high 
quality assets in areas complementary to its existing 
academic and professional lists, with the purchase of two 
applied visual arts lists: Fairchild Books in March 2012 for 
£3.8 million and Applied Visual Arts Publishing in June 
2012 for £1.8 million. Combined with Bloomsbury’s existing 
visual arts lists and academic list Berg, this makes us the 
leading global publisher in this field. These acquisitions 
contributed £6.0 million of revenue and £2.0 million of 
incremental operating profit before highlighted items in 
the year ended 28 February 2013. 
Excluding these acquisitions, there was excellent 
underlying growth in title sales which increased by 9%, 
£1.8 million, to £20.8 million. Rights and services revenue 
reduced by £1.8 million to £2.3 million following a very 
strong year in 2011/12, causing the £0.9 million reduction 
in underlying operating profit before highlighted items. 
New title output now exceeds 1,000 titles per year, with an 
increasing focus on digital publishing. We expect digital 
revenues to increase as we rapidly expand our portfolio of 
subscription services.
In October 2012, Bloomsbury published the Churchill 
Archive online in conjunction with the Sir Winston Churchill 
Archive Trust. The work comprises almost one million 
pages, in digital format for university libraries, public 
libraries and schools to access on demand. The content of 
the archive has been made available to a global audience 
who will be able to study one of the largest and most 
important collections of primary source material of any 
individual leader in history. All secondary schools in the UK, 
USA and Canada will be granted access to the entire 
digital Churchill Archive thanks to funding from the 
Churchill Centre.
In February 2013, Bloomsbury launched Drama Online, an 
online resource for plays, critical analysis and performance.

Adult – Digital sales flourish 
The Adult division generated 45% of Group continuing 
revenue this year (2011/12: 46%). Continuing revenue was 
£44.3 million (2011/12: £45.1million). Continuing operating 
profit before highlighted items was £3.7 million, (2011/12 
£4.8million). Continuing operating profit margin before 
highlighted items for the division was 8% which compares 
very favourably with an industry average of 5.8%.
Print sales decreased by 7% to £34.3 million, but digital 
sales in the division rose 32% year on year to £5.6 million, 
representing 13% of continuing sales (2011/12: 9%).
The highest penetration of e-book sales remains in the 
USA at 27% of net title sales, but UK e-book sales are 
accelerating and now at 11% of net title sales. Other 
territories are also growing rapidly. Rights & Services 
revenue rose by 16% to £4.4 million (2011/12: £3.8 million).
In line with our strategy we focused our efforts on 
acquiring and publishing titles with global English-
language rights. In particular we have invested in the 
area of high-quality cookery books with the potential for 
global sales. Our two most successful new authors in the 
year were Paul Hollywood with two titles, How to Bake and 
Bread, and Russell Norman with his Waterstone’s Book of 
the Year, Polpo. We also saw significant and growing sales 
from our established author chefs such as Hugh Fearnley-
Whittingstall, Heston Blumenthal, Atol Kochhar, Fergus 
Henderson, Raymond Blanc, Nikki Segnit, David Chang, 
Vivek Singh, Philip Howard and many more.
Literary prizes are becoming an ever more important 
way for book buyers to identify what they want to read. 
Madeline Miller won the Orange Prize for Fiction with The 
Song of Achilles, a brilliant re-telling of Homer’s Iliad. The 
International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award is one of the 
richest literary prizes in the world and was won for the 
second year running by a Bloomsbury author, this time Jon 
McGregor with Even the Dogs. Paula Wilfert won the James 
Beard Award with The Food of Morocco, Alistair Hignell with 
Higgy was Rugby Book of the Year, and we were delighted 
that Cuckoos of the World was voted Bird Book of the Year 
by Birdwatch magazine.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On We have also focused on publishing in print and digital 
for special interest markets. Jonathan Kingdon’s six-
volume Mammals of Africa is unique, comprehensive 
and authoritative. This was published alongside our 
established natural history list which continues its central 
role in ornithology, not least with the publication of Ralph 
Steadman’s Extinct Boids.
Progressively we view the English-speaking market (and 
many non-native English territories) as a single market, 
particularly with internet and digital distribution channels. 
In this respect our two recent start-up businesses in 
Australia and India are vital to our functions of promoting 
our authors and developing sales and markets. India’s 
first year has been good with bestsellers ranging from 
Manil Suri’s The City of Devi, through William Dalrymple’s 
The Return of a King to the first edition of the Wisden India 
Almanack edited by Suresh Menon.
Digital sales will continue to increase across the board 
with significant opportunities: geographical (India, Latin 
America, China), technological (colour, audio, interactivity 
etc) and reach (new e-tailers, social media, subscription, 
lending etc). The rate of growth in traditional e-book sales 
in the USA is slowing but elsewhere there appears to be 
very significant opportunities for growth.
Children’s & Educational – An innovative team  
builds for the future 
Bloomsbury Children’s & Educational division publishes 
quality books for children up to 16 years old to inspire a 
love of reading. 
Revenue was £21.3 million (2011/12: £25.6 million). This 
reduction is largely due to a 22%, £5.1 million reduction 
year on year in print sales, which in turn is almost wholly 
due to lower sales of Harry Potter titles, with the release of 
the final film in that series in 2011 making the comparative 
for 2011/12 very strong. E-book sales grew to 10% of 
net title sales, up from 5% in 2011/12, with the strongest 
performance in the US market, but steeper growth in the 
UK. Closely managed costs and advance focus led to an 
improved gross profit margin of 53% compared to 49% in 
2011/12. 
The Educational division benefited from a community led 
marketing team focusing on direct selling and inherited 
titles from the Continuum acquisition, growing sales to 
£4.8m, up from £4.2m last year.

The children’s trade division continues to acquire 
world rights to strengthen global publishing. With new 
publishing directors in both the UK and the US, the 
publishing strategy is to acquire market facing titles and to 
publish fewer books better, driving up profitability per title.
Digital innovation is a priority with interactive colour 
e-books and app marketing in development, along with 
an e-first imprint for the young adult market – Bloomsbury 
Spark. The Educational sub-division is developing its first 
online digital product – Music Express Online, which will 
launch in 2014.
Highlights from the 2012/13 year include Hogwart’s 
Library by JK Rowling and Princess Academy: Palace of 
Stone by Shannon Hale, which entered the New York Times 
bestseller list. Throne of Glass by Sarah J Maas has sold in 12 
languages and Steve Jobs by Karen Blumenthal sold almost 
100,000 copies in the year. We also launched both the 
Bloomsbury Activity Books imprint and a new picture book 
list at Frankfurt Book Fair. Nicholas Lake won the prestigious 
Printz Award from the American Library Association for 
In Darkness and is also shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal 
along with The Weight of Water, a debut novel by Sarah 
Crossan. 
Bloomsbury Information – Knowledge hubs
The core activities of Bloomsbury Information are the 
development of IP-rich knowledge hubs in cooperation 
with external partners, the provision of management and 
publishing services and publishing business, management, 
finance and reference titles. 
The division generated 4% of Group continuing revenue 
this year (2011/12: 4%) and 19% of Group continuing 
operating profit before highlighted items (2011/12: 
7%). Continuing revenue was £3.8 million, up 5% on 
£3.6 million for 2011/12. Continuing operating profit 
before highlighted items was £2.3 million, up £1.5 million 
compared to £0.9 million in 2011/12. Rights and services 
revenue of £3.4 million made up 90% of total continuing 
revenue.
Successes in the year include the continuing growth of 
www.QFinance.com, the digital knowledge hub for finance 
professionals created by Bloomsbury which now attracts 
over 300,000 unique visitors per month. Development 
of the IZA World of Labor, our knowledge hub targeted 
at policy makers in the field of labour economics which 
covers topics such as migration and minimum wage, is 
progressing well with launch scheduled for later this year. 
The division continues to grow and is well placed to 
exploit digital, management services and other innovative 
business opportunities for the Group.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Bloomsbury’s strategy delivers
Bloomsbury is a global fully integrated publisher of books 
and other media for general readers, children, students, 
researchers and professionals throughout the world. 
Bloomsbury uniquely offers authors access to these 
multiple markets in multiple formats throughout the world: 
in print, through e-books, through digital downloads and 
apps; in schools, in libraries, in universities, and in terrestrial 
and Internet bookshops, with entrepreneurial teams 
in New York, London, New Delhi and Sydney serving all 
territories. 
The bringing together of general and scholarly publishing 
has already resulted in significant cost savings, better 
marketing reach, a balanced portfolio both editorially and 
financially, and excellent results. Bloomsbury’s strategy 
over the next five years is to balance trade and non-trade 
publishing in the business to further enhance these 
benefits. 
The Academic & Professional division aim is to be the 
number one applied visual arts publisher in the world, 
and within five years to be the number one independent 
humanities and social science publisher in Europe, with half 
of turnover coming from digital and subscription-based 
products.
The Adult division aims to be the number one publisher of 
choice in cookery, sport and natural history and in the top 
ten for quality fiction worldwide within five years. 
Our overall strategy for Bloomsbury Children’s & 
Educational books is to be recognised for great author 
care, independent spirit and innovation. Over the next five 
years we will develop Bloomsbury Activity books to be a 
leading profit generating list for the division, with half of 
the trade frontlist being illustrated books and 25% of all 
publishing being in a digital format. 
The Bloomsbury Information division strategy is to increase 
revenues from digital knowledge hubs and broaden the 
base for services and partnerships. Over the next few years 
we intend to expand from the division’s UK base and 
develop a global reach for Bloomsbury Information. 
Outlook
Bloomsbury has an exceptional publishing programme for 
2013/14. This includes And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled 
Hosseini, The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert, The 
Bone Season by Samantha Shannon and the first book from 
our new MasterChef venture with Shine TV.
There are exciting opportunities for growth in many areas, 
including; digital sales (e-books, knowledge hubs and 
academic and professional online services), publishing 
services sales and global title sales - particularly in India, 
Latin America and China. We also have many internal 
operational improvements ongoing across the Group 
which will improve business efficiency, including a Group 
wide shift to content-led (XML-based) workflows to expedite 
the print and digital production process.
The publishing industry is going through changing times 
full of opportunity. With online and digital technology 
the book market is increasingly global, facilitating trade 
across Bloomsbury’s international business. Global 
English language speakers and literacy generally are ever 
increasing. Our content has become more widely available 
through the increasing number of e-reading devices and 
the ease of acquiring e-books means that each consumer 
buys more titles than before. Fewer books are being sold 
through high street shops as e-book sales are continuing to 
grow. However, there will be a place for the physical book 
for many more years albeit mainly sold online. 
Bloomsbury has been successfully steering a path through 
this shifting business model. The opportunities for selling 
our content and the different formats for our content are 
proliferating. Whereas content was historically only sold 
as an individual physical title, now we can sell content 
24/7 as an e-book, bundle online rights for sale or create 
innovative knowledge hubs where access rights can be 
sold direct to the consumer. It is this innovation, together 
with our valuable intellectual property and respected 
Bloomsbury brand that form the core of Bloomsbury’s 
strategy for growth.

o
n 28 February 2012 the Company sold 
Bloomsbury Verlag, its subsidiary in Germany, 
following a strategic decision to concentrate 
on English language publishing. Continuing 
figures for 2011/12 exclude the results of this subsidiary.
During the year we completed two acquisitions. The most 
significant of these is that of Fairchild Books, which was 
acquired on 30 March 2012. On 29 June 2012 we acquired 
Applied Visual Arts Publishing (“AVA”). Underlying 
numbers disclosed below are continuing numbers, which 
exclude the results of Fairchild Books and AVA.
Strategic initiatives over the last two years, which include 
the acquisitions of Fairchild Books and AVA, the set up 
of Bloomsbury India and the One Global Bloomsbury 
reorganisation, have resulted in costs which have been 
highlighted separately in these financial statements. 
There have been no changes in accounting policies in  
the year. 
Overview
Continuing revenues were up by 1% year on year. We 
increased our continuing operating profit margin before 
highlighted items to 12.6%. The resulting profit before tax 
and highlighted items was up by 3% to £12.5 million. Our 
results history for the last four years is shown in the graph

revenue
The Group’s revenues arise from publishing services and 
related income. Publishing services principally comprise 
editing, marketing, selling and distribution of titles either in 
print or digital formats. Related revenue is disclosed in the 
rights and services table below.
Group continuing revenue for the year was £98.5 million, 
up 1% on the year ended 29 February 2012 of £97.4 million. 
There was growth of 26% year on year in the Academic & 
Professional division, following the acquisition of Fairchild 
Books and AVA. These acquisitions contributed £6.0 million 
to revenue and £2.0 million to operating profit before 
highlighted items. 
Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Fairchild Books 
and AVA, the Group’s continuing underlying revenue 
in the year ended 28 February 2013 of £92.5 million was 
down on a like-for-like basis by 5% (2011/12: £97.4 million). 
The results in 2011/12 benefited from exceptionally 
strong rights and services income and high Children’s & 
Educational title sales as a result of the final Harry Potter 
film. However, the two academic acquisitions we made 
have generated sufficient revenue to ensure that the 
Group’s total revenues grew year on year in 2012/13. 
Continuing title sales grew by 3% year on year. Within that 
there was a further move away from print and towards 
digital formats. Print sales were 78% of total continuing 
revenue, down £2 million, 2%, year on year, and down £7.7 
million, 10% on an underlying basis. Within this, the sales 
of Harry Potter print titles were down £4.4 million year on 
year.
Digital sales mainly comprise e-book sales together with 
a growing element of digital subscriptions revenues. 
Continuing e-book sales were up 61% year on year to £9.1 
million, and now are 9% of Group continuing revenues 
(2011/12: 6%). Given the nature of e-books, most of this 
growth was in the Adult division, where 13% of continuing 
sales were e-books (2011/12: 9%), with slower growth in 
the Children’s & Educational division and growing e-book 
sales in the Academic & Professional division. Overall 16% 
of continuing revenue in the US were of e-books and 7% in 
the UK, indicating the significant potential remaining in the 
UK for e-book sales.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Rights and services revenue was down by £1.1m on last 
year’s exceptional result but 72% up on 2010/11. The two 
key areas that drive this revenue are copyright licence 
sales and management contract income. Copyright 
licences include the sale of foreign language rights to 
our titles and the sale of online rights to certain titles. 
Trademark licence revenue last year included income 
from rights relating to the Bloomsbury Verlag disposal, this 
year it includes fees from the licensing of Wisden in India. 
Management contracts include revenues from the IZA 
deal which we signed in 2011 and from our management 
contract in Qatar. Whereas in 2011/12 these revenues 
were characterised by a smaller number of larger deals, in 
2012/13 they are a larger number of smaller deals, as this 
type of revenue is now more embedded in the day to day 
operations of the business. The top three revenue sources 
in 2011/12 delivered £5.4m profit (50% of total rights and 
services profit) whereas in 2012/13 the top three sources 
delivered £3.4m or 35% of this profit.
The Group sales by region are shown below. The 
acquisition of Fairchild Books at the end of March and of 
Continuum last year gives us increased presence in the 
US, the largest academic publishing market in the world. 
This chart shows where Group continuing revenues were 
generated for the year ended 28 February 2013:
Group continuing sales by region
UK    65%
US    29%
Australia     6%
profit margins
The continuing gross profit margin increased year on 
year from 57% to 58% of total revenues. This increase 
reflects the shift of revenues from print to digital and the 
substantial print cost savings we have made following a 
tender process. Both production costs and stock costs have 
reduced as a proportion of total revenues.
Author costs, consisting of royalties and advances, 
increased from £15.6 million to £16.3 million year on year. 
Group marketing and distribution costs are down from 
15% of revenues in 2011/12 to 13% of revenues in 2012/13. 
Underlying administration costs, excluding new costs in the 
year from acquired companies and our new business in 
India, were down by 1% to £28.7 million. 
Group continuing operating profit before highlighted 
items for the year was £12.4 million, up 3% on last year. 
The continuing operating profit margin before highlighted 
items for the Group increased from 12.4% to 12.6%.

Divisional performance
Our two highest margin divisions, Academic & Professional 
and Information, grew in both revenue and profit year on 
year. The table below shows continuing performance by 
division. 
Divisional financial highlights are noted below and further 
information by division is given in the Divisional Review 
section of the Chief Executive’s Review.
The Academic & Professional division has grown 
significantly during 2012 and 2013 through acquisitions, 
organic growth in digital subscription-based publishing 
and innovative deals with publishing partners. Growth in 
Academic & Professional revenues is core to our strategy 
to balance trade revenues with non-trade revenues. 
This division now makes up 29% of Group revenue 
(2011/12: 24%) and 42% of Group operating profit 
before highlighted items (2011/12: 34%). Academic & 
Professional sales grew by 26%. Our two acquisitions in 
the year – Fairchild Books and AVA – contributed £6.0m of 
revenue and £2.0m of incremental operating profit before 
highlighted items. On an underlying basis, before the 
acquisitions, title sales in the division were up by 9% year 
on year. Underlying rights and services revenue was down 
£1.8m year on year following an exceptional result in this 
area in 2011/12.
In the Adult division we are showing growth over 2010/11 
but revenue is 2% lower than last year which included 
very strong sales of River Cottage Veg Every Day! The 
sales reduction led to a £0.4 million reduction in profit, in 
addition there was a £0.7 million provision for unearned 
advances in the US following alignment of territorial 
policies, which in total has led to a profit reduction of  
£1.1 million year on year in the division. E-book sales rose 
32% year on year to £5.6 million, which represented 13% 
of the division’s total continuing revenue compared to 9% 
in the previous year. This division makes up 45% of Group 
revenue (2011/12: 46%). The UK cookery list performed 
well, including sales of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Heston 
Blumenthal and our new author Paul Hollywood’s How to 
Bake and Bread. The Song of Achilles won the 2012 Orange 
Prize for Fiction, and two of our other titles, Painter of 
Silence and State of Wonder were also on the Orange Prize 
shortlist of six.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On The Children’s & Educational revenue reduction year on 
year was due to the effect of the release of the final Harry 
Potter film in July 2011. Excluding this effect titles sales  
were 1% up year on year. E-book sales in the division rose 
78% year on year to £2.0 million, so we are starting to see  
in Children’s & Educational some of the great e-book 
growth numbers that we have previously seen in the Adult 
division. The division makes up 22% of Group revenue 
(2011/12: 26%). 
The Information division generated 90% or £3.4 million of 
its continuing revenue from rights and services. This was 
mainly management services fees and included fees for 
the businesses we manage in Qatar and revenue of £0.9 
million (2011/12: £0.9 million) from the partnership with IZA 
in Germany that will generate £4.3 million of revenue over 
five years. The division’s continuing operating profit before 
highlighted items was £2.3 million (2011/12: £0.9 million).
The charts below show the proportion of Group continuing 
revenues that each division generates, and illustrates the 
growth in relative contribution from the Academic & 
Professional division year on year.

acquisitions
On 30 March 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets 
of Fairchild Books for a cash consideration of £3.8 million 
($6.1 million). On 29 June 2012 the Group acquired the 
trade and assets of AVA for £1.8 million (CHF 2.6 million). 
The acquisitions reflected Bloomsbury’s strategy to 
increase its proportion of academic and professional 
revenues compared to trade revenues. All of Fairchild 
Books’ sales are in the US further increasing Bloomsbury’s 
reach to the global book market. Goodwill of £0.5 million 
arose on the acquisition of AVA and intangible assets 
of £1.9 million were identified for publishing rights and 
imprints on the acquisition of AVA and Fairchild. A gain on 
bargain purchase of £0.2 million arose on the acquisition of 
Fairchild Books, which is credited to highlighted items. The 
consideration on each acquisition is payable in three equal 
annual instalments, commencing at the acquisition date. 
The two acquisitions contributed a total of £6.0 million of 
revenue and £2.0 million of incremental operating profit 
before highlighted items to the Academic & Professional 
division this year.
interest
The net interest income for the Group for the year was 
£0.09 million compared with £0.05 million for the year 
ended 29 February 2012 due to the improved performance 
of the defined benefit pension scheme.
t axation
Taxation on continuing operations was £2.0 million for  
the year, compared to £1.4 million for the year ended  
29 February 2012. The effective tax rate was 20.6% (2011/12: 
16.2%). In 2011/12 the rate was brought down by the offset 
of the substantial overseas losses of Bloomsbury Verlag 
against UK generated profits. Excluding the effect of 
highlighted and other non-recurring items, the continuing 
effective tax rate for the Group was 21.4% (2011/12: 23.4%), 
consistent with the reduction in the UK tax rate.
earnings per share
Continuing diluted earnings per share, excluding 
highlighted items, were down by 1% year on year to  
13.11 pence (2011/12: 13.27 pence) largely due to the tax 
credit on Bloomsbury Verlag losses in 2011/12.

Dividend and dividend policy
The Group has a progressive dividend policy and the aim of 
keeping dividend cover in excess of two times. In line with 
this policy the directors are recommending a final dividend 
of 4.56 pence per share, which subject to shareholder 
approval at our Annual General Meeting on 23 July 2013 
will be paid on 24 September 2013 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 30 August 2013. This 
dividend is a 5.8% increase on the dividend paid for the six 
months ended 29 February 2012. Together with the interim 
dividend, this makes a total dividend for the year ended 
28 February 2013 of 5.50p per share, a 5.8% increase on 
the 5.20p dividend for the year ended 29 February 2012 
Over the past six years our dividend has increased at a 
compound annual growth rate of 7%. 
capital structure
Our statement of financial position at 28 February 2013 can 
be summarised as set out in the table below.
The Group’s key assets were goodwill and intangible  
assets, net trade receivables, advance prepayments  
and inventories. 
Net assets increased by 5% to £114.8 million  
(2012: £109.2 million) and net assets per share by 5%  
to 155 pence (2012: 148 pence). The main movements in 
the statement of financial position are explained below. 
assets
Goodwill and intangible assets increased by £2.5 million to 
£55.2 million (2012: £52.8 million) due to:
 ✶ the acquisitions of Fairchild Books and AVA increasing 
goodwill by £0.5 million and other intangibles by  
£1.9 million; 
 ✶ product and systems development cost of  
£2.4 million which includes the Churchill Archive and 
Drama Online; less
 ✶ £2.3 million of amortisation.
Inventories increased by 27% to £25.6 million  
(2012: £20.2 million) mainly because of £3.3 million  
of stock acquired as part of the Fairchild Books and  
AVA acquisitions and building up the existing Academic  
list in the US, especially for Continuum.
Trade and other receivables were £53.6 million  
(2012: £55.4 million). The acquisition of Fairchild Books 
added £1.6 million and there was an increase of £1.0 
million in accrued income for Academic & Professional 
rights and services deals. This offset a reduction of £3.7 
million to other receivables from 29 February 2012, which 
was in respect of the sale and rights proceeds from the 
disposal of Bloomsbury Verlag and income tax recoverable 
decreased by £0.4 million.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Since books sold are generally returnable by customers, 
the Group makes a provision against books sold in the 
accounting year. The unused provision at the year end is 
then carried forward and offset against trade receivables in 
the statement of financial position, in anticipation of further 
book returns subsequent to the year end. A provision for 
the Group of £5.3 million (2012: £4.7 million) for future 
returns relating to 2012/13 and prior year sales has been 
carried forward in trade receivables at the statement of 
financial position date. This provision was 18% of trade 
receivables (2012: 17%).
As at 28 February 2013 the Group had 4,043 titles  
(2012: 2,493) under contract for future publication, with a 
gross investment of £24.2 million (2012: £21.7 million). The 
increase in titles arises from the acquisitions of Fairchild 
Books and AVA and growth in the Academic & Professional 
publishing program including at Continuum and Visual 
Arts. After payment of the initial tranches of advances 
to authors, our year end commitment for future cash 
payments on these contracted titles was £14.7 million 
(2012: £12.7 million). The average total investment per title 
fell in 2013 to £6,000 compared to £8,700 as at 29 February 
2012, reflecting the increasing number of Academic & 
Professional titles in the Group. 
equity and liabilities
At 28 February 2013 total equity was £114.8 million  
(2012: £109.2 million). The increase of £5.6 million was  
due to an increase of £1.4 million from the cumulative 
currency translations; dividends of £3.8 million  
(2011/12: £3.7 million); share based payment transactions 
of £0.5 million and the retained profit for the year of  
£7.5 million (2011/12: £3.4 million) after highlighted 
items of £2.7 million (2011/12: after highlighted items of 
£3.6 million and £3.7 million loss from the discontinued 
operations of Bloomsbury Verlag).
Current liabilities increased 1% to £32.9 million  
(2012: £32.5 million). Trade payables increased to  
£12.0 million (2012: £11.3 million) due to accrued work in 
progress mainly in respect of increased academic printing. 
Accruals and deferred income, which is included in  
trade and other payables, reduced to £14.9 million  
(2012: £18.8 million). This includes deferred income on 
database contracts, subscription revenues, accrued work 
in progress and royalty payments due to authors, which 
vary year on year depending on revenue and authors’ 
royalty rates. At 29 February 2012 there were accruals for 
bonuses and for disposal costs of Bloomsbury Verlag, with 
no corresponding accrual at this year end. Other payables 
increased to £4.1 million (2012: £1.6 million) which includes 
£2 million to cover the second instalment of the Fairchild 
Books and AVA purchase prices and increased VAT due to 
timing of supplier payments.
Non-current liabilities increased 34% to £6.4 million  
(2012: £4.7 million). Within that other payables increased 
to £2.5 million (2012: £0.3 million) due to the £2 million 
accrual of the third and final instalment of the Fairchild 
Books and AVA purchase price due in 2014. A £1.7 million 
deferred tax liability on intangible assets was recognised on 
the acquisition of Continuum in 2011/12. This is reducing as 
the relevant intangibles are amortised. 
cash
Cash and cash equivalents increased by £2.0 million in the 
year with net cash of £14.6 million at the year end. The net 
cash inflow from operating activities, including the effect 
of highlighted items, was £7.9 million, £2.9 million above 
2011/12. Investing activities for the year ended  
28 February 2013 resulted in an outflow of £2.4 million 
(2012: outflow £23.6 million) largely from the acquisitions 
of Fairchild Books and AVA and purchases of intangible 
assets, partly offset by the sale proceeds from the disposal 
of Bloomsbury Verlag; the outflow in 2011/12 included 
the acquisition of Continuum and refurbishment of the 
Group’s new Head Office in Bedford Square. Fairchild 
Books was acquired for £3.8 million and the trade and 
assets of AVA for £1.8 million. Each of these acquisitions is 
being financed in cash in three equal annual instalments 
with no interest on the deferred cash payments. The  
£3.8 million net cash used in financing activities was made 
up of dividends of £3.8 million (2012: £5.7 million, made up 
of £2.0 million purchase of shares for the Employee Benefit 
Trust and a dividend of £3.7 million). 
liquidity 
The Group has an unsecured credit facility with Lloyds TSB 
Bank. At 28 February 2013 the Group had £10 million of 
undrawn committed loan facility (2012: £10 million) and  
£2 million of undrawn overdraft facility (2012: £2 million). 
The overdraft facility is available until November 2013 and 
the loan facility matures in July 2016. The facility is subject 
to two covenants being a maximum net debt to EBITDA 
ratio and a minimum interest cover covenant. 
The Group’s net cash position changes over the course 
of the year as a result of the seasonality of the business 
with the most significant expenses being the payment of 
royalties in March and September and the most significant 
sale receipts being in February from the Christmas sales.

utlined in the table overleaf is a description 
of risk factors that management considers 
are relevant to the Group’s business. Not all 
the factors are within management’s control 
and other factors besides those listed below could also 
affect the Group. Actions being taken by management to 
mitigate risk factors should be considered in conjunction 
with the cautioning note to shareholders in the Directors’ 
Report on page 43 with regards to forward looking 
statements. Details on financial risk management are given 
in note 23.
Our strategy
The Group’s mission is to grow a high quality global 
publishing business delivering high value to its 
contributors, readers and shareholders.
We achieve this mission through our strategy which is to:
 ✶ Publish authors and works of excellence and originality.
 ✶ Deliver professional services to those seeking 
publication.
 ✶ Combine tradition and technology to achieve 
excellence.
 ✶ Establish solid profit streams.
Key objectives include:
 ✶ Grow non-trade revenues so that they match or exceed 
our trade revenues. This is because these revenues 
have higher margins, are generally a more predictable 
revenue stream, are less reliant on the retail bookshop 
environment and have more digital opportunities. 
Non-trade revenues comprise those in our Academic & 
Professional and Information divisions.
 ✶ Continue acquisition of rights to publish outstanding 
works by undiscovered and established authors.
 ✶ Expand internationally in English language markets. 
This reduces the Group’s reliance on the UK market and, 
in particular, takes advantage of the biggest academic 
market worldwide in the US and the significant growth 
being experienced in India.
 ✶ Create and exploit copyright and IP including by 
licensing of information databases to support major 
institutions and corporations.
 ✶ Benefit from the digital opportunity, both in cost saving 
and market expansion.
Information of how we take account of social and 
environmental matters when implementing our strategy is 
included in Corporate Responsibility on pages 32 to 36.
Overview of Bloomsbury’s processes
Bloomsbury is an independent worldwide publisher  
and has been listed on the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange since 1994. Over a period of more than 
25 years the business has built up a substantial body of 
publishing rights.
The Group is structured as four fully integrated worldwide 
publishing divisions – Adult, Children’s & Educational, 
Academic & Professional and Information – under a 
global brand supported by centralised sales, marketing, 
production and head office functions. Each publishing 
division reports to the Chief Executive. The Group 
encourages each publishing division to develop and grow 
diversified income streams. Each division has the capability 
to publish books in all formats but may also produce 
other products such as online content accessible through 
subscription. Each division may also use its expertise to 
provide publishing related services to clients.
Book publishing
Publishing e-books and printed books is the main 
activity of Bloomsbury. Publishing teams acquire the 
intellectual property rights to publish the works of authors. 
Bloomsbury sells its own books typically through online 
retailers such as Amazon, through bookshops, through 
supermarkets and direct to customers.
Bloomsbury’s global production function produces books 
in all formats. Bloomsbury has produced e-books since 2005 
and as an early adopter has benefited from the worldwide 
growth in e-book sales. Printed books that are sold through 
retail outlets are normally sold on a sale-or-return basis. 
The Group subcontracts the printing, warehouse storage 
and distribution of printed books to a number of long-term 
global partners.
Group strategic actions to mitigate the risks
The Group focuses on improving its processes in order to 
address the identified risks and has implemented a number 
of key initiatives including:

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Repositioning the business towards  
non-trade revenues
Bloomsbury is a cash generative business and has enjoyed 
the benefit of publishing many bestselling titles over a 
prolonged period. Bloomsbury has balanced its core 
general trade publishing business with academic and 
professional publishing. This addresses a number of risks:
 ✶ Long-term growth potential, less sales volatility 
and higher margins: The demand for academic and 
professional books is more regular which reduces the 
volatility of book sales compared to general trade 
publishing.
 ✶ Barriers to entry: Since acquiring Methuen Drama in 
2006, Bloomsbury has continuously invested in growing 
its academic publishing business through organic 
growth and acquisitions of publishing businesses,  
lists of academic books and online databases. The 
acquisition of Continuum in July 2011 and Fairchild 
Books in March 2012 with their strong US footprint 
has enabled Bloomsbury to consolidate the academic 
publishing division into a substantial unified worldwide 
publisher with a number of market leading subject 
areas.
 ✶ Established business: Bloomsbury is successfully 
establishing its position in the professional publishing 
market.
 ✶ Exploiting intellectual property: Bloomsbury is 
developing innovative academic online products which 
are sold under annual subscriptions and which exploit 
the Group’s content assets and expertise.
 ✶ Lower risk: Academic publishing acquisitions require 
lower advances and have lower returns of unsold copies 
from booksellers.
One Global Bloomsbury
From 2011 the Group implemented one Global Bloomsbury 
which is the approach of four worldwide publishing 
divisions under a global brand supported by centralised 
sales, marketing, production and head office functions. 
To support One Global Bloomsbury the Group has 
implemented global information systems and processes 
which are continuously being improved. One Global 
Bloomsbury and the global processes address a number of 
risks and process areas:
 ✶ Extended territorial reach of the sales and marketing 
teams: Sales and marketing teams have been unified 
into a single global function to meet the needs of a 
worldwide market.
 ✶ Editorial economies of scale: Editorial teams have an 
increased focus on acquiring the world rights.
 ✶ Functional economies of scale: The book production 
function (which takes finalised scripts from editorial 
teams and converts them into e-books and/or printed 
books), Finance and IT teams have been unified into 
global functions to support the Bloomsbury publishing 
teams based in different territories worldwide.
Growth in emerging markets
Bloomsbury has established a growing publishing business 
in India which publishes the works of local talented authors 
in addition to the works of Bloomsbury authors with works 
originally published in the UK and US. India has one of 
the world’s largest English speaking populations and an 
increasing number of highly educated readers of English.
uK head office consolidation
The Group has relocated most of the UK workforce into a 
single London head office supported by fewer satellite UK 
offices which enables common processes to be developed 
and economies of scale to be realised.
w orldwide systems and processes
The Group has implemented centralised publishing and 
finance systems worldwide across the business allowing 
teams to work more closely together.

Bloomsbury’s core business is the worldwide promotion of high quality 
literature and literacy for readers of all ages which in itself has a high social 
value. We focus on integrity in all of our activities, consider our impact 
on society and the environment and maintain high ethical standards. the 
company continues to be included in the ftse4good index.
t
he Board recognises that the achievements 
of the Group have depended upon the high 
standards of social responsibility demonstrated 
by the Directors and employees for more than 
twenty five years. The Board takes account of the relevant 
social, environmental and ethical issues and associated risks 
and opportunities to the Group’s short-term and long- 
term value.
community
We encourage the involvement of staff worldwide in 
volunteer work and Bloomsbury is involved in a number 
of community based activities. Our publishing teams share 
a common passion for promoting the enjoyment of high 
quality literature which is often cutting edge and provides 
new authors with opportunities to establish themselves. 
We have a substantial Children’s & Educational division 
focused on promoting literacy for young readers of all 
abilities and ages including specialist ranges for ‘Hi-Low’ 
pupils (high age, low attainment) which provide parents 
and teachers with the tools needed to engage their 
children in reading.
 ✶ Support by Bloomsbury 
With a focus mainly on promoting literacy, we actively 
support numerous organisations including schools 
and libraries and other good causes such as Booktrust, 
Barnado’s, Oxfam and other charities. We are a sponsor 
and partner of World Book Day which was established 
in 1995 by UNESCO with the objective of promoting and 
celebrating books and reading amongst children and 
adults. We typically donate, or provide at a substantial 
discount, over 100,000 books annually which includes 
donations by our overseas and UK offices of mainstream 
titles. For example, we donated books by some of 
Bloomsbury’s leading female authors to charities 
supporting education as part of International Women’s 
Day, we donated signed copies of books by leading 
authors for charity auctions and have supported the 
Booktrust who give every child starting secondary 
school a free book. 
 
 
 
 
 
We make minor cash donations to charities and not-for-
profit organisations that support literature, education 
and literacy which has included Book Aid International, 
The Charleston Trust, the Independent Publishers Guild 
and other charities that meet our specific criteria.
 ✶ Support by employees of Bloomsbury 
Our business has a strong team of employees who 
are passionate about literacy and literature with a 
relatively high proportion of women. A number of our 
employees, both privately and through a Bloomsbury 
coordinator of a reading in schools project, are involved 
in formal volunteer reading schemes and regularly 
attend state schools. These schemes provide lunchtime 
supervised reading support to young readers who are 
often from backgrounds where their opportunities to 
develop reading skills may be hindered. 
 
Other employees are involved with a number of 
formal voluntary activities promoting literacy such 
as in voluntary associations for editors promoting 
the publication of children’s books; in workshops in 
schools for young aspiring journalists, magazine editors 
and writers; in supporting associations for dyslexic 
children; in supporting the updating of a number of 
school libraries; or in arranging visits by authors to talk 
at schools. Other employees voluntarily assist schools 
with numerous activities such as interview practice, 
presentations on working in publishing and writing and 
producing musicals for primary schools. 
 
Groups of employees around the business regularly 
participate in a wide range of fund raising events for 
good causes and charities such as sponsored runs, 
cycling challenges for Book Aid, bake sales and other 
employee inspired activities. Privately, Bloomsbury 
people actively give their time and support to a wide 
range of good causes.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On employees
We recognise that people are a key asset and employment 
policies are directed at creating a workplace that attracts, 
motivates, develops and retains high calibre employees. 
We have a diverse workforce and management team led 
by a diverse Board, of which one third of the members are 
women, and a senior management team comprising a 
majority of women.
Supported by territory heads of human resources, the 
managing directors of the four publishing divisions, the 
heads of each Group function and managing directors of 
regional offices have responsibility for the employment 
matters of their teams. The Chief Executive has overall 
Board level responsibility for employment matters. For 
example, where employment matters have a group 
wide impact or cannot be resolved at a lower level in the 
business then they may be referred to the Chief Executive.
The senior management team monitors joiners, leavers, 
headcount, pay rates and other KPIs but the Group does 
not disclose these for commercial reasons that are in the 
interest of the shareholders.
Key features of the Group’s employment policies and 
practices are:
 ✶ Openness: Bloomsbury provides a high degree of 
openness and transparency on its activities and 
performance through information provided to 
employees. Employees are kept updated daily, 
weekly and monthly on sales, book releases, project 
achievements, corporate news and feedback from 
external media and other sources. The Bloomsbury 
Institute arranges regular events which enable staff to 
meet socially. Weekly and other regular team meetings 
and internal annual conferences bring employees 
together from across the Group’s worldwide sites 
allowing team members to formally and informally 
share information about the business and develop 
strong working relationships.
 ✶ Engagement: we promote a friendly collegiate culture 
in which employees are encouraged to discuss their 
concerns and issues with their line managers and 
senior colleagues. The senior management team 
meets frequently to discuss employee matters and is 
supported by regular operational meetings attended 
by managers covering all the Group’s worldwide sites.
 ✶ Ethical behaviour: we expect employees, Directors, 
subcontractors and others to exercise the highest  
ethical standards at all times in respect of the 
relationships and dealings Bloomsbury has with its 
customers, authors and agents, suppliers and other 
third parties. Bloomsbury has whistleblower procedures 
which it publishes at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk enabling 
employees to have their concerns confidentially 
addressed. It also has a formal policy on ethical 
behaviour which is included within employment terms.
 ✶ Employee development: Bloomsbury is acquisitive 
and has benefited from an intake of high calibre 
entrepreneurs who support the Group’s capacity 
to innovate. The Group develops its management 
structure to serve the changing needs of customers 
and authors. This creates opportunities for suitably high 
calibre individuals to progress to increasing levels of 
seniority as they gain capabilities and expertise. External 
recruitment is supported by a Human Resources 
function enabling vacancies across sites worldwide to 
be filled internally where employees of an appropriately 
high calibre seek new opportunities.
 ✶ Performance and merit: senior employees agree 
personal objectives and are rewarded based on 
performance determined by business results and 
appraisals. Senior managers are accountable for the 
performance of their teams and determine the most 
appropriate approach to performance management 
for each team. Promotions and external recruitment 
are based on merit and ensure that the most suitable 
person is selected for each position.
 ✶ Employee participation: the Group offers UK employees 
the opportunity to participate in an all employee HM 
Revenue and Customs approved Sharesave scheme to 
encourage employee participation in the performance 
and growth of the Group. High performing senior 
employees may also be eligible to participate in the 
Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan.
 ✶ Flexible working: we encourage family friendly working 
practices such as flexible working hours and recognise 
that experienced employees returning to work 
following maternity, paternity or other career breaks 
are an asset.

 ✶ Equality of opportunity: Bloomsbury has a diverse 
workforce and follows a policy that no employee or 
other person receives more or less favourable treatment 
on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, colour, 
race and ethnic origin, nationality, religion, disability 
or age. This extends to any person known to be HIV 
positive. The Human Resources function monitors 
compliance with the policy and with applicable 
legislative requirements to ensure the equality 
of opportunity in the recruitment, selection and 
promotion of employees. Grievance and disciplinary 
procedures protect employees from discriminatory 
behaviours and attitudes.
 ✶ Disabled persons: Group policy is to offer equal 
treatment in respect of the recruitment, training, career 
development and promotion of disabled persons. 
Should people become disabled during the course of 
their employment, the Group will seek to retain their 
services and to provide retraining where necessary.
 ✶ Health and safety: The Company Secretary reporting 
to the Chief Executive in respect of Health and Safety 
(‘H&S’) heads an H&S team that ensures Group-wide 
compliance with H&S policy. H&S incident reports are 
reviewed by the Board and at senior team meetings. 
The H&S team works closely with management and 
employees to ensure that the H&S policy is effectively 
communicated, implemented and maintained across 
the business. Managers of the worldwide sites are 
accountable for ensuring their areas of the business are 
in compliance with H&S policy.
Health and safety
The Group maintains risk assessments and accident  
books at its locations and staff are encouraged to report  
all accidents or near misses. The Board reviews health  
and safety annually. During the year there were no fatalities 
or serious injuries. Accidents reported have typically 
included infrequent bumps and scalds associated with the 
office environment.
environment
The Board recognises that a responsible approach to the 
environment is attractive to its existing and prospective 
customers and authors. Customers can require Bloomsbury 
to demonstrate that the Group is a good corporate citizen 
during the tender process for new and existing contracts.
The Executive Committee (which consists of the Executive 
Directors and the managing directors of the publishing 
divisions and group functions) have responsibility for 
environmental matters of their teams. These people 
report to the Chief Executive who has overall Board level 
responsibility for environmental matters and issues.
The impact on the environment of our business 
predominantly arises from the activities we subcontract 
to our suppliers including the printing, production, 
distribution, recycling and disposal of printed books. 
Bloomsbury also has office based information product 
development, editorial, sales and administrative activities 
which operate through an employee workforce based at 
offices in the UK, US (mainly in New York), India (New Delhi) 
and Australia (Sydney).
Our policy is to reduce both the financial cost to 
the business and the impact of the business on the 
environment. We employ specialist independent 
external advisors, Trucost, to monitor our impact on the 
environment. Key areas where we are active in reducing 
the direct and indirect environmental impact of the 
business include:
 ✶ Online print: we are increasingly moving to e-books and 
online products that will save on using natural resources 
and have very little environmental impact. Our strategy 
embraces digital publishing and the potential benefits 
this may bring to the environment.
 ✶ Book printing: we monitor the impact of our 
major suppliers and engage with them to reduce 
environmental impact where possible. We stipulate 
that the pulp used to produce the papers for our books 
comes from well-managed forests and encourage 
our suppliers to obtain Forest Stewardship Council 
(FSC) accreditation and use FSC certified papers. The 
majority of our UK and European suppliers are FSC chain 
of custody certified as are several of our main colour 
printers in Asia.
 ✶ Building and office facilities: most of our employees 
travel to work by public transport and we support part-
time and home-working. For most employees we have 
implemented separate recycling bins for different waste 
materials so that a significant proportion of our office 
waste is recycled. Lights are generally fitted with motion 
detectors and our office policy is to turn off lights out of 
hours when not in use.
We have previously taken advice from the Carbon Trust 
and implemented their recommendations to reduce 
our carbon footprint. For example, we use point of use 
instead of bottled water coolers, fit energy efficient lamps, 
ensure heating systems are regularly maintained and 
programmed efficiently and turn off unnecessary electrical 
equipment out of hours amongst other measures.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On environmental targets
Our target is to beat the average greenhouse gas and 
waste production per employee for the previous 2 years. 
By doing so we are focussed on continuously reducing the 
consumption of natural resources per employee.
Our direct operations are predominately office-based 
and have been independently assessed as having a low 
impact on the environment. The Group’s consumption of 
natural resources, although relatively minor, is significantly 
impacted by ambient weather conditions beyond our 
control and by the buildings we lease. In recent years 
we have changed the main office buildings in London, 
New York, India and Sydney which has impacted on our 
environmental performance.
Greenhouse gases
Our independent external advisor, Trucost, has calculated 
the tables below based on data we have provided. We 
report on our waste production and greenhouse gas 
emissions aligning with the 2006 Government Guidelines, 
Environmental Key Performance Indicators, Reporting 
Guidelines for UK Businesses. In respect of greenhouse 
gases, we report consumption of natural gas, vehicle fuel 
and electricity in kWh, converted to CO
2
-e following the 
protocols provided by the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural affairs (DEFRA). Emissions have been 
categorised against the Greenhouse Gas Protocol scopes of 
reporting. This information is unaudited.

Directors
The names of the Directors as at the date of this report,

Details of Directors’ service contracts and Directors’ 
interests in shares, awards and options are shown in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 68. Other 
than as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
none of the Directors held any interest, either during or 
at the end of the financial year in any material contract 
or arrangement with the Company or any subsidiary 
undertaking.
Company policy is to appoint Directors to the Board on 
the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. 
This may be as part of the progressive refreshing of the 
Board, to reappoint a Director retiring by rotation, to fill a 
vacancy arising as a result of a retiring Director or as part of 
measures taken to enhance the skills, experience, capability 
and balance of the Board.
The effect of the Company’s Articles of Association is to 
require that at least approximately one third of Directors 
who have remained in office for the longest period since 
being elected or re-elected and any Director who did 
not stand for re-election in either of the two proceeding 
Annual General Meetings (‘AGM’s) must retire by rotation. 
The articles also require that new Directors appointed by 
the Board must offer themselves for re-election at the next 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Wendy Pallot and 
Jeremy Wilson retire by rotation at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. Both these Directors, being eligible, offer 
themselves for re-election. The Chairman on behalf of the 
Board confirms that each of the Directors proposed for 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting continues to 
contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment 
to the role (including commitment of time for Board and 
committee meetings and any other duties).
The terms of termination of the Directors’ contracts are 
described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out 
in pages 53 to 68 which includes details of any agreements 
by which the Company would pay compensation to its 
Directors for loss of office, for loss of employment or would 
make payments in respect of a change of control of the 
Company.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to 
the extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred 
as a result of their office. The Group maintained insurance 
throughout the year for its Directors and officers against 
the consequences of actions brought against them in 
relation to their duties for the Group.
Director conflicts of interest
Procedures are in place to ensure compliance with 
the Directors’ conflict of interest duties set out in the 
Companies Act 2006. These procedures have been 
complied with during the year and the Board considers 
that these procedures operate effectively. During the 
year, details of any new potential conflict matters were 
submitted to the Board for consideration and, where 
appropriate, these were approved. Authorised conflicts or 
potential conflict matters will be reviewed by the Board on 
an annual basis.
charitable and political donations
The Group made no charitable donations in respect of the 
year (2012: £15, 000). Details of the non-cash support given 
by the charitable and voluntary activities of the Company 
are as set out in the Corporate Responsibility section on 
pages 32 to 36.
No political donations were made by the Group during the 
current or previous year.
payment policy for suppliers
It is the Company’s policy that payments to suppliers are 
made in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed 
between the Company and its suppliers, provided that 
all trading terms and conditions have been complied 
with. The same policy is adopted by the subsidiaries of the 
Company.
At 28 February 2013 the number of days’ credit taken for 
purchases by the Group was 84 days (2012: 82 days).

share capital and rights attaching to the 
company’s shares
The share capital of the Company comprises a single class 
of ordinary 1.25p shares (‘Ordinary shares’). As at the date 
of this Directors’ Report, there were 73,844,724 fully paid 
issued shares, all listed on the London Stock Exchange, with 
a further 24,614,880 Ordinary shares that the Directors are 
authorised to issue. Details of the issued share capital of the 
Company can be found in note 20 together with details of 
the shares issued and cancelled during the year.
No Ordinary shares carry special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. At a general meeting of the 
Company every member has one vote on a show of hands 
and on a poll one vote for each share held. The notice of 
general meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting 
rights either by proxy or present in person in relation to 
resolutions to be passed at a general meeting.
Under the Articles of Association, any share in the Company 
may be issued with such rights or restrictions, whether in 
regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise as 
the Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution 
determine (or, in the absence of any such determination, 
as the Directors may determine).
No shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, 
entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a 
general meeting or to exercise any other rights conferred 
by being a shareholder if he or she or any person with an 
interest in shares has been sent a notice under section 793 
of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon public 
companies the power to require information with respect 
to interests in their voting shares) and he or she or any 
interested person failed to supply the Company with the 
information requested within 14 days after delivery of that 
notice. The Board may also decide to apply to the court 
for an order under section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 
so that no dividend is payable in respect of those default 
shares and that no transfer of any default shares shall be 
registered. These restrictions end seven days after receipt 
by the Company of a notice of an approved transfer of 
the shares or all the information required by the relevant 
section 793 notice, whichever is earlier.
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer which is 
not a fully-paid share, although such discretion may not be 
exercised in a way which the Financial Conduct Authority 
regards as preventing dealing in the shares of that class 
from taking place on an open proper basis. The Directors 
may likewise refuse any transfer of a share in favour of 
more than four persons jointly.
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions in the 
transfer of Ordinary shares in the Company other than 
certain restrictions that may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); 
and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority whereby certain employees of the Group require 
approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of the securities or voting rights.
share dilution
The Company adheres to “ABI Principles of Remuneration” 
issued in November 2011 by the association of British 
insurers in respect of dilution limits. In particular:
 ✶ The rules of the Company’s LTIP scheme ensure that 
commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury 
shares, when aggregated with awards under all of 
the Company’s other schemes, do not exceed 10% of 
the issued ordinary share capital (adjusted for share 
issuance and cancellation) in any rolling 10 year period.
 ✶ The Remuneration Committee ensures that appropriate 
policies regarding flow-rates exist in order to spread 
the potential issue of new shares over the life of relevant 
schemes so that the limit is not breached.
 ✶ Commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury 
shares under executive (discretionary) schemes do not 
exceed 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the 
Company (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) 
in any rolling 10 year period. The implicit dilution 
commitment is provided for at point of grant even 
where, as in the case of share-settled share appreciation 
rights, it is recognised that only a proportion of shares 
may in practice be used.

authorities to purchase shares, to allot shares 
and pre-emption rights
Notice of the 2013 Annual General Meeting and 
explanatory foreword to the meeting on pages 137 to 143 
form part of the Directors’ Report and set out:
 ✶ an ordinary resolution renewing the authority for 
the Directors to allot shares under section 551 of the 
Companies Act;
 ✶ a special resolution renewing the authority given to the 
Directors to disapply statutory pre-emption rights under 
section 571 of that Act to allow shares to be issued for 
cash or treasury shares to be sold for cash on a non-
preemptive basis; and
 ✶ a special resolution renewing the authority given to the 
Directors to purchase the Company’s own shares on the 
stock market.
employee Benefit trust
Throughout the financial year, Ogier Employee Benefit 
Trustee Limited (‘Trustee’) acted as the trustee of the 
Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). As at 28 
February 2013 the EBT held 1,265,313 ordinary shares of 
1.25 pence in the Company being approximately 1.7% of

Overview Business r eview Governance Financial s Ta Temen Ts cO mpany in FOrma Ti On changes of control
The Group has established close relationships over a 
long period within the publishing markets in which it 
operates. It relies heavily on its goodwill and reputation 
and in particular on its reputation as an autonomous 
independent publisher with authors, customers and key 
employees that could be affected by a change of control.
The Company’s share incentive schemes contain 
provisions relating to a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid (see note 21 for further details of 
the share incentive schemes). Under these provisions, a 
change of control of the Company would normally be a 
vesting event, facilitating the exercise of awards, typically 
subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
contracts and arrangements essential to  
the business
The Group has a diverse base of authors, customers 
and general suppliers so that its dependency on any 
one individual author, customer or supplier is reduced. 
Primarily for printed books, the Group develops longer 
term relationships with a reduced number of business 
partners, printers and distributors to maximise process 
efficiencies and economies of scale. Failure of a main 
supplier could disrupt the supply of books to market 
or result in increased cost of working whilst alternative 
arrangements are made.
The Group depends on its reputation as there is a tendency 
for its authors and customers to behave collectively in the 
selection of their publishing service provider.
future developments
The Group intends to continue to develop its range 
of publishing businesses and other services. Although 
the primary focus of the Group is on organic growth, 
acquisitions in these areas of business will be considered.
Going concern
After making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated and company financial statements in 
accordance with Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: 
Guidance for Directors of UK companies 2009, published 
by the Financial Reporting council in October 2009. 
Further going concern disclosure is given in the financial 
statements as noted in note 2c) of the significant 
accounting policies on page 76.
cautionary statement
Under s417 of the Companies Act 2006, a company’s 
Directors’ Report is required, among other matters, 
to contain a fair review by the Directors of the Group’s 
business through a balanced and comprehensive analysis 
of the development and performance of the business of 
the Group and the position of the Group at the period end, 
consistent with the size and complexity of the business. The 
Directors’ Report together with all sections incorporated 
into it by reference has been prepared only for the 
shareholders of the Company. Its sole purpose and use is 
to assist shareholders to exercise their governance rights. 
In particular, the Directors’ Report has not been audited 
or otherwise independently verified. The Company and its 
Directors and employees are not responsible for any other 
purpose or use or to any other person in relation to the 
Directors’ Report.
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future 
developments and other forward looking statements 
that are subject to risk factors associated with, among 
other things, the economic and business circumstances 
occurring from time to time in the sectors, countries and 
business divisions in which the Group operates. These 
factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed 
under Risk Factors on pages 28 to 31. These and other 
factors could adversely affect the Group’s results, strategy 
and prospects. Forward looking statements involve risks, 
uncertainties and assumptions. They relate to events and/ 
or depend on circumstances in the future which could 
cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from 
those currently anticipated. No obligation is assumed to 
update any forward looking statements, whether as a result 
of new information, future events or otherwise.

a) Reappointment of the Auditor
A resolution to reappoint Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP as auditor 
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting.
b) Statement as to Disclosure of Information to the 
Auditor
The Directors who were in office on the date of approval 
of these financial statements have confirmed that, as far 
as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the auditor is unaware. Each of the Directors 
have confirmed that they have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that it has been communicated to the auditor.

statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors 
Report, the Directors Remuneration Report, the Corporate 
Governance statement and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company financial statements for each financial period. 
The Directors are required under the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority to prepare Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European 
Union (‘EU’) and have elected under company law to 
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS 
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and the financial 
performance of the Group. The Companies Act 2006 
provides in relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve  
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period.
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
c. state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the EU; 
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s and the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure 
and t ransparency rules
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
in the Directors’ Report, confirms that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
a. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
b. the Directors’ Report contained in the Annual 
Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance  
and integrity of the corporate and financial  
information included on the Company’s website,  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

t
he Board takes its responsibility to achieve 
sound governance of the Bloomsbury group 
very seriously and continuously maintains high 
standards of corporate governance that focus 
on serving the interests of the shareholders.
The Company’s compliance throughout the year with 
the main principles of The UK Corporate Governance 
Code (September 2012) in addition to the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority is set out below. The 
UK Corporate Governance Code is also published on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk).
confirmation of compliance with the code
The Board confirms that it has applied the principles and 
complied fully with all provisions of the code in respect of 
the year ended 28 February 2013 except for the following 
provisions:
 ✶ B.2.1 requires that the Chairman of the Board or an 
Independent Non-Executive Director should chair the 
Nomination Committee. The Committee is formed 
of two Independent Non-Executive Directors, the 
Independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, 
and the Chief Executive who continued to chair the 
Committee. The Board considers that provision B.2.1 is 
complied with fully in all other respects. 
 
During the year the Board instigated a recurring formal 
review of the structure of the Committee as an item on 
the Board’s agenda. The Board concluded from this 
review that the Committee continues to ensure that 
the best interests of the shareholders are served. The 
Board considers that the Main Principle and Supporting 
Principles of B.2 are applied effectively.  
 
The Company has a balanced Board of Independent 
and Executive Directors that is progressively refreshed. 
Leading external recruitment consultants are appointed 
for and advise on the recruitment of new directors. 
In the previous three years, external appointments of 
two new Independent Non-Executive Directors and 
a new Finance Director have been made. Directors 
are appointed to the Board objectively on merit from 
diverse backgrounds and one third of the Board are 
women. Performance appraisals of each Independent 
and Executive Director are conducted by the Chairman 
(the assessment of the Chairman is led by the Senior 
Independent Director) as part of the Board’s rigorous 
annual evaluation process which assesses the skills 
and experience of the Board against the needs of the 
business.
 ✶ B.2.3 requires that Non-Executive Directors should 
be appointed for specified periods. The letter of 
appointment for the Chairman of the Board, Jeremy 
Wilson, dated 31 October 2007 specifies that the 
appointment may be terminated by the Director or 
company on a fixed notice period of 3 months. However 
the letter does not specify a fixed renewal period for the 
appointment. The Board considers that provision B.2.3 
has been complied with fully in all other respects. 
 
During the year the Board reviewed the appointment 
terms for Jeremy Wilson as an item on the agenda. The 
Board concluded that amending these terms to include 
a fixed renewal period, for example three years, would 
have no practical effect or benefit to the shareholders. 
The Board reviews the renewal of the Chairman’s 
appointment regularly through the Director retiring 
by rotation and being submitted for re-election at 
Annual General Meetings. Bloomsbury’s annual board 
evaluation assesses the ongoing performance of the 
Chairman. Further, the Board ensures there is planned 
and progressive refreshing of the Board.
Board effectiveness
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for ensuring 
that the Company is appropriately managed and that it 
achieves its objectives. The Board determines the strategy 
for the Group and sets and monitors targets for the 
management team to achieve the strategy.
The Board comprises the Independent Non-Executive 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director, a further 
Independent Non-Executive Director, the Chief Executive, 
the Finance Director and a further Executive Director. The 
biographies of the Directors appears on pages 37 and 38.
The Board met for eight main Board meetings during the 
year with an additional five meetings called during the year 
for the Board to consider specific matters. The agendas 
for main Board meetings provide standing agenda items 
for each Director to provide updates on their area of 
responsibility. Board meetings included reviewing the 
Company’s strategic direction, operating and financial 
performance and overseeing that the Company is 
adequately resourced and effectively controlled.

The Board has approved the matters specifically  
reserved for consideration by the Board. The Board 
determines the responsibilities and authority of its sub-
committees, individual Directors and the level of authorities 
delegated to the management of the business. The Audit 
Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 
Committee have terms of reference approved by the  
Board that can be found on the Company’s website,  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
Matters considered at Board meetings during the year 
have typically included:
 ✶ Review and setting of strategy for the Company’s 
operations.
 ✶ Review of the management accounts, key performance 
indicators and full year forecasts.
 ✶ Approval of the annual and interim results and Interim 
Management Statements.
 ✶ Review and approval of annual budgets.
 ✶ Regular reports by the Chief Executive, proposals and 
updates on developing business operations, significant 
investments, major initiatives, other organisational 
changes and health and safety.
 ✶ Reports of the chairs of sub-committees and minutes 
following sub-committee meetings.
 ✶ Review and approval of decisions, transactions and 
sensitive policies that are significant to the Company 
such as dividends, the organisational, legal and capital 
structure of the Company, acquisitions of literary titles, 
businesses and companies and major contracts.
 ✶ Risk management and review of the risks of the 
Company.
 ✶ Evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board including 
the appropriateness of the terms of reference of  
sub-committees.
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head 
of the Company, with the Chairman responsible for 
the effective operation of the Board, encouraging 
the active participation of all Directors, and the Chief 
Executive responsible for the strategic running of the 
Company’s businesses. The Board has approved formal 
statements describing the role and remit of both the 
Chairman and Chief Executive, which further emphasise 
this division of responsibilities. The Executive Directors 
regularly hold formal meetings with senior managers as a 
management team to assist the Chief Executive in fulfilling 
his operational objectives. This management team makes 
recommendations to the Board and seeks approval from 
the Board where required. The Non-Executive Directors 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on 
strategy at meetings specifically set up for the purpose, 
which are attended by all Board members.
All Directors and Board sub-committees have access 
to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and advising the Board, through the 
Chairman, on governance matters. They also have access 
to independent professional advice, if required, at the 
Company’s expense.
The Chairman has held regular meetings during the year 
with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors present to discuss relevant matters.
Policy on Board diversity
On average for the year women have comprised one third 
of the Board which is significantly ahead of the minimum 
target representation level to be achieved by 2015 as 
recommended by the Davies Review.
The policy of the Board is that all directors should be 
appointed purely on merit whatever their gender or 
background. The Board has set a target that a minimum of 
one third of Board Directors together with members of the 
senior management team should be women. The present 
Board and senior management team exceeds the target.
Director independence
The Board considers each of the three Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Non-Executive Chairman, who 
served during the year to be independent in character 
and judgement and does not consider that there are 
any relationships or circumstances which affect, or could 
appear to affect, their independent judgement.

Board evaluation
The Board conducts a formal evaluation annually which 
considers the balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the Board, its diversity including gender, 
how the Board works together as a unit and other factors 
relevant to its effectiveness. The evaluation reviews the 
progress made by the Board with developing strategy and 
with the underlying processes supporting the effective 
operation of the Board including the quality of information 
it receives.
The evaluation of the Board and of each individual Director 
is through:
 ✶ one-to-one interviews of Directors with the Chairman 
to review the Board processes using evaluation 
questionnaires to facilitate discussion
 ✶ the Chairman holds a further round of one-to-one 
appraisal interviews to review the performance of each 
Director as a Plc Board Director
 ✶ the Chair of each sub-committee leads the evaluation of 
their committee
 ✶ the Chief Executive conducts additional management 
performance appraisals of the Executive Directors and 
the senior management team
 ✶ the Board discusses the findings and recommendations 
for improvement actions in respect of evaluations of 
the Board, each Director, the sub-committees and the 
processes supporting the Board
 ✶ the Chairman may hold further one-to-one interviews 
with Directors to follow up issues and actions
The performance evaluation of the Chairman is led by the 
Senior Independent Director. The evaluation is undertaken 
using assessment questionnaires and an one-to-one 
interview of the Chairman with the Senior Independent 
Director who takes account of the confidential views of the 
other Directors.
Upon completing the interviews, the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director make formal reports to the Board 
on the findings with recommendations for actions to be 
implemented by the Board, by individual Directors, by the 
Company Secretary and by senior management in the 
business. Where needed the Chairman holds confidential 
follow up meetings with individual Directors to address 
concerns they have raised or to address concerns raised 
about them by other Directors. The Board monitors 
progress with implementing the actions.
The performance of the Board sub-committees is evaluated 
annually using detailed assessment questionnaires which 
review the performance of the committees against best 
practice. The questionnaires are completed as appropriate 
by the Non-Executive and Executive Directors, the 
External Auditor and Company Secretary. The Company 
Secretary collates a report of anonymous responses to 
questionnaires from which recommended improvements 
to committee processes are agreed by the committees 
and the Board. Each sub-committee considers its terms 
of reference and adherence to the terms of reference at 
least annually and, if considered necessary, recommends 
changes for the Board to approve.

The conclusions of the Board evaluations are considered 
by the Nomination Committee when reviewing the 
structure and composition of the Board and succession 
planning. As a result of the review of performance, the 
Chairman on behalf of the Board confirms that each of the 
Directors proposed for re-election at the AGM continues 
to contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment 
to the role (including commitment of time for Board and 
committee meetings and any other duties).
Training and development of the Directors
The Board evaluation including director appraisals by the 
Chairman considers whether each Director has refreshed 
their skills and knowledge sufficiently and provides an 
opportunity for Directors to identify where training and 
development can assist them in the performance of their 
duties. Development may include, for example, meetings 
with senior managers to gain an improved understanding 
of the business.
Directors are provided with extensive director knowledge 
checklists to help them self-assess their personal learning 
needs and they have access to numerous relevant 
publications by Bloomsbury. Formal training is provided 
to the Board by the External Auditor and external 
remuneration consultants who assign time in meetings 
to provide updates on and to explain topical areas of 
corporate governance, remuneration, auditing and 
financial reporting.
The Board is progressively refreshed, bringing in new skills 
and experience from which each Director on the Board  
can learn.
remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the two 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and Chairman of 
the Board and is chaired by Sarah Jane Thomson. The 
Committee met six times during the year.
The Committee formulates and recommends to the Board 
the policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors 
including the Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board. 
It approves the design of, and determines the targets for, 
the short-term and long-term incentive schemes for the 
Executive Directors and the senior management team. The 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined 
jointly by the Chairman and the Executive Directors and the 
remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board 
excluding the Chairman. The Committee is supported 
by remuneration consultants New Bridge Street who 
work exclusively for the Committee and have no other 
commercial connection with the Company. A statement  
to this effect is included on the Company’s website,  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
The Committee ensures that the contractual terms and 
payments upon the termination of Directors’ services are 
fair and do not reward failure, and that the duty to mitigate 
loss is fully recognised. It approves the design of employee 
share incentive plans, the grant of share incentive awards 
and options to employees and determines whether the 
performance criteria have been met for the vesting 
of awards and options. The Committee monitors the 
remuneration trends for employees generally across 
the Company and oversees major changes in employee 
benefits structures.
During the year there were no new long-term incentive 
schemes (as defined in the Listing Rules) or significant 
changes to existing schemes. However, the Board would 
seek the approval of the shareholders for new long-term 
incentive schemes and significant changes to existing 
schemes.
audit committee
The Committee comprises two Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, Ian Cormack and Sarah Jane Thomson. The Chair 
of the Committee is Ian Cormack. The Committee met on 
three occasions during the year. The Board is satisfied that 
the experience of Ian Cormack is sufficient for him to meet 
the experience and qualification requirements to be a 
member of the Audit Committee with recent and relevant 
financial experience under the Code and the UK listing 
authority Listing Rules.
The terms of reference of the Committee can be found 
on the Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk, 
and set out the role and authority of the Committee. 
Responsibilities and matters reserved for the Committee 
include oversight of the relationship and process with the 
External Auditor; review of significant financial information, 
including assumptions, judgements of management and 
critical accounting policies, to be published externally; 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s systems 
of internal control and risk management; reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function; and 
recommending to the Board changes to the Committee’s 
terms of reference.
During the year the Committee has reviewed the interim 
and annual results and Interim Management Statements 
to ensure that overall they present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects before approval by the Board. The Committee 
approves all significant changes in accounting policies. 
It has reviewed the Company’s statement on internal 
control systems prior to endorsement by the Board and 
has reviewed the policies and processes for identifying, 
assessing and managing business risks.

Overview Business r eview Governance Financial s Ta Temen Ts cO mpany in FOrma Ti On The Committee reviews the plans, findings and 
recommendations of the Internal Auditor, and 
management’s responses to internal audit 
recommendations. It ensures that the internal audit 
function is adequately resourced in light of the system of 
risk management and has appropriate standing within the 
Company. The Committee evaluates the effectiveness of 
the internal auditor and approves the appointment and 
removal of the Head of Internal Audit.
The Committee typically invites the External Auditor, 
Internal Auditor, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, 
Finance Director and Executive Director to attend 
meetings. It meets at least once in respect of each 
reporting period and a standard item on the agenda for 
every meeting is a meeting with the External Auditor alone 
without management present.
The Committee formally reviews the whistle-blowing 
arrangements of the Company by which staff may, in 
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or other matters. The 
Committee’s objective is to ensure that arrangements 
are in place for the proportionate and independent 
investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up 
action.
The Committee’s annual evaluation, which forms part 
of the Board evaluation, reviews how the Committee 
has discharged its responsibilities. The findings of the 
evaluation and recommendations arising are reported to 
the Board.
Significant issues in relation to the  
financial statements
The Committee identifies issues that could be significant 
to the financial statements by considering financial 
reporting risk assessments and reports on the internal 
controls from the Finance Director, a separate detailed 
group risk evaluation by the senior management team, 
internal audit reports, audit planning discussions with the 
External Auditor, discussions with management and the 
Committee’s cumulative knowledge of the business. At 
least one Committee meeting per year focuses primarily 
on planning the external audit enabling the Committee 
to review the level of assurance provided by the External 
Auditor on significant areas.
Areas identified as having the potential to significantly 
affect the financial statements include ensuring
 ✶ printed book returns from retailers are accounted for in 
the right accounting period
 ✶ goodwill and intangible assets arising from acquisitions 
are supported
 ✶ advances to authors held as an asset in the balance 
sheet are recoverable from royalties on future book 
sales
 ✶ investments in and receivables from group 
undertakings are recoverable
 ✶ revenue on rights and services projects is recognised in 
the right accounting period
For each area the Committee considers management’s 
approach and reviews the external audit plan with the 
External Auditor together with the findings from the 
external audit. As a standing item, each Committee 
meeting agenda includes a discussion with the External 
Auditor without management present which provides the 
opportunity for the Committee and External Auditor to 
raise any concerns that they may have.
Assessment of the effectiveness of the external  
audit process
The Committee has reviewed and assessed the 
effectiveness of the audit process as an item on the agenda 
for a Committee meeting. The review considered the 
procedures and independence of the External Auditor, 
the Financial Reporting Council findings for the review 
of External Auditor, the latest Transparency Report of the 
External Auditor and the external audit plan. The annual 
Board evaluation of the Board and Audit Committee 
reviewed the effectiveness of how the external audit 
process integrated with the business process for the Group.
Appointment of the External Auditor
The Committee monitors the independence and objectivity 
of the External Auditor, ensuring that key audit partners 
are rotated at appropriate intervals. The Shareholders first 
approved the re-appointment of Baker Tilly as the External 
Auditor at the Annual General Meeting held 27 June 
2002. Supported by the Board, the Committee anticipates 
tendering the appointment of the External Auditor after 
the Annual General Meeting.

Non-audit services
The Committee reviews the level of non-audit fees 
relative to audit fees and has approved a formal policy 
on the provision of non-audit services to safeguard the 
independence and objectivity of the External Auditor. The 
policy prohibits the External Auditor from being engaged 
on work where their independence could be threatened 
and requires the pre-approval by the Committee of other 
non-audit services where the fees of the External Auditor 
would exceed £5,000. Further safeguards are employed 
such as audit and non-audit work being performed by 
different teams from the External Auditor.
nomination committee
The Committee comprises three Independent Non-
Executive Directors, including the Chairman of the Board, 
and the Chief Executive who chairs the Committee. The 
Committee met once during the year.
The Committee operates under terms of reference agreed 
by the whole Board, and which are available on the 
Company’s website. Its role is to review the composition of 
the Board, consider succession planning and nominate to 
the Board, for approval, candidates to fill Board vacancies. 
The Committee determines the Directors who should 
stand for re-election at the AGM in accordance with the 
articles of association of the Company. The Board formally 
approves the appointment of all new Directors on the 
recommendation of the Committee.
Board appointment process
Appointment of new Directors
The Board adopts a formal and rigorous approach to the 
appointment of Directors. The following outlines the Board 
appointment process that has been followed:
 ✶ the need to appoint a new Director is identified by an 
existing Board member’s intention to retire or by the 
monitoring by the Committee of the Board’s structure, 
balance, succession planning and need for progressive 
refreshing which takes account of the findings of the 
Board’s evaluation of the skills and capabilities of Board 
members;
 ✶ the Committee determines the recruitment process;
 ✶ the Committee considers the strengths and weaknesses 
of the Board, the management senior team and the 
business to define the experience and capabilities 
required for the new appointment;
 ✶ external recruitment consultants are appointed and 
briefed with the requirements for candidates; filtering 
selects a long list of the highest calibre candidates; 
standard interviews are conducted on the long list by 
two Directors sitting together supported by the external 
recruitment consultant; and a short list of candidates is 
recommended to the Committee. The recommended 
candidates are supported by further detailed 
background research to confirm their suitability which 
includes detailed references taken up by the Company;
 ✶ the Committee considers whether a suitable high calibre 
candidate can be selected and, if so, recommends a 
single candidate to the Board.
The Chairman ensures that new Directors receive a full, 
formal and tailored induction on joining the Board. Newly 
appointed Directors are provided with the opportunity to 
meet major shareholders as part of the investor relations 
programme of the Company.
Re-election of Directors
All Directors are subject to appointment by the 
shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their 
appointment, and reappointment thereafter at intervals 
of no more than three years. Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to 
reappointment and a notice period by the Company or 
the Director (notice periods are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 68). A policy is 
followed of progressive refreshing of the Board and the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors can be expected to 
retire from the Board no later than during the third three 
year period or earlier if appropriate.
relations with shareholders
The Board led by the Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
an open dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives.
The Annual Report, Interim Reports, Interim Management 
Statements, AGM, market updates and post results 
announcement presentations are the principal means 
through which the Company communicates its strategy 
and performance to shareholders. All shareholders are 
welcome to attend the AGM and investors are encouraged 
to take advantage of the opportunity given to ask 
questions. The Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees attend the meeting and are 
available to answer questions, as appropriate.

Overview Business r eview Governance Financial s Ta Temen Ts cO mpany in FOrma Ti On The Company maintains an active dialogue with its 
institutional shareholders and City analysts through a 
planned programme of investor relations. The programme 
includes formal presentations of results and post results 
meetings with the major shareholders and other investors 
who request meetings. The presentations are made 
available on the website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The 
meetings and presentations provide an opportunity for 
shareholders to ask questions and to meet the Executive 
Directors including the Chief Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors including the Senior Independent Director. The 
outcome of regular meetings with the main shareholders, 
presentations and post results meetings is reported to 
the Board. This includes both feedback from individual 
Directors and feedback collated from discussions by the 
Company’s corporate broker with the main shareholders. 
The Company’s corporate broker provides regular 
shareholder analysis to the Board. Feedback from 
shareholders and other members of the shareholder 
corporate governance community is used to help review 
and develop Bloomsbury’s procedures.
The Chairman writes annually to the major shareholders 
inviting them to meet to discuss governance and strategy 
and to review with them the Company’s performance. 
The Chairman has met with a number of shareholders in 
respect of the year.
Meetings on corporate governance with  
major shareholders
The Company requests meetings with the major 
shareholders each year to provide shareholders with the 
opportunity to openly discuss corporate governance 
matters, including remuneration, and raise any concerns. 
Following the meetings the Chairman reports to the Board 
on the discussions held including any feedback from the 
shareholders. 
internal control and risk management
The Code requires the Directors to assess at least annually 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control 
which include financial, operational and compliance 
controls, and risk management. This review has been 
carried out by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, for 
setting policy on internal control, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control. The role of management 
is to implement Board policies on risk and control. The 
system of internal control is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material financial misstatement 
or loss.
The Board operates both formally, through Board and 
committee meetings, and informally, through regular 
contact amongst Directors. High level decisions on such 
matters as strategy, financial performance and reporting, 
dividends, risk management, major capital expenditure, 
acquisitions and disposals are reserved for the Board or 
Board committees. For its regular formal meetings, the 
Board receives appropriate information in advance from 
management. Other decisions outside of these areas are 
delegated to the Company’s management, which reports 
to the Executive Directors.
The Board has put in place an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Company in accordance with the guidance of 
the Turnbull Committee on internal control. This process 
has been in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report. The process 
is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf 
of the Board to ensure that the procedures implemented 
continue to be effective and, where appropriate, 
recommendations are made to management to improve 
the procedures. The Company’s system of internal financial 
control aims to safeguard the Company’s assets, ensure 
that proper accounting records are maintained, that the 
financial information used within the business and for 
publication is reliable, that business risks are identified and 
managed and that compliance with appropriate legislation 
and regulation is maintained.
Internal control and risk management framework
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
of the Company is the responsibility of the Finance Director 
and is overseen by the Audit Committee and the Board. 
This includes responsibility for ensuring appropriate 
internal controls are in place over financial reporting 
processes and related IT systems. The Audit Committee 
monitors the risks and associated controls over financial 
reporting processes, including the consolidation process.
Relevant features of the Company’s system of internal 
controls and risk management in relation to the financial 
reporting process and preparation of the Group financial 
statements include:
Organisational culture: The Company has a highly skilled, 
professional and committed workforce. The Board is 
committed to developing a culture of openness, integrity, 
competence and responsibility. The Board concentrates 
mainly on strategic and significant organisational issues, 
approving objectives and monitoring, at a high level, the 
financial and operational performance against objectives.

Risk and control review: The Company maintains risk 
logs and a risk matrix supported by risk reviews by 
management and the Internal Auditor. The Executive 
Committee (which comprises the senior management 
team and Executive Directors) and Board have reviewed 
the significant risks and ensure appropriate action is 
being taken to address the risks. The Audit Committee has 
reviewed the Company’s financial risk matrix of areas  
that could impact on reporting when considering the 
financial statements.
Financial internal control and risk review: The Finance 
Director formally reviews the internal financial controls 
taking account of the risks within the financial information 
systems and reports the findings of this review to the 
Audit Committee. Analytical review of operating results 
and detailed control questionnaires completed for the 
publishing divisions and overseas offices supplement 
management’s knowledge of the business for the 
evaluation of the risks and assessment of the internal 
financial controls. The Audit Committee also receives 
reports on the internal controls and risks provided by 
the Internal Auditor. The Audit Committee receives 
other reports from management relevant to the internal 
financial controls such as reports on the progress of  
key projects.
Authority levels: The Board sets the level of authority 
required, before Board approval is needed, to commit  
the Company or to undertake transactions. It also  
approves budgets and other performance targets. The 
publishing divisions and Group functions operate  
within these authority levels and budgets. The Executive 
Directors determine the authority to be delegated to 
individual managers.
Financial management reporting: The Board approves 
the annual Group budget. Sales are reported daily, weekly 
and monthly. Financial results of the business operations 
are reported monthly and compared to budgets. The 
Group has a yearly forecast and variances in the forecast 
are analysed monthly. Detailed forecasts for the Company 
are updated regularly and reviewed by the Board.
Book title acquisition procedures: Established procedures, 
such as the review and approval by an Executive Director  
of acquisition proposals of rights to new books, are 
operated within set authority limits and used for 
transactions in the ordinary course of business. Acquisitions 
exceeding delegated authority limits require approval 
by the Board. Significant acquisitions of companies and 
businesses are approved by the Board. The Board has 
set authorised limits for the total author advances in the 
balance sheet as a percentage of net assets and for the 
total committed but not paid advances.
Accountability: The Company has clearly defined lines of 
responsibility headed by the Chief Executive and Executive 
Committee to control the publishing divisions and business 
functions. Each overseas office has a local manager or 
managing director who is responsible for operational 
effectiveness and local internal controls. Detailed 
operational and financial performance data are monitored 
by supervisory management to ensure the performance of 
operations is in line with targets. The reasons for variances 
and under performance are established by supervisory line 
management.
Internal Audit: An internal audit function conducts risk 
based audits of the processes agreed with the Audit 
Committee to review the internal controls. Its conclusions 
are communicated to senior management and the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee considers reports from 
External and Internal Audit to ensure that adequate 
measures are being taken by management to address 
risk and control issues. The Company Secretary is the 
Head of Internal Audit and reports to the Chair of the 
Audit Committee and the Chief Executive in respect of risk 
management and internal audit work.

Overview Business r eview Governance Financial s Ta Temen Ts cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Dear shareholder
i 
am delighted to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year 
ended 28 February 2013 (the ‘Report’). The Report 
has been prepared on behalf of the Bloomsbury 
Board by the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) 
and has been approved by the Board. As required by the 
Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’), a resolution to approve the 
Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Committee has adopted the principles of good 
governance relating to Directors’ Remuneration as set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The 
report complies with the Act and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority. The Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Code relating to Directors’ 
Remuneration throughout the year. 
The Report incorporates a number of changes in the 
spirit of the forthcoming legislation on Directors’ pay, as 
developed by the Department of Business, Innovation and 
Skills (‘BIS’). The Company will be required to adopt the 
new legislation in full for the 2013/14 Remuneration Report.
Consistent with the draft BIS proposals, the Report is split 
into two sections (see below):
 ✶ Part A, the Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the 
policy on the remuneration of the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors, and
 ✶ Part B, the Implementation Report, which discloses how 
the Remuneration Policy has been implemented for the 
year ended 28 February 2013.
The Act requires the External Auditor to state whether, 
in their opinion, certain parts of the Report have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the applicable 
regulations. Part B-1 has been audited while Part A and Part 
B-2 are not subject to audit.
Key message and changes during the year
Bloomsbury delivered another good set of results for 
the year against the background of a rapidly evolving 
publishing market place and the generally slow economic 
environment in many areas of the world. The Committee 
recognises the strong performance and hard work of  an 
exceptional management team in their delivery of the 
Board’s strategic aims which are set out in the Overview 
and Business Review sections of the Annual Report on 
pages 2 to 36.
In applying the Remuneration Policy (see below) the 
Committee’s priority is to ensure that the interests of the 
shareholders and, where beneficial to the shareholders, 
other stakeholders are served whilst the Executive Directors 
and senior management team are treated fairly. In 
reaching its decisions the Committee considers the views 
and feedback it receives from shareholders and other 
members of the shareholder corporate governance 
community together with the views of management.
During of the financial year ended 28 February 2013 the 
Committee:
Fixed pay and annual bonus
 ✶ Approved no increase in basic salaries for Executive 
Directors in respect of the year ended 28 February 2014 
in line with a pay freeze for higher paid employees 
across the Group;
 ✶ Approved that bonuses should not be paid for 
Executive Directors and the senior management team. 
The Committee sets stretching targets for an annual 
bonus taking account of the performance needed to 
beat both the consensus forecast of City analysts and 
stretching operational targets. Whilst the strong results 
for the year achieved by the management team came 
close to hitting the threshold bonus target, no bonuses 
will be payable;
Long Term Incentive Plan
 ✶ Approved the grant of 2012 LTIP awards to the Executive 
Directors and senior managers with vesting targets 
that ensure stretching performance is required for 
minimum threshold vesting and that the highest levels 
of performance are required for full vesting;
 ✶ Approved vesting restricted to a level of 50% for the 
LTIP awards granted in 2009;

Remuneration process and corporate governance
 ✶ From listening to the feedback received from 
shareholders and the shareholder corporate 
governance community:
 − Introduced Executive Director Share Ownership 
Guidelines; 
 − Amended the Remuneration Policy for LTIP awards 
granted with TSR performance conditions to reduce 
the level of minimum threshold vesting in line with 
best practice;
 − Reduced the number of vesting thresholds for 
awards granted with EPS performance conditions;
 ✶ Reviewed the structure of Executive Director 
remuneration and concluded that the levels as a 
percentage of basic salary for LTIP awards under 
the Remuneration Policy continue to provide an 
appropriate incentive to attract, retain and motivate 
the Executive Directors to achieve the highest levels 
of performance that is aligned with the longer-term 
interests of the shareholders;
 ✶ Considered the draft BIS proposals; and
 ✶ Reviewed the Committee’s procedures against its Terms 
of Reference, which were recently replaced with best 
practice terms. 
Remuneration of the Chairman and  
Non-Executive Directors
The Board approved no increase to the annual fees of the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors in respect of the 
year ended 28 February 2014.
In conclusion, the Committee considers that the 
Remuneration Policy continues to incentivise the 
sustainable delivery of the Board’s strategy, strong 
financial performance and the creation of long term 
shareholder value.

remuneration committee
Membership
Throughout the year ended 28 February 2013 the 
Committee has comprised three Independent Non-
Executive Directors, namely Sarah Jane Thomson, Ian 
Cormack and Jeremy Wilson. Sarah Jane Thomson has 
chaired the Committee since 28 May 2010. The Company 
Secretary, Michael Daykin, acts as secretary to the 
Committee.
Assistance to the Committee
During the year the Committee took advice from external 
remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, which do not 
perform other services for and have no other connection 
with the Company. The Committee is free to choose its 
advisors and is satisfied that New Bridge Street continues to 
provide advice that is objective and independent.
The Committee received assistance from the Company 
Secretary and, where specifically requested by the 
Committee, the Chief Executive and Finance Director. 
The Committee has considered any feedback received 
from the major shareholders during the year as part of 
Bloomsbury’s ongoing investor relations programme 
and considers the reports and recommendations of 
shareholder representative bodies and corporate 
governance analysts.
Responsibilities and activities of the Committee
The Committee determines the Remuneration Policy and 
annual remuneration plans for the Executive Directors 
for approval by the Board. In particular, the Committee 
approves for each Executive Director the basic salaries, 
pensions, other benefits, bonus awards and the awards 
made under Bloomsbury’s Long Term incentive Plan (see 
below). The Committee approves all payments of bonus and 
the vesting of LTIP awards before payments are made for 
each Executive Director. The Committee approves whether 
Executive Directors may participate in the Company’s 
Sharesave scheme (see below) in years when it is run.
The Committee considers it is appropriate for the Executive 
Directors to determine the remuneration plans of senior 
management. In respect of employees below the level of 
the Board, the Committee approves the bonus pool from 
which bonuses are paid and approves the grant/vesting of 
all LTIP awards before payments are made.
The Committee met formally on six occasions during the 
year including five occasions without the Executive Directors 
present and on one occasion with an Executive Director 
attending at the request of the Committee for specific 
items on the agenda. New Bridge Street attends Committee

1) Basic salary
Operation
Basic salaries for the Executive Directors are reviewed 
annually and are set at levels that take account of the 
performance, experience and responsibilities of each 
individual concerned having regard to the prevailing 
market conditions and the budgeted annual increase in 
basic salaries for Bloomsbury employees generally. On 
appointment, the basic salaries for Executive Directors 
take account of appropriate market competitive ranges 
from companies of a similar size and complexity. The 
Committee determines as a proportion of basic salary the 
level of opportunity to earn a performance related annual 
bonus, the level of opportunity to earn long-term incentive 
awards and Company contributions to a contributory 
pension scheme. 
Levels of basic salary
In respect of the year ended 28 February 2014, the Group’s 
lower paid employees are budgeted to receive pay 
increases in line with the publishing industry. Increases for 
higher paid employees have been limited to 0% subject 
to adjustments for promotions. This should increase the

4) performance related annual bonus
The Committee determines the policy on an annual cash 
bonus scheme for the Executive Directors and the eligibility 
of Executive Directors to participate in the scheme. The 
Committee is satisfied that the annual cash bonus strongly 
aligns the interests of Executive Directors with those of the 
shareholders and that the bonus provides the Executive 
Directors with a strong incentive for the highest levels of 
performance over the coming financial year.
The annual bonus opportunity, as a percentage of basic 
salary for the Executive Directors, for the year just ended 
and for 2013/14 is as follows:
Actual bonus opportunities
Period end:
28 February 
2014

2013
Profit Related bonus 70% 70%
Personal Objectives bonus 10% 10%
Strategic Objectives bonus 20% 20%
Maximum bonus opportunity 100% 100%
Operation of the bonus pool
Bonuses paid to the Executive Directors and other 
managers in the business are paid from a bonus pool 
approved by the Committee. The bonus pool is calculated 
by applying formulae based on Adjusted Profit and targets 
set by the Committee. If there is a short-fall in the bonus 
pool such that the pool is not sufficient to fund full bonuses 
then the bonuses for the Executive Directors and other 
managers are scaled back in proportion to the short-fall.
The Committee sets a minimum target for Adjusted Profit 
below which no bonuses are paid. The minimum target 
is in line with City analysts’ key indices, namely forecast 
Adjusted Profit.
Profit measurement for annual cash bonus
Consistent with other UK listed companies in the media 
sector, the Committee considers that audited Adjusted 
Profit from continuing operations (that is profit from 
continuing operations before amortisation, highlighted 
items and tax) to be an appropriate financial measure 
for the performance targets for profit related bonus. This 
measure of underlying performance is consistent with 
the profit forecasts that City analysts publish and ensures 
that the majority of the annual cash bonus and the short-
term financial achievement of the Executive Directors are 
aligned with the interests of the shareholders.
The Committee may use its independent discretion to 
adjust bonus payments in order to ensure they are aligned 
with the interests of shareholders. The Committee considers 
each highlighted item that is excluded from Adjusted Profit 
and determines whether, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the treatment with respect to bonus is in the interests of 
shareholders.
In determining whether highlighted items may be 
excluded from Adjusted Profit for the purposes of 
calculating the bonus the Committee applies the following 
criteria:
 ✶ the highlighted items relate to important strategic 
steps instructed by the Board that have been taken to 
strengthen the business;
 ✶ future profits should benefit from the investment value 
of the highlighted items;
 ✶ failure to implement the strategic steps and incur the 
highlighted items would have been detrimental to the 
interests of the shareholders;
 ✶ management has mitigated the quantum of the 
highlighted items; and
 ✶ the highlighted items are measureable, properly 
accounted for and audited.
The Committee also takes account of whether highlighted 
items have arisen as a result of the Executive Directors 
achieving their personal and strategic bonus objectives 
approved by the Committee.
Further information on the annual bonus can be found 
below in Part B.

Overview Business r eview Governance Financial s Ta Temen Ts cO mpany in FOrma Ti On 5) long term incentive plans
The Company’s primary long term incentive plan (‘LTIP’) 
is the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2005 Performance Share 
Plan which was approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting held on 27 September 2005. LTIP awards 
are made by the Committee to the Executive Directors and 
managers below Board level.
Details of the Directors’ LTIP awards granted, vesting  
and outstanding for the financial year are shown below in 
Part B-1.
Level of LTIP awards
The policy of the Committee is to apply a maximum award 
level of 75% of basic salary for the Chief Executive, 66% 
for the other Executive Directors and lower levels for 
individuals below the level of the Board.
The Committee may use its discretion to approve a  
one-time enhanced award to an Executive Director upon 
their appointment to the Board. The purpose is to increase 
the exposure of the Executive Director to the risks and 
rewards of share ownership early on in their appointment 
so that their interests are aligned with the shareholders. 
The terms of the LTIP approved by the shareholders permit 
awards to be granted to Executive Directors and senior 
individuals in excess of the policy of the Committee up to  
a maximum level of 150% of basic salary per annum.
Executive Director LTIP award levels, as operated last  
year and as intended to be operated going forward,  
are as follows:
% of basic 
salary
Nigel Newton 75%
Richard Charkin 66%
Wendy Pallot 66%
Performance conditions for LTIP awards
LTIP awards are subject to two non-concurrent 
performance conditions, namely 50% of the awards are 
subject to normalised earnings per share (‘EPS’) targets 
and 50% of the awards are subject to Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’) targets at the end of a three year period. LTIP 
awards lapse in the event that the conditions are not met at 
the end of the three year performance period.
The Committee has reviewed the LTIP and concluded 
that non-concurrent rather than concurrent EPS 
and TSR performance conditions provide the most 
effective incentive to align the long-term interests of 
LTIP participants with the long-term interests of the 
shareholders.
The Committee determines performance conditions for 
each LTIP award at the time of making an award.
TSR targets
The performance conditions used for outstanding LTIP 
awards are set out below in Part B-1. The policy for setting 
performance conditions for new grants of awards can be 
summarised as:
Parameter Details
Comparator group FTSE Mid-250 excluding investment 
trusts 
Duration of awards Awards fall due for vesting on the 
on the third anniversary of the

part of an award vests, pro-rata
TSR performance 
period measurement
TSR based on share price and 
averaged over one to three 
months before the grant date and 
vesting date as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee.
The terms of the LTIP awards permit the Committee to 
restrict vesting in circumstances where the Committee 
considers that the Company’s TSR rank in the Comparator 
Group is not reflective of the underlying performance of 
the Company.

LTIP awards with EPS targets
The Committee takes the following approach to setting EPS 
performance targets for LTIP awards:
 ✶ The threshold normalised EPS target is set with reference 
to City Analysts’ indices for Adjusted EPS prevailing at 
the time the awards are granted; and
 ✶ The maximum normalised EPS target is an achievable 
but highly stretching target based on long-term 
projections for the Group under different scenarios.
Vesting is on a straight line basis between threshold  
and maximum targets. There is no vesting below the 
threshold target.
Awards in previous years also contained a ‘Mid Vesting’ 
target. During the year the Committee reviewed this 
structure and concluded that eliminating the ‘Mid Vesting’ 
threshold made the relationship between reward and 
performance clearer over the full range of the EPS targets. 
This change applies to the 2012 LTIP and onwards.
The Committee considers that audited Adjusted diluted 
EPS from continuing and discontinued operations (see 
note 11 of the Financial Statements on page 97) remains 
an appropriate measure for normalised EPS performance 
targets for the LTIP. This measure of EPS is consistent with 
the forecasts for EPS published by City analysts and ensures 
the performance required for LTIP awards to vest is both 
clear to management and the shareholders and aligned 
with the interests of the shareholders.
The Committee considers that the absolute EPS targets 
provide the greatest clarity to shareholders and 
management on the long-term performance required in 
order for LTIP awards to vest.
vesting of awards
The vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the approval 
of the Committee and to which the Committee will 
apply its Intervention Policy. Under this policy the 
Committee may apply its independent discretion to 
modify the measurement of EPS to ensure that the 
interests of management are aligned with those of the 
shareholders. For example, the Committee may review the 
appropriateness of the treatment of highlighted items with 
regards to the calculation of EPS used for determining the 
level of vesting.
The Committee will consider the impact of share buy-backs 
over the relevant performance periods for the purposes of 
determining the level of vesting of share incentive awards.
Savings related share option scheme (“Sharesave”)
Subject to the approval of the Committee each Executive 
Director is eligible to voluntarily participate in the 
Company’s all-employee HM Revenue and Customs 
approved Sharesave scheme. The Company intends to run 
a new annual Sharesave scheme in most years. A Sharesave 
scheme allows participants to make 36 equal monthly 
instalments under a building society savings contract. 
On maturity of the savings contract, participants may use 
the savings plus interest to purchase shares under share 
options granted at a discount of 15% to the market price at 
the start of the savings contract. Company policy is to limit 
the monthly savings into any Sharesave scheme to £100 
per participant and to limit the total monthly savings into 
all Sharesave schemes to £250.
Details of the Executive Directors’ outstanding Sharesave 
options are shown in Part B-1 below.
6) executive Director share Ownership 
Guidelines
During the year ended 28 February 2013 the Committee 
implemented the Executive Director Share Ownership 
Guidelines.
Under the guidelines the Executive Directors are expected 
to build and maintain a shareholding valued at 100% of 
basic salary with no upper limit on the number of shares 
they may hold. A time limit is not set to accumulate the 
shareholding however Executive Directors are required to 
retain all shares arising from vested LTIP awards (net of tax) 
or purchase shares until the shareholding guideline is met. 
The number of shares needed to satisfy the shareholding is 
recalculated annually at the close of the next business day 
following the announcement of the full year results taking 
account of changes to basic salary.
Part B-2 below includes a review of achievement of the 
shareholding guideline for each Executive Director.

Other remuneration matters
Change of control provisions for share incentive schemes
On a change of control, LTIP awards vest to the extent that the performance conditions, as adjusted for the reduced 
vesting period due to the change of control, have been achieved subject to settlement of taxes arising on vesting. The 
Committee determines a reasonable basis for measuring the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
achieved. Sharesave options become exercisable on a change of control, however the treatment for tax would be subject 
to HM Revenue & Customs regulations that apply at the time.
Remuneration earned by the Executive Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the Directors are given in the bibliographic details on pages 37 and 38. The 
Committee considers that the external appointments of the Executive Directors have no detrimental impact on the 
performance of their duties. The Committee has approved that each Executive Director may retain his or her remuneration 
earned from external appointments up to £15,000 per year.
Contracts of service
The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors to have contracts of employment with notice periods of up to 12 months. 
The Company will not enter into service contracts of more than two years duration without obtaining prior shareholder 
approval. Contracts with notice periods in excess of 12 months will only be considered at the time of recruitment and would 
normally be structured so that the notice period reduces to a period up to 12 months over a specified time of service.

Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors who served during the year are set out below:
Executive Directors Date of agreement Date of expiry Notice period
Nigel Newton 24 June 2003 – 12 Months
Richard Charkin 10 October 2007 – 12 Months
Wendy Pallot 10 March 2011 – 12 Months
Termination of Executive Director appointments
The service agreements of Richard Charkin and Wendy Pallot include terms such that there would be no claim for loss 
of office as a Director resulting from termination of their service agreement. The agreement for Wendy Pallot includes 
that the Company may make a payment of basic salary in lieu of notice. There are no further specific provisions for 
compensation on early termination of service contracts for the Executive Directors including Nigel Newton and no 
automatic right to payments.
The payment of bonus and the vesting of LTIP awards on termination are subject to the discretion of the Committee. 
In the event of early termination, the Committee would seek to take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to the 
Company and to ensure that the Executive Director observed his or her duty to mitigate loss. The Committee considers the 
termination terms of the Executive Directors to be appropriate to avoid rewarding failure on termination.
non-executive Directors
The annual fees of Non-Executive Directors (‘NED’s) upon appointment are determined by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors. The annual fee of the Chairman upon appointment is determined by the other NEDs and the Executive 
Directors. NEDs receive a basic annual fee plus an extra annual amount for additional responsibilities such as chairing sub-
committees. The fees of the NEDs and chairman are reviewed against benchmark data provided by external remuneration 
consultants. Where NEDs and the Chairman receive an increase in annual fee this is normally limited to the budgeted 
annual increase in salaries for Bloomsbury employees.
No annual increase has been awarded to NED fees from 1 March 2013 in line with basic salary increases for senior 
employees across the Group. The fees for the NEDs are:

1. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the ‘Company’) is a Company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the 
Company’s registered office can be found on page 136. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and 
for the year ended 28 February 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The 
Group is primarily involved in the publication of books and other related services.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
a) Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations adopted by the European 
Union (‘EU’) at the time of preparing these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
b) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern 
basis.
c) Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position 
are set out in the Business Review on pages 4 to 36. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position 
are described in the Financial Review on pages 21 to 27. In addition, note 23 to the financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its 
financial instruments, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors believe that the Group’s diversification of product and geographical spread together with its monitoring 
and forecasting processes place the Group well in managing its business risks. The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading performance, indicate that the Group is able to operate within 
the level of its current available facilities including compliance with the bank facility covenants. Details of the bank facility 
and its covenants are shown in Note 23c).
After making enquiries of senior management and reviewing cash flow forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.
d) Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical judgments and areas 
where the use of estimates is significant are disclosed in note 2.v). 
e) Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were adopted by the Group for the year ended 28 February 2013 and have 
not had an impact on the Group financial statements:
✶ ✶Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’;
✶ ✶Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’;
✶ ✶Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption’.
Bloomsbury AR2013 BACK.indd   76 12/06/2013   10:45:31 22166.04       12 June 2013 7:18 AM        Proof 7

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On The Directors have considered the impact of new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments on 
the Group that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. They have not been adopted early by the Group and are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements:
✶ ✶Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Financial statement presentation’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012). 
The amendment requires the presentation of other comprehensive income items on the basis of whether they are 
potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss. 
✶ ✶Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). There 
are various amendments which, based on preliminary analyses, will not have a material impact on the Group financial 
statements. 
✶ ✶IFRS 10 ‘ Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 11 ‘ Joint Arrangements’, IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Involvement with 
Other Entities’, amendments to IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ and amendments to IAS 28 ‘Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures’ (issued as a package effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). 
The Group is currently assessing the impact that these standards will have on the financial position and performance 
but, based on preliminary analyses, no material impact is expected. 
✶ ✶IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). The standard 
establishes guidance for fair value measurements. The Group is currently assessing the impact that this standard will 
have on the financial position and performance but, based on preliminary analyses, no material impact is expected.
f) Basis of consolidation
I. Business combinations
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
 The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
✶ ✶the fair value of consideration transferred; plus
✶ ✶the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; less
✶ ✶the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 Where the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
  The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such 
amounts are generally recognised in the income statement.
  T ransaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with the business combination are expensed as incurred.
  Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Changes in contingent 
consideration arising from additional information, obtained within one year of the acquisition date, about facts or 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognised as an adjustment to goodwill. Other changes in 
contingent consideration are recognised through the income statement, unless the contingent consideration is 
classified as equity. In such circumstances, changes are recognised within equity.
  For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, the Group applies IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2004) in accounting for 
business combinations. All changes to contingent consideration in respect of these acquisitions are recognised as an 
adjustment to goodwill.

II. Subsidiaries
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
  Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies to obtain 
economic benefit for the Group. The financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
  Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with accounting policies adopted by the Group to ensure consistency.
  All subsidiaries except Bloomsbury Publishing India Private Limited have a reporting period end of 28 February. 
Bloomsbury Publishing India Private Limited has a reporting period end of 31 March, which aligns with the Indian 
government’s financial year.
III. Loss of control
  On the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests 
and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is 
recognised in the income statement.  
IV. Transactions eliminated on consolidation
  All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated 
on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of 
the asset transferred.
g) Revenue
Revenue represents the amount derived from the provision of goods, services and rights falling within the Group’s 
ordinary activities, after deduction of trade discounts, value added tax and anticipated returns. 
✶ – Revenue from book publishing is recognised when title passes. 
✶ – Revenue from the sale of publishing and distribution rights, including film, paperback, electronic, overseas publishing 
rights and sponsorship, is recognised on receipt of contractual documentation or receipt of funds, whichever occurs first.
✶ – Revenue from database contracts is recognised in accordance with the stages of completion of contractual services 
provided. The degree of completion is calculated as a proportion of the content generated against the contractually 
agreed milestone, for example number of words generated. Where the degree of completion of milestones cannot be 
reliably measured, revenue is only recognised in full on completion. 
✶ – Revenue from management services contracts is recognised at the contractually agreed rate. 
✶ – Revenue from e-book sales is recognised when content is delivered.
h) Foreign currencies
I. Functional and presentation currency 
  Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). These consolidated financial 
statements are presented in sterling (£) as this is the most representative currency of the Group’s operations. All 
financial information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise stated.
II. Transactions and balances
  T ransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded in the functional currency at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at closing rates of exchange at the date of the statement of financial position. 
  Exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement within administrative expenses.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On III. Group companies
  The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
✶ – Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date 
of that statement of financial position;
✶ – Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates; and
✶ – All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation 
reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign entity these exchange differences are recycled to the income statement.
  Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.
i) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
I. Current tax
  The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
II. Deferred tax
  Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised 
for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. 
  Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be generated 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
  Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
III. Current and deferred tax for the year
  Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or 
charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or equity respectively.

j) Goodwill and other intangible assets
I. Goodwill
  Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business 
(see note 2f) I) less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
  For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of 
cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
  A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is 
less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the 
unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement. An 
impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. 
  On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal.
II. Other intangible assets
  Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
  Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over their expected 
useful lives by equal annual instalments at the following rates:
Publishing relationships – 5% to 20% per annum
Imprints – 3% to 5% per annum
Subscriber and customer relationships – 6% to 17% per annum
Product and systems development – 20% per annum
 
  Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted prospectively 
if appropriate.
  The separately acquired trademark for the name Bloomsbury Publishing Plc in the US is shown at historical cost and is 
subject to annual impairment reviews. The trademark is deemed to have an indefinite life due to the underlying 
stability of the industry in which it operates.
III. Product and systems development
  Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of systems, such as software products, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Likewise costs incurred in developing a product, typically an online platform, are 
recognised as intangible assets.
  Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially feasible, 
future economic benefits are probable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development and use  
the asset.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated in order to write down their cost less residual value using the straight-line 
method over their expected useful lives at the following rates:
Short leasehold improvements – over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and fittings – 10% per annum
Computer and other office equipment – 20% per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
 
Depreciation is pro-rated in the years of acquisition and disposal of an asset. The estimated useful lives, residual value and 
depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income 
statement.
I) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At the end of each reporting period the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
m) Inventories
Inventories include paper, sheets and bound stock. The cost of work in progress and finished goods represents the 
amounts invoiced to the Group for origination, paper, printing and binding. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
n) Royalty advances to authors
Advances to authors are included within prepayments and accrued income and are written off to the extent that they are 
not covered by anticipated future sales or firm contracts for subsidiary rights receivable.
o) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be 
estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. When 
a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present 
value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).

p) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group has become a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as below:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the contractual arrangement. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and changes to debtor payment patterns are considered indicators that the 
trade receivable may be impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group, repayable 
on demand.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
q) Operating leases
Operating leases are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the related asset are not 
transferred to the Group. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement as they fall due. Stamp duty is 
capitalised in leasehold improvements and depreciated over the life of the lease.
r) Employee benefits
I. Defined contribution plans
  P ension costs relating to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period 
for which related services are rendered by the employee. 
II. Defined benefit plans
  Until 1997 a subsidiary company operated a defined benefit pension scheme. The liability in respect of the defined 
benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligations, calculated using the projected unit credit 
method at each statement of financial position date by the scheme actuary, less the fair value of the scheme’s assets.
  The current service cost, interest on scheme liabilities and all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the  
income statement.
III. Termination benefits
  T ermination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic 
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan either to terminate employment before the normal retirement date, 
or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On IV. Share-based payment transactions
  The Group issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date 
of equity-settled share-based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.  
  Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes, sharesave scheme and share appreciation rights scheme 
are equity settled. The fair values of such options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model or a modified 
version of the same, based on publicly available market data. 
  Awards granted under the Group’s performance share plan are equity settled. Half of any award granted under the 
plan is subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is 
calculated using the Stochastic model. The other half of any award granted under the plan is subject to an Earnings Per 
Share performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
s) Employee benefit trust
The Company operates an employee benefit trust and has de facto control of shares held by the trust and bears their 
benefits and risks. The Group records the assets and liabilities of the trust as its own and shares held by the trust are recorded 
at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Finance costs and administrative expenses are charged as they accrue.
t) Segmental reporting
Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’), regarded as the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The CEO views the Group primarily from a nature of business basis, reflecting the divisional performance of Adult, Children’s 
& Educational, Academic & Professional and Information.  Segment results that are reported to the CEO include items 
directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Performance is evaluated 
based on operating profit contributions using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Group’s financial statements.
u) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as liabilities once they are appropriately authorised.
v) Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
reasonable expectations of future events. The resultant estimates will, by definition, not necessarily equal the related actual 
results and may require adjustment in subsequent accounting periods. The estimates and assumptions that may cause a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are:
Book returns
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which is 
then carried forward and offset against trade receivables in the statement of financial position in anticipation of book 
returns received subsequent to the reporting period end. The provision is calculated by reference to historical returns 
rates and expected future returns.
Author advances
A provision is made by the Group against advances on published titles which may not be covered by anticipated future title sales 
or subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all published titles advances. If it is 
unlikely that royalties from future title sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down the advance, a provision is made in the income 
statement for the difference between the carrying value and the anticipated recoverable amount from future earnings.
Inventory
At the end of each reporting period a review is carried out on all published titles where inventory is held. A provision is 
made by the Group against unsold inventory on a title by title basis, with regard to historical net sales and expected future 
net sales, to value the inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Impairment reviews
IFRS requires management to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite life assets and, for finite life assets, to 
test for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable. The Group currently undertakes an annual impairment test covering goodwill and other indefinite life assets 
and also reviews finite life assets to consider whether a full impairment review is required. 
Intangible assets recoverability is an area involving management judgment, requiring assessment as to whether the 
carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash 
flow projections which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash 
flows, certain assumptions are required to be made. Note 12 details the assumptions used.
3. Segmental analysis
The Group is comprised of four worldwide publishing divisions: Adult, Children’s & Educational, Academic & Professional 
and Information. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information. Segments derive 
their revenue from book publishing, sale of publishing and distribution rights, management and other publishing services.
The analysis by segment for continuing operations is shown below:

b) Factors affecting tax charge for the year
The tax on the Group’s profit before tax differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom of 24.17% 
(2012: 26.17%). The reasons for this are explained below:

Tax charge for the year 2,029 20.60 1,367 16.15
 
c) Factors affecting tax charge for future years
The UK current tax rate will be reduced from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013, in line with previously substantively 
enacted legislation. The rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities has also been reduced to 23%, creating a rate 
adjustment, which is partly reflected in the consolidated income statement and partly in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
A proposed reduction to 21% at 1 April 2014 and 20% at 1 April 2015 has not yet been substantively enacted. If these 
reductions had been enacted by 28 February 2013 the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax liability as 
at 28 February 2013 from £1,363,000 to £1,066,000. Of this reduction it is estimated that £302,000 would be credited to the 
consolidated income statement and £5,000 charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

9. Acquisitions
Fairchild Books
On 30 March 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Fairchild Books from Fairchild Fashion Media, a unit of 
Advance Magazine Publishers Inc, for a cash consideration of £3,823,000 ($6,117,000). This is net of a working capital 
adjustment of £239,000 ($383,000) as the closing working capital was less than the target closing working capital 
anticipated at the point of acquisition. The consideration is being paid in cash in three equal annual instalments, 
commencing at the acquisition date. The acquisition of Fairchild Books makes the Group a market-leading publisher of 
textbooks and educational resources for students of fashion, merchandising, retailing and interior design. 
 
The table below summarises the fair values to the Group included in the consolidated financial statements of the major 
categories of assets and liabilities of Fairchild Books at the date of acquisition.

Inventories 2,738
Trade and other receivables 359
Payables and provisions (252)
Total net assets acquired 4,033
Gain on bargain purchase (210)
Cash consideration 3,823
Identifiable intangible assets of £1,188,000 consist of publishing rights of £940,000 and customer relationships of £248,000. The 
publishing rights have a useful life of 15 years and customer relationships 9 years. A gain of £210,000 as a result of a bargain 
purchase has been recognised within highlighted items in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. The 
transaction resulted in a gain mainly because of the significant adjustment on alignment of the returns policy. 
The gross contractual trade receivable at acquisition is £778,000 of which £203,000 is the best estimate of the contractual 
cash flows that are not expected to be collected.
Transaction costs of £49,000 have been expensed in the year within administrative expenses. 
From 30 March 2012 revenue of £5,177,000 and profit attributable to owners of the Company of £1,876,000 have been 
included in the consolidated income statement in relation to Fairchild Books.
The value of the identifiable net assets of Fairchild Books disclosed in the 31 August 2012 Interim Report had been 
determined on a provisional basis. They differ from the values reported above due to the finalisation of fair value and 
accounting policy assessments. Had the valuation been finalised at 31 August 2012 the interim financial statements would 
have differed to those reported as follows:
✶ – inventories would have been £41,000 lower;
✶ – trade receivables would have been £359,000 higher;
✶ – payables and provisions would have been £172,000 lower;
✶ – goodwill would have reduced by £280,000;
✶ – the recognition of the bargain purchase would have increased profit before tax by £210,000; and
✶ – there would have been no impact on the current tax charge or deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Bloomsbury Publishing Plc guaranteed the payment of this amount on behalf of its subsidiary.
Applied Visual Arts
On 29 June 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Applied Visual Arts Publishing (‘AVA’) from Applied Visual Arts 
Publishing SA and AVA Publishing (UK) Limited for £1,755,000 (CHF 2,579,000). The consideration is being paid in three 
equal annual instalments from the date of acquisition. The acquisition of AVA enhances Bloomsbury’s Academic & 
Professional division. AVA is a publisher of textbooks and educational resources for students and professionals in the 
applied visual arts and has a strong following in the design community.

Transaction costs of £27,000 have been expensed in the year within administrative expenses. 
From 29 June 2012 revenue of £824,000 and loss attributable to owners of the Company of £53,000 have been included in

10. Discontinued operation
On 28 February 2012 the Group contracted to sell its German subsidiary Bloomsbury Verlag GmbH to Pendo 
Betilligungsgesellschaft mbH, a subsidiary of Bonnier AB, for a cash consideration of ¤2,600,000 (£2,158,000). The disposal 
was subject to the approval of the German competition authorities which was granted in March 2012. The risks and rewards 
of ownership passed to Bonnier AB as at 28 February 2012 and, given that the chances of not receiving approval were 
considered to be remote, the sale was treated in the prior year financial statements as completing on 28 February 2012. 
The expenses in the year ended 28 February 2013 relate to an on-going tax enquiry with HMRC.

Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is subject to annual impairment reviews. Any impairment losses are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Impairment testing
The recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill has been considered with regard to value in use calculations. These 
calculations use the pre-tax future cash flow projections of each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) based on the Board’s 
approved budgets for the year ended 28 February 2014 and the Board approved five-year plan. The calculations include 
a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of the five-year plan with a long term growth rate assumption 
applied.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following CGUs:

The remaining goodwill balance of £7,081,000 (2012: £6,557,000) is allocated across multiple CGUs with no individual CGU 
exceeding 10% of the Group’s goodwill balance.  Each CGU represents a separate business operation acquired.

Other US business units 9.7–10.4 10.1–10.6 0.8–7.9 4.0 2.4 2.0
 
Discount rates
The discount rates applied to the cash flows are calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of 
capital for the Group. This is adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates. The Group has considered 
the impact of the current economic climate in determining appropriate discount rates. 
Growth rates
Growth rates have been calculated on those applied to the Board approved budget for the year ended 28 February 2014 
and five-year plan. They incorporate future expectations of growth in backlist revenues and identified new revenue streams. 
Long-term growth rates
The five-year forecasts are extrapolated to perpetuity on the basis that the relevant CGUs are long established business 
units and the useful lives of these CGUs were assessed at acquisition as twenty years or greater.
Gross margin
Gross margins have been based on historic performance and expected changes to the sales mix in future periods. 
Sensitivity
The Group has not identified any reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of 
goodwill of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

15. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
a) Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the 
asset or liability arises and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.

Due to changes in the statutory tax rate in the UK, deferred tax is provided at 23% (2012: 25%) which is the rate that has 
been substantively enacted to apply from 1 April 2013. The impact of the change in tax rate is a credit of £105,000  
(2012: £92,000), of which £110,000 (2012: £96,000) has been recognised in the deferred tax charge in the income statement 
and the remainder recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets in respect of losses are only recognised to the extent that it is anticipated they will be utilised in the 
foreseeable future.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On c) Unrecognised deferred tax assets
The Group had deferred tax assets not recognised in the financial statements as follows:
28 February
2013
£’000
29 February
2012
£’000
Unused tax losses 994 1,677
Non-trading losses 541 600
Total 1,535 2,277
 
These deferred tax assets are recoverable against available taxable profits of the same type or from the same trades in 
future years. They have not been recognised in the financial statements as it is not sufficiently certain that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the losses.
The gross tax losses on which no deferred asset has been recognised were £4,320,000 (2012: £6,708,000). This relates to tax 
losses for certain subsidiaries in the UK. These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At 28 February 2013 the Group had non-trading losses of approximately £2,352,000 (2012: 2,400,000). A deferred tax asset 
has not been recognised in respect of non-trading losses carried forward as it is not clear whether sufficient non-trading 
income against which the losses may be offset will arise in the Group in the foreseeable future. 
 
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the Group controls the timing of remittance and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

12 months.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values. The Group’s 
exposure to credit and currency risks is disclosed in note 23. Trade receivables principally comprise amounts receivable 
from the sale of books due from distributors. The average number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the Group was 
100 days (2012: 102 days). 
The majority of trade debtors are secured by credit insurance, overseas third party distributors and letters of credit on the 
main UK third part distributor.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made with reference to specific debts, past default experience, trading 
history and the current economic environment. Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables

arrangement is based on average revenues for the Berg Fashion element of the business and is payable based on results for the 
years ended 28 February 2015 and 29 February 2016. The maximum potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that 
the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is £1,000,000, of which £377,000 has 
been recognised at 28 February 2013.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust
The Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) is an independent discretionary trust established to acquire issued shares of the 
Company to satisfy any of the share-based incentive schemes (see note 21) and plans of the Company. All employees of the 
Group are potential beneficiaries of the EBT. The results and net assets of the EBT are included in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group. 
During the year to 28 February 2013 299,982 shares held by the EBT were used to satisfy share option exercises under the 
Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan (see note 21). 35,315 EBT shares were used to satisfy the dividends due on the vested 
shares exercised. 
The market value of the 1,265,313 shares of the Company held at 28 February 2013 (2012: 1,600,610) in the EBT was 
£1,316,000 (2012: £1,948,000). Whilst the trustee has power to subscribe for Ordinary shares and to acquire Ordinary shares 
in the market or from Treasury, it is not permitted to hold more than five per cent of the issued share capital without prior 
approval of the shareholders.
As at the date of signing this Annual Report, the Trust held 953,343 Ordinary shares of 1.25 pence being approximately 1.3% 
of the issued Ordinary share capital. 
Retained earnings
The retained earnings reserve comprises profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company and other items 
recognised directly through equity as presented on the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
21. Share-based payments
Options over shares of the ultimate parent undertaking, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, have been granted to employees of 
the Group under various schemes. 
The total share-based payment charge to the income statement for the year was as follows:
Year ended
28 February
2013

Year  ended

2012

Equity settled share-based transactions 547 255
Cash settled share-based transactions 68 –
Total 615 255
 
In the prior year £31,000 of the total charge related to the discontinued operation Bloomsbury Verlag GmbH. 
National Insurance contributions are payable by the Company in respect of some of the share-based payment 
transactions. These contributions are payable on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based 
payments and are therefore treated as cash settled awards. The Group had an accrual for National Insurance at 28 
February 2013 of £68,000 (2012: nil), of which none related to vested options. 
a) The 1994 Approved Executive Share Option Schemes (‘ Approved 1994 ESOS’)
All Approved 1994 ESOS options outstanding at 28 February 2013 and 29 February 2012 have vested. No options have been 
granted under the scheme since 2004. 
Grants under the Approved 1994 ESOS were made on an annual basis to selected employees, with the exercise price of 
options being not less than the higher of the nominal value of an Ordinary share and the average middle market 
quotation of an Ordinary share for the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer of options under the Scheme. If 
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of the grant or if (except in certain circumstances) the 
employee leaves the Group, the options lapse.

b) The Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan 2005 (‘the PSP’)
The Group operates the PSP for Directors and senior employees. Awards under the scheme are granted as a nil-priced 
option. The number of Ordinary shares comprised in an award is calculated using a share value equal to either the average 
middle-market price of the Ordinary share for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or the middle-
market price on the dealing day before the award date. 
The vesting period is three years and the level of vesting is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) and 
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance conditions. For details of the performance conditions see the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 68. Awards are not exercisable after the vesting date and awards that vest on the 
vesting date are automatically exercised. Except in certain circumstances awards lapse if the employee leaves the Group.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On The share awards granted in the year to 28 February 2013 have been measured by New Bridge Street Consultants. The TSR 
element has been measured using the stochastic model and the EPS element has been measured using the Black–Scholes 
model. The inputs were:
Performance condition Earnings Per Share Total Shareholder Return
Share price 115.5 pence 115.5 pence
Exercise price – –
Expected term 3 years 3 years
Expected volatility – 26.0%
Risk free interest rate – 0.35%
Fair value charge per award 115.5 pence 58.26 pence
The expected volatility was based on Bloomsbury’s share price volatility over the period prior to grant equal in length to 
the expected three year performance period. Half of each award is subject to an EPS performance condition (which is not 
factored into the valuation). Half of each award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return condition whereby performance is 
compared to the FTSE Mid 250 companies (excluding Investment Trusts) over a three year period from the date of grant. A 
median ranking results in 30% of shares subject to this performance condition vesting, rising to 100% for an upper quartile 
ranking. The discount for this TSR condition is calculated at the date of grant using the stochastic model.
c) Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005
The Group operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings related share option scheme under which employees 
are granted options to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company in three, five or seven years’ time, dependent upon 
their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions to a savings account over the period of the savings term. The 
Sharesave Plan is open to all UK employees.

SAR Scheme awards provide participants the right to buy a number of Company shares at their nominal value. The awards 
have an exercise price which is set at the time of granting the awards. The number of shares that can be acquired is equal 
to the excess of the market price of the Company’s shares at the date of exercise over the exercise price for the award. SAR 
awards are exercisable for four years after the vesting date subject to satisfying an Earnings per Share condition at the date 
of exercise.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On Defined benefit plan
A subsidiary company operates a defined benefit scheme for some staff which is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. 
Accrual of benefits ceased in 1997, with the scheme now operated as a closed fund. There is no obligation in respect of 
medical costs. The scheme is actuarially valued every three years. The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at  
29 February 2012 and updated to 28 February 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
Contributions are paid by the employer at the rate of £1,600 per month, plus expenses as and when required. 
Contributions paid to the scheme during the year were £19,200 (2012: £19,200). The Directors’ best estimate of the 
contribution to be paid for in the year ending 28 February 2014 is £20,700. 
The Group’s policy is to fund the deficit in the scheme by additional contributions to meet the scheme’s commitment to 
members.
The financial assumptions used by the actuary for the update were as follows::

 * The expected return on plan assets has been determined by reference to the scheme’s current investment strategy.
The scheme is closed and there are no active paying members, therefore no increases in payments have been applied. The 
assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale 
covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
Mortality rate assumptions follow the PnxA00 table with long cohort improvements subject to a minimum 1.0% per annum 
improvement. The mortality assumptions adopted at the end of the reporting period imply the following remaining life 
expectancies at age 65:

Financial risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets 
and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from the key risks of market risk 
(including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Board has approved the Group Treasury policies and procedures by which the Group Treasury function is to be 
managed, headed by the Group Finance Director and part of Bloomsbury’s Finance Department, it operates under a 
delegated authority from the Board. 
The treasury management policies and procedures focus on the investment of surplus operating cash likely to be needed 
in order to support Bloomsbury’s on-going operations, foreign currency requirements and interest rate risk management. 
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The policies are reviewed at least on an annual basis 
by the Group Finance Director and any amendments are approved by the Board. The Board is assisted in its oversight role 
by Internal Audit, who undertakes regular reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are 
reported to the Audit Committee.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in 
interest rates. The Group incurs costs in the same currencies as it earns revenue creating some degree of natural hedging. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by Group 
Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets so as 
to control exposure to the relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as 
funding, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity.
(i)  Interest rate risk
The Group has significant interest bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and as such cash flows are 
dependent on changes in market interest rates. 
The Group maintains a low risk stance to investing surplus cash balances and does not allow speculative trading or 
investment and invests surplus funds only in investments that meet certain criteria which include the following:
✶ ✶ Invest utilising permitted instruments as authorised by the Board
✶ ✶ Are held at a permitted institution
✶ ✶ Have a defined maximum maturity date which is no longer than twelve months unless a UK Government bond
✶ ✶ Are denominated in sterling, euro, US dollars, AUS dollars or Indian rupees
✶ ✶ Pay interest at a fixed, floating or discount rate

£’000
Variable rate financial assets 14,078 12,639
Fixed rate financial assets 547 –
Total 14,625 12,639
Fixed rate financial assets are short-term bank deposits with a maturity date range of one day to one month. 
Variable rate financial assets are cash at bank. The average rate of interest during the year was 0.3% (2012: 0.9%). The 
Group had no interest-bearing financial liabilities at 28 February 2013 or 29 February 2012.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate financial assets
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore a change in 
interest rates at 28 February 2013 would not affect the income statement.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The Group derived the following sensitivities to assess the impact of changes in interest rates, based on the effect of the 
market volatility in the current climate and the previous 12 months. The analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.

(ii)  Currency risk
The Company believes in its current circumstances that the Group’s risk from foreign currency exposure is limited and no 
active currency risk management by hedging is considered necessary, as a significant proportion of revenues are matched 
by expenditure in the same local currency creating some degree of natural hedging.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts:

No significant amounts of loans and receivables or financial liabilities are denominated in currencies other than sterling, US

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group derived the following sensitivities based on the outstanding foreign currency denominated financial assets and 
liabilities at the year end. The sensitivity analysis includes loans to foreign operations within the Group where the 
denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or the borrower. 
The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates 
between the current and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change 
in foreign exchange rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity.

The Group’s sensitivity has decreased in the current year due to the disposal of Bloomsbury Verlag GmbH in the prior year 
(functional currency Euro).
b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s trade and rights income receivables. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The amounts presented in the statement 
of financial position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on 
trading experience and the current economic environment. An analysis of the relevant provisions is set out in note 17.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings as assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies.
The Group determines its concentration of credit risk based on the individual characteristics of its customers and publicly 
available knowledge of specific circumstances affecting those customers. The Group defines counterparties as having 
similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the  
final customers are set by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. 
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong 
to established international groups whose business includes a number of publishing interests and clients. The Group’s  
risk is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are secured by credit insurance and letters  
of credit.

c) Liquidity risk
The Directors do not consider that the Group currently has an exposure to liquidity risk, as the Group has no borrowing 
and has sufficient cash deposits to meet its debts as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow budgets and forecasts are prepared by the operating entities of the Group, aggregated for the Group and 
regularly reviewed by the Board, and the actual cash position of the Group and each entity is compared monthly against 
budget. This allows management to ensure that each operating entity and the Group have sufficient cash to meet 
operational needs. Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balance required for working capital 
management is invested in interest bearing accounts and money market deposits. 
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds TSB Bank Plc. At 28 February 2013 the Group had at its disposal 
£12 million of undrawn borrowing facilities (2012: £12 million) comprised of a £10 million committed revolving loan facility 
and a £2 million overdraft. The overdraft facility is available until November 2013 and the loan facility matures in July 2016. The 
facility is subject to two covenants being a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest cover covenant. 
The Group’s financial liabilities are trade payables, accruals and other payables as shown above. Apart from the identified 
other payables due after one year, all other financial liabilities are due within one year.
24. Operating leases
At 28 February 2013 the Group had the following outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases:

Later than one year and less than five years 4,740 2,905
After more than five years 6,144 2,274
Total 12,129 6,344
The operating leases represent rentals payable by the Group for certain office properties, vehicles and equipment. The 
lease terms over properties are for an average of eleven years. The lease at the headquarters in Bedford Square is for a 
period of twenty years with an option to break the lease at the tenth year. The operating leases over vehicles are in respect 
of company cars driven by certain employees. The lease terms are for an average of three years. The operating leases over 
equipment are in respect of office equipment. The lease terms are for an average of three years.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On 28. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s 
registered office can be found on page 136. The Company is primarily involved in the publication of books and other 
related services.
29. Significant accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations adopted by the European Union 
(‘EU’) at the time of preparing these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Company accounting policies are consistent with the Group policies set out in note 2 of the consolidated financial 
statements. Key additional policies are stated below. 
b) Parent company result
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to 
present the Company income statement or statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s profit for the year was 
£1,293,000 (2012: £3,981,000). 
c) Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the Company financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and in any future years affected. Critical judgments and areas where 
the use of estimates is significant are disclosed in note 2 v) for the Group and are applicable for the Company.
d) Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were adopted by the Company for the year ended 28 February 2013 and 
have not had an impact on the Company financial statements:
✶ ✶Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’; 
✶ ✶Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’; 
✶ ✶Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption’.
The Directors have considered the impact of new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments on 
the Company that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. They have not been adopted early by the Company and 
are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements:
✶ ✶Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Financial statement presentation’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012). 
The amendment requires the presentation of other comprehensive income items on the basis of whether they are 
potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss. 
✶ ✶Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013).  
There are various amendments which, based on preliminary analyses, will not have an impact on the Company  
financial statements.

✶ ✶IFRS 10 ‘ Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 11 ‘ Joint Arrangements’, IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Involvement with 
Other Entities’, amendments to IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ and amendments to IAS 28 ‘Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures’ (issued as a package effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). 
The Company is currently assessing the impact that these standards will have on the financial position and performance 
but, based on preliminary analyses, no material impact is expected. 
✶ ✶IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). The standard 
establishes guidance for fair value measurements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will 
have on the financial position and performance but, based on preliminary analyses, no material impact is expected.
e) Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less accumulated impairment in the statement of financial position. 
Investments are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there are any indicators of impairment. Any 
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the year they occur.
f) Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees of the Group. Equity-settled 
share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of equity-settled share-based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.  
Options granted under the Company’s share option schemes, sharesave scheme and share appreciation rights scheme 
are equity settled. The fair values of such options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model or a modified 
version of the same, based on publicly available market data. 
Awards granted under the Company’s performance share plan are equity settled. Half of any award granted under the 
plan is subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is 
calculated using the stochastic model. Half of any award granted under the plan is subject to an Earnings Per Share 
performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
The Company recharges a share of the share-based payment charge to subsidiaries. This recharge is made via 
intercompany transactions.

Due to changes in the statutory tax rate in the UK, deferred tax is provided at 23% (2012: 25%) which is the rate that has 
been substantively enacted to apply from 1 April 2013. The impact of the change in tax rate is a charge of £13,000 (2012: 
£14,000), of which £8,000 (2012: £17,000) has been recognised in the deferred tax charge in the income statement and the 
remainder recognised in other comprehensive income.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany inf Ormati On Non-current amounts owed by group undertakings represent loan balances due from subsidiary companies. These loans 
are technically repayable on demand, however there is no intention to demand repayment of the loans within the next 
twelve months. As at 28 February 2013, £2,328,000 (2012: £2,511,000) of prepayments and accrued income are expected to 
be recovered after more than 12 months.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values. The 
Company’s exposure to credit and currency risks is disclosed in note 39. Trade receivables principally comprise amounts 
receivable from the sale of books due from distributors. The average number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the 
Company was 204 days (2012:167 days). All UK trade debtors are being recorded in one sales ledger in the Company.

The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates 
between the current and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change 
in foreign exchange rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity.

b) Credit risk 
The Company has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final 
customers are set by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit 
limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to 
established international groups whose business includes a number of publishing interests and clients. The Company’s 
risk is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are secured by credit insurance and letters of 
credit. 
c) Liquidity risk
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds TSB Bank Plc. At 28 February 2013 the Group had at its disposal 
£12 million of undrawn borrowing facilities (2012: £12 million) comprised of a £10m committed revolving loan facility and a  
£2 million overdraft. The overdraft facility is available until November 2013 and the loan facility matures in July 2016. The 
facility is subject to two covenants being a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest cover covenant.

This document is important and requires your immediate attention.
1. If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take, you are recommended to seek your own financial advice 
immediately from your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant, fund manager or other appropriate 
independent financial adviser authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
2. If you sell or have sold or otherwise transferred all of your shares, you should send this document together with the

Dear Shareholder
The 2013 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Company”) is to be held at 50 Bedford 
Square, London WC1B 3DP on Tuesday 23 July 2013 at 12 noon. The formal notice convening the AGM is set out on pages 
pages 140 to 143 below.
Information regarding the AGM, including the information required by section 311A of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
“Act”), is available from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
The AGM is an important opportunity for the Directors to listen to the Shareholders and respond to their questions. It is also 
when Shareholders are asked to vote in favour of various resolutions related to the running and management of the 
Company. Therefore below are explanatory notes relating to the resolutions that you will be asked to consider and vote on 
at the AGM. Resolutions 1 to 7 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and resolutions 8 to 10 will be proposed as special 
resolutions.
As at 12 noon on the date of this notice, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 73,844,724 Ordinary Shares of 1.25 
pence each (subject to any changes which will be notified to you at the beginning of the AGM). Each Ordinary Share 
carries the right to one vote at a General Meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the 
Company as at 12 noon on the date of this notice is 73,844,724.
As a shareholder, you are entitled to attend and vote but, if you are not able to attend, then you may appoint one or more 
proxies to attend, speak and vote on your behalf.
As your vote is important to us, whether or not you intend to come to the AGM, you are asked to return the form of proxy 
enclosed with this document. Completing the form of proxy will not prohibit Shareholders from attending, and voting at, 
the AGM in person.
The Ordinary Business to be proposed at the 2013 Annual General Meeting
Resolutions 1 to 3 (ordinary resolutions): The audited report and accounts of the Company for the year ended  
28 February 2013 are recommended by the Board to be received by Shareholders. 
 
A final dividend of 4.56 pence per Ordinary Share for the year ended 28 February 2013 is recommended by the Board to 
the Shareholders for approval.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, which includes details of the remuneration earned by, and paid to, the Directors in 
respect of the year ended 28 February 2013, is also recommended to the Shareholders for approval.

Resolutions 4 and 5 (ordinary resolutions): In accordance with article 78.1 of the Articles of Association of the Company, 
one-third of the Directors who are subject to retirement by rotation are required to retire at the AGM.  Wendy Pallot (who 
was last re-appointed as a Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2011) and Jeremy Wilson (who 
was last re-appointed as a Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2011) will retire at the AGM and, 
being eligible, offer themselves for re-appointment. The Board has considered the appraisal of the performance of each 
Director falling due to retire by rotation and recommends the reappointment of Wendy Pallot and Jeremy Wilson.
Resolutions 6 (ordinary resolution): The Board recommends that the incumbent External Auditor, Baker Tilly UK Audit 
LLP, is re-appointed for a further year so that they are able to audit the Company’s report and accounts for the year ending 
28 February 2014 and the Board proposes that it be authorised to determine the level of the auditors’ remuneration.
The Shareholders first approved the re-appointment of Baker Tilly as the External Auditor at the Annual General Meeting 
held 27 June 2002.  In view of the long standing nature of the appointment, the Audit Committee anticipates tendering the 
External Audit following the Annual General Meeting.
The Special Business to be proposed at the 2013 Annual General Meeting
Resolution 7 – authority to allot Ordinary Shares (ordinary resolution): This replaces the general authority, last  
given at the Company’s Annual General Meeting held on 23 July 2012, for the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares. This 
resolution, if passed, would give the Directors the authority to allot up to 24,614,880 Ordinary Shares of 1.25 pence with a 
nominal value of £307,686, representing approximately 33.33% of the issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company at the 
date of this notice.
This authority, if granted, will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting and 15 
months from the date of passing this resolution. The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority granted by 
this resolution and intends to seek its renewal at subsequent Annual General Meetings of the Company.
As at the date of signing the Directors Report for the 2013 Annual Report, the Directors have beneficial holdings of Ordinary 
Shares in the Company which in aggregate amount to approximately 2.2% of the Ordinary Shares in issue. The Directors 
have been granted conditional share awards under the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Performance Share Plan 2005 and 
options granted under the Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005 that if they were to fully vest would entitle the Directors to 
further Ordinary Shares which in aggregate would amount to approximately 2.4% of the Ordinary Shares in issue.
Resolution 8 – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption provisions (special resolution): This resolution, which will be 
proposed as a special resolution, authorises the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares for cash without first offering them, pro 
rata, to existing shareholders.
The maximum nominal value of new Ordinary Shares which may be so allotted under this authority is £46,152 or 3,692,160 
shares of 1.25 pence being equivalent to approximately 5% of the entire issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company 
at date of this notice. This authority would expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General 
Meeting and 15 months from the date of passing this resolution.
Resolution 9 – Authority for the Company to purchase Ordinary Shares (special resolution): With the authority of 
Shareholders in general meeting, the Company is empowered by the Articles of Association to purchase Ordinary Shares 
subject to the provisions of the Act. The Directors believe it is prudent to seek general authority from Shareholders to be 
able to act if circumstances arise in which they consider such purchases to be desirable. The Directors have no current 
intention to exercise the authority granted by this resolution and it will only be exercised if and when, in the light of market 
conditions prevailing at that time, the Directors believe that such purchases would increase earnings per share and would 
be for the benefit of shareholders generally.
This resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, authorises the Company to purchase its own Ordinary Shares 
and either, depending on the circumstances at the time and subject to the provisions of the Act, to hold these as treasury 
shares or to cancel them. This authority would, if granted, expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next 
Annual General Meeting and 15 months from the date of passing this resolution.

Overview Business r eview GOvernance Financial s Ta Temen Ts Company information The Company would be authorised to make market purchases of up to 7,384,472 Ordinary Shares of 1.25 pence with a 
nominal value of £923,059, being equivalent to approximately 10% of the issued Ordinary Share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) of the Company at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) shall be not more 
than 5% above the average market value of the Company’s equity shares for the 5 business days prior to the day the 
purchase is made. The minimum price (exclusive of expenses) that may be paid shall be the nominal value of an Ordinary 
Share (1.25 pence).
Resolution 10 – Approval that a General Meeting may be called on not less than 14 clear days notice (special 
resolution): In terms of the Act, the notice period for general meetings (other than an AGM) is 21 clear days’ notice unless 
the Company (i) has gained shareholder approval for the holding of general meetings on 14 clear days’ notice by passing 
a special resolution at the most recent AGM; and (ii) offers the facility for all shareholders to vote by electronic means. The 
Company would like to preserve its ability to call general meetings (other than an AGM) on less than 21 clear days’ notice. 
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine, but only where the flexibility is merited by the business 
of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. Resolution 10 seeks such approval. Should 
this resolution be approved it will be valid until the end of the next AGM. This is the same authority that was sought and 
granted at last year’s AGM.
Action to be taken
As outlined above, information regarding the AGM is available from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk
Enclosed with this Notice, you will find a reply-paid form of proxy for use at the AGM. Whether or not you are able to attend 
the AGM, you are advised to complete and return the form of proxy in accordance with the instructions printed on it.
If you wish to attend the AGM in person then the proxy appointment will not preclude you from doing so.
The form of proxy should be completed and returned as soon as possible to Capita Registrars, Proxy Department, PO Box 
25, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4BR and, in any event, so as to reach such address no later than 48 hours before the appointed 
commencement time of the AGM (for which a prepaid business reply service has been provided). You may also deliver it  
by hand to Capita Registrars at The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU during usual business hours, 
by such time.
Recommendations
The Board considers that the passing of Resolutions 1 to 10 is in the best interests of the Company and of the Shareholders 
as a whole, and are most likely to promote the success of the Company. The Board unanimously recommends that you 
vote in favour of all the resolutions, as each of the Directors intends to do in respect of his or her own beneficial holdings of 
shares in the Company.
Yours faithfully
Michael Daykin
Company Secretary

Notes:
1. Only the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend the meeting and vote. A member entitled to attend and 
vote may appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote on his behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the 
Company. A form of proxy is enclosed for your use. Further copies of the form of proxy may be obtained from the 
registered office of the Company or from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
2. If a member wishes his proxy to speak on his behalf at the meeting, he or she will need to appoint his own choice of 
proxy (who is not the Chairman) and give instructions directly to the proxy. The completion and return of a form of 
proxy will enable a shareholder to vote at the Annual General Meeting without having to be present at the Annual 
General Meeting, but will not preclude him or her from attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if 
he or she should subsequently decide to do so.
3. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to 
different shares. A member may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To 
appoint more than one proxy, please sign and date the form of proxy and attach a schedule listing the names and 
addresses (in block letters) of all your proxies, the number of shares in respect of which each proxy is appointed 
(which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you) and indicating how you wish each proxy 
to vote or abstain from voting. If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, insert “Chairman 
of the Meeting” in the box which is used to identify the name of the proxy on the relevant proxy card.
4. To be valid, the enclosed form of proxy must be lodged with the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, not later 
than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the Annual General Meeting.
5. Shareholders included on the register of members (in relation to ordinary shares held in CREST, pursuant to 
Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) at 6 pm on 21 July 2013 will be entitled to attend and 
vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. 
Changes to the register of members after that time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend or vote at the meeting.
6. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to 
enjoy information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder 
by whom he/she was nominated (“Relevant Member”), have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else 
appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment 
right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she, under any such agreement, may have a right to give instructions to the 
Relevant Member as to the exercise of voting rights.  Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in the 
Company remains the Relevant Member (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and you should continue to contact 
them (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest 
in the Company (including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly 
requests a response from you.
7. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in this regard can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
8. Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by shareholders of the Company under 
section 527 to 531 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company may be required to publish on a website a statement 
setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the 
conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with 
an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports 
were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the shareholders 
requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Companies Act 
2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement 
available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement 
that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.

all its powers as a member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers over the same 
share.
10. In the case of joint registered holders, the signature of one holder will be accepted and the vote of the senior who 
tenders a vote, whether in person or proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. 
For this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand on the register of members in 
respect of the relevant joint holding.
11. Copies of the following documents will be available for inspection at the Company’s Registered Office, 50 Bedford 
Square, London WC1B 3DP, during usual business hours on any weekday, Saturdays and public holidays excepted, 
from the date of this notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General 
Meeting for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
✶ ✶ copies of the service agreements under which Directors of the Company are employed by the Company or its 
subsidiaries
✶ ✶ copies of letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors
✶ ✶ a copy of the Articles of Association of the Company.
✶ ✶ The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee of 
the Board.
12. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the meeting by using the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST 
members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the 
instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by 
the Company’s agent (ID RA10) no later than 48 hours before the meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will 
be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) 
from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by 
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to 
the appointee through other means. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
provider(s) should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for 
any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST 
Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST 
personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

Notes
1.  If you prefer, you may return the proxy form to the Registrar in an envelope addressed to FREEPOST RSBH-UXKS-LRBC, PXS, Capita Registrars, 34 Beckenham Road, 
Beckenham, BR3 4TU.
2. Every holder has the right to appoint some other person(s) of their choice, who need not be a shareholder, as his/her proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights, to attend, speak 
and vote on his/her behalf at the meeting. If you wish to appoint a person other than the Chairman, please insert the name of your chosen proxy holder in the space provided on the 
Proxy Form. If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than your full voting entitlement, please enter next to the proxy holder’s name the number of shares in relation to which 
they are authorised to act as your proxy. If left blank your proxy will be deemed to be authorised in respect of your full voting entitlement (or if this proxy form has been issued in 
respect of a designated account for a shareholder, the full voting entitlement for that designated account).
3. To appoint one or more proxies or to give an instruction to a proxy (whether previously appointed or otherwise) via the CREST system, CREST messages must be received by 
the issuer’s agent (ID number RA10) not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time 
(as determined by the timestamp generated by the CREST system) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message. The Company may treat as invalid a proxy 
appointment sent by CREST in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
4. To appoint more than one proxy please sign and date the Proxy Form and attach a schedule listing the names and addresses (in block letters) of all your proxies, the number of 
shares in respect of which each proxy is appointed (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you) and indicate how you wish each proxy to vote or 
abstain from voting.  
5. ‘Vote Withheld’ enables you to abstain on any particular resolution. However, it should be noted that a ‘Vote Withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation 
of the proportion of the votes ‘For’ and ‘Against’ a resolution.
6. Entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting and the number of votes which may be cast thereat will be determined by reference to the Register of Members of the Company at 
6pm on the 21 July 2013 or two days before the adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of 
any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
7. The completion and return of this form will not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you attend the meeting in person, you may terminate your 
proxy appointment.
8. To be effective, the Proxy Form must arrive during usual business hours not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting at: Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham 
Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU.
9. The Proxy Form shows how your address appears on the Register of Members. If not correct please ring the Registrar’s helpline on 0871 664 0300 (calls cost 10p per minute plus 
network extras, lines are open 8.30am – 5.30pm Mon–Fri) to request a change of address form.
10. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been nominated to receive communication from 
the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (“nominated persons”). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered 
shareholder who holds shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have such a right, or do not 
wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
11.  In the case of an individual, this form of proxy must be signed by the appointor or his attorney.  A shareholder which is a corporation must execute this form of proxy either under 
seal or under the hand of an attorney or duly authorised officer.
12.  A shareholder which is a corporation and which wishes to be represented at the Annual General Meeting by a person with authority to speak and vote (a corporate representative) 
must appoint such a person by resolution of its directors.  A corporate representative has the same powers on behalf of the corporation as he/ she represents as that corporation 
could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company.  Corporate representatives must make themselves known to the Company Secretary or Chairman prior to the start  
of the meeting.
13.  If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for receipt of proxies will take precedence.  In the case of joint holders, 
where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted.  Seniority is determined by the 
order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first named being the most senior).

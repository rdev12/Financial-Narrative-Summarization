STRATEGIC REPORT

Technology plays an increasing role in business and everyday life. 
We live in an always-on, 24/7 connected society. At home, activities 
such as internet shopping and online gaming are part of day-to-day life. 
At work, the way organisations and the people within them interact and 
collaborate has changed significantly. We are increasingly dependent 
on being able to harness the power of communications technologies. 
Using the capabilities of our Group and its partners we can help 
people and organisations harness that technological power by creating 
services that satisfy the varied requirements of the markets we serve. 
By monitoring future trends in technology and business, and by listening 
to our customers’ plans and needs, we design and shape the services we 
can offer now and in the future.
The rise of the data hungry household 
Over the past five years, demand for faster broadband speeds and data 
usage has grown dramatically, and it’s easy to see why. With more and 
more households owning multiple devices – tablets, computers, games 
consoles and smart TVs – there is a constant stream of data flowing 
into and out of the home.
Alongside this, we have become used to accessing services like 
Netflix and YouTube, where the speed and download capacity 
of our internet connection is key. This is driving demand for 
faster and faster broadband services. 
Looking to the future, with more devices and services set to join this online 
world – including telehealth for monitoring patients in their own homes 
and smart appliances which send data back to an external organisation, 
as with smart metering services – the thirst for bandwidth and superfast 
internet is set to continue.
Building better businesses
Today connectivity is crucial for businesses of all sizes. The internet 
has made the world a much smaller place and businesses now have to 
contend not only with traditional bricks and mortar based operations 
but also lower cost, internet-based competition in the UK and abroad. 
For the small enterprise owner, balancing the need to focus on growing 
business with being able to access a range of technologies can be 
a challenge. Much like consumers, they want bundled solutions that can 
deliver all their communications needs. Having access to customer and 
technical support is also vital, as small organisations typically have limited 
specialist in-house IT resource.
For larger organisations, the challenges become more complex, driven 
not only by new demands from customers but also the need to leverage 
talent across the organisation. 
The growing role 
of technology
At KCOM Group, we believe we have 
a significant opportunity to help people 
and organisations harness the power 
of technology. We create services 
to satisfy the requirements of the 
markets we serve by:
 I Monitoring future trends 
in technology and business
 I Listening to our customers’ plans and needs
 I Designing and shaping the services we can 
offer now, and in the future

Strategic report
As the marketplace becomes increasingly competitive, organisations are 
looking for new ways to stand out from the crowd. The ability to deliver 
consistent and high standards of customer service can be a challenge 
when there is also pressure to deliver more for less. 
Customer service
Organisations that can adapt to key trends in customer service will be 
able to deliver an experience that will empower customers and provide 
a competitive advantage. 
The explosion in broadband, smartphone and social media adoption, 
and the pace of technological change present opportunities for 
personalisation, enhanced customer service and innovation to 
differentiate organisations against the background of a ‘more 
for less’ environment.
The economic environment has been very challenging for some time 
causing organisations to re-think their plans. Alongside cost reduction 
programmes, management teams are now looking to embrace innovation 
and IT to create a competitive advantage and find new ways to interact 
with their customers, deliver services and manage their operations 
and supply chain.
By integrating online channels into their contact strategy, organisations 
can build a single view of the customer, tailor their service to customer 
needs, and respond in the timeframe that today’s consumers expect. 
As some online channels are effectively self-service, there is an 
opportunity for organisations to become more efficient in the way 
they handle customer contact.
Research we’ve undertaken in partnership with the Contact Centre 
Association (CCA) has shown that 60 per cent of customers want to talk 
to a person, rather than an automated system – this is in stark contrast 
to figures that show up to 80 per cent of businesses want to increase 
self-service features for their customers. There are however certain 
transactions that customers prefer to handle via self-service or automated 
systems. There is an opportunity for organisations to find a balance 
between human interaction and automated services and take 
a multi-channel approach to delivering customer service which 
will increase both satisfaction and efficiency. 
The future of work
In just over 20 years, we’ve gone from a paper-driven society to one 
that is almost entirely digital - and we are now connected in ways that 
would have seemed like science fiction in the early 1990s.
Organisations that have been traditionally based upon hierarchical, 
pyramid, command and control models are now flattening their 
structures and evolving organisational design thinking from a ‘built 
to last’ approach to one that is ‘built to change’. Social software, 
collaborative technologies, workflow automation and task tracking 
are enabling organisations to become more flexible and agile. A key 
component of this new, agile structure is the application of tools and 
technologies that can create virtual networks and allow greater mobility 
of skills and knowledge.
At the same time, changes in workplace demographics, and a drive 
towards greater work/life flexibility have coincided with faster access 
speeds and the emergence of new technology such as 4G to create 
an expectation from an increasingly specialised workforce for 
collaboration and communications tools that enhance productivity 
and speed up innovation. 
Creating work/life flexibility will be a priority for organisations seeking 
to attract and retain talent. Empowering employees to deliver the best 
results and an enhanced customer experience will make collaboration 
tools and off-site connectivity a key success factor. Technology has 
gone mobile, the use of video and gamification in business is growing, 
and employees are pushing for choice as consumer devices outpace 
corporate ones in terms of functionality and ease of use.
Business leaders and end users are already bringing their own tablets 
and smartphones into the workplace and using cloud applications such 
as Dropbox, Evernote and SkyDrive to store and transfer corporate data. 
While this presents an opportunity for employees to be more productive, 
it creates an information security risk to the organisation.
Being prepared for, and embracing, such opportunities is critical for both 
organisations and individuals. Organisations are increasingly becoming 
aware that people are a key strategic asset, so finding ways to foster 
innovation and productivity is key to success. Technology, particularly 
enterprise-grade communications and collaboration tools, can have a 
big impact on how employees interact and solve problems. Being ready 
to meet the challenges of security and device management will be 
critical to success.
Organisations are looking for trusted partners to help them navigate 
through the latest trends in business and IT, and identify and deliver 
new, compelling capabilities in the areas of collaboration, contact, 
mobility and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) services that add 
demonstrable value. 
Connectivity is at the heart of everything
In order to exploit these technologies in the workplace to the best effect, 
organisations are increasingly looking to pay for what they use, rather 
than owning technology assets outright. Connectivity will be key to 
delivering hybrid cloud solutions that allow organisations to accelerate 
innovation, explore new ideas and reduce the time to bring new products 
to market. These solutions will help them stay poised to take advantage 
of rapid technological advances, and give them the agility, flexibility and 
scalability to respond to opportunities, all for a predictable cost. To exploit 
these opportunities, organisations require much more from their networks 
than ever before and thinking of the network in a strategic way has never 
been more important. Networks will become intelligent, contextual and 
service-aware, and they will be judged on what they enable rather than 
what they are. KCOM Group PLC 
Annual report and accounts 2013/14
STRATEGIC REPORT

Connectivity is at the heart of everything continued
In an increasingly competitive world, successful organisations must look 
to embrace the opportunities and seek out innovative methods for 
facing everyday challenges.
It’s more than the possibility of using technology to avoid undesirable 
tasks through automation and the streamlining of processes. It’s about 
harnessing knowledge and information to provide a richer view of our 
customers and allowing technology to empower us by innovating and 
expanding our existing capabilities; ultimately being augmented rather 
than replaced by technology.
The challenge for IT teams 
Because it is such a driver for change, understanding the potential that 
can be realised by technology is a must for organisations that want to 
create a high-performance workplace.
In the past, IT innovation took place in the workplace first and then, 
when commoditised, became available in the consumer space. 
Since 2009 this has been reversed. Consumer IT has delivered 
transformational innovation that is now being embraced in 
the enterprise.
End users want a consumer IT experience and the IT function wants 
secure, enterprise-grade IT services. The reality is that it’s possible for 
both. Cloud, social media, mobility and Big Data are a nexus of forces 
that is transforming the way businesses will function in the future.
Rapid innovation and the proliferation of technology have changed the 
way we live and work. Organisations want more from their IT networks, not 
just in terms of speed, but also functionality, connectivity and reliability.
This means that organisations must focus on IT now more than ever, 
finding new ways to integrate technology into the company strategy to 
enhance communication, streamline operations, increase revenue and 
transform the business.
In this context, IT becomes a strategic enabler for business, unlocking 
the potential of people across organisations through new collaboration, 
contact and mobility services and experiences to customers, employees 
and partner networks.
Not only are organisations becoming more tech savvy, so are 
their consumers and employees, and end users are seeking increased 
personalisation, integration and connectivity in all facets of technology.
Whatever the market segment, it’s clear that customers are looking for 
some key things from their technology partner: the skills and capability 
to create and integrate solutions; great customer service to anticipate 
and meet their needs, innovative thinking and access to the right 
products and services.
What it means for KCOM Group
At KCOM Group, we bring all these elements together to create the right 
solutions for customers across our markets. We base our strategy on 
four strategic pillars: 
 I our customer focus – through each of our brands we tailor our offer to 
the needs of a particular set of customers and deliver an experience to 
match their requirements; 
 I our people – making sure we leverage their skills and capabilities and 
create the right environment for them to achieve their full potential; 
 I our partners – who help us to deliver a wide breadth of services which 
we can bring together using our expertise and experience; and
 I our processes and systems – making sure they give us the flexibility 
and agility to serve our customers.

Chairman’s statement
Dear shareholder
The Group has performed well during the past financial year, with 
progress being made in all our target markets. Subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM in July, the Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 3.25 pence per share, which is in line with our existing commitment 
to increase the full year dividend by 10 per cent per annum until 
March 2016. This financial year also marks a key point in the 
transformation for our Group. 
The business has successfully refocused 
on those activities that deliver most 
value to customers

important as the services we offer KCOM Group PLC 
Annual report and accounts 2013/14 11
Strategic report
Over the past five years, Bill Halbert has led the Board and the 
Group as Executive Chairman. During that period, the business 
has successfully refocused on those activities that deliver most 
value to our customers and offer opportunities to grow our 
market presence; at the same time, we have been able to provide 
progressive dividend growth to shareholders. Having completed 
that stage of the Group’s transition, the Board agreed it was an 
appropriate time to move to a more traditional Board structure, with 
separate Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles. This provides 
Bill Halbert, as Chief Executive, with additional capacity to drive 
forward the Group’s strategy and I am delighted and proud to have 
taken up the role of Chairman. 
Having seen the Group develop and transform during my time as a 
Non-Executive Director, I know that there is a wealth of talent within 
the organisation and it has such a great heritage on which to build. 
In my role as Chairman, my focus will be to ensure that your Board 
operates effectively and in line with good governance. I am also 
committed to being an ambassador for the Group both internally and 
externally, supporting Bill and his leadership team as they steer the 
business through its next stage of transformation.
We have an extremely effective Board, with strong, experienced 
Non-Executive Directors with a range of skills and experience which 
enables a good level of debate and challenge. Having transitioned to 
a new Board structure, we have been looking to appoint an additional 
Non-Executive Director and are mindful that one of the key challenges 
facing many publicly quoted companies is that of reflecting diversity on 
their Boards. As a Group, we are committed to reflecting diversity of all 
kinds, and gender in particular. This forms an important part of our 
People Strategy and has been a key area of focus in our selection 
process for a new Non-Executive Director. While the selection process 
is ongoing, our aim is to bring wider diversity to the Board within the 
next 12 months, subject to finding a candidate with the right experience 
and skills. Any new appointments to the Board will stand for election by 
shareholders at the AGM in 2015.
Kevin Walsh, one of our Executive Directors, announced his intention 
to retire from the Group during the summer of 2014 and he will not be 
seeking re-election at the AGM. Kevin joined the business in May 2004 
and, alongside his Executive Director role, was responsible for the 
management of our KC brand for the past 10 years. During that time, 
he oversaw its transition into the UK’s leading provider of fibre-based 
services. On behalf of the Board, I’d like to thank him for his contribution 
and insight and wish him well with his retirement plans.
As part of our ongoing transformation, we are mindful that how 
we operate as a business is as important as the services we offer. 
There has been a great deal of progress in both areas. KC has been 
shortlisted in three categories in this year’s Internet Service Providers 
(ISPA) Awards including Best Superfast Broadband, Best Business 
Customer Service and Best Business Use of Cloud for our fibre-based 
CCTV offering. Our Eclipse brand was recognised in the Comms 
National Awards in the SME Vertical Solution category for its supply of 
ICT products and services. Our community programmes, which offer 
employees the chance to give something back to their local area, 
remain very popular with individuals and as team building 
opportunities. As part of our patronage of the Prince’s Trust, people 
across the Group have donated over 2,000 volunteering hours, in this 
year alone, to help disadvantaged young people to find work.
Finally, I’d like to acknowledge the immense contribution made by 
everyone across our organisation. Working against a backdrop of 
economic uncertainty and ongoing business transformation, it is 
challenging to deliver such progress. I’d like to thank everyone for their 
efforts over the past year. It is their commitment to providing inspiring 
customer experiences that builds our growing reputation in the market.

STRATEGIC REPORT

This year’s results reflect the progress we have made in key focus areas 
across the Group, underpinned by the highly cash-generative nature 
of the business.
The vision for our Group is to passionately pursue better ways to connect 
people and this underpins all our activity. In today’s world, connecting 
people is more than just providing simple network connections; it’s about 
collaboration and value-adding interactions, whether that is direct 
communication between people, or interactions that occur through the 
vast array of applications and systems we use at home and at work. As a 
business, we focus on helping our customers harness the power of those 
technologies that enable such connections to take place.
This year’s results reflect the 
progress we have made in key 
areas across the Group

Strategic report
As the economy begins to recover, we expect to see further opportunities 
across both the public and enterprise sectors, as many organisations 
begin to make IT investments to underpin their renewed ambitions.
Internally, we have started to invest in strengthening our Group 
capability, introducing new ways of working and increasing our ability to 
leverage the wide range of skills and capability of our people across the 
business. As part of this, we are undertaking substantial investment in 
our core IT systems in support of some of these new ways of operating. 
Outlook
We are now moving into the next stage of the Group’s development 
as we continue to grow our capabilities and help our customers 
to harness the power of communications.
The Group is well positioned to continue exploiting the opportunities 
that exist in its key markets. We will continue to invest in expanding 
the reach of, and building customer demand for, our fibre-based 
broadband services and similarly in growing our share of the wider 
enterprise market we serve. While, as we do so, we expect to see a 
continued decline in some traditional carrier revenue, we are confident 
of achieving successful growth in our value-added services. 
With the strong underlying cash flow of the Group, refinancing 
finalised and the positive indicators within the Group, we will consider 
also opportunities for investment in these focus areas going forward.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone across the Group 
for helping make this year one of further progress on our transformation 
journey. I look forward to continued achievement and success, as we 
progress our plans.

In our consumer market, there continues to be growing demand for our 
fibre-based services, with the take-up rate of 27 per cent being ahead 
of our initial expectations and above UK averages. Over 29,000 premises 
now have access to superfast fibre broadband and we remain on target 
to pass 45,000 by March 2015. The investment we are making in this 
infrastructure today, which takes fibre directly to the premise, provides 
us with a future-proof network capable of satisfying both current and 
any future demand for high bandwidth services. 
Alongside the deployment of fibre across our network, we are looking 
at opportunities to provide innovative ‘over the top’ services. 
We recently launched a high definition, cloud-based CCTV service 
and are talking to a number of other potential partners that provide 
a range of business and consumer services. The range of services 
available is evolving rapidly as more people gain access to fibre services.
The success that we have achieved to date with our superfast fibre 
deployment has helped shape our thinking as we begin to scope the 
next phase. We expect to outline our future plans when we announce 
our half year results in November 2014.
Across the other areas of the Group, we continue to build our reputation 
in the design, delivery and management of value-added services in the 
wider enterprise market. There have been a number of notable contract 
wins and renewals. New customers include HM Revenue & Customs, 
RNLI and National Farmers Union Mutual, all of whom are taking 
a range of services that we will manage on their behalf. This ability 
to attract, and importantly, retain customers is a reflection of our 
growing reputation in the market. 
There is continued growth in both Smart421 and Eclipse. Both brands are 
establishing strong reputations in the provision of cloud-based services. 
Eclipse has launched a range of hosted services aimed at small to 
medium businesses who typically need a technology and 
communications partner to support them.
There is also an increasing interest in the use of cloud technology in 
the enterprise market and we have successfully positioned ourselves, 
alongside our partner, Amazon Web Services, as a leading integrator and 
consultant for organisations looking to embrace cloud-based solutions. 
For example, in May, we successfully migrated all the UK’s rail ticketing 
systems on behalf of the Association of Train Operating Companies. KCOM Group PLC

Customers
We understand and anticipate the needs 
of our customers and align our products, 
services and solutions to meet those needs 
and create a unique brand experience.
Our focus on exceptional service delivery has 
resulted in increasing customer advocacy, new 
contracts with large enterprise customers and

People
Achieving our vision is dependent upon the 
skills and capabilities of our people. Creating 
a value-driven, high performance culture is 
about providing an environment where we 
attract, develop, sustain and enable all of 
our people to demonstrate and apply their 
capabilities, providing opportunities for 
everyone to reach their full potential.
In order to achieve that, we are evolving the 
way we work together, harnessing the power 
of all 1,900 people so that all our customers 
can benefit from our collective experience 
and skills. 
We continue to reward and recognise our 
people when they go the extra mile to deliver 
excellence, not just by what they achieve, 
but also how they achieve it, through their 
behaviour and attitude. 
We launched the Building our Future 
initiative to support our business goals of 
delivering and recognising excellence. 
Throughout the year we brought people 
together to create Group-wide teams 
responsible for network-related activities 
and project management.
I  continue developing the skills and capabilities 
of our people to drive the achievement of our 
strategic objectives in line with our growth

Partners
We harness the skills and capabilities of our 
partners to support the focus of our brands.
We have strong relationships in place with 
organisations including BT, Microsoft, IBM, 
Cisco, Avaya and Amazon Web Services. 
With access to their skills, experience and 
technologies, overlaid with our managed 
service capability, we are able to fulfil our 
long-term vision. As a result of those 
relationships, leading organisations 
increasingly are recognising the capabilities of 
the Group and its exceptional service delivery.
We have created a Group-wide team 
responsible for all network-related activities 
and for leveraging our partnership with 
BT particularly.
Our partnerships support our ability to 
achieve a level of innovation and deliver 
solutions and experiences that cannot be 
gained elsewhere, as customers experience 
improved ways to connect, collaborate and 
interact, using the power of technology.
I  invest in partnerships that support

investment. Those pillars 
support us in our pursuit 
of operational excellence, 
as we seek to achieve a 
market-leading position in our 
selected markets and deliver 
increasing shareholder value.

Principal risks and uncertainties
As with all businesses, we are affected by a number of risks and uncertainties, of which some are beyond our control. The table below shows the principal risks 
and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on the Group and have been identified through the risk management framework on page 37 .
This is not an exhaustive list and there may be risks and uncertainties of which currently we are unaware, or which are believed to be immaterial, which 
could have an adverse effect on the business.
In the previous year we also included risks in relation to business continuity, increasing compliance requirements from customers and competition in 
the Hull and East Yorkshire area. We are still closely managing these risks, but these are not currently considered to be among the key risks facing the 
business and therefore these have not been reported on specifically below.

Change in 
level of risk Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? How does this link to our Group strategy?
Risks continuing from last year
Security and resilience of our 
networks and IT systems
Our networks and IT systems are key to all that we do and are crucial 
in delivering service to our customers. The risk in the year has 
increased due to an increase in external security threats, including 
larger volume of attacks intended to create a denial of service.
As the risk has increased, so has our work to mitigate the risk. We 
have implemented increased security and we continue to closely 
monitor any attempted attacks and take actions where necessary to 
ensure we have robust security in place. We have held the ISO 27001 
Information Security Management standard since 2007 and also 
comply with other security standards as required by our customers.
This links directly to our processes and systems, as well as being key 
to our customer pillar as ensuring security of our networks and IT 
systems is a clear customer need.
Accuracy, security and 
confidentiality of customer data
Security of customer data, whether it belongs to a business or 
an individual, is of paramount importance to our customers and 
therefore to us. The potential risk to data security has increased 
in the year as a result of the increased volume of external attacks 
seen across all industries. 
We have rolled out mandatory information security training and 
data protection training to all our people and have a clear Data 
Governance policy in place, which contains specific handling 
guidelines for different types of data. Any incidents, however minor, 
are investigated and control improvements implemented where 
necessary to ensure that we keep our customer data secure at 
all times.
This has a direct impact on our customers and also links to 
our processes and systems pillar as our processes and systems play 
a pivotal role in keeping our data accurate, secure and confidential.
Customer service and delivery
Delivering exceptional service to our customers is one of our key 
strategic aims and therefore the risk of failing to do this is a key risk 
for us to mitigate.
We have continued to invest in our people and our systems to 
ensure that we have the right people in the right roles and that they 
have the right tools to provide an exceptional service. We also work 
closely with our partners to ensure that they are aligned with us in 
delivering the best service possible.
This links to all aspects of our Group strategy and is key to the 
whole of our business.
Recruitment and retention 
of the right people
Recruiting and retaining the right people is crucial for the success of 
the Group in meeting our objectives. This applies not only to being 
able to recruit people who embody our values, but also to recruiting 
people with specific technical skills where needed, some of which 
may be in short supply. It also involves developing the skills in-house 
and creating internal mobility around deploying those skills.
Our People Strategy is focused on creating a workplace which not 
only attracts top talent but also retains those people that are key to 
delivering on our objectives. During the year we have focused on 
communicating total reward packages to our people to ensure that 
everyone understands their total reward. We have also been creating 
a competency framework across the Group, which will enable us to 
create more career opportunities for individuals internally and to 
respond to our customers with greater agility.
Recruiting and retaining the right people is part of the people pillar 
of our Group strategy, whilst also having an impact on our customers 
and the level of service that they receive.
Reliance on key third party 
partners and suppliers
Our business model means that we are reliant on several key partners 
to deliver service to our customers and to provide the equipment that 
we need to deliver the right solutions; such as BT, Comms-Care, 
ForgeRock, Cisco, Avaya, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and IBM.
We have dedicated teams to work alongside our key partners and we 
monitor all of our partnerships closely so that any potential issues are 
identified and resolved before becoming significant. We have also 
multiple partners in key risk areas to mitigate the risk in the event 
of failure of one partner.

Strategic report
Growing consumer demand for fibre-based services
In KC, progress in our fibre deployment remains strong and we 
continue to exploit the investment in our fibre network to grow sales 
of broadband and related data services. Take-up remains strong 
and we are on target to provide 45,000 premises (c30 per cent of the 
addressable market) with access to superfast fibre-based services by 
March 2015. Our current take-up rate of 27 per cent is well ahead of the 
national average, and is delivering an average revenue per user (ARPU) 
uplift of in excess of £5 per month.
We are scoping the next phase of this investment (beyond March 2015) 
and will provide an update on this at the interim results in November 2014. 
While subsequent phases of this deployment will require additional 
capital investment, it will create a future-proof infrastructure capable 
of very high speeds, well in excess of current and forecast market 
requirements. We believe our decision to deploy fibre to the premise 
(FTTP) is the most financially attractive over the longer term, as well 
as being the most beneficial for our customers.
Focus on delivery of value-added services to SMB and 
enterprise markets
In Kcom, we are focused principally on partnering enterprise and public 
sector organisations for the delivery of value-added communications 
and IT related services. 
The move away from some of our legacy carrier business is most 
evident in our enterprise activities rather than those in the SMB 
market where there is continued demand for connectivity, particularly 
as part of our cloud-based offerings. Typically, SMB organisations 
have limited internal IT resource and are looking for access to a range 
of communications packages with low upfront investment and full 
service support. Customers in this sector include RNLI, Furniture 
Village and the RSPB.
Within the large enterprise market, our carrier-only activity is declining 
due to both the commoditised nature of the products and ongoing 
pricing pressure from regulatory changes. However, those products 
will continue to be a component of our managed services offering.
Increasingly, our enterprise customers are looking for partners with the 
ability to offer multiple communications and IT services under one 
managed contract, many of which include cloud-based solutions. 
We believe this market will exhibit significant growth and provides 
opportunities for the Group, driven by: 
 I the need for organisations to make ‘catch-up’ investment post the 
economic crisis;
 I the complexity of managing multiple customer contact channels 
(web, email, live chat, contact centres); 
 I the need to exploit the capability of a range of systems and 
platforms; and
 I a focus on increased efficiency, collaboration and productivity 
within organisations.
Building long-term customer relationships
Our ability to deliver bespoke solutions provides the opportunity to build 
long-term, quality relationships based on annuity contracts. 
We provide managed and consultancy services to organisations 
including Morrisons, Phones4U, National Farmers Union Mutual, 
Admiral and University Hospitals Birmingham. During the year, we 
also secured contracts and renewals with British Airways, Mercedes 
and HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). Under our contract with the 
Association of Train Operating Companies, we recently migrated all the 
UK’s rail ticketing and travel information and systems on to a cloud-
based platform with our partner, Amazon Web Services. 
Certain managed services contracts require specific customer capital 
investment, which is reflected in our contract pricing. Our contract 
with HMRC for the provision of hosted contact centre services requires 
capital investment of c£8 million which will be funded through cost 
effective finance leases allowing us to match our cash inflows and 
outflows over the life of the contract. This will increase net debt in the 
year ending 31 March 2015.
Net debt, cash flow and refinancing
Year end net debt was £75.0 million (2013: £88.2 million), representing 
a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0x (2013: 1.2x). 
The Group continues to be highly cash generative and recorded strong 
cash collection in the second half of the year increasing working capital 
inflows and leading to lower year end net debt. Net debt is likely to 
increase in 2015 as capital expenditure increases but we expect to 
maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio of comfortably less than 1.5x. 
The Group’s debtor management remains strong with year end days’ 
sales outstanding of 30 days (2013: 30 days).
On 4 June, the Group successfully refinanced through the agreement 
of a £200.0 million revolving credit facility, secured on improved terms. 
This new arrangement, which expires on 30 June 2019, provides 
sufficient funding to support both organic and inorganic growth.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 3.25 pence per share 
(2013: 2.97 pence), representing a total dividend for the year 
of 4.88 pence per share (2013: 4.44 pence). This represents 
10 per cent year-on-year growth in the total dividend, consistent 
with the Board’s previously stated commitment to grow full year 
dividends at 10 per cent per annum until the year ending 
31 March 2016.
Subject to shareholder approval at the KCOM Group PLC Annual General 
Meeting on 29 July 2014, the final dividend will be paid on 1 August 2014 
to shareholders registered on 27 June 2014. The ex-dividend date is 
25 June 2014. KCOM Group PLC

Pensions
The Group continues to actively manage its pension obligations and 
engage in positive discussions with the schemes’ Trustees. In recent 
years, significant progress has been made through a number of 
actions, including:
 I closure of all defined benefit schemes to future accrual; 
 I breaking the link to final salary;
 I reduction of deferred membership through a transfer-out offer; and
 I establishment and transfer of assets into an asset-backed partnership.
During the year reported, a secured loan was transferred into the 
asset-backed partnership created during the year ended 31 March 2013. 
This second agreement provides further certainty over the Group’s cash 
commitments to the schemes, by creating both an improvement to the 
funding deficit (through an annual distribution of £1.6 million) and added 
security to the Trustees of the schemes. 
The Group’s IAS 19 pension liability is £26.5 million (2013: £9.8 million). 
The year-on-year increase arises as a result of movements in assumptions, 
in particular a lower discount rate used to calculate the schemes’ liabilities. 
The actuarial deficit at 31 March 2013 was £59.2 million 
(31 March 2010: £61.4 million). The Group’s cash commitments 
reflect post-valuation experience factors including:
 I successful completion of the second transfer into the 
asset-backed partnership;
 I post-valuation experience, particularly significant movements 
in discount factors and equity rates since March 2013; alongside
 I further strengthening of covenant and relationship with the 
pension scheme Trustees.
In addition to payments relating to the Group’s asset-backed partnership, 
the planned level of deficit repair payment (across both schemes) is 
£2.0 million in each of the years ending 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016. 
Group and segmental performance 
Group revenue (£370.7 million) and EBITDA before exceptional items 
(£75.3 million) were broadly flat (2013: £372.9 million and restated 
£74.9 million). 
The KC segment reported revenue of £105.0 million (2013: £104.6 million) 
representing a strong consumer performance (particularly in the take-up 
of fibre-based services), offset by slightly lower business revenue. 
Ongoing efficient cost management resulted in EBITDA before exceptional 
items increasing by 3.1 per cent to £56.2 million (2013: £54.5 million).
Within our Kcom segment, revenue was £270.9 million (2013: £273.4 million) 
reflecting our focus on exploiting emerging market trends. EBITDA before 
exceptional items was £28.7 million (2013: £29.4 million). We anticipate 
some incremental decline in revenue in the year ending 31 March 2015, as 
the decline in some historic carrier based activities continue to decline.

Annual report and accounts 2013/14 23
Strategic report
The Group’s PLC segment includes central and share scheme expenses, 
and administration costs associated with the Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes. These costs (before exceptional items) were £9.6 million 
(2013: restated £9.0 million).The income statement effect of financing 
the Group’s pension schemes was previously reported within EBITDA but, 
following the revision to IAS 19, is now included within finance costs. 
The Group’s net exceptional credit was £0.6 million. This included 
a £2.6 million profit on contract termination offset by costs of 
restructuring (£1.1 million), costs associated with the Group’s second 
asset-backed pension funding arrangement (£0.7 million) and onerous 
lease costs (£0.2 million).
Capital investment
The Group’s depreciation and amortisation charge for the year was 
£20.3 million (2013: £19.6 million), reflecting continued investment 
in existing commitments. We expect this charge to increase in future 
years. Cash capital expenditure during the year was £27.9 million 
(2013: £28.0 million). Specific projects include:
 I the continued deployment of fibre;
 I IT investment to allow the Group to move towards common systems 
and processes; and
 I targeted customer specific investment.
The Group anticipates that capital investment levels will be 
approximately £35 million in the year ending 31 March 2015. 
This increase reflects the timing of cash outflows rather than 
a material change in capital investment levels. 
Tax
The Group’s tax charge of £11.8 million (2013: restated £11.9 million) 
reflects the corporation tax charge for the year and the ongoing unwind 
of deferred tax balances. Deferred tax balances have been re-measured 
to reflect the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 23 per cent to 
20 per cent for the year ending 31 March 2015. 
The effective rate of 23.3 per cent is broadly in line with the prevailing 
rate of corporation tax as the effect of re-measuring deferred tax is 
offset by prior year tax items. The Group’s corporation tax liability 
would have been higher had it not been for the benefit arising from 
the Group’s second asset-backed pension funding arrangement.
Our cash tax payment in the year ended 31 March 2015 relating to the 
current year is c£2 million. We expect cash tax payments in the years 
ending 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016 to be c£4 million and 
c£5 million respectively, in line with prevailing corporation tax rates.

STRATEGIC REPORT
24
It is extremely important to us that we 
not only achieve our strategic vision but 
that we do this in the right way
Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) strategy covers four key areas:
We seek to ensure our business is sustainable while also 
behaving responsibly in relation to our key stakeholders, 
including the communities in which we operate, our people 
and the environment.
Corporate responsibility
The four key areas of focus are not separate and overlap in many ways.
The strategy for our people, the community and the environment has 
been well-established and communicated across our Group for a number 
of years. Our supply chain strategy has previously operated at a brand 
level resulting in different levels of focus. As we move towards our One 
Group business model, we are linking together the different elements 
of our supply chain strategy to produce a more coherent and consistent 
strategy across the Group.
All four elements of our CR strategy are taken into consideration when 
key business decisions are made and the Board receives regular reports 
during the year on the key areas. Responsibility for the overall CR strategy 
sits with our Chief Executive.
The governance around the four key areas is to ensure that we have 
a consistent approach to risk management, strategy development and 
measuring progress against each key area.
The overall aims of our CR strategy are to:
I  use our knowledge and expertise to create a positive impact on 
all our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate;
I  develop and promote a culture driven by our Group values, which 
in turn is reflected in how we conduct our business; and
I  engage, enable and empower our people so that they can make 
a positive contribution to our CR strategy and the causes that 
matter to them.

Strategic report
Why is this part of our CR strategy? How does this link to the Group strategy?
Community
We have a responsibility to the communities in which we operate; 
in particular our KC brand has a significant impact on the local 
community in Hull and East Yorkshire. Our community strategy 
is key to ensuring that we take our responsibility seriously in all 
of our local communities.
This links directly to our customers strategic pillar as our community 
strategy, particularly in the Hull and East Yorkshire area, impacts 
directly on the brand experience of our customers.
People
People are key to our business and to our ongoing sustainability. 
We listen to our people as key stakeholders in our business and ensure 
also that we meet our legal and moral obligations in relation to the 
health, safety and wellbeing of our people and anyone else who comes 
into contact with our business.
This links directly to our people strategic pillar, which seeks to attract, 
develop, sustain and enable all of our people to achieve their full 
potential. It also links to our partners strategic pillar as our partners 
working alongside us are directly affected by our people strategies.
Environment
We are not a significant polluter from an environmental perspective; 
however, we need to ensure that we meet our obligations in relation to 
environmental reporting requirements and environmental legislation. 
It is important that we measure and monitor our environmental impact 
so that we can make informed decisions in relation to environmental 
matters. We must also consider wider environmental impacts on the 
Group as part of our ongoing strategy to protect the sustainability of 
the business.
This links to all of our strategic pillars:
I  the manner in which we manage our environmental impacts and 
the impacts of the environment on our business directly affects 
our customers and therefore our customers strategic pillar;
I  having a clear environmental strategy and enabling our people to 
identify how they can contribute to this is a motivational factor for 
our people;
I  environmental impacts, such as flooding, can have a direct impact 
on our processes and systems if we do not adequately plan to 
mitigate these risks; and
I  environmental impacts on our suppliers and partners can also 
directly impact our business if we do not adequately plan for these; 
therefore linking directly also to our partners strategic pillar. 
Supply chain
Our supply chain is crucial to the success of the business and it is essential 
that this is managed effectively in order to manage the risk relating to 
continuity of supply. We believe also that we have an obligation to ensure 
that we source goods and services from suppliers with the right ethical 
priorities and from sustainable sources wherever possible. 
This links directly to our partners strategic pillar, which focuses 
on closely collaborating with our partners and suppliers which in turn 
directly leads to supply chain strategy.
Our supply chain choices also impact on our customers and therefore 
also link to our customers strategic pillar across the Group.  KCOM Group PLC

Corporate responsibility continued
Community
We have no material social issues, however we are very aware of our potential impact in the local communities 
in which we operate, particularly in the Hull and East Yorkshire region where we employ over 1,000 people, support 
a further 400 full-time local jobs and contribute over £1 50 million each year
1
 to the local economy.
We are proud to be part of local life and the potential impact on the local community is considered in all 
decisions made by the Group.
Supporting local economic growth and business success
As businesses and consumers increasingly rely on online services to 
communicate and do business, we have invested significantly in rolling out 
superfast fibre-based broadband services in the Hull and East Yorkshire 
area to help boost the region’s economy and to transform the online lives 
of our customers, with download speeds including 100Mbps and 350Mbps. 
We announced the start of the fibre roll-out in 2012 and as at 31 March 
2014 we have passed 29,700 premises, with a commitment to pass 
45,000 premises by 31 March 2015.
Unemployment rates in Hull are high in comparison to England as a whole
2
, 
we therefore believe that we have a responsibility to support the local 
economy whenever we can. We proactively adopt a ‘buy local’ approach 
when purchasing goods and services, which means that two-thirds of these 
come from over 240 local suppliers.
In 2011 we launched an investment fund, called KC Invest, to provide 
start-up and growth financing for local businesses in the digital and 
technology sectors. The aim of this fund is to stimulate business growth 
in the local economy and help create new, sustainable jobs. Since it was 
introduced, KC Invest has provided loan financing to 20 start-ups and small 
businesses, which in turn have supported 72 local jobs.
Community engagement prior to the launch of KC Invest highlighted that a 
key area in which small businesses need support is with sales and marketing 
skills. We therefore launched a series of Boost Your Business events 
featuring expert speakers, which are free for small businesses to attend. 
The first series of events was so successful that a second series was launched 
in May 2013, with events now taking place quarterly.
We have also supported 17 young people with grants through the Hull 
Youth Enterprise Bank to help them set up and develop their businesses. 
We firmly believe that the enterprising young people of today are the 
employers of tomorrow and therefore it is vital that we provide practical 
and financial support where we can to help these businesses get started.
We are active supporters of the Hull Employability Charter and in the past 
year have taken on six apprentices to demonstrate our support.
Volunteering
In addition to our activities in the Hull region, we also encourage all of 
our people to become involved in local community projects wherever 
they are based.
We have formal partnerships in place with schools, charities and projects 
in areas where we operate across the UK. During the year, our people 
donated 3,843 hours to community volunteering through our various 
community programmes.
Our commitment to the local community was recognised in 
November 2013 when the KC brand was awarded the Community 
Involvement Award at the annual Hull Daily Mail Business Awards.
We continued also this year our patronage of the Prince’s Trust, the UK’s 
leading youth charity. The Trust aims to change lives by offering training, 
personal development, business start-up support, mentoring and advice to 
young people. As part of our support we entered two teams into the Million 
Makers corporate challenge, in which each team aims to raise money for 
the Trust by setting up their own mini enterprise. Our two teams raised over 
£17 ,000 for the Trust, with our Eclipse team winning first place in the South 
West region for their fundraising.
In addition, we have sponsored and hosted a number of events to 
recognise the achievement of young people on Prince’s Trust programmes 
and to encourage wider membership from business contacts.
Group charity partner
We work with a charity partner, chosen by our people who vote on a 
shortlist of UK-registered national charities. In April 2012 we began a 
partnership with Sparks, a charity dedicated to funding pioneering research 
into conditions affecting babies, children and mums-to-be. The focus of 
Sparks is on improving the quality of life for children and families affected 
by serious illness or disability, while seeking ways to better diagnose, treat 
and prevent these conditions in the future through medical research.
Since the partnership began in 2012 we have raised almost £150,000 
for Sparks through the dedication of our people participating in sporting 
challenges, dress down days, auctions, cake bakes and many other 
activities. We have extended our partnership to 31 March 2015 after 
consulting with our charity champions and key fundraisers.

People
Our people are essential to our success as a Group and are one of our key differentiators when we are seeking to win 
business. It is therefore crucial to us that we can continue to attract the right skills, behaviour and talent for the Group, 
whilst continuing to motivate and develop the talented individuals already within our organisation. We launched our 
current People Strategy in 2010 with these aims in mind.
Values
Our values are to be open and considerate, team-minded, flexible, 
inspiring and innovative and we have invested in activities to 
communicate and embed these values across our Group since 2010. 
Part of this has been through a series of workshops entitled ‘It Starts 
with Me’, which have been attended by over 1,000 of our employees.
Development
Since the launch of our People Strategy we have provided 
comprehensive leadership training to all of our people managers, 
covering all areas of people management and providing 360 degree 
feedback to all participants, plus access to one-on-one coaching for 
all employees and managers.
We are working also on the production of a competency-based 
framework across our organisation to enable greater career 
management and personal development opportunities for those 
within our organisation.
Human rights 
We respect fundamental human rights consistent with the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and we ensure that 
all of our internal policies are consistent with this. We do not have 
any current human rights issues.
Health, safety and wellbeing
The health, safety and wellbeing of our people is of paramount 
importance to us, along with the health, safety and wellbeing of our 
contractors, partners, customers and any members of the public who 
may be affected by our work.
We have rigorous training and clear Safe Systems of Work for all 
of our people engaged in manual work; we also have training for 
our office-based workers and we undertake risk assessments with 
those who drive on company business, providing additional driver 
training for individuals deemed to be at a higher risk.
We work with a number of partners when performing manual work 
and we have clear processes in place to ensure that our partners are 
competent and are operating in a healthy and safe manner. We require 
all of our suppliers of physical services to hold safe contractor status 
and seek to work with any smaller suppliers without this to help them 
achieve this status.
We have held our annual health and wellbeing screening sessions, 
for the fifth consecutive year. These are open to all of our people 
and provide a free and confidential health assessment measuring such 
things as blood pressure, blood sugar levels, Body Mass Index and lung 
capacity. 592 of our colleagues attended these sessions in the year. 
In addition we provide employees with the option to purchase other 
medical and dental services through our flexible benefits scheme.
We continue to maintain our accreditation to the BS OHSAS 18001 
Health and Safety management standard and there were no fatalities 
or health and safety enforcement notices in the year. We experienced 
two Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 
(RIDDOR) incidents (2013: one). There were 13 working days lost in the 
year as a result of health and safety incidents (2013: 17.5).
Gender diversity
It is important to us that we achieve gender diversity at all levels of 
the organisation. The gender diversity of the Group as at 31 March 
2014 is set out below:
Male Female Female %
Board Directors 6 0 0%
Senior management team 11 6 35%

We are supportive of flexible working whenever possible and 15 per cent 
of our workforce works flexible hours, including 34 per cent of our 
female employees. KCOM Group PLC

Corporate responsibility continued
Environment
As a Group we take our impact on the environment seriously and over the years have sought to reduce our emissions 
wherever possible. We have recycling facilities at all of our main offices and we have a network of Green Champions 
across the Group, who help to raise awareness of environmental matters in their local area.
Our emissions
Our main environmental impact arises from the use of electricity, 
which accounts for over 85 per cent of our CO 2e emissions. This includes 
electricity used at our offices, as well as at our data centres and network 
sites. During the year our electricity usage has reduced by eight per cent 
from the prior year. This is a result of energy efficiencies achieved 
through various IT initiatives and more detailed reporting of usage 
by site enabling opportunities for energy savings to be more easily 
identified and implemented. 
The table below sets out our annual emissions in tonnes of CO 2e.
 
1.  Last year we reported total emissions of 26,600 tonnes of CO 2 e. We have now restated 
the comparatives to reflect changes in the assumptions set out by the Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to ensure consistency with the emissions 
reported this year.
We have calculated our emissions data using the GHG Reporting Protocol.
The impact of climate change
There has been a significant amount of flooding across Great Britain 
during the year under review. Despite a tidal surge affecting the centre 
of Hull, we are pleased to report that our business continuity process 
provided adequate protection and none of our buildings or equipment 
were affected. However, we take the risk of flooding seriously and over 
the last few years have installed powerful water pumps and flood 
alarms at the sites we have identified as having a potential flood risk, 
as well as installing flood barriers to doors leading to basements and 
replacing air bricks at selected sites.
Last year we also reported on CO
2
e arising from business travel, the 
proportion of waste recycled and the amount of printer and photocopier 
paper used. We set ourselves targets to maintain all of these at 2012/13 
levels. During the year we achieved all of these targets.
We will continue to monitor these figures going forward, however we 
do not believe that these are material to understanding our business 
performance and therefore will not report these in our Corporate 
Responsibility report in future years. If you would like any further 
information on our environmental performance or further detail on 
any of our emissions then please contact our Company Secretary, 
Kathy Smith.

Strategic report
Supply chain
We believe that we have responsibilities in relation to our supply chain, not only to try to ensure continuity of supply but 
also to do as much as we can to ensure that our suppliers operate with the same ethics and standards as us. In devising 
our supply chain strategy we have considered the key risks in relation to the current supply chain.
 
Ethical sourcing
The vast majority of products that we purchase come from suppliers 
within the UK. During the year we imported only one per cent of the 
goods we bought, all of which came from Europe, North America, 
Australia and New Zealand. In our KC brand we have a specific policy 
of ‘buying local’ so two-thirds of our spend to support our KC brand 
was with over 240 local suppliers.
We have a supplier code of conduct which all of our suppliers are required 
to adhere to. This includes our requirements in relation to laws and ethical 
standards, labour practices, risk management and business continuity. 
We are also in the process of meeting with our top 10 suppliers to see 
first-hand how they approach ethical issues and how they ensure 
compliance with our code of conduct.
Continuity of supply
We review continually our supply chain to ensure that we are able to 
have continuity of supply, or a viable alternative, should one of our key 
suppliers unexpectedly fail. Electricity is clearly key to much of our 
business and therefore the threat of a significant power outage has 
been identified as a potential risk to the Group. To mitigate this risk,  
each of our key sites has an on-site dedicated power supply back-up, 
with either permanent or mobile generator support in the event of 
long-term power outages. These are all tested at regular intervals.
Contractual risk
One of the key areas in which we need to manage risk in our supply chain 
is in our contracts with suppliers and subcontractors. We have an in-house 
Legal team that is responsible for overseeing all of our bespoke contracts 
and they work hard to ensure that the Group does not take on an 
exposure which is outside of our control and that we contract fairly while 
mitigating risk where possible.

Corporate governance
Appointment and replacement of Directors
It is the policy of the Board that all Directors wishing to continue in 
office will stand for election or re-election each year at the AGM, in 
accordance with Provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Articles of Association allow the Board to appoint a new Director at 
any time; however the Articles state that the new Director will only hold 
office until the next AGM, at which point he or she must stand for 
election or vacate the office.
The Nomination Committee, and the Board as a whole, has reviewed 
the performance and contribution of Bill Halbert, Graham Holden, 
Tony Illsley, Paul Simpson and Martin Towers and has no hesitation 
in proposing the re-appointment of each of these Board members. 
Kevin Walsh has indicated his intention to retire from the Board during 
the summer of 2014 and therefore will not stand for re-election at 
the AGM.
The Articles of Association state also that the Company may remove a 
Director by ordinary resolution with special notice before the expiration 
of their period of office. There have been no Directors removed from 
office during the year.
Independence
The two Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman, 
are considered to be independent in relation to the criteria set out in 
Provision B.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the National 
Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) Corporate Governance Voting 
Policy and Guidelines.
The Board reviews the independence of the Non-Executive Directors 
each year, taking into account the length of tenure, relationships and 
circumstances as well as considering the behaviour of each Director 
at Board meetings and whether or not they contribute to unbiased 
and independent debate. All of the Non-Executive Directors and the 
Non-Executive Chairman were independent upon appointment and 
the Board believes that all three remain wholly independent.
Commitments of the Chairman
During the year under review, Bill Halbert worked full-time for the 
Company as Executive Chairman. He also sat on the boards of a 
number of smaller private limited companies but these did not require 
a significant time commitment and he managed successfully these 
commitments alongside his role at KCOM Group. His commitments 
have not changed significantly in the year.
From 1 April 2014, Graham Holden was appointed as Non-Executive 
Chairman. Graham currently has no other significant commitments.
The combined roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
From July 2009 to the end of March 2014, Bill Halbert held the 
role of Executive Chairman, combining the roles of Chairman and 
Chief Executive. Given the particular circumstances of the Group 
in 2009, the decision to combine the two roles was taken with the 
support of our largest shareholders, to provide strong leadership 
through a period of transformation for the business. This 
transformation continued through the economic downturn and, 
in both 2011 and 2012, consultation with our largest shareholders 
indicated that there was strong support for Bill to continue in his 
dual role.
The combined role was reviewed regularly by the Nomination 
Committee and during the year it was agreed that the Group had 
progressed beyond the specific circumstances requiring the dual 
role and that therefore it was the right thing for the Group to 
split the role once again, to ensure compliance with best practice. 
Therefore from 1 April 2014 the roles of Chairman and Chief 
Executive have been separated, with Bill becoming the Chief 
Executive and Graham Holden, previously one of our Non-Executive 
Directors, becoming Non-Executive Chairman.
Having a combined Executive Chairman role is in breach of 
Provision A.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The main 
principle of the Code, which is supported by Provision A.2.1, is 
‘There should be a clear division of responsibilities at the head of 
the Company between the running of the Board and the executive 
responsibility for the running of the Company’s business. No one 
individual should have unfettered powers of decision.’ To ensure 
that we complied with this principle while the dual role was in 
operation, we had the following measures in place throughout:
 I we had a strong Board, including experienced Non-Executive 
Directors. Our Senior Independent Director, Tony Illsley, along 
with the Executive Chairman and the other Non-Executive 
Directors, was responsible for ensuring that there was a culture 
of openness, debate and challenge among the Board members. 
Also, Tony Illsley and the other Non-Executive Directors were 
always available to any shareholders who requested a meeting 
or wanted to voice concerns, although no such meetings 
were requested;
 I we had an equal number of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors on the Board and a clear schedule of Matters 
Reserved for the Board so that no single group or individual was 
able to dominate decision-making;
 I the Company Secretary, along with the Executive Chairman, 
was responsible for ensuring that there was the right flow of 
information to the Board and that the Board agenda covered 
all of the topics that the Board should be considering; 
 I each of our four operating brands has its own Managing 
Director, separate from the Executive Chairman, who all had 
access to the other Executive Directors and, along with other 
members of senior management, met with the Non-Executive 
Directors on a regular basis to enable information to be 
exchanged first hand and to provide the Non-Executive 
Directors with greater insight and understanding of Group 
operations outside of the boardroom; and
 I our Executive Chairman received training on his responsibilities 
as an Executive Director and as the Chairman of the Board and 
was careful to ensure that he did not perform one role at the 
expense of the other. The Senior Independent Director 
supported him in this and acted as a sounding board for the 
Executive Chairman when required. KCOM Group PLC 
Annual report and accounts 2013/14 33
Directors’ report
UK Corporate Governance Code
Apart from the exception noted opposite, the Board considers that 
it has complied with all the detailed provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code throughout the year ended 31 March 2014. 
Since 1 April 2014, following Graham Holden’s appointment as 
Chairman of the Board, there are currently two Non-Executive Directors 
and three Executive Directors which is in breach of provision B.1.2 of the code, 
which requires at least half of the Board excluding the Chairman to 
be independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board is actively seeking 
a new Non-Executive Director to correct this imbalance. In addition, 
Kevin Walsh has chosen not to stand for re-election at the AGM which 
will reduce the number of Executive Directors to two. In addition, provision 
C.3.1 of the code requires the Audit Committee membership to be made 
up of at least three independent Non-Executive Directors. Since 1 April 2014 
the Group has therefore been in breach of this requirement, but will 
rectify this when the new Non-Executive Director is appointed to 
the Board.
The Board as a whole is committed entirely to the principle of achieving 
and maintaining a high standard of corporate governance. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code is available on the Financial Reporting 
Council website at www.frc.org.uk.
How the Board operates
The Board has eight scheduled meetings a year, with other adhoc 
meetings held as needed. During the year, the Board met 10 times. 
The two additional meetings were specifically held to review the details 
of a significant sales contract and to review progress in relation to a 
large-scale internal project. Attendance at the meetings during the year 
is shown in the table opposite. Five of the meetings were preceded the 
evening before by an informal meeting, allowing more time to debate 
issues in depth.
At each meeting the Board considers all aspects of Group performance, 
including past performance and the future long-term success and 
strategic aims of the Group.
The Board agenda is set each month by the Chairman with input from 
the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary. In addition, any of 
the Non-Executive Directors can request a matter to be added to the 
agenda at any time.
The Board receives reports each month on financial performance, people 
matters, investor relations, governance, compliance and risk. These 
reports are circulated every month, regardless of whether or not a Board 
meeting is scheduled. There are also regular updates on key projects and 
strategic programmes and regular reports on health, safety and 
environmental matters and other areas of corporate responsibility.
Board meetings are held at various KCOM Group sites throughout the 
year and the Board seeks to regularly meet with senior management 
from the four brands to gain further insight into the day-to-day 
operation of the business and the key risks and opportunities facing 
each part of the business.
There is a schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board which is reviewed 
and updated each year. This schedule requires that specific matters 
relating to budgets, strategy, performance against objectives, financial 
reporting, internal controls, communications, remuneration and governance, 
along with any proposed changes to business operations or the 
structure and capital of the Company, are referred to the Board for 
consideration and approval.
The Board reviews also contractual clauses escalated to the Board 
through our contracting risk framework and business cases escalated 
in accordance with our Group-wide delegations of authority.
The Board considers the role of the Company Secretary to be pivotal in 
ensuring that the Group and the Board has the right governance in place 
and that Board processes follow best practice. Our Company Secretary, 
Kathy Smith, was appointed to the role in 2010 and has been with the 
Group for over eight years. She is a Chartered Accountant and Graduate 
member of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.
The Company Secretary meets with each of the Directors individually 
as necessary to discuss governance-related matters and provides a 
governance report to the Board on a monthly basis. The Directors are 
able also to obtain independent professional advice at the Group’s 
expense whenever necessary.

Corporate governance continued
The balance of the Board
The Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing the balance of 
the Board to ensure that it continues to meet the current and future 
requirements of the Group.
There is a Board Appointments policy in place, which sets out the 
procedure that will be followed in the event of a Board vacancy being 
identified, along with the approach of the Board to diversity.
The key principle set out in the policy is that the Board will seek always 
to appoint on merit, in line with the current and foreseeable future 
requirements of the Group. The Board recognises the benefits of diversity 
of all types, including gender diversity, and will aim always to develop 
the diversity of the Board, while remaining true to the key principle of 
appointing on merit. The Board is currently actively seeking a new 
independent Non-Executive Director and has specifically requested that 
there should be female candidates on the shortlist. The Board has 
committed to appoint at least one female director to the Board by the 
time of the AGM in 2015, whether it is through this next appointment or 
an additional future appointment.
The Board Appointments policy states also that the Nomination 
Committee will ensure that it only uses executive search firms that have 
signed up to the voluntary Code of Conduct addressing gender diversity 
and best practice, that female applicants are given the same 
consideration and opportunity as male applicants and that gender 
diversity is considered specifically when drawing up a list of 
potential candidates.
In addition, through the Board Appointments policy, the Board has 
committed to:
 I continue to seek to identify and develop the talented individuals 
in the Group, regardless of gender;
 I review regularly the proportion of women at each level in the 
organisation to ensure that equal opportunities are being presented 
to individuals at every level; and
 I ensure always that there is a confidential way in which concerns 
can be raised without fear of repercussion if anyone, regardless of 
gender, has a concern about the opportunities available to them.
While we do not have currently any female representation on the 
Group’s Board of Directors, 35 per cent of our senior management team 
is female. This is broadly comparable with the proportion of women 
across the Group as a whole, which sits at 37 per cent. 
Training and development
The Board receives monthly updates on governance-related matters 
and more formal training where appropriate. Potential training needs are 
discussed as part of individual performance evaluation, plus each Director 
is given the opportunity to flag any additional training requirements which 
they may have identified as part of the annual Board evaluation process.
Performance evaluation
For the previous 10 years the Board has undertaken a formal internal 
process to evaluate the effectiveness of its own performance, as well 
as that of its various Committees. Following the admission of the Group 
back into the FTSE 350 in September 2011, the Board wishes to comply 
with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code to perform 
an externally facilitated evaluation in 2014. Given the changes to the 
Board that were announced in November 2013, which came into effect 
on 1 April 2014, it was decided to delay this external review until the new 
Board structure was in place. The review is therefore currently underway 
and is being facilitated by Independent Audit Limited, who do not provide 
any other services to the Group.
In addition to the evaluation process, the Executive Chairman met 
with each Board member individually during the year to discuss their 
own performance and the Non-Executive Directors met separately to 
discuss the performance of the Executive Chairman. The feedback 
from this meeting was then passed on to the Executive Chairman by 
the Senior Independent Director. The individual evaluation process will 
continue under the new Chairman, with feedback to the Non-Executive 
Chairman again being provided by the Senior Independent Director. 
The Non-Executive Directors have regular dialogue with each other 
concerning Board matters and the Executive Chairman met with the 
Non-Executive Directors, without the other Directors present, at regular 
intervals during the year. The Non-Executive Directors also met formally 
during the year without any of the Executive Directors present to 
discuss matters, including the performance of the Executive Chairman.
In 2013 the areas of focus that were identified through the Board evaluation process were:
Area identified What have we done?
Succession planning at both a Board 
and senior management level.
Succession planning at a Board level has been much discussed during the year as a result of the 
Board changes that have been announced. At a senior management level there has also been a 
greater focus and it has been agreed that this will be a regular area for Board discussion in the future. 
Future brand strategy in relation to 
changing customer requirements as 
a result of developing technology.
There have been regular brand strategy updates provided to the Board throughout the 
year, including presentations from each of the brand Managing Directors. Future customer 
requirements are frequently discussed, as well as new developments in technology.

Board Committees
The Board has established and delegated specific responsibilities to the 
following Committees. Each Committee reports back to the Board after 
each meeting and minutes of Committee meetings are circulated to all 
Board members, where appropriate, to ensure that the whole Board is 
aware of the matters considered by the Committees.
Audit Committee
The membership and attendance at Committee meetings during 
the year is shown in the table above. Details of the role of the Audit 
Committee are given on pages 38 to 40. From 1 April 2014 Graham 
Holden stepped down from the Audit Committee. The Board is currently 
actively seeking a new independent Non-Executive Director, who will 
join the Audit Committee on appointment.
Nomination Committee
The membership and attendance at Committee meetings during the 
year is shown in the table above.
From 1 April 2014 Tony Illsley stepped down as Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee and Graham Holden has been appointed as 
Committee Chairman in his place. Tony will continue as a committee 
member going forward, alongside Martin Towers. 
The Nomination Committee meets as often as required and is responsible 
for reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and ensuring 
that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board is right for 
the Group, both in terms of the current challenges and opportunities facing 
the Group and the skills and expertise that are expected to be needed on 
the Board in the future. The approach of the Nomination Committee to 
diversity on the Board is noted on the page opposite.
When Board vacancies arise, the Nomination Committee is responsible 
for preparing a description of the role and capabilities required for 
a particular appointment and then identifying and nominating 
candidates for the approval of the Board. In order to identify suitable 
candidates the Committee uses open advertising or the services 
of external advisors to facilitate the search, where appropriate.
The Board is currently seeking a new Non-Executive Director and 
appointed CTPartners as the executive search firm to lead the search. 
The Nomination Committee provided the criteria for the required 
candidate to CTPartners and specifically requested that there should 
be female candidates on the shortlist. CTPartners does not provide any 
other services to the Group. 
During the year, the decision was taken to appoint Graham Holden as 
Chairman of the Board. This was a recommendation to the Board from 
the Nomination Committee, following consultations with our largest 
shareholders and detailed discussions relating to the skills and 
experience required from the Chairman.
It was decided following these discussions, and taking into account his 
existing experience of the Group, that Graham was the best candidate 
for the role and that an external search would therefore not be 
beneficial for the Group. 
The Committee is responsible also for considering succession planning 
for the Directors and for key senior management across the Group, 
although this is a matter considered also by the full Board.
The Nomination Committee reviews annually the time required from 
each of the Directors to perform their role effectively. Following this 
review in the year, the Committee is satisfied that each of the Directors 
has committed sufficient time during the year to fulfil their duties as 
Directors of the Company.
The Committee reviews the re-appointment of all of the Directors 
standing for re-election at the AGM, giving regard to their performance 
and ability to continue to contribute to the requirements of the Board. 
The Nomination Committee then makes recommendations to the 
Board on whether each Director should be put forward for re-election.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are in line with the recommendations 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the ICSA Guidance on Terms 
of Reference for Nomination Committees. Copies of the Terms of 
Reference are available from the Company Secretary and are on our 
website, www.kcomplc.com.

Business model and key performance indicators
Details of our business model can be found on pages 7 to 9 and our key 
performance indicators are on pages 16 and 17.
Proposal to re-appoint the external auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have advised of their willingness to 
continue in office and have confirmed their continued independence. 
Following consideration of the relationship with the external auditors, 
as described on page 40, the Audit Committee has recommended to 
the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are re-appointed and a 
resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the AGM. They have 
provided an independent audit opinion on these accounts which can be 
found on pages 61 to 63.
Powers of the Directors
The business of the Company is managed by the Directors, who may 
exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to the provisions of the 
Articles of Association, relevant statutes and any special resolution of 
the Company.
The Articles of Association give the Directors the power to authorise 
conflicts of interest in relation to transactions or arrangements with the 
Company, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. Conflicts of 
interest are a standing agenda item at Board meetings and each 
Director proposes any potential conflicts for consideration as soon as 
they become aware of them. The Director with the potential conflict is 
excluded from the vote to authorise the transaction or arrangement.
Any conflicts that are authorised are then logged on a register, along 
with details of any specific terms imposed upon authorisation. Internal 
controls are in place to ensure that transactions or arrangements which 
may lead to a potential conflict of interest are conducted on an arm’s 
length basis.
Relations with shareholders
We place a great deal of importance on communicating with our 
shareholders and understanding their views. Our Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer meet regularly with our institutional 
shareholders to discuss the strategy, performance and governance 
of the Company and to obtain feedback. During the year, meetings 
have been held with 26 such shareholders. There are also general 
presentations following the half year and final results 
announcements each year.
Feedback from meetings with shareholders is included as part 
of the monthly report to the Board and discussed at each Board 
meeting, along with details of any analyst reports, to ensure that 
each of our Directors has a clear understanding of the views of 
our shareholders. Our Non-Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Chairman are available to meet face-to-face with our institutional 
shareholders if requested to do so, although no such requests have 
been received during the year.
A large number of our individual shareholders live in the Hull and 
East Yorkshire region and, as a Group; we are very much involved in 
local life in the area. More information about our community 
activities is on page 26. We believe that being a part of local life 
enables us to learn more about our local shareholders and the 
issues that matter to them.
We consider our AGM to be an important means of communication 
between our shareholders and Directors. All of our Directors are 
available at the AGM to answer questions and we seek to encourage 
shareholder participation by inviting questions in advance.
We use electronic voting at our AGM each year. The results of voting, 
including the proxy votes lodged, are shown to shareholders in the 
meeting and are made available subsequently on our website.
All of our Company announcements are published 
on our website, www.kcomplc.com, together with 
presentation materials and financial reports, so 
that all of our shareholders can keep up to date 
with our news. KCOM Group PLC

Managing risk 
effectively is key 
to everything 
that we do.
We believe that by 
understanding and 
anticipating our risks we 
can manage them properly; 
we therefore do not seek to 
eliminate risk but instead we 
take considered risks where 
necessary to help the business 
remain competitive and to 
achieve our objectives.
Risk management is built 
into all our processes. We also 
have a Risk team, which has 
specific responsibility for 
health, safety, environmental 
and legal risks, internal audit, 
insurance, governance and all 
matters relating to standards 
and compliance.
We recognise that our internal 
control systems can provide 
only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Risk management framework
We have a risk management framework in place to help us to formally identify, assess, 
measure, manage and monitor our key risks. We define key risks to be anything that may 
prevent us from meeting our objectives. The framework has been developed in accordance 
with guidance from the Financial Reporting Council and provides us with a single picture 
of the threats and uncertainties we face. This enables the Board and senior management 
to make appropriate decisions to manage the key risks.

Risk management responsibilities
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility for deciding the acceptable level 
of risk that the Group may take to achieve its objectives. It is responsible 
also for ensuring that the Group maintains sound internal control and risk 
management systems, as well as reviewing the effectiveness of those 
systems. In order to do this, the Board receives regular reports from senior 
management, the Internal Audit team and the external auditors, via the 
Audit Committee, on the effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
and risk management. The Board is satisfied that the systems are 
embedded within the day-to-day activities of the business and cover all 
material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls 
and that the Group continues to be compliant with the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code relating to internal control.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee consists of senior management representatives 
from across the Group and meets bi-monthly to consider all types 
of risk. External advisors and subject-matter experts from within the 
Group are invited to attend the meetings as and when appropriate 
to provide insight or expertise on particular risk topics.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing progress in mitigating risks 
and discussing and agreeing actions relating to any new risks that have 
been identified. The Committee prepares a report for the Board after 
each meeting. KCOM Group PLC

Audit Committee
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the Board and is 
responsible for reviewing all aspects of the financial reporting of the 
Group and all aspects of internal control. In doing so, the Committee 
represents the interests of the shareholders of the Group in relation to 
the integrity of information and the effectiveness of the audit processes 
in place.
Composition
The Audit Committee during the year under review has consisted of the 
three Non-Executive Directors. Further information on the membership 
and meeting attendance is on page 35. From 1 April 2014 Graham 
Holden was appointed to the role of Non-Executive Chairman and 
consequently stepped down from the Audit Committee, in accordance 
with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
Board is currently seeking an additional Non-Executive Director and, 
when appointed, the new Non-Executive Director will become a 
member of the Audit Committee.
The Committee is chaired by Martin Towers, who has significant 
recent financial experience. He is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales and has held a number of senior 
finance roles, including working as Group Finance Director at Kelda Group 
PLC until 2008. The Board considers therefore that he has the relevant 
financial experience to fulfil the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Committee meetings are also attended by the Executive Directors, the 
Group Financial Controller, the Company Secretary, the Head of Internal 
Audit and representatives from the external auditors. The external 
auditors meet also with individual members of the Audit Committee 
during the year, without the other attendees present. The Head of 
Internal Audit also meets separately with the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee without the other attendees present.
Meetings
There were three meetings held in the year; in June, November and 
March. The June meeting was used to review the year end external 
audit and year end financial reporting, the November meeting to 
consider the half year review and financial reporting and the March 
meeting to consider the planning for the year end.
Each meeting included agenda items relating to internal audit, financial 
reporting and external audit. The areas discussed under each item are 
noted in the table below:
Area Discussion
Internal audit The internal audit agenda item focuses on the audits 
performed in the period, including any significant issues 
identified. A report setting out previous audit issues raised 
and the progress made to mitigate the issues is also 
discussed at each meeting. A review of the internal audit 
plan for the period to the next Audit Committee meeting 
also takes place.
Financial 
reporting
The Group Financial Controller talks through the key 
judgement areas in relation to financial reporting and sets 
out the decisions made and the rationale behind these. 
These are covered in more detail on page 20.
External audit The representatives from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP set 
out the audit approach, the key audit risks, an overview of 
internal controls and a view on the key audit and accounting 
matters, as well as how PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
ensures its continuing independence from the Group.
Each year the Audit Committee is also responsible for:
 I seeking the view of the external auditors on any accounting 
judgements made in the year;
 I considering the consistency and appropriateness of the accounting 
policies adopted;
 I reviewing the financial statements of the Group and the clarity of the 
disclosures made, although the ultimate responsibility for reviewing 
and approving the annual report and financial statements remains 
with the Board;
 I reviewing the adequacy of the whistleblowing procedures in place 
to enable employees and third parties to raise concerns in confidence, 
as well as the effectiveness and independence of any investigations 
undertaken as a result of such concerns being raised;
 I reviewing the procedures in place for the detection of fraud and the 
prevention of bribery across the Group; and
 I overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, as noted 
in more detail on page 40.
 
  The Committee’s Terms of Reference are in line with the 
recommendations in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and 
Administrators Guidance on Terms of Reference for 
Audit Committees. Copies of the Terms of Reference are 
available from the Company Secretary and are on our 
website at www.kcomplc.com.

Significant issues relating to the financial statements
The specific issues considered by the Audit Committee in the year under review, in relation to the financial statements, are shown in the table below. 
Nature of the issue
How the Committee was satisfied with the 
treatment adopted by management
Any changes arising from discussion by the 
Committee
Pension accounting assumptions
Pension accounting is complex and there are a number 
of assumptions that have to be made, which can have a 
significant impact on the valuation of scheme liabilities.
This is a recurring matter.
The approach to the assumptions made was in line 
with previous years and the Committee was satisfied 
that this was satisfactory given the reasonable nature 
of the previous assumptions and the fact that there 
were no reasons identified to require a revision to 
these assumptions.
The assumptions were debated by the Committee.
No changes were made as the Committee concluded 
that it was in agreement with the treatment adopted 
by management.
Capitalisation of intangible assets on internal projects
There is a significant internal project currently ongoing 
to implement a new back office system. Costs relating 
to this are being capitalised in line with accounting 
standards but there have been judgements made 
in relation to the proportion of internal salaries 
that should be capitalised for this project and the 
recoverability of the carrying value of the asset.
This will be a recurring matter while there are significant 
internal projects ongoing.
The approach adopted by management in relation to 
the capitalisation of internal salaries was consistent 
with that previously adopted for other IT projects.
Management also noted that the expected benefits 
of the project were still believed to be in line with 
the original business case and therefore there was 
no trigger to indicate a potential impairment of the 
asset carrying value.
The Committee challenged the approach to the 
capitalisation and the proposed useful economic life 
and concluded that it was in agreement with the 
treatment adopted by management. 
Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets
Testing goodwill and other intangible assets for 
potential impairment is complex and requires a number 
of management estimates to be made, which inevitably 
require judgement.
This is a recurring matter.
A full impairment assessment was performed at the year 
end and this was discussed in detail by the Committee, 
along with the assumptions made and the sensitivities in 
relation to the assumptions. It was concluded that there 
was no indication of impairment and that the 
assumptions made were reasonable.
The Committee challenged the assumptions and 
concluded that no changes were required. 
Accounting for judgements in significant contracts
There are a number of significant contracts in place 
within the Group, some of which have changed during 
the year. The contract changes require some management 
judgement in relation to how to account for the changes.
This is a matter that is specific to the year under review.
The rationale for each judgement was clearly set out 
to the Committee and discussed at length. It was 
concluded that the rationale for each was reasonable 
and consistent with previous years, where applicable.
The Committee discussed the rationale for each area 
of judgement and agreed with the rationale applied 
by management. 
Exceptional costs
Management judgement around when costs should be 
treated as exceptional is always an area for review.
This is a recurring matter.
There is an established and well-defined policy in place 
in relation to the classification of costs as exceptional 
and this has not changed in the year. Management had 
followed this policy and therefore the Committee was 
satisfied with the treatment adopted by management.
No changes were made as the Committee was in 
agreement with the treatment adopted by management. KCOM Group PLC

Audit Committee continued
External audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the relationship with 
the external auditors to ensure that the external auditors continue to be 
independent, objective and effective in their work, as well as 
considering the re-appointment of the auditors each year.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed as auditors in 2006 
following a comprehensive tender process. Following a partner rotation, 
the current audit partner, Ian Morrison, was appointed to the audit in 
2011. Each year the Committee considers the continued independence 
of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the external audit 
process, to determine whether to recommend to the Board that the 
current auditors be re-appointed, also taking into consideration the 
desire to comply with the requirement of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code to tender the external audit at least every 10 years and the 
transitional arrangements in place in relation to this.
There are no contractual obligations in place which would restrict the 
choice of external auditors by the Committee.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
audit process in the year through the reports received from the external 
auditors and the close working of the internal audit team with the 
external auditors. The Committee has concluded that the external 
audit process was effective and is satisfied that the scope of the 
audit is appropriate and that significant judgements have been 
robustly challenged.
In addition PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has formally confirmed its 
continued independence and the measures they have taken to ensure 
that they comply with best practice and professional and regulatory 
requirements in this area. The Committee believes that audit partner 
rotation is a significant factor in ensuring continued independence and 
objectivity by reducing the risk of familiarity while retaining the detailed 
understanding of the business which the external auditors have gained 
over time.
We have an ‘Engagement of External Auditors’ policy which covers the 
selection of firms to perform non-audit work. This policy excludes the 
auditors from providing certain services, such as internal audit services, 
litigation support, remuneration advice and legal advice services. All 
other non-audit work is assessed separately and is awarded to the firm 
considered best suited to perform the work. Any such work with a fee 
greater than 25 per cent of the annual audit fee must be approved by 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee before the external auditors may 
be appointed.
During the year the fee for the external audit of the Group and its 
subsidiaries, along with other services pursuant to legislation, was 
£263,000 (2013: £228,000). In addition to this, the external auditors 
provided services to the value of £111,000 (2013: £21,000) relating to 
tax advisory services and pensions-related work. In these areas the 
auditors were considered the most appropriate firm to perform the work.
Risk management and internal control
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems through the work performed by the internal and 
external auditors and reports to the Board on the effectiveness of such 
systems. The internal control and risk management systems have not 
changed during the year and the Committee is satisfied that any audit 
issues raised by either the internal or external auditors are being 
adequately followed up and closed down on a timely basis.
Internal audit
Our Internal Audit team consists of two qualified accountants, both 
with a ‘Big Four’ background. The team performs financial, operational 
and compliance audits, assessing each potential audit area according 
to the risk associated with it and the level of assurance already in place; 
this then enables the audit to be appropriately prioritised and built into 
the audit plan as necessary. The audit plan is brought to each Audit 
Committee meeting, where it is considered and approved.
The internal auditors report to the Audit Committee at each meeting 
on the adequacy and effectiveness of the financial, operational and 
compliance controls in place across the Group. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
internal audit team and does this through reviewing the internal audit 
reports presented to the Committee and through the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee meeting separately with the Head of Internal Audit 
outside of the Committee.
The Committee also reviews the adequacy of management responses 
to the audit issues raised and monitors the closure of issues on a timely 
basis through a regular report from the internal audit team.
The internal and external audit teams work closely together to ensure 
that all key risk areas are covered and that the work performed by one 
team feeds into the work of the other.
Financial risk management
Each part of our business produces an annual budget which is reviewed 
by senior management and ultimately approved by the Board. A 
longer-term six year plan is also in place which is updated annually and 
approved by the Board to enable it to have a clear longer-term view of 
financial projections.
We also prepare a quarterly forecast and performance against budget and 
quarterly forecast is monitored at monthly senior management meetings 
and reported to, and reviewed by, the Board each month. Further information 
about the financial risk management policies in place, and in particular the 
way in which credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency 
risk are managed, is in note 26 to the accounts.
Controls around consolidation
The basis of consolidation for the financial statements is detailed in note 
2 to the accounts. Strong controls are in place around the process for 
preparing consolidated accounts. The work of consolidation is performed 
by experienced, qualified accountants and a review of the consolidation 
forms part of the audit work performed by our external auditors.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out 
on pages 18 and 19 of the Strategic report.

General information
General information is provided in the note 1 of the financial statements.
Disclosure of all relevant information to auditors
The Directors who approved this report are satisfied that, as far as they 
are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined in the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
Each of the Directors has taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
Directors
The names and biographical details of our Directors as at 31 March 2014 
are on pages 30 and 31. Further information regarding the Directors 
who served during the year can be found on pages 44 to 60 in the 
Remuneration report.
Political donations
No political donations were made by the Group during the year 
(2013: £Nil).
Employees
Our people make all the difference to the service we can provide 
to our customers and enable us to differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors. We therefore take great care to have employment 
strategies in place that drive business performance but also help our 
people to develop to their full potential. Our employment policies are 
designed to provide equal opportunities irrespective of age, disability, 
ethnicity, gender, gender reassignment, marital status and civil 
partnership, nationality, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion 
and belief and sexual orientation.
All employees, whether part-time or full-time, temporary or permanent, 
are treated fairly and equally. We select employees for employment, 
promotion, training or other matters affecting their employment 
on the basis of aptitude and ability.
We take every opportunity to involve and consult with our employees and 
we believe that employee involvement is an essential contributor to the 
development of our business. Our Executive Directors regularly visit our 
different office locations to meet with our employees, provide updates on 
the performance of the Group and to receive suggestions and feedback, 
through both roadshow presentations and informal meetings.
Regular video and news updates are provided to all employees through 
our intranet, and a weekly round-up bulletin via email to keep them 
informed of activities and Group performance. There is also a monthly 
briefing document for managers to share with their teams.
In March 2013 we undertook our second Group-wide employee survey 
in two years, to obtain feedback on a range of topics. The results of this 
were fed back to employees and action plans were developed to 
address the key matters raised. 
We encourage our employees to become shareholders by offering a 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) as we believe this is one opportunity to 
encourage greater employee engagement. More information about this 
can be found on page 59.
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into 
ordinary shares of 10 pence.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
In a general meeting of the Company voting is as follows:
 I on a show of hands, every member present in person shall 
have one vote;
 I on a show of hands, every proxy present who has been duly 
appointed by one or more members shall have one vote; and
 I on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall 
have one vote for every share of which he or she is the holder.
A member is not entitled to vote in respect of any share in the capital 
of the Company held by him or her, if there are sums payable to the 
Company in respect of such share which remain unpaid.
Full details of the deadline for exercising voting rights in respect of the 
resolutions to be considered at the AGM to be held on 29 July 2014 are 
set out in the Notice of Meeting.
All dividends are paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the

register at the date at which the dividend is declared, or at such other 
date as determined by the Directors or by an ordinary resolution of 
the Company.
If the Company is wound up, the liquidator, with the sanction of a 
special resolution of the Company or any other sanction required by 
law, may divide the whole or any part of the assets of the Company 
among the shareholders and may determine how the division of the 
assets will be carried out.
Transfer of shares
All transfers of uncertificated shares must be made in accordance with, 
and be subject to, the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and in 
accordance with any arrangements made by the Board.
All transfers of certificated shares must be in writing in a form which has 
been approved by the Directors; this is known as ‘the Instrument of 
Transfer’. The Instrument of Transfer must be signed by, or on behalf of, 
the transferor and the transferor will remain as the holder of the share 
until the name of the transferee is entered into the share register.
The Directors may refuse to register the transfer of any share which is 
not fully paid or which is in favour of more than four persons jointly. The 
Directors may also refuse to recognise an Instrument of Transfer if it is 
not lodged at the Company’s registered office or at any other place 
which the Directors have determined.
If the Directors refuse to register a transfer they will send to the transferee 
a notice of the refusal and the Instrument of Transfer within two months 
of the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company.

Allotment of shares
At the AGM in 2013, the Company was authorised by the members to 
allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £17,220,130. 
Authority was also given at the same time for the partial disapplication 
of pre-emption rights, up to a maximum aggregate value of £2,583,019. 
As at the date of this report no shares had been allotted under 
this authority.
Repurchase of shares
At the AGM in 2013, the Company was authorised by members to 
purchase its own shares, up to a maximum of 51,660,391. During the 
year, the Company did not purchase any of its own shares.
The Company funds Employee Share Trusts (ESTs) to meet its obligations 
under the Company’s share schemes. During the year the ESTs purchased 
12,043,000 (2013: 15,130,000) shares on the London Stock Exchange at 
a cost of £1,778,000 (2013: £11,053,000) with a nominal value of 
£1,204,300 (2013: £1,513,000). These shares represent 2.33 per cent of 
the called-up share capital and are held in trust until they vest; therefore 
the purchase of these shares does not reduce the share capital in issue. 
The total number of shares held in trust to meet obligations under the 
Company’s share schemes is:
000’s of shares
As at 1 April 2013 9,524
As at 31 March 2014 205
Further details around the purchase of shares in the year are set out 
in note 25 to the financial statements.
Shares held by ESTs
The trustees of the Kingston Communications 2000 EST and the 
Kingston Communications All Employee Share Plan vote any shares held 
in the ESTs as they wish, having due regard to the interests of the 
employees as potential beneficiaries.
There are two other ESTs, the Kingston Communications Qualifying 
Employee Share Ownership Trust and the KCOM Group PLC Employee 
Benefit Trust, that are currently dormant and hold no shares.
Significant agreements – change of control
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of 
a change of control of the Company:
 I under our £200 million multi-currency revolving facility agreement 
dated 4 June 2014, the Company must notify Lloyds Bank PLC, the 
Agent of the agreement, within seven days of becoming aware of 
a change of control of the Company. Any bank or financial institution 
named within the facility agreement may then notify the Agent 
within seven days that they wish to cancel their commitments. 
The Agent must then give at least 21 days’ notice to the Company 
of this and all outstanding amounts due to that bank or financial 
institution will become immediately due and payable. For these 
purposes, a ‘change of control’ occurs if any person or group of 
persons acting in concert gains control of the Company; and
 I the Company’s share schemes, details of which are contained 
in the Remuneration report on pages 44 to 60, contain provisions 
which take effect in the event of a change of control, as a result 
of which options and awards may vest and become exercisable. 
The provisions do not entitle participants to a greater interest in 
the shares of the Company than that created by the initial grant 
or award under the relevant scheme.
The Company does not have any agreements with any Director or 
employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover.
Strategic report
Pursuant to section 414c of the Companies Act 2006 the Strategic 
report on pages 2 to 29 contains disclosures in relation to future 
developments, dividends, financial risk management and the disclosure 
of the Greenhouse Gas emissions for which the Company is responsible. 
Annual General Meeting
Our AGM will be held at the KC Stadium, Hull, on Tuesday 29 July 2014 
at 11.00am. The Notice of Meeting accompanies this annual report 
and is also available on our Group website at www.kcomplc.com. 
Four resolutions will be proposed as special business. Explanatory 
notes on these resolutions are set out in the Notice of Meeting.
The Directors consider that all the resolutions proposed are in the best 
interests of the Company and it is their recommendation that 
shareholders support these proposals as they intend to do so in respect 
of their own holdings.

Directors’ report
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU). Under company law, the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 I select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 I make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 I state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 I prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s website, www.kcomplc.com. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are listed on pages 
30 and 31 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 I the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and 
Company; and
 I  the Strategic report and Directors’ report contained in the annual report 
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group and Company, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Conclusion on the annual report
The Board is responsible for reviewing the annual report and, 
after consideration, has concluded that the annual report, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides 
the necessary information for shareholders to assess performance, 
business model and strategy. In reaching this conclusion, the Board 
has considered the different types of shareholders that the Group has, 
the reports and presentations that the Board has received during the 
year and the reports submitted to the Audit Committee during the 
year by both the internal and external auditors and combined this 
with the Board’s collective knowledge of the business, gained through 
both formal and informal meetings and personal interactions across 
the Group at all levels.
Amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association may 
be made by passing a special resolution at a general meeting of 
the shareholders.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that, having reviewed the Group’s budget and 
forecasts along with the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group, they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly 
the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
This report has been reviewed and approved by the Board of KCOM 
Group PLC.

18 June 2014 DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Remuneration report
Dear shareholder
This has been a relatively quiet year for the Remuneration Committee 
in terms of remuneration decisions; there have been no long-term 
incentive schemes vesting in the year and there have been no 
significant changes to the Remuneration policy in the year.
This is the first year of the new disclosure requirements in relation 
to remuneration and therefore the Committee has spent time reviewing 
the requirements and the disclosures made to ensure that we present 
our information as clearly and fully as possible.
The Committee has focused during the year on reviewing the 
Remuneration policy in place and ensuring that this meets the 
requirements of the business, aligns with the expectations of our 
shareholders and also enables us to continue to attract and retain 
the right individuals to the Board.
The philosophy of the Remuneration Committee is to reward 
performance fairly, which normally means paying around the median 
market rate for good performance, providing the opportunity for 
greater rewards for extraordinary performance and ensuring that 
we do not pay additional reward where performance is below par. The 
Committee is mindful of the need for balance between risk and reward 
and has risk mitigation elements in place through clawback provisions 
and share ownership guidelines for Executive Directors.
Statement from the Chairmen of the Remuneration Committee
In looking at performance we consider both the current performance 
of the Group and the longer-term sustainability of the business. This 
is reflected through our policy to have an annual bonus linked to the 
performance of the Group in the year and a long-term incentive scheme 
that rewards Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance over a three 
year period. We ensure that the final decision over vesting of LTIP 
awards is dependent on the Committee agreeing that the performance 
of the Group over the three years is representative of the continued 
success of the business into the future.
Decisions made
There have been no pay increases for the Executive Directors since 
1 July 2011. In the meantime the performance of the Group has remained 
strong and the share price has moved from 77 .75 pence as at 30 June 2011 
to 99.2 pence as at 31 March 2014. Across the Group, all employees have 
been eligible for a pay award, based on performance and the market rate 
for the role which they perform. The average pay award given to employees 
will be 1.66 per cent, which will take effect from 1 July 2014. All employees, 
other than the Executive Directors and senior management, also received 
a two per cent increase on 1 July 2012. Taking these factors into 
consideration, along with individual performance, the Remuneration 
Committee has proposed that an increase of 2.75 per cent is awarded to 
both Bill Halbert and Paul Simpson, with effect from 1 July 2014. The same 
award has not been proposed for Kevin Walsh as he has indicated his plans 
to retire from the company in the summer of 2014 and will not be standing 
for re-election at the AGM.
“The philosophy of the Remuneration Committee is to reward 
performance fairly, which normally means paying around the 
median market rate for good performance, providing the 
opportunity for greater rewards for extraordinary performance 
and ensuring that we do not pay additional reward where 
performance is below par.”

Directors’ report
The annual bonus scheme for the forthcoming year has been reviewed 
by the Committee and it has been agreed to retain the current metrics 
operated, with a slight increase in the targets for the 2014/15 year, 
which are set out in more detail on pages 52 and 53. During the year 
the Group achieved EBITDA above the target level required to trigger 
a bonus payment and bonus payments for the year of 14 per cent of 
the on-target bonus entitlement have been awarded. The Committee 
has considered this and believes that this is a fair reflection of the 
performance of the business in the year; it is also consistent with the 
average percentage of bonus entitlement that has been triggered for 
bonus scheme participants across the Group.
No LTIP awards were due to vest based on performance ending in, 
or substantially ending in, 2013/14. During the year new awards 
were granted under the LTIP scheme to each of the Executive Directors, 
equivalent to 100 per cent of base salary. This is consistent with awards 
made in the previous year and was considered by the Committee to 
reflect the continued good performance of the Group, and to provide 
a longer-term incentive to the Executive Directors as these awards will 
not vest until 2016 and are dependent on TSR measured over a three 
year performance period from the date of grant. The Committee 
is happy that TSR remains appropriate as the performance measure 
for the LTIP scheme.
Change of Committee Chairman
From 1 April 2014, Graham Holden has been appointed as Chairman 
of KCOM Group PLC, which means that he has had to step down from 
the role of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in order to 
comply with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Graham remains a member of the Committee and will provide support 
to the new Chairman. From 1 April 2014, Tony Illsley has stepped up 
to take on the role of Committee Chairman. Tony has significant 
experience as a Non-Executive Director and has performed the 
role of Remuneration Committee Chairman at three other listed 
companies, therefore bringing considerable experience to the role. 
The Board is currently actively seeking a new Non-Executive Director 
and on appointment the new Director may take on the role of Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee, subject to experience.
Director retirement
On 26 November 2013, Kevin Walsh indicated to the Board that he 
will be retiring from the Group in the summer of 2014 and he will 
therefore not be standing for re-election at the AGM. The policy of 
the Committee is to reward retiring colleagues fairly for the period for 
which they work, whilst avoiding significant payments in lieu of notice 
wherever possible. In line with the policy, it has been agreed with Kevin 
that he will sign a new service contract in the summer of 2014 which 
will reduce his notice period from 12 months to three months, therefore 
relieving the Group from the obligation to make a 12 month payment in 
lieu of notice from the date on which he formally tenders his resignation 
and ensuring that his notice period does not extend beyond 26 November 
2014, which would be 12 months from the date of his initial indication.
In order to ensure an orderly succession, Kevin continues to offer support 
to the KC brand and the rest of the business and will continue to do so 
until late summer 2014.
New reporting requirements
Last year we adopted early some of the new reporting requirements 
in relation to remuneration. This is the first year in which we have been 
required to comply fully with the new disclosure requirements and we 
welcome the move towards greater transparency and clearer reporting. 
Views of the shareholders
The Committee recognises the importance of taking account of 
shareholders’ views and believes they can add considerable value to 
the process of policy formulation. Any feedback would therefore be 
welcomed and may be directed to the Chairman of the Committee or 
to our Company Secretary, Kathy Smith.

Executive Directors’ policy table
Element and how it supports 
the KCOM Group strategy How does this operate and what is the maximum that may be paid? What performance measures are used and why? Are there any provisions to recover sums paid?
Base salary
Setting the base salary at the right 
level enables us to attract and retain 
the right individual for the role, whilst 
reflecting appropriately the status, 
responsibility and experience of 
the individual.
Base salaries are normally reviewed at least annually. Salaries are typically set following comparison with broad industry 
based peer companies and companies of a similar size. We aim to pay salaries around the median; however we also take 
into account a number of other specific factors, including the experience and performance of the individual, the criticality 
of the individual to the success of the Group, pay and conditions throughout the Group and the wider economic climate.
Increases will not ordinarily exceed the general level of increase for the Group’s employees however, increases beyond 
those awarded to the Group’s employees may be awarded in certain circumstances, for example, where there is a change 
in responsibility, progression in the role, experience, or where there is a significant increase in the scale of the role or the size 
and/or complexity of the Group.
Details of the base salary for each of the Executive Directors are shown in the annual report on remuneration  
on pages 52 and 53.
No specific performance measures are used in relation to determining base salary, but individual and 
business performance are considered as part of the discussion when setting the base salary levels.
There are no provisions to recover any sums paid.
Benefits
Paying the right amount of benefits 
helps us to attract and retain the right 
individual for the role.
The provision of benefits is set based upon market practice at similar companies, taking into account also the benefits 
available to other employees across the Group.
The benefits available to all Executive Directors are:
 I private medical insurance for the Executive and their immediate family;
 I income protection;
 I life assurance;
 I car allowance of up to £16,000 per annum for the Chief Executive and £14,000 per annum for other Executive 
Directors, or an equivalent company car;
 I fully expensed fuel card; 
 I medical screening; and
 I the opportunity to participate in any all-employee share plans operated by the Company, in line with HMRC guidelines. 
 The cost of insured benefits may vary from year to year and there is no maximum level set. Additional benefits can be 
purchased through the flexible benefits arrangements available to all employees.
Benefits are not performance related. There are no provisions to recover any sums paid.
Retirement benefits
Retirement benefits are paid as part 
of a market competitive package 
which, in turn, helps us to attract and 
retain high calibre individuals.
All Executive Directors are entitled to receive an employer pension contribution of 20 per cent of base salary. This can 
either be paid as a contribution direct to the Group Stakeholder Pension Plan or as cash to the individual. Contributions 
to the Group Stakeholder Pension Plan are dependent on a minimum employee pension contribution of three per cent 
per annum.
Retirement benefits are not performance related. There are no provisions to recover any sums paid.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is designed 
to reward the achievement of 
stretching Group objectives and 
therefore drive operational excellence.
All payments are at the discretion of the Committee. Payments are considered and approved by the Committee and are 
payable annually following publication of the Group’s full year results. Up to 10 per cent of maximum bonus is dependent 
on achieving the threshold hurdle with sliding scale targets set for payments above this level.
Target performance receives up to 50 per cent of salary. Performance above-target results in a higher percentage up to a 
maximum of 100 per cent of salary.
The performance measures will be financial measures, such as EBITDA. The measures chosen will 
be those that the Committee believes most closely align Executive Director and shareholder interests 
and are important to the long-term success of the Group.
Clawback may be invoked for the annual bonus for:
 I material misstatement of the accounts;
 I error in assessing performance conditions; or
 I gross misconduct.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentive schemes are used 
to drive growth in shareholder value 
and to ensure that there is a direct link 
between reward and superior 
shareholder returns.
Awards are normally made annually and performance is measured over a three year period.
The plan rules state that a maximum of 150 per cent of salary per annum may be awarded (200 per cent of salary may 
be made in exceptional circumstances). In the first year of the policy awards will be made at 100 per cent of salary. In later 
years actual award levels will be disclosed in the Annual report on remuneration. 
The performance measure used in the LTIP is Total Shareholder Return (TSR). The Committee believes 
that a relative TSR measure offers a robust measure of performance over the long-term as it takes into 
account changes in the economic cycle, while maintaining a focus on shareholder returns.
KCOM Group’s TSR must rank at least median to the TSR performance of the companies within a 
comparator group. Performance at median would result in 25 per cent of the awards vesting, with 
performance between median and upper quartile resulting in vesting of awards on a straight-line basis 
with 100 per cent vesting at upper quartile performance.
In addition, there is an underpin that the Committee must be satisfied that the Group’s financial and 
non-financial performance over the performance period warrants the level of vesting, having regard to a 
number of factors such as share price progression, dividend policy and Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance.
Clawback may be invoked for the LTIP for:
 I material misstatement of the accounts;
 I error in assessing performance conditions; or
 I gross misconduct.
This Directors’ Remuneration report sets out details of the Remuneration 
policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors, describes the 
implementation of the policy and discloses the amounts paid for the 
year ended 31 March 2014. The report complies with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013 and has been prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules. 
Policy report
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration report sets out the proposed 
Directors’ Remuneration policy of the Group. The Policy report will be 
put to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 29 July 2014, in 
accordance with Section 439A of the Companies Act 2006. If approved, 
the policy will then take effect from that date. KCOM Group PLC

Policy overview
In designing the Remuneration policy for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee seeks to align the policy to the strategic objectives of the 
Group and reward strong performance to ensure the long-term success 
of the business, whilst not encouraging unnecessary risk taking or 
irresponsible behaviour.
The Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions of 
employees across the Group when setting the Remuneration policy for 
the Executive Directors, to ensure that these are aligned where appropriate.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when drawing up 
the Directors’ Remuneration policy; however, a regular employee satisfaction 
survey is conducted across the Group, which includes questions around 
remuneration. The latest survey was held in March 2013. The results of this 
are taken into consideration when making decisions around remuneration.
The Committee is always open to hearing the views of shareholders in 
relation to Directors’ remuneration and any views expressed will be 
considered as part of the process when setting the Remuneration policy. KCOM Group PLC

Policy report continued
Awards granted prior to the effective date
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy report, authority 
is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with 
current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders 
in previous Remuneration reports. Details of any payments to former 
Directors will be set out in the Annual report on remuneration as they arise. 
Discretion retained in operating incentive plans
The annual bonus plan and LTIP will be operated according to the rules 
of each respective plan and consistent with normal market practice and 
the Listing Rules. The quantum and performance targets applicable to 
awards will be within the parameters described above. Subject to that, 
the Committee has certain flexibility and the ability to exercise 
judgement in a number of regards, including:
 I who participates in the plans;
 I when to make awards and payments;
 I how to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and how 
much of an award should vest;
 I how to deal with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;
 I whether a Director is a good or bad leaver and whether and what 
proportion of awards vest at the time of leaving and at the original 
vesting date(s);
 I how and whether an award may be adjusted in certain circumstances 
(e.g. for a rights issue, corporate restructuring or special dividend); and 
 I what the weighting, measures and targets should be for the annual 
bonus and LTIP from year to year. 
The Committee also retains the discretion within the policy to adjust 
targets and/or set different measures and alter weightings for the annual 
bonus plan and to adjust targets for the LTIP if events happen that cause 
it to determine that the conditions are unable to fulfil their original 
intended purpose. However, varied performance conditions must in the 
Committee’s opinion not be materially easier or more difficult to satisfy 
than the original conditions were when they were set. 
All historic awards that were granted under any current or previous share 
schemes operated by the Company but remain outstanding remain 
eligible to vest based on their original award terms.
Share ownership requirement 
The Committee’s policy is to have shareholding requirements for the 
Executive Directors which create greater alignment between their 
interests and those of shareholders and reduce the potential for 
behaviours and actions which are detrimental to the long-term health 
of the Company. The required level is set at 100 per cent of salary.

Fees
Fees are set to recognise the 
responsibility and experience of the 
individual and enable us to attract 
and retain the right calibre 
of individual.
Fees are normally reviewed at least annually and may be adjusted as necessary to align with market rates 
in companies of a comparable size and to take account of factors such as the time commitment of the role. 
The Chairman is paid an all-encompassing fee to take account of all Board responsibilities. The other Non-Executive 
Directors receive a base fee with additional fees paid for additional responsibility, such as the chairing of a Committee 
and performing the role of Senior Independent Director.
No Non-Executive Directors participate in any of the Company’s incentive arrangements and no benefits or other 
remuneration are provided. Non-Executive Directors will be reimbursed for any normal business related expenses.
What performance measures are used and why?
Fees are not performance-related; however performance is addressed through regular one-to-one meetings 
between the Chairman and each Non-Executive Director.

Directors’ report
How does the Remuneration policy for Executive Directors differ from that 
of other employees?
Overall, the Remuneration policy set for the Executive Directors 
ensures their remuneration is more heavily weighted towards 
performance-related variable pay than for other employees. 
As such, a greater proportion of their remuneration is dependent 
upon the successful delivery of the business strategy.
Base salary
 I As for the Executive Directors, the basic pay for each employee is 
reviewed at least annually in comparison to market rate 
information and individual performance and increased if 
appropriate, also taking into account the overall financial 
performance of the Group.
Benefits
 I Flexible benefits can be purchased each year by all employees 
and include dental cover, childcare vouchers, additional life 
assurance, additional income protection and employees also 
have the opportunity to buy or sell holiday entitlement. In addition 
senior employees are entitled to private medical insurance, either 
as part of their package or as an option to purchase as a 
flexible benefit.
Retirement benefits
 I All employees are entitled to pension contributions from the 
Group, which increase as the employee contribution increases.
Annual bonus
 I All employees, other than those eligible for commission payments, 
are entitled to participate in the bonus scheme in which the 
Executive Directors participate, with maximum awards set as 
a percentage of salary, depending on seniority. Performance 
is measured in the same way as for the Executive Directors 
but with more challenging targets for the Executive Directors 
to achieve maximum pay-out.
Long-term incentives
 I Long-term incentive awards are reserved for those individuals 
most able to directly influence Company strategy. Along with 
the Executive Directors, selected senior managers are also invited 
to participate in the LTIP scheme. The performance targets 
and performance period for these awards are the same as those 
for the Executive Directors.
Chart assumptions
The charts above show how much Bill Halbert and Paul Simpson could 
earn under KCOM Group’s Remuneration policy as detailed on pages 
46 and 47. The different scenarios shown in the graphs are: 
 I fixed, where performance is below threshold and Executive 
Directors receive fixed pay only with no vesting under the LTIP 
and no annual bonus;
 I on-target, where Executive Directors receive their fixed pay plus a 
bonus at the mid-point of the range, representing 50 per cent of the 
maximum opportunity and vesting of 25 per cent of the maximum 
under the LTIP; and 
 I maximum, where performance meets or exceeds the maximum and 
the Executive Directors receive their fixed pay plus the maximum bonus 
and maximum vesting of the LTIP . 
Fixed pay comprises:
 I salaries, with an increase of 2.75 per cent effective from 1 July 2014;
 I benefits, equivalent to the amount received by each Executive Director 
in the year to 31 March 2014; and
 I pension, equivalent to 20 per cent of the base salary for the year.
It should be noted that since the analysis above shows what could be earned 
by the Executive Directors based on the 2014/15 financial year Remuneration 
policy described on pages 46 and 47, the numbers will be different to the 
values included in the table on page 53 detailing what was actually earned 
by the Executive Directors in the year to 31 March 2014, since these values 
are based on the actual levels of performance to 31 March 2014.
The charts above do not include what Kevin Walsh might be paid 
given that he will no longer be a Director on the date the policy 
becomes effective.

Recruitment policy
This table sets out the Company’s policy on recruitment of new permanent Executive Directors for each element of 
the remuneration package. 
Remuneration element Policy on recruitment
Base salary The Remuneration Committee will typically offer salaries around the median market 
level for comparative roles, but salaries above or below this level may be set to recognise 
the experience of the individual, the wider economic climate and pay and conditions 
throughout the Group.
Where it is appropriate to set a lower salary initially, a series of increases above the level 
awarded to the wider workforce may be given over the proceeding few years until the 
desired positioning is achieved, subject to individual performance. This may apply to 
those promoted internally in the Group as well as to those recruited from outside. 
Benefits The Remuneration Committee will offer a benefits package that will be set in line with its 
policy for existing Executive Directors.
In addition to the benefits currently available to existing Executive Directors, the 
Committee may also offer an allowance to cover relocation expenses as appropriate.
Retirement benefits The maximum pension contribution will be set in line with the Company’s policy for 
existing Executive Directors at 20 per cent of base salary.
Annual bonus The Remuneration Committee will offer an annual bonus in line with its policy for existing 
Executive Directors of up to 100 per cent of salary.
Different performance measures may be set initially depending on the point in the 
financial year at which the individual joined. The opportunity for an annual bonus will 
be pro-rated for the period of employment. 
Long-term incentives On an ongoing basis awards will be made in line with the policy for other Directors. In the 
year of recruitment a higher award may be made within the approved limits of the plan 
(200 per cent of salary in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment).
‘Buy-outs’ The Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers 
these to be in the best interests of shareholders and the Company. Any such payments 
would be based solely on remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer 
and would reflect (as far as possible) the nature and time horizons attaching to that 
remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions.
The Remuneration Committee’s policy on the ‘buying-out’ of existing incentives granted 
by the Executive’s previous employer will depend on the circumstances of recruitment and 
will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. There will not be a presumption in favour of 
buy-out but it will be considered if necessary to attract the right candidate.
In total the maximum variable pay level in the year of appointment – excluding the value of any buy-out awards – will be 300 per cent 
of salary.
For an internal executive appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing 
prior to appointment would continue. 
Non-Executive Directors
On the appointment of a new Non-Executive Chairman or Non-Executive Director, fees will be set to take account of the calibre and 
experience of the individual, prevailing market rates in companies of a similar size and the expected time commitment associated 
with the role.  KCOM Group PLC 
Annual report and accounts 2013/14 51
Directors’ report
Payments for loss of office
This table sets out the policy on exit payments in relation to each remuneration element for Executive Directors.
The Committee is clear that there will be a consistent approach to exit payments and no reward for poor performance. No amount is payable 
if an Executive Director is dismissed for serious breach of contract, serious misconduct or under-performance or acts that bring the Executive 
Director or Group into serious disrepute.
The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment do not include any compensation for loss of office.
Remuneration element Treatment on exit
Base salary Salary will be paid over the contractual notice period. In all cases the Company will seek 
to mitigate any payments due and the Executive Directors have a contractual duty to 
use reasonable endeavours to obtain alternative income, which can then be used to 
reduce the salary if being paid by instalments. However, the Company has discretion 
to make a lump sum payment on termination in lieu of notice.
Benefits and retirement benefits Benefits and retirement benefits will normally continue to be provided over the notice 
period. In all cases the Company will seek to mitigate any payments due. However, the 
Company has discretion to make a lump sum payment on termination equal to the value 
of the benefits payable during the notice period. 
Annual bonus Whether an annual bonus payment is made is entirely at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee and would be pro-rated to the time of active service in the year 
of cessation. The decision of the Committee would take into consideration the 
performance of the individual, the circumstances of the departure and the financial 
performance of the Group. 
LTIP Normally awards will lapse on cessation of employment, unless the Company determines 
and the Remuneration Committee agrees that the Executive is a good leaver. Good 
leaver status is usually conferred for one of the following reasons; death, ill-health, injury 
or disability, retirement, redundancy, or other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee. Good leavers will be treated in accordance with the rules of the LTIP, as 
approved by shareholders. In these circumstances a participant’s awards vest on 
a time pro-rata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria 
over the original period, with the balance of the awards lapsing. The Committee retains 
discretion to decide not to pro-rate, to alter the basis of time pro-rating, and to alter 
the date on which performance is calculated if it feels such decisions are appropriate 
in particular circumstances.
Payments on a change of control, where a Director’s employment is adversely changed, will be as on termination. There will be no enhanced 
provisions on a change of control. 
Service contracts and letters of appointment policy
Service contracts
It is the policy of the Group that the notice period for Executive Directors is set at six months for either party. Prior to 2008, the notice period for 
Executive Directors was set at 12 months. The decision has been taken not to retrospectively alter the notice period for those Directors appointed 
with a 12 month notice period.
Letter of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by letters of appointment rather than service contracts and the notice period in all letters of appointment is set 
at six months for either party. 
Copies of the Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection during office hours at our head office at 37 Carr Lane, 
Hull, HU1 3RE. There are no obligations on the Group in any of the service contracts or letters of appointment to make payments beyond those disclosed 
in this report.
Policy on outside appointments
We believe that where Board members hold directorships in other companies the Group can benefit from their experience. As a result, and subject 
to the Board’s prior approval, Executive Directors may take on more than one external non-executive directorship and retain the fees earned. KCOM Group PLC

Annual report on remuneration
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration report sets out the amounts paid to Directors for the year ended 31 March 2014 and describes how policy 
will be implemented in 2014/15. The Annual report on remuneration, along with the statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, will be put to an advisory vote at the AGM on 29 July 2014.
Implementation of policy for 2014/15
The table below sets out how the Remuneration policy will be implemented for the 2014/15 financial year:
Executive Directors
Bill Halbert Paul Simpson Kevin Walsh
Base salary
From 1 July 2014 Bill’s base salary has 
been increased to £396,872. This is an 
increase of 2.75 per cent.
From 1 July 2014 Paul’s base salary 
has been increased to £262,126. 
This is an increase of 2.75 per cent.
Kevin’s base salary will remain the 
same as in 2013/14, up to the date 
of his retirement, at £242,050.
Benefits
The benefits to be provided remain unchanged from 2013/14. These include private medical insurance for the Executive 
and his immediate family, income protection, life assurance, a car allowance of £16,000 per annum for Bill and £14,000 
per annum for Paul and Kevin or an equivalent company car, a fully-expensed fuel card, medical screening and the 
opportunity to participate in the all-employee Share Incentive Plan. The Executive Directors are also able to purchase 
additional flexible benefits which are available to all employees. The benefits for Kevin in 2014/15 will be pro-rated to 
his date of retirement.
Retirement 
benefits
Each Executive Director is entitled to an employer pension contribution of 20 per cent of base salary.
Annual bonus
The performance measures for the annual bonus scheme are growth in EBITDA 
and growth in revenue, measured for the 2014/15 financial year. Both Bill and 
Paul have a target annual bonus entitlement of 50 per cent of base salary. Up to 
20 per cent of the target entitlement, equivalent to 10 per cent of base salary, is 
triggered upon exceeding a specific targeted level of EBITDA. If the EBITDA 
achieved in the year is greater than that required to trigger the full 20 per cent 
payment then further bonus payments begin to accrue, however payment of 
any bonus beyond the 20 per cent is dependent on an underpin of revenue 
growth in the year. Even more stretching financial targets are in place for a 
bonus of between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of base salary. The exact 
targets set are commercially sensitive and therefore cannot be disclosed here.
Kevin will not be entitled to a bonus 
for the 2014/15 financial year, given 
his indication of his intention to retire 
in the summer of 2014.
Long-term 
incentives
It is proposed to award LTIP awards to Bill and Paul in July 2014 under the 
current scheme, which will be equivalent to 100 per cent of their base salary 
at the date of grant. These awards will have a three year performance period 
and therefore will be due to vest in July 2017.
Kevin will not be eligible for an LTIP 
award in July 2014, given his intention 
to retire in the summer of 2014.
Base salary increases
The base salaries of the Executive Directors have not increased since 1 July 2011. On 1 July 2012 all employees, excluding Executive Directors and 
senior managers, were awarded a two per cent increase. From 1 July 2014 an average pay rise of 1.66 per cent will be awarded to employees across 
the Group based on individual performance and the market rate for their role. 
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance of the Group, the individual performance of the Executive Directors and the 
pay awards made elsewhere in the Group since the last increase for Executive Directors in 2011 and has proposed a 2.75 per cent increase for 
Bill Halbert and Paul Simpson effective from 1 July 2014. Following this increase we can confirm that the salaries for Bill and Paul are consistent 
with median market rates.
Non-Executive Directors
Graham Holden Tony Illsley Martin Towers
Fees
From 1 April 2014, Graham was 
appointed to the role of Chairman and 
from that date his fee became £125,000 
per annum, which is in line with the 
median market rate for his role.
The fee for Tony will be increased to 
£43,000 from 1 July 2014 to reflect 
an increase in the median market rate 
for the role. This is an increase of 
2.4 per cent and is the first increase in 
three years. Tony will also receive an 
additional fee of £11,000 for his role 
as Senior Independent Director.
The fee for Martin will be increased to 
£43,000 from 1 July 2014 to reflect an 
increase in the median market rate for 
the role. This is an increase of 2.4 
per cent and is the first increase in three 
years. Martin will also receive an 
additional fee of £6,000 for his role as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. KCOM Group PLC

Explanatory notes
Salary
In 2012/13 Paul Simpson’s salary included an annual allowance for dual 
responsibility of £18,000 in relation to his temporary responsibility for 
the Kcom brand. This allowance was not pensionable or subject to 
bonus and ceased on 1 April 2013.
The salary for Kevin Walsh has remained consistent with the prior year 
at £242,050; however his actual pay in the year was slightly lower due 
to some unpaid leave that Kevin requested to take in the year.
Taxable benefits
Bill Halbert received a car allowance of £16,000 but elected not to 
receive any other benefits from the Group. The taxable benefits for Paul 
Simpson and Kevin Walsh include private medical insurance, income 
protection, life assurance, medical screening, a company car equivalent 
to a £14,000 per annum car allowance, fully-expensed fuel cards and 
membership of the all-employee Share Incentive Plan.
Pension-related benefits
Bill Halbert has elected not to be a member of the Group pension scheme 
and, accordingly, the Group made no contributions on his behalf. Instead 
he received cash payments totalling £65,905 (2013: £65,905) which are 
disclosed above within pension-related benefits.
Paul Simpson and Kevin Walsh elected to receive part of their pension 
contribution entitlement in cash due to their Pension Lifetime Allowance 
contributions being reached. These amounts were £15,000 (2013: £5,000) 
and £12,000 (2013: £14,000) respectively and are included in the table 
above within pension-related benefits.
None of the Directors have any prospective entitlement to defined 
benefits or cash balance benefits in respect of qualifying services.
Bonus receivable for the year
The annual bonus was dependent on the achievement of Group financial 
performance targets around growth in Group EBITDA and Group revenue. 
Up to 20 per cent of the target bonus entitlement (of 50 per cent of 
salary) was dependent on exceeding a targeted level of Group EBITDA. 
Further bonus awards would then accrue on a straight-line basis up to 
50 per cent of salary, dependent on the amount of Group EBITDA 
achieved and with an underpin of Group revenue growth. Even more 
stretching targets were then in place to achieve a bonus above the 
targets bonus entitlement, up to 100 per cent of salary.
The performance in the year exceeded the targeted level of Group 
EBITDA required to trigger a bonus and indicated that a bonus of 
14 per cent of the target bonus entitlement (equivalent to seven per 
cent of salary) was payable. This was reviewed by the Remuneration 
Committee, along with the individual performance of the Executive 
Directors, and it was agreed that 14 per cent of the target bonus 
entitlement should be awarded.
Long-term incentives
In the prior year, two long-term incentive schemes vested: the Long-Term Co 
Investment Plan (LTCIP) and the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP). In the year 
under review further shares were released from the EIP to Paul Simpson and 
Kevin Walsh. Further details on these schemes are included on page 55.
Included within the EIP vesting figures were dividends of £Nil 
(2013: £485,000) for Bill Halbert, £58,000 (2013: £78,000) for 
Paul Simpson and £58,000 (2013: £78,000) for Kevin Walsh.
Non-Executive Directors
The fees for the Non-executive Directors were set at £42,000 per 
annum with an additional £5,000 per annum for the responsibility 
of chairing the Remuneration or Audit Committee and an additional 
£10,000 for the role of Senior Independent Director.  KCOM Group PLC

The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
On 19 July 2012 a new long-term incentive scheme, the LTIP, was approved by shareholders. The scheme authorises the Remuneration Committee to 
grant nil-cost share options to the Executive Directors and selected senior managers on an annual basis.
The scheme measures TSR performance over a three year performance 
period from the date of grant, relative to the TSR performance of each 
company within a comparator group, comprising those companies within 
the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) as at the start of the 
performance period.
No part of the awards may vest unless the Company’s TSR performance 
ranks at least median to the TSR performance of the comparator group. 
Performance at median would result in 25 per cent of the awards vesting, 
with performance between median and upper quartile resulting in a 
vesting of awards on a straight-line basis with 100 per cent vesting at 
upper quartile performance.
In addition, regardless of TSR performance, no awards shall vest unless 
the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Company’s financial 
and non-financial performance over the performance period warrants 
the level of vesting set out in the vesting schedule. The Committee will 
consider the Company’s share price progression, dividend policy and EPS 
performance as part of this review.
The first awards under the scheme were made on 19 July 2012 with a 
second award made on 17 July 2013. The maximum award granted to 
each Director at each award date was equivalent to 100 per cent of base 
salary at the time of the award.

LTCIP
The LTCIP was established in 2007 with participation restricted to the Executive Directors at that time. The scheme required an Executive Director to purchase 
and hold KCOM Group shares for up to five years (either by transferring existing shares or through new share purchases). Purchased shares and transferred-in 
shares had to be held in the plan for a minimum of 12 months. Following the introduction of the EIP in 2009 no further shares could be lodged in the LTCIP . 
There were three performance periods for TSR and absolute share price growth, all starting from the adoption date of the plan on 1 September 2007 , and 
ending consecutively on 31 August 2010, 201 1 and 2012. The performance periods ended on 31 August 2010 and 31 August 201 1 did not result in any shares 
vesting. The outcome for the performance period ended on 31 August 2012 resulted in the vesting shown in the table below. Further information on the 
performance measures and vesting of the scheme can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration report in the 2013 Annual report and accounts.

EIP
The EIP was introduced in 2009 at the request of shareholders, as the Group’s main long-term incentive scheme. All the Executive Directors 
participated in this scheme and were granted a conditional right to a number of ordinary shares in the Group which would vest after three years to the 
extent that the associated TSR performance condition was met. No further awards will be made under the EIP.
Shares released during the year
For full vesting, KCOM Group’s average TSR over any three month period 
in the three years to 24 July 2012 had to equal or exceed 100 pence. 
This reduced to 10 per cent vesting on a straight-line basis for a TSR of 
45 pence, with no vesting below 45 pence. During the performance period 
the highest rolling three month TSR achieved was 81.26 pence which 
meant that 69.34 per cent of the maximum awards vested on 24 July 2012.
Vesting was also subject to the Remuneration Committee being 
satisfied that there had been a demonstrable and sustainable 
improvement in the Group’s financial and non-financial performance 
over the performance period. This was considered and the Remuneration 
Committee took into account the increase in shareholder value over the 
same period, comparing the market capitalisation of the Group at 24 July 
2009 of £145.9 million with the market capitalisation of the Group at 24 
July 2012 of £382.3 million, showing a 162.0 per cent increase.  
In addition over the performance period, dividends of £48.3 million 
had been paid, resulting in a total increase in shareholder value over 
the performance period of £284.7 million. The awards granted to the 
Executive Directors on the vesting of the scheme on 24 July 2012 had 
a market value on vesting of £6.8 million, representing just 2.4 per cent 
of the total increase in shareholder value over the three years of 
the scheme.
The vested shares were released in full to Bill Halbert at the end of 
the performance period as, at the time the scheme was introduced, 
this timescale was better aligned to his expected tenure in his role.
Paul Simpson, Kevin Walsh and former Director, Paul Renucci, all received 50 
per cent of their vested shares on 24 July 2012 and 25 per cent on 24 July 
2013. The remaining 25 per cent is due to be released on 24 July 2014.  KCOM Group PLC

2.  In November 2013 Kevin Walsh indicated that it was his intention to retire from the Group in the summer of 2014. Kevin has worked closely with the rest of the Board and the Senior 
Management team within the KC brand since that time to ensure a smooth and seamless transition in his operational responsibilities. As part of the planning for his departure, Kevin has 
agreed to sign a new service contract in the summer of 2014 which will reduce his notice period to just three months; therefore relieving the Group from the obligation to make a 12 month 
payment in lieu of notice from the date that he formally tenders his resignation and ensuring that his notice period does not extend beyond 12 months from the date of his initial indication.

meets for additional meetings as and when required. For the year under 
review there were no additional meetings held.
The membership and attendance at Committee meetings is shown on 
page 35. Meetings were attended also during the year by the Executive 
Chairman, the Group HR Director and the Company Secretary, although 
none were present when their own reward was under discussion.
During the year under review, the Committee received advice on all aspects 
of remuneration from independent remuneration consultants New Bridge 
Street, a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited, an Aon plc company, who were 
appointed by the Committee in August 201 1 following a comprehensive 
tender process. New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group Code of Conduct and any advice received is governed 
by that code. The fee paid to New Bridge Street during the year for this 
advice was £45,000 which is charged as a fixed annual fee for recurring 
work, with separate fees agreed as appropriate for additional adhoc work.
The Committee has reviewed the operating processes in place at New Bridge 
Street and remains satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and 
objective. Aon Hewitt also provide actuarial and investment consultancy 
advice to the Trustees of the Group’s two defined benefit pension schemes, 
which the Committee considers does not produce a conflict of interest.
In accordance with its Terms of Reference, the Committee is responsible for:
 I determining and agreeing the Remuneration policy for the Executive 
Chairman or Chief Executive, the Executive Directors and senior 
management across the Group;
 I having regard to remuneration trends across the Group and remuneration 
in other companies when setting Remuneration policy, as well as to 
environmental, social and governance matters when appropriate;
 I selecting, appointing and setting the Terms of Reference for any 
remuneration consultants who advise the Committee;
 I approving the design of, and determining targets for, any 
performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group and 
approving the total annual payments made under such schemes;
 I reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the 
Board and shareholders and determining each year whether awards will 
be made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual 
awards and the performance targets to be used;
 I determining the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for each 
Executive Director and senior management; and
 I ensuring that contractual terms on termination, and any payments 
made, are fair to the individual and the Group, that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised.
    The Committee’s Terms of Reference are in line with 
the recommendations in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and 
Administrators’ Guidance on Terms of Reference for 
Remuneration Committees. Copies of the Terms of 
Reference are available from the Company Secretary 
or on our website, www.kcomplc.com.
The specific matters considered by the Committee during the year were:
Description What the Committee has done
Reviewing the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration packages
The Committee reviewed benchmark analysis of the remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors and the Senior Management team against comparable roles and considered market 
trends in remuneration across the industry and in similar sized companies.
Reviewing the proposed annual bonus 
scheme for the 2013/14 financial year 
and performance against the scheme 
for 2012/13
The proposed scheme for 2013/14 was reviewed by the Committee with particular emphasis on 
the need to ensure that the proportion of retained profit above the bonus target was appropriate. 
The Committee confirmed that the financial performance of the Group had not triggered a 
bonus payment for 2012/13 and that therefore it was correct that no bonus should be paid.
Reviewing progress on the LTIP scheme 
and determining the awards for 2013
The awards made in July 2013 under the LTIP scheme were reviewed and approved by the 
Committee. There was also a review at each meeting of progress against the performance 
measures, as well as a discussion around the appropriateness of the use of TSR as a single 
measure and the peer group used, which concluded that these were still appropriate.
Reviewing the Directors’ Remuneration 
report in the annual report and accounts
The Directors’ Remuneration report in the 2013 annual report and accounts was reviewed by 
the Committee during the year. Post year end the Committee has reviewed the new disclosures 
required under Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and has approved the current Remuneration 
report as compliant with the new requirements.
Reviewing the approach to pay reviews 
across the Group and specifically for 
senior management
The approach to pay reviews across the Group was discussed by the Committee, in particular 
in relation to how it aligned with the pay review approach for Executive Directors.
Reviewing the leaving arrangements in 
relation to the retirement of Kevin Walsh
On 26 November 2013, Kevin Walsh indicated his intention to retire in the summer of 2014 which 
prompted a review of the leaving arrangements in place for retiring Directors. It was agreed between 
Kevin Walsh and the Committee that, upon formally retiring, his notice period would reduce to just 
three months to relieve the Group of the obligation to pay 12 months’ notice from the date of his 
formal notice and to ensure that his notice period does not extend beyond 12 months from the date 
of his initial indication.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion  
In our opinion:
 I the financial statements, defined below, 
give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of the 
Group’s profit and of the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s cash flows for the year 
then ended;
 I the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
 I the Parent Company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 I the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what 
we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements and Parent 
Company financial statements (the ‘financial 
statements’), which are prepared by KCOM 
Group PLC, comprise:
 I the Consolidated and Parent Company 
balance sheets as at 31 March 2014;
 I the Consolidated income statement and 
statement of comprehensive income for 
the year then ended;
 I the Consolidated and Parent Company 
statements of changes in equity and 
cash flow statements for the year then 
ended; and
 I the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation comprises 
applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the Parent 
Company, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Certain disclosures required by the financial 
reporting framework have been presented 
elsewhere in the Annual report and accounts 
(the ‘Annual Report’), rather than in the notes 
to the financial statements. These are 
cross-referenced from the financial statements 
and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial 
statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). An audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
 I whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
 I the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and 
 I the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These 
helped us to determine the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate 
the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we 
determined materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole to be £2.5 million, being 
five per cent of the Group’s consolidated profit 
before tax. We have had regard to profit before 
tax as we believe this is the most appropriate 
measure of Group performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we 
would report to them misstatements identified 
during our audit above £0.1 million as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group is structured along two business 
segments, being KC and Kcom. Within these 
segments are five individual trading subsidiary 
entities (the ‘trading entities’). Together 
with the Group’s centralised PLC function, 
these trading entities form the consolidated 
financial statements. 
In establishing the overall approach to the 
Group audit, we determined the type of work 
that needed to be performed by us at each 
trading entity to be able to conclude whether 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements as a whole. We 
determined that each of the trading entities 
required an audit of their complete financial 
information. This together with the audit of the 
Group’s centralised PLC function, including the 
consolidation, gave us the evidence we needed 
for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors made a number of subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. We 
primarily focused our work in these areas 
by assessing the Directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures 
in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined 
information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we considered 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for 
us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness 
of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In summary, we considered the following areas 
to be those that required particular focus in the 
current year. This is not a complete list of all 
risks or areas of focus identified by our audit. 
We discussed these areas of focus with the 
Audit Committee. Their report on those matters 
that they considered to be significant issues 
in relation to the financial statements is set 
out on page 39. KCOM Group PLC 
Annual report and accounts 2013/14 62
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent auditors’ report continued
to the members of KCOM Group PLC
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets
We focused on this area due to the size of goodwill and 
other intangible asset balances and because the directors’ 
assessment of the carrying value of the Group’s cash 
generating units (‘CGUs’) involves subjective judgements 
about the future results of the Kcom, Smart421 and Eclipse 
parts of the business.
We evaluated the Directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and the process by which they 
were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board approved budgets, and 
testing the underlying calculations. We challenged:
 I the Directors’ key assumptions for long-term growth rates in the forecasts by comparing 
them to historical results and long-term growth forecasts for the economy; and
 I the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the company and comparable 
organisations. 
We also performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts, 
being projected revenue and EBITDA growth in the respective CGUs. Having ascertained 
the extent of change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively would be 
required for the goodwill and other intangible assets to be impaired, we considered the 
likelihood of such a movement in those key assumptions arising and whether there was 
adequate disclosure of such sensitivities in the financial statements.
Valuation of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities
We focused on this area because the Group operates two 
defined benefit pension scheme arrangements and the 
valuation of each scheme’s liability is sensitive to a number 
of judgemental assumptions made by the directors, in 
particular the discount rate and inflation rate.
A small change in these assumptions can have a material 
impact on the financial statements.
We considered and challenged the reasonableness of the key assumptions (including the 
discount rate and inflation rate) by comparing the Directors’ assumptions to benchmark 
assumptions and evaluating the sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to movements 
in those assumptions, both individually and in aggregate.
We also assessed whether the methods used to determine the key assumptions were 
consistently applied year-on-year.
Capitalisation of internal project costs
We focused on this area because the Group is investing 
significantly in its back office systems and core IT applications. 
In the year this has resulted in the capitalisation of £4.6 million 
of internal salary costs. There is a degree of judgement involved 
in determining the element of internal salaries that is directly 
attributable to this project and as such should be capitalised. 
There is also judgement involved in assessing the recoverability 
of the carrying value of the asset created from the project.
We tested capitalised salary costs to supporting payroll records to agree the existence 
of individuals, hours charged and to evaluate whether the costs were directly attributable 
to the capital project.
The Directors made an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of the 
capitalised asset. The Directors assessed and compared actual spend to date to budgeted 
spend; and total forecast spend to the forecast cost savings and payback period, compared 
to the carrying value and estimated useful life of the asset created. We evaluated the 
Directors’ assessment by testing costs capitalised to date by agreeing to supporting 
evidence and assessing these costs against the original Board approved business case.
Accounting for judgements in significant contracts
We focused on this area because a number of significant 
customer and supplier contracts exist within the Group. 
The accounting for each of these contracts requires 
judgement in terms of both the timing and amount 
of both revenue and cost recognition. 
We challenged the judgements made by management in the calculation of certain 
contractual revenues, including whether the Group was entitled to, and appropriately 
recognised revenue in line with their contractual obligations and revenue recognition policy.
We also tested the related cost recognition and evaluated the consistency of this against the 
revenue recognition policy and the completeness of costs recognised.
Fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in 
revenue recognition because of the pressure management 
may feel to achieve the planned results. 
We focused on the risk that revenue may have been 
recognised in all revenue streams for transactions that 
had not occurred.
We evaluated the relevant IT systems and tested the operating effectiveness of internal 
controls, relating to calls and rentals, designed to verify whether revenue transactions had 
occurred and were entitled to be recognised in the financial statements We also tested the 
reconciliations between the revenue systems used by the Group and its financial ledgers.
Our testing of contractual revenue streams to assess whether a service had been provided 
or a product sale had occurred focused on understanding whether cash had been received 
and agreeing the timing of services performed to supporting documentation including 
customer contracts and, where relevant, project information including timesheets.
We also tested journal entries posted to revenue accounts to obtain evidence for unusual 
or irregular items.
Risk of management override of internal controls 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. 
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the arrangements for 
staff to ‘whistle-blow’ inappropriate actions, and interviewed senior management and the 
Group’s internal audit function. We examined the significant accounting estimates and 
judgements relevant to the financial statements for evidence of bias by the Directors that 
may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We also tested manual journal 
entries to determine that the adjustments made were appropriate. KCOM Group PLC

Report on the financial statements

Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review the Directors’ statement, set out on 
page 43, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the 
directors have concluded that it is appropriate 
to prepare the Group’s and Parent Company’s 
financial statements using the going concern 
basis of accounting. The going concern basis 
presumes that the Group and Parent Company 
have adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the directors intend them to do so, for 
at least one year from the date the financial 
statements were signed. As part of our audit we 
have concluded that the directors’ use of the 
going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, these statements are not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Opinions on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 I the information given in the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
 I the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Other matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and 
information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
 I we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit; or
 I adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the Parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 I the Parent Company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law have not been made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility. 
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review 
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the Parent Company’s compliance 
with nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’). We have nothing 
to report having performed our review.
On page 43 of the Annual Report, as required 
by the Code Provision C.1.1, the directors state 
that they consider the Annual Report taken as a 
whole to be fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. On page 39, 
as required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit 
Committee has set out the significant issues 
that it considered in relation to the financial 
statements, and how they were addressed. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
 I the statement given by the directors is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
 I the section of the Annual Report describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the Annual Report is:
 I materially inconsistent with the information 
in the audited financial statements; or
 I apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the Group and Parent Company acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 I is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 43, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands 
it may come save where expressly agreed by 
our prior consent in writing.

Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2014
01 General information 
KCOM Group PLC is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address 
of the registered office is 37 Carr Lane, Hull, HU1 3RE. The nature of the Group’s operations is described within the ‘Strategic report’ on pages 7 to 9. 
02 Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of accounting 
The consolidated and Parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial 
assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit and loss. The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 3. 
There were no new standards, amendments and interpretations that were adopted by the Group and effective for the first time for the financial year 
beginning 1 April 2014 that were material to the Group, with the exception of the amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits (revised)’.
This standard replaces the interest cost on pension scheme liabilities and expected return on pension scheme assets with a net interest amount that is 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability/asset. The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 have been 
restated to apply this standard and the net impact has been an additional charge of £2.7 million to profit before tax in the income statement, see note 28 
for further detail.
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013 and have not yet been 
applied in preparing these financial statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect or material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations on the effective date will not have a significant impact on the 
Group’s financial results.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are taken into account. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its undertakings made 
up to 31 March 2014. The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included from the dates of acquisition using the purchase method of consolidation. 
Where a company has ceased to be a subsidiary undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation. 
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition 
below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by 
the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. 
The Group’s share of its associates’ profits or losses is recognised in the income statement. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted 
against the carrying amount of the investment. 
Partnerships are controlled when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the partnership so as 
to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the KCOM Central Asset Reserve Limited Partnership and its undertakings 
made up to 31 March 2014. The results of new partnership undertakings are included from the dates of acquisition using the purchase method of 
consolidation. Where a company has ceased to be a partnership undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation.
Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The 
CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the KCOM Group PLC 
Board of Directors. As described in note 4, the Board assessed that Kcom, Smart421 and Eclipse brands are aggregated together and reported as the 
‘Kcom’ segment. The remaining brands of KC and the PLC function are reported respectively in the ‘KC’ segment and ‘PLC’ segment.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of 
discounts, returns and value-added taxes. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured when it is probable 
that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below. 
The Group bases its estimate of return on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics 
of each arrangement.
Revenue from calls is recognised in the Consolidated income statement at the time the call is made over the Group’s network. Revenue from rentals 
is recognised evenly over the rental period.  KCOM Group PLC

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 March 2014
02 Accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition continued
Revenue from product sales is recognised at the point of effective transfer of risk and reward. Revenue from production of directories is recognised 
at the point when the directory is published. For large long-term annuity and multiple element customer contracts the Group is able to distinguish 
between the installation and the in-life service phases of a contract. Revenue is allocated based on the fair value of the consideration which represents 
the market value of such services, or amounts per contracts, and will be recognised on the following basis for each phase:
 I installation – within this phase revenue relating to resources and services is accounted for on a stage of completion basis where revenue is 
recognised with reference to the proportion of total costs incurred to date. Revenue related to equipment is accounted for based on the point 
of effective transfer of risks and rewards (shipment); and
 I in-life service – revenue for this phase is recognised in line with the obligation to provide service as dictated by customer contracts.
Pre-contract costs, such as bid costs, on key contract wins are expensed as and when incurred.
Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised in the accounting period in which services are 
rendered, by reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction and assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion 
of the total services to be provided.
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide better understanding of the financial 
performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature 
or amount. In particular costs associated with organisational restructuring, costs and provisions associated with onerous contracts, profits or losses 
on the sale of an operation and one-off pension costs and credits are treated as exceptional items.
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and is the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the 
fair value of the net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate potential impairment. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected 
to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the 
lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Development costs 
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s internal development activities is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: 
 I an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes); 
 I it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
 I the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Internally generated intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful 
lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which 
it is incurred. Research costs are expensed to the income statement as and when they are incurred. 
Customer and supplier relationships
Contractual customer and supplier relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. The contractual 
customer and supplier relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over the expected life of the relationship. These intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
T echnology and brand
T echnology and brand acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Assumptions are used in estimating 
the fair values of acquired intangible assets and include management’s estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by the acquired businesses. 
These intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Software
Software comprises computer software purchased from third parties and also the cost of internally developed software. Computer software purchased 
from third parties and internally developed software is initially recorded at cost.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are 
recognised as intangible assets when the criteria detailed above is met. These intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised 
as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.  KCOM Group PLC

02 Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets continued
Amortisation 
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset. 
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer and supplier relationships up to 8 years 
T echnology and brand up to 10 years 
Software up to 5 years 
Development costs 3 years
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Network infrastructure and related 
equipment (included within exchange equipment and external plant) is recorded at cost including labour costs directly attributable to the cost of the 
network construction. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of assets to residual values on a straight-line basis over the assets’ useful 
estimated lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 years 
Leasehold buildings and improvements period of lease 
Exchange equipment 10 years 
External plant 10 to 20 years 
Vehicles, other apparatus and equipment 3 to 10 years
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually. Depreciation of network infrastructure and related equipment is provided for from the 
date the network comes into operation. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term 
of the relevant lease. 
Fixed asset investments 
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. They are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal of the impairment. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill – are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units (CGUs) are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to CGUs and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Costs include raw 
materials and, where appropriate, direct overhead expenses. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where 
appropriate. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy 
or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of 
provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
income statement within operating expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade 
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts written off are credited against operating expenses in the income statement. KCOM Group PLC 
Annual report and accounts 2013/14 72
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
02 Accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three 
months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet, unless a right of offset exists. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax payable is currently based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and/or items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised generally for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced or increased to the extent that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly to equity. In this 
case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. 
Financial instruments and hedge accounting 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing 
and investment activities. In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently recognised at fair value. Any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of the resultant gain or loss depends on 
the nature of the item being hedged. 
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, 
taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange contracts 
is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm 
commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the 
associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial 
measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised 
in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. 
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement 
in the period. 
Foreign currency translation
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.

02 Accounting policies continued
Leasing and hire purchase commitments 
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance 
leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the future minimum lease 
payments and are depreciated over their useful economic lives. The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase 
contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over 
the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease so as to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Bank borrowings and issue costs 
Bank borrowings are stated at the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue costs, which are amortised over the period of the loan. Finance charges, 
including direct issue costs are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Borrowings are carried subsequently at amortised cost and any differences between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value 
is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Pensions 
Defined contribution 
Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution (money purchase) scheme are charged to the income statement in the period they fall due. 
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Defined benefit 
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using a building block approach, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are recognised in equity 
and presented in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The current and past service costs of the scheme (the increase in the present value of employees’ future benefits attributable to the current or prior 
periods) are charged to the income statement in the period. The cost or benefit of committed settlements and curtailments is recognised immediately 
in the income statement. The interest cost of the scheme (the expected return on scheme assets, less interest on scheme liabilities) is recognised 
in the income statement in the period to which it relates. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service 
cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
Employee share schemes and share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity 
instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005. 
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. 
Equity-settled employee schemes, including employee share options and discretionary long-term incentive schemes, provide employees with the option 
to acquire shares of the Company. Employee share options and long-term incentive schemes are generally subject to performance or service conditions. 
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is measured at the date of grant and charged to the income statement over the period during 
which performance or service conditions are required to be met, or immediately where no performance or service criteria exist. The fair value of equity 
settled share-based payments granted is measured using either the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo model, depending on the terms under which the 
options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of employee share options that vest, except 
where forfeiture is only due to market-based performance criteria not being met. 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting 
conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Group also operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) under which employees have the option to purchase shares in the Company each month and 
offers employees free matching and partnership shares on a sliding scale of between 1:3 to 2:1. The Group recognises the free shares as an expense 
over the period of any applicable service condition, or immediately when no service condition exists. 
Dividends 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. KCOM Group PLC

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
02 Accounting policies continued
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
03 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Impairment of non-current assets 
Determining whether a non-current asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use and/or the estimated recoverable amount of the 
asset derived from the business, or part of the business, CGU, to which the non-current asset has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires 
an estimate of the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU, by applying an appropriate discount rate to the timing and 
amount of future cash flows. 
The Directors are required to make judgements regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows applicable to the CGU, based on current 
budgets and forecasts, and extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and 
operating costs. The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU. 
Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates two defined benefit schemes. All post-employment benefits associated with these schemes have been accounted for in accordance 
with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits (revised)’. As detailed within the accounting policies note, in accordance with IAS 19, all actuarial gains and losses 
have been recognised immediately through the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
For all defined benefit pension schemes, pension valuations have been performed using specialist advice obtained from independent qualified 
actuaries. In performing these valuations, judgements, assumptions and estimates have been made. These assumptions have been disclosed within 
note 28.
04 Segmental analysis 
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the KCOM Group PLC Board that are used to make strategic 
decisions. The chief operating decision-maker of the Group is the KCOM Group PLC Board. The Board considers the performance of the four brands 
and the PLC function in assessing the performance of the Group and making decisions about the allocation of resources. These are the Group’s 
operating segments.
The KC brand addresses the needs of our Hull and East Yorkshire customers and the Eclipse, Kcom and Smart421 brands serve enterprise, public sector 
organisations and small business markets across the UK. 
The Board assessed that the Eclipse, Kcom and Smart421 brands have similar profiles offering similar products and services, similar production 
and distribution processes and are operating in a consistent regulatory environment. In line with IFRS 8, the Eclipse, Kcom and Smart421 brands 
are aggregated together and reported as the ‘Kcom’ segment for the year ended 31 March 2014. The remaining brands of KC and the PLC function 
are reported respectively in the ‘KC’ segment and ‘PLC’ segment. This reporting is also consistent with the reporting to the KCOM Group PLC Board.
The segment information provided to the KCOM Group PLC Board for the reportable segments, for the year ended 31 March 2014 and for the year 
ended 31 March 2013, is as follows:

which is a reclassification from the reserves on the unwind of the deferred tax asset.
Factors affecting the current and future tax charges
As a result of the change in the UK main corporation tax rate from 23% to 20% that was enacted substantively at the balance sheet date and 
that became effective from July 2013, the relevant deferred tax balances have been remeasured. This change in rate will become effective from 
1 April 2015. The UK main corporation tax rate became 21% on 1 April 2014 before it will reduce to 20% on 1 April 2015.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held in trust. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the exceptional items net 
of taxation and dividing this adjusted figure by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares 
purchased by the Company and held in trust.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive 
ordinary shares. The dilutive potential ordinary shares are in the form of share options. A calculation has been done to determine the number of shares 
that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

Consolidated £’000
Cost and carrying amount
At 1 April 2013 and at 31 March 2014 85,272
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at the date of acquisition to the CGU that is expected to benefit from that business 
combination. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The 
recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those 
regarding discount rates, growth rates and forecast cash flows. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU. Growth rates reflect long-term growth rate prospects for the 
UK economy.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the current operating budget approved by the Directors which covers a five year period and an 
appropriate extrapolation of cash flows beyond this. The cash flow forecasts assume revenue and EBITDA growth in line with our strategic priorities.
The carrying amount of goodwill of £85,272,000 (2013: £85,272,000) has been allocated across multiple CGUs as follows:
CGUs £’000

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
14 Goodwill continued
The discount rate and growth rate (in perpetuity) used for value in use calculations are as follows: 
2014 2013 
Discount rate (pre-tax) % 10.5 11.3
Growth rate (in perpetuity) % 2.0 1.5
The goodwill which has been allocated to the Kcom CGU is considered significant in comparison with the Group's total carrying amount of goodwill. 
The recoverable amount of the Kcom CGU has been determined using an internal value in use calculation. Given the materiality of goodwill allocated 
to this CGU, together with the relative headroom derived by the calculations, sensitivity analysis has been performed on the key assumption used in 
the value in use calculations. The estimated recoverable amount of the Kcom CGU exceeds its carrying value by £31 million. The key assumption to 
which this calculation is most sensitive is the forecast net cash flows into perpetuity of £135 million. Specific sensitivity analysis with regard to this 
assumption shows that a reduction in the net cash flows into perpetuity of 23% would need to arise before any impairment would be triggered.
For the other CGUs, management has considered the level of headroom resulting from the impairment tests. Where appropriate, further sensitivity 
analysis has been performed by changing the base case assumptions applicable to each CGU. The analysis has indicated that no reasonably possible 
changes in any individual key assumption would cause the carrying amount of the business to exceed its recoverable amount. 
As at 31 March 2014 and 2013, based on these valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill required no impairment.

The majority of the Group’s trade and other receivables are denominated in Sterling.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash balances and trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk is attributable primarily to its trade 
receivables for which an allowance has been made for the estimated irrecoverable amounts. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the 
counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The Group has no significant concentration of credit 
risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group does not hold 
any collateral as security.
As of 31 March 2014, trade receivables of £5,817,000 were impaired (2013: £3,431,0000). The amount of the provision was £1,489,000 as of 
31 March 2014 (2013: £2,065,000). The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers who are in unexpectedly difficult economic 
situations. It was assessed that a portion of the impaired balance is expected to be recovered.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings are unsecured and have no fixed date of repayment. However, the subsidiary undertakings have confirmed 
that none of the amounts are due within one year. Interest at market rates is charged on amounts due to subsidiary undertakings due after more than 
one year, except for amounts due to dormant entities where nil interest is charged. KCOM Group PLC

assets are expected to reverse. There are additional deferred tax assets of £1.1 million (2013: £1.3 million) which have not been recognised, as there 
is insufficient evidence as to the generation of suitable profits against which these assets can be offset. The utilisation of these assets would reduce 
the Group’s tax charge in future periods. All deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for at the future rate of corporation tax that is substantively

Annual report and accounts 2013/14 88
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
26 Financial instruments and risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments during the year comprised bank loans, cash on short-term deposits, interest rate swaps and forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations, to manage the interest rate risk arising from 
its sources of finance and to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on future cash flows. The Group has various other financial instruments 
such as short-term receivables and payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group regularly reviews its exposure to interest, liquidity and foreign currency risk. Where appropriate the Group will take action, in accordance 
with a Board approved Treasury Policy, to minimise the impact on the business of movements in interest rates and currency rates.
The Group only enters into derivative instruments with members of the banking group to ensure appropriate counterparty credit quality.
Liquidity risk
The Group keeps its short, medium and long-term funding requirements under constant review. Its policy is to have sufficient committed funds available 
to meet medium-term requirements, with flexibility and headroom to make minor acquisitions for cash if the opportunity should arise.
The Group’s bank facilities were refinanced in June 2014 to replace existing facilities. These bank facilities comprise a multi-currency revolving credit 
facility of £200.0 million, provided by a group of five core relationship banks. The facility matures in June 2019. The Group considers that this facility 
will provide sufficient funding to meet the organic and inorganic investment needs of the business. In addition, short-term flexibility of funding is 
available under the £10.0 million overdraft facility provided by the Group’s clearing bankers.
The net debt position of £88.2 million at the beginning of the financial year has decreased during the year to net debt of £75.0 million. The Group 
generated positive cash flow after investing activities of £44.0 million for the year (2013: £24.7 million).
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining 
period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. Notional interest is included for the period from the year end up to the contractual 
maturity date of the debt, calculated on the amount of debt drawn down at the year end.

Interest rate risks
Sterling interest rate swaps were held during the year that fixed approximately 80% (2013: 68%) of the year end net debt. The weighted average 
fixed interest rate payable (including margin) was 3.90% (2013: 3.60%). The weighted average rate of current interest rate swaps in place at the year 
end was 1.63% (excluding margin). Maturity dates of the current interest rate swaps are all July 2015 and reflect the forecast profile of net debt over 
the period. The weighted average period over which the interest rates are fixed is 1.3 years (2013: 2.3 years). Interest rate exposures will continue to 
be hedged in accordance with the Treasury Policy.

The Group’s only major foreign currency risk arises due to the purchase of equipment invoiced in US Dollars. Whenever possible the Group resells this 
equipment in US Dollars. The remaining exposure is managed principally through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in order to minimise 
the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on future cash flows and gross margin.
The Group has also some Euro cash flows but these are not material on a net basis and are not hedged.
Net asset exposure
The Dollar denominated trading described above results in a balance sheet exposure since debtor days are longer than creditor days. It is the Group’s 
policy not to hedge this exposure. If Sterling strengthened by 5% against both the US Dollar and the Euro this would reduce net assets at the balance 
sheet date by £43,719 (2013: £69,808).
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to business and retail customers.
Credit ratings of institutions which hold the Group’s financial assets are regularly monitored to ensure they meet the minimum credit criteria set by the 
Board through the Group Treasury Policy. At the year end all the institutions holding the Group’s financial assets were rated A-/A- or higher by Standard 
and Poor’s.
The credit quality of customers is assessed by taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are 
set and the utilisation of credit limits monitored regularly. 
Currency and interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets
The Group had financial assets of £9.4 million at the year end (2013: £15.7 million), comprising cash on overnight money market deposits and cash 
at bank. This attracts floating rates of interest.
The currency profile of the Group’s financial assets at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 was:
2014 2013

Sterling 7,955 13,616
US Dollar 909 1,871
Euro 577 232
Total 9,441 15,719
Foreign currency cash balances are held on a short-term basis to fund cash flow requirements in these currencies.
At the year end £1.3 million (2013: £1.3 million) of cash collateral was held by Barclays in respect of a bank guarantee given under OFCOM’s ‘Funds 
for Liabilities’ regulations.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The mark to market value of the interest rate swaps and forward contracts at 31 March 2014 was a liability of £1.8 million (2013: £3.2million). 
Interest rate swaps are accounted for by adjusting the interest cost on the floating debt return. The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities 
is obtained from third party sources. The movement in mark to market value is reflected in reserves and is shown below:
 £’000
Hedging reserve 
31 March 2013 (2,363)
Movement in the year 1,377
31 March 2014 (986)
The effectiveness of the interest rate swaps was tested quarterly throughout the period, and at the year end, and all are considered to be effective 
cash flow hedges. There are no other significant differences between the fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and their book value.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
 I quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1); 
 I inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly 
(that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and 
 I inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). 
All of the Group’s financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 2.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, support the growth of the business 
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of its gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total 
capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet) 
less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is shown in the table below and is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
 2014 2013

Net debt 74,976 88,218
Total equity 85,153 82,642
Total capital 160,129 170,860
Under the Group’s £200 million revolving credit facility the Group is required to comply annually with certain financial and non-financial covenants. 
The Group is required to maintain a minimum interest cover ratio and a maximum net debt: EBITDA ratio. Both financial covenants were tested and 
complied with throughout the year and at the year end. The Board monitors both covenant compliance and net debt performance on a regular basis.

28 Retirement benefit obligation – consolidated
Defined contribution schemes
The Company operates defined contribution schemes, which are open to all eligible employees. Contributions charged to the income statement 
in respect of defined contribution schemes amounted to £3.9 million (2013: £3.7 million).
Defined benefit schemes
The principal defined benefit scheme at 31 March 2014 was the Kingston Communications Pension Scheme, which is a funded scheme and provides 
defined benefits based on final pensionable salary. The assets of the scheme are held separately from the assets of the Group in trustee administered 
funds. The Company operates also a second funded defined benefit scheme, the Kingston Communications (Data) Pension Scheme. Both schemes 
are closed to both new members and future accrual.
The defined benefit schemes are operated in the UK under the same regulatory frameworks. Both of the schemes are final salary pension schemes, 
which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends on members’ 
length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. In the schemes, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with 
the retail price index. In addition to this inflationary risk, the schemes face the same risks, as described below. 
All of the benefit payments are from trustee administered funds. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice, as is the 
nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Responsibility for governance of the plans 
– including investment decisions and contribution schedules – lies jointly with the Group and the Trustees. The Trustees must be composed of 
representatives of the Group and scheme participants in accordance with the scheme’s regulations.
Parent company
KCH (Holdings) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, is responsible for all obligations and liabilities of the schemes. An equivalent liability 
has been provided in the accounts of KCH (Holdings) Limited.
The Parent company provides a guarantee to both defined benefit schemes, whereby if KCH (Holdings) Limited is unable to meet its obligations to the 
schemes, such obligations would be met by the Parent company. No liability has been recognised in respect of the guarantee at 31 March 2014 (2013: £Nil).
Most recent valuations

Funding
Asset-backed partnership
On 24 March 2014, the Group reached an agreement with the Trustees to provide further funding of the Schemes’ current deficit position through 
the asset-backed Partnership (“the Partnership”) that had been previously established during the year ended 31 March 2013.
As part of this agreement, a loan note of £20.0 million was secured over the Group network assets. As partner in the Partnership, the pension schemes 
are entitled to an annual income distribution of £1.6 million, rising in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) (capped at 5%) over a potential period 
of 15 years. The total value of this income distribution to the Schemes is £16.0 million which provided an immediate improvement to the funding 
deficit. As part of the agreement with the Trustees, there is no requirement for the Group to pay any deficit payments in the year ended 31 March 2014.
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the pension schemes in the Partnership does not represent a plan asset for the purpose of the Group’s 
consolidated accounts. The distribution of the Partnership’s profits to the pension schemes are reflected as pension contributions in these Group 
accounts on a cash basis.
Employer contributions for the year ended 31 March 2014
The disclosures below are for the two schemes combined.
Contributions into the two defined benefit schemes during the year were as follows:
2014 2013
 £’000 £’000
Deficit payments 788 575
Existing committed deficit recovery payments due over the financial years ending 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016 are £2.0 million per annum.
Main financial assumptions
2014 2013
per annum per annum
 % %
RPI inflation 3.40 3.40
CPI inflation 2.40 2.40
Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.40 2.40
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.30 4.60
Expected return on plan assets — 5.56
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables, which allow for future improvements in life expectancy. The effect of these tables are that:
 I a future pensioner aged 65 at retirement will live on average to age 89.0 (2013: 89.0) if they are male and on average to age 91.2 (2013: 90.9) 
if they are female; and
 I a current pensioner aged 65 will live on average to age 87.1 (2013: 87.2) if they are male and on average to age 89.1 (2013: 89.1) if they are female.
The defined benefit obligation reflects the assumption that 20% (2013: 20%) of deferred members will transfer out of the scheme over its life. Where 
such transfers take place, the value of such transfers are assumed to be 0% (2013: 0%) above the current IAS 19 value for individual members.
The key assumptions used for IAS 19 are discount rate, inflation and mortality. The sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation deficit to changes 
in the assumptions is as follows:
Impact on the retirement benefit obligation
Sensitivity Of increase Of decrease
RPI inflation 0.1% 11.3% (10.9%)
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.1% (12.8%) 13.6%
Mortality 1 year 24.5% (24.5%)
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, 
and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation deficit to significant 
actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit liability calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of 
the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation deficit recognised in the Group balance sheet.

Adoption of IAS 19 (revised)
The revised employee benefit standard introduces changes to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of post-employment 
benefits. The standard also requires net interest expense to be calculated as the product of the net defined benefit liability and the discount rate as 
determined at the beginning of the year. The effect of this is to remove the previous concept of recognising an expected return on plan assets.
The effects of the changes on prior year’s previously disclosed figures are as follows:

There is no impact on the balance sheet following the adoption of the revised IAS 19. In the cash flow statement, as the revised standard has 
no impact on Group net debt, the reduction in profit above is offset by an increase in working capital. The impact of the revised standard on basic 
EPS was a 0.41 pence reduction.
29 Other commitments and contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities existed at 31 March 2014 and at 31 March 2013 in respect of guarantees given by the Parent company on behalf of subsidiary 
undertakings, together with contingencies arising in the normal course of the Group’s business in respect of overdraft facilities. None of these guarantees 
are considered material in the context of the net assets of the Group.

Operational  
excellence Who we are
bwin.party is a global online gaming company . Listed on the London 
Stock Exchange (ticker:BPTY), the Group owns some of the world’s 
leading online gaming brands including bwin, partypoker , partycasino 
and Foxy Bingo.
The opportunity
Online gaming is set to enjoy strong growth driven by mobile as well 
as the adoption of commercially viable regulations by governments 
around the world.
Our proven and proprietary e-commerce platform differentiates 
us from our competitors and means we can enter newly regulated 
markets that prove attractive. We deliver world-leading gaming 
products and brands, across multiple channels and markets. 
The challenge
The transition to regulated markets brings additional costs as well as 
local gaming taxes. Sometimes overly strict regulation can  also mean 
that the customer is presented with a less attractive gaming offer  
than they were expecting. At the same time, building tailored solutions 
to meet local requirements, across multiple channels only adds to 
operational complexity .

2014 Performance
Current trading, outlook and dividend
• T rading in the first eight weeks of 201 5 was broadly in-line  
with expectations; a lower than expected gross win margin  
in sports betting meant that average daily net revenue  
was down 12% year-on-year and up 6% versus Q4 2014 
• Board remains confident in the Group’s full year prospects
• Recommended final dividend of 1.89p per share, a 5% increase 
over the prior year making 3.78p per share for the full year –  
a 5% increase over 201 3

BUSINESS FOCUS AND GROUP STRUCTURE ...delivered through  
a new , label-led approach...
During the second half of 2014 we revised our approach 
by shifting to a series of label-led, operational units in 
order to move faster and increase our focus on delivering 
a great customer experience. The operational tactics of 
each business unit are independent of each other but  
fall within a clearly defined strategic framework set by 
the Group. This new approach is realising operational 
improvements and significant cost savings.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT I joined the Board in April 2014 conscious 
of the challenges the Group faced and 
aware that a significant number of 
key stakeholders believed that our full 
potential was not yet being realised. 
My objective has been to take on board 
the views of shareholders, industry 
specialists and colleagues, and then 
draw on my prior experience to work 
actively with the Board and the broader 
management team to address each of our 
key challenges. These include external 
pressures such as the ever-shifting 
regulatory and technological landscape, 
and closer to home, the challenges, 
some self-inflicted, that have arisen 
from the 2011 merger which created the 
current Group.
Operational focus
The reorganisation of the business into a 
label-led structure, the separation of our 
technology into a stand-alone unit and 
the simplification of our management 
structure have together addressed the 
organisational weaknesses of our previous 
approach by speeding-up decision-making, 
r ed u c i n g co sts an d r et u rn i n g th e o pe ra tio n al 
focus to our customers. I am pleased to 
confirm that the targeted cost savings are 
on track, and will contribute €1 5m during 
the 201 5 financial year . The renewed focus 
within our business and the continued 
divestment of non-core operations have 
allowed a simplified restatement of our 
strategy under just three headings being: 
to focus our B2C operations on nationally 
regulated and/or taxed markets, to secure 
long-term strategic partners for our B2B 
business driven by sports betting, and to 
act responsibly . Management have 
accelerated their efforts to deliver these 
and in particular to put innovative product 
and customer insight as the key priorities 
for their teams.
Board composition
It is important that shareholders have 
full confidence in the Board at any 
time, but particularly during such a 
challenging period. My early review of the 
composition and structure of the Board 
identified the benefits of change that 
were announced prior to the 2014 AGM 
in May . Rod Perry , who steps down at the 
201 5 AGM, has been a valued member 
of the Board, serving latterly as Deputy 
Chairman, SID and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. His experience, 
counsel and constructive challenge will be 
missed. Likewise in Helmut Kern, who also 
steps down, we will be losing an energetic, 
inquisitive and experienced Chair of Audit 
& Risk Committee. I should like to thank 
them both for their contribution to the 
Group over an extended period and their 
support during my first year as Chairman. 
In Barry Gibson and Liz Catchpole I am 
sure we have recruited strong successors 
who will be valuable contributors to 
key Board decisions as well as effective 
committee chairs.
As part of my review it was also agreed 
that Manfred Bodner , a co-founder of 
bwin, could best contribute to the Group’s 
development through a consultancy 
arrangement, and as a consequence 
he stepped down as a Non-Executive 
Director at the conclusion of the 2014 
AGM. The strength and global awareness 
of the bwin brand are testimony to his 
efforts over many years on shareholders’ 
behalf. I should like to record our thanks 
for this legacy . Following the 2014 AGM, in 
accordance with the rights attaching to 
the shares acquired by SpringOwl, Daniel 
Silvers was nominated to the Board. 
Since his appointment in June, he has 
brought new insights to our deliberations 
and has been a valued and engaged 
member of the Board. 
Industry consolidation
Since May 2014 the external environment 
has continued to present the Group with 
a challenging backdrop. Although it was 
clear that industry pressures meant 
that consolidation was a likely feature 
of industry dynamics, the acquisition of 
the PokerStars business by Amaya Inc. 
announced in June 2014 was unexpected 
and raised concerns over both the likely 
trajectory of our nascent US business 
as well as the future competitiveness of 
our European offering. A new regulatory 
regime and gaming tax in the United 
Kingdom together with changes in 
VA T legislation within the EU present 
additional headwinds for the industry 
in 2015.
Additional value will attach to firms with 
scale, a diverse customer footprint and 
access to winning technology . Whilst as a 
Group we already possess each of these 
attributes, the wave of recent corporate 
activity has shown that consolidation 
may be an effective route forward, where 
it delivers strategic benefits supported 
by significant operational and financial 
synergies. Whilst we remain committed to 
and are accelerating the execution of our 
operating plans, the Board also continues 
to explore whether certain business 
combinations might deliver superior 
outcomes for our stakeholders.

“Having announced our shift to a label-led approach in

This programme is already improving our operational

key drivers of our long-term financial performance, with

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
CEO’S REVIEW Overview
Betting volumes on sports and casino 
in our core nationally regulated and/or 
taxed markets were both up year-on-year , 
however total revenues and Clean EBITDA 
were lower than expected. This was 
largely due to further declines in poker 
that also held back casino and the full year 
impact of ISP blocking in Greece. 
Progress towards a European landscape 
of commercially viable and well-regulated 
markets continues, albeit more slowly 
than we would like. While several 
European countries are at various stages 
in developing what should prove to be 
reasonable regulatory frameworks, 
others have yet to do so. Such attributes 
are critical for long-term success as 
they ensure that both the regulatory as 
well as the fiscal objectives of national 
governments are capable of being met by 
licensed operators.
In the United States, the size of the online 
gaming market in New Jersey remains 
some way short of original expectations 
and whilst new bills introducing online 
gaming legislation have been published 
in California and Pennsylvania, there is 
little visibility on when or if these may 
be considered for the statute book. 
At the same time, proponents of a new 
federal initiative to ban all forms of online 
gaming across the United States are 
seeking support to get a bill passed in 
Washington DC.
As w e l l as r e g u l a t ory chan g es, dev e lop m en ts 
in technology continue to create new 
opportunities, as well as challenges for 
our business. Expanding our mobile 
footprint is an exciting source of potential 
revenue growth and we remain focused 
on growing our presence in all products 
and across all platforms, wherever 
commercially viable. While differing 
regulatory rules and compliance protocols 
present additional barriers to us both in 
expanding our international presence 
and introducing new and appealing game 
content, we have made good progress in 
this area. 
We are improving our digital marketing 
and customer relationship management 
(‘CRM’) capabilities through the 
introduction of powerful new tools that 
are opening up a raft of new opportunities 
for e-commerce companies like  
bwin.party . As a technology integrator we 
are able to use our comprehensive set of 
data sources to provide a detailed view 
of customer behaviour .  As we embed this 
into our operations, we can differentiate 
the quality of our offer through better 
customer experience, personalisation 
and improved performance management 
in an increasingly competitive 
digital landscape.
Our transition to a label-led, rather than 
product-led approach is almost complete 
and has already increased transparency 
and accountability throughout the Group, 
speeding-up our decision-making and 
improving the execution of our plans. 
Outside of our core gaming activities, we 
have made good progress on growing 
Kalixa, our digital payments business. 
Following the acquisition of PXP in May 
2014, we have secured a number of large 
third-party contracts and concluded an 
international joint venture with Millicom 
to exploit payment opportunities in Latin 
America and Africa. 
We are making good progress on the sale 
of our other non-core businesses and 
assets that we expect will realise between 
€30m and €50m in aggregate. 
Whilst the industry faces several 
headwinds in 201 5 in the form of 
additional gaming and indirect taxes, the 
absence of a major football tournament 
and further projected declines in the 
European poker market, the year ahead 
also offers some significant opportunities: 
we remain on-track to deliver €1 5m of 
additional cost savings this year through 
several initiatives that have already been 
implemented; we plan to launch under 
licence in two new territories later this 
year , both of which represent material 
markets for our business; we will continue 
to expand our mobile footprint, led by our 
bwin label but also through partycasino, 
partypoker and Foxy Bingo; we are 
revitalising our digital marketing and 
CRM through a programme of investment 
in both infrastructure and people; and 
we expect to secure additional B2B 
customers that should ensure that our 
Studios business unit becomes Clean 
EBITDA positive during 2016.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  2014 – Operational highlights 
Operationally in 2014 we focused on 
continuing to expand our presence 
in nationally regulated and/or taxed 
markets, growing our mobile footprint 
as well as improving our operational 
performance through increased 
productivity and cost efficiencies.
Nationally regulated and/ or 
taxed markets
The proportion of the Group’s total 
revenue coming from nationally regulated 
and/or taxed markets increased to 56% in 
2014 versus 53% in 201 3. Having launched 
into New Jersey towards the end of 201 3, 
we sustained our network’s leadership 
position throughout the year and in 
December 2014 had a combined market 
share of 33%. In Belgium, another recent 
market entry , we also continued to make 
good progress growing revenue by 59% 
versus the prior year .
Mobile growth
Sports betting  
The launch of our new mobile sports 
offer (‘MS2’) helped to increase the share 
of gross sports betting revenue coming 
through mobile and touch devices to 
32% (201 3: 19%). However , the breadth of 
our geographic coverage masks the fact 
that in certain markets the proportion 
coming through mobile and touch is much 
higher . The annual figure also conceals 
the pace of growth throughout the year 
and in December 2014, mobile and touch 
represented approximately 35% of total 
sports betting gross gaming revenue. 
Casino & games  
Having added 32 new mobile games to 
our casino & games offer during 2014, we 
saw a marked uptick in the share of casino 
gross gaming revenue coming through 
mobile and touch that more than doubled 
from 6% in 201 3 to 14 % in 2014. 
Poker  
We launched single-table and then multi-
table tournaments on mobile that both 
contributed to a 126% increase in our 
mobile poker gross gaming revenues in 
2014 that represented 9% of the total, up 
from 3% in 201 3. With the advent of mobile 
devices with larger screens and increasing 
network speeds, mobile is proving to be 
an attractive channel for players.
Bingo  
As we reported at the time of the half year 
results, our Foxy Bingo mobile app has 
been particularly popular and we have 
seen a near trebling of bingo gross gaming 
revenue through mobile and touch in 
2014, accounting for approximately 24 % of 
total bingo gross gaming revenue in 2014, 
up from 6% in 201 3. 
Productivity and 
operational performance
Technology  
We successfully completed the migration 
of our French technology platforms in 
August 2014 resulting in improved poker 
liquidity for our network as well as the 
scope for cost savings as we began to 
decommission technologies that were 
no longer required. The absence of any 
major issues bodes well for the migration 
of our Italian platforms that will be 
completed this month and will also 
help to reduce costs as we close down 
legacy systems. This will complete the 
integration of platforms following the 
Merger . Our software release cycle has 
increased significantly during 2014 with 
a marked increase in automated testing 
and benefits from a much improved 
systems architecture.
Digital and mobile marketing  
Having embarked upon a significant 
investment in third party systems and 
infrastructure, we are improving our 
CRM and digital marketing capabilities 
with the goal of developing a single view 
of the customer irrespective of product 
or channel.
New label-led approach  
Our shift away from a product-led 
approach has allowed us to remove 
several layers of middle management 
whilst at the same time increase 
accountability for and visibility of projects 
that now reside within a single label. 
Whilst such a shift is not without risk (see 
Principal Risks on page 43), we are already 
seeing a marked increase in the speed 
of decision-making, improved execution 
as well as meaningful reduction in 
staff costs. 
POKER
We launched single-table and then 
multi-table tournaments on mobile 
that both contributed to an 126% 
increase in our mobile poker gross 
gaming revenues in 2014
BINGO
We have seen a significant increase of 
bingo gross gaming revenue through 
mobile and touch that represented 
24% of total bingo GGR in 2014
SPORTS BETTING
Mobile and touch represented 
approximately 32% of total sports 
betting gross gaming revenue in 2014. 
Further growth will be driven by the 
cross-selling of new products such as 
slider blackjack and slider roulette

CEO’S REVIEW CONTINUED 2014 – Other developments 
Industry structure
Increasing complexity , regulatory 
oversight and taxes mean that scale 
and technology have never been more 
important for long-term success. At the 
time of the half year results we stated our 
belief that the online gaming industry 
was set to enter a period of consolidation 
and that the Board believed bwin.party 
should be prepared to play an active role 
in any future reshaping of the industry , 
assuming further value can be delivered. 
We announced on 12th November 2014 
that we had entered into preliminary 
discussions with several third parties 
regarding possible business combinations 
to see if additional value could be created 
for shareholders. Since then there have 
also been some notable transactions 
which have occurred in the sector .
Further to the announcement in 
November , we continue to be in 
discussions with several parties 
regarding a variety of potential business 
combinations. Aware that there has been 
speculation regarding the status of these 
discussions in recent weeks, the Board 
can confirm that it has received a number 
of indicative proposals. T ogether with its 
advisers, the Board has entered a further 
stage of discussions with each party with 
a view to assessing the relative attractions 
of these proposals against the Board’s 
objective of creating additional value 
for shareholders. Whilst such proposals 
may or may not result in an offer being 
made for all or part of the Company , the 
Board confirms that as and when there 
are further material developments, it will 
make an appropriate announcement.
Payments
Having acquired PXP in May 2014, our 
Kalixa payments business continued 
to make solid progress during 2014. 
In September 2014 we announced the 
establishment of a 50:50 joint venture 
with Millicom, a leading international 
telecommunications and media company 
dedicated to emerging markets in Latin 
America and Africa so that we could 
seek to exploit Kalixa’s capabilities in 
both of these new and exciting markets. 
Since then, Kalixa has also succeeded in 
winning new third party business from 
customers including Abercrombie & Fitch 
and expects to secure further contract 
wins over the coming weeks.   
Disposal of non-core assets
H a v i n g a n n o u n ce d o u r i n t e n t io n t o f o c u s our 
resources on our core real money gaming 
business, we have made good progress 
since the year-end. On 20 February 201 5 
New Game Capital LP realised its only 
remaining investment through a placing 
of a 10.4 % stake in Gaming Realms plc. 
New Game Capital LP is now being wound 
up and the proceeds distributed to 
shareholders. As the largest shareholder 
in New Game Capital LP , the Group expects 
to receive approximately €4. 5m. 
Regulatory developments
The regulatory landscape across Europe 
and in the United States remains complex 
an d i s co n ti n u i n g to ev o lv e. A b ri e f s u m m ary 
o f some o f the k ey regu la tory developmen ts 
affecting our business is set out on pages 
41 and 42.
Impairment of intangible and 
other assets
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group 
regularly monitors the carrying value of 
its intangible assets and investments. 
A non-cash impairment charge of €104.4m 
(201 3: €9.4m) was taken relating to 
intangible assets within poker and social 
gaming, almost all of which was taken 
in the first half of 2014 and was included 
in the half year results and impairments 
of non-core investments including those 
held as available for sale.
Board changes
On 9 April 2014, Philip Y ea joined the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director and 
became Chairman at the AGM on 22 May 
2014 when Simon Duffy stepped down. 
Manfred Bodner stepped down as a 
Non-Executive Director at the AGM and on 
10 June 2014 Daniel Silvers was appointed 
a Non-Executive Director .  Daniel Silvers’ 
appointment was made under the terms 
of a relationship agreement entered into 
by amongst others, bwin.party , Emerald 
Bay Limited (‘Emerald’) and Stinson Ridge 
Limited (‘Stinson’) that was approved by 
shareholders on 28 January 2011 and to 
which SpringOwl Gibraltar Partners B 
Limited (‘SpringOwl’) became a party on 
28 February 2014 as a result of acquiring 
6% of bwin.party’s issued share capital 
from Emerald and Stinson together with 
the director nomination right.  SpringOwl 
exercised this nomination right on 
22 May 2014.  
In respect of the Company’s 
announcement on 16 May 2014 regarding 
Director changes and succession 
planning, the Board has announced the 
appointment of Barry Gibson and Liz 
Catchpole to succeed Rod Perry (Deputy 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director 
and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee) and Helmut Kern (Chairman 
of the Audit & Risk Committee), both of

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  Dividend and share buy-back
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 1.89 pence per Ordinary 
share (201 3: 1.80 pence) representing a 5% 
increase over the prior year and making 
a total dividend payment for the 2014 
financial year of 3.78 pence (201 3: 3.60 
pence). The final dividend, if approved at 
the AGM will be payable to shareholders 
and depositary interest holders on the 
register of shareholders and register of 
depositary interest holders respectively 
on 24 April 201 5 (the ‘Record Date’). 
Dividends will be paid on 27 May 201 5. 
Shareholders wishing to receive dividends 
in Euros rather than Pounds Sterling 
will need to register a currency election 
with bwin.party’s registrars on or before 
8 May 201 5. 
Using the authorities granted by 
shareholders at the 201 3 and 2014 AGMs 
to repurchase up to 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital, during 2014 the 
Company bought back 1,556,86 7 shares 
for cancellation at a total cost, including 
commission, of £1,579,437 . There have 
been no further purchases since the 
year end. As at 6 March 201 5 the total 
number of bwin.party shares in issue 
was 824,106,369 and the total number of 
voting rights in issue was 822,7 49,091 (total 
number of shares in issue minus 1,357 ,278 
shares held by the employee benefit trust 
in respect of which the voting rights have 
been waived).
Plans for 2015/2016
We remain focused on maximising both 
the accessibility and appeal of our gaming 
products and services and on striving to 
achieve operational excellence in each of 
our key business units. This will continue 
for the rest of 201 5 as we continue to 
improve our operational focus to deliver 
a great experience for our customers. 
As from 1 January 201 5 the business is now 
organised as follows:
• bwin labels (including Gamebookers);
• Games labels (partycasino, partypoker , 
Foxy Bingo, Gioco Digitale);
• US (including B2C, B2B and the World 
Poker T our);
• Studios The Group’s technology 
provided through arm’s length B2B 
agreements with both internal and 
external customers; and
• Other Includes Kalixa, social gaming, as 
well as Inter T rader , Winners and some 
smaller , non-core assets.
Shared and corporate functions such as 
finance, legal and HR are performed by 
the corporate centre. 
Establishing these new business units 
was the first step in transforming our 
operational performance and we are now 
accelerating this process with an even 
greater focus on core markets, channels 
and brands. 
T echnology will remain at the heart of 
this effort as we transform our Studios 
business into a stand-alone provider 
of B2B gaming services worldwide. 
Having built a fully-integrated and 
scaleable technology platform, with 
a proven capability of entering newly 
regulated markets with all products, 
we are now preparing to leverage this 
capability by driving incremental third 
party volume through the platform with a 
view to moving Studios into profit during 
2016. In addition to the Group’s own B2C 
labels, we are in the process of securing 
new B2B customers that are keen to use 
our technology , particularly for sports 
betting, which we believe represents 
a unique and valuable opportunity for 
the Group.
Having already exited a number of 
non-core businesses, we are continuing 
to review how value can be maximised 
for our Kalixa payments business that 
is making good progress following the 
acquisition of PXP in May 2014. As a result 
and given the increased focus on our 
core operations we have rationalised 
our strategic framework to the following 
three areas:
• focus our B2C operations on 
nationally regulated and/ or 
taxed markets;
• secure long-term strategic partners 
for our B2B business, driven by sports 
betting; and
• continue to act responsibly .
For further details regarding our business 
strategy see pages 28 and 29.

CEO’S REVIEW CONTINUED Using this new approach, each business 
unit has a clear set of objectives and 
operational KPIs for 201 5/16 that fall 
under one or more of the following 
four headings:
Increase B2C revenue from nationally 
regulated and/ or taxed markets
Each of our B2C business units are focused 
on achieving this goal. We plan to launch 
under licence in two new territories during 
201 5 as well as consolidate our position in 
other nationally regulated and/or taxed 
markets. Whilst a lack of new regulated 
markets opening over the past year has 
held back the pace at which we can make 
progress, we did increase the proportion 
of revenue coming from these markets to 
56% of total revenue in 2014 (201 3: 53%). 
KPI target: 
• Increase gross profit (net revenue less 
gaming taxes) from existing nationally 
regulated and/or taxed markets 
Grow mobile
Mobile represents a major growth 
opportunity for the Group.  The increase 
in smartphone penetration around the 
world in conjunction with improving 
connectivity is enabling huge growth 
in the amount of data consumed 
and time spent using these devices – 
mobile is where our customers want to 
consume  services, including gaming.  
Whilst the complexity of our international 
footprint, with its mosaic of regulatory 
regimes, presents additional hurdles, we 
are determined that each of our recently 
upgraded products is available on the very 
latest mobile and touch devices, wherever 
commercially viable, during 201 5.
KPI target: 
• 50% of gross gaming revenue 
coming through mobile/touch by 
December 201 5
Enhance the quality and breadth  
of our customer offer
As outlined in the Review of 2014 below, 
we have already increased the appeal  
of our products with significant 
improvements to our offer across each 
of our own labels and those of our B2B 
customers. However , this journey is 
only just beginning and we plan a raft of 
additional product upgrades and new 
features during 201 5. A release programme 
of new games and features on mobile as 
well as desktop will continue throughout 
the rest of the year , complemented by 
improved CRM and digital marketing. 
KPI targets: 
• Continue to add new content  
through a variety of channels
• Secure additional B2B customers  
for our Studios business unit
Operational excellence – reliability 
and productivity
Each of our objectives above cannot 
be achieved without continuing to 
improve our operational performance 
and allocation of capital. Our shift to 
a new label-led structure needs to be 
accompanied by a shift in working 
practices that combine to increase our 
focus on the customer . Through greater 
transparency and accountability , this 
shift will also help us to realise €1 5m of 
additional cost savings already identified. 
KPI targets: 
• Deliver €1 5m of cost savings 
as planned
• Improve system availability and  
reduce planned downtime
• Maximise the value of non-core 
business via divestment or 
strategic partnerships
Current trading and  
full year outlook 
T rading in the first eight weeks of 201 5 has 
been broadly in-line with our expectations. 
While betting volumes as well as overall 
player activity on sports and gaming 
(excluding poker) have been above last 
year , lower margins in sports betting and 
casino meant that average daily net 
revenue was down 12% year-on-year .
New gaming and other indirect taxes, 
continued pressures in European poker 
and the absence of a major football 
tournament this year represent significant 
headwinds in 201 5. However , the steps 
taken during 2014 to reduce costs, the 
early results from some of our recent 
product launches and other initiatives 
mean that we remain confident about  
the full year outlook.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  Review of 2014
Key points
• T otal revenue of €611. 9m (201 3: €652.4m) reflected the full  
year impact of ISP blocking in Greece and further declines in 
poker , partially mitigated by the FIF A World Cup; nationally 
regulated and/or taxed markets represented 56% of total 
revenue (201 3: 53%)
• Gross gaming revenue through mobile/touch grew by 99%  
to €1 53.2m (201 3: €76. 9m) with solid growth across all verticals
• Planned cost reductions of €30m within Clean EBITDA~ were 
exceeded and a further €1 5m of additional savings remain  
on-track for 201 5 
• Clean EBITDA~ of €101.2m (201 3: €108.0m) declined primarily 
due to lower revenues and increased start-up losses in the US 
• Non-cash impairment charge of €104.4m (201 3: €9.4m)  
against poker-related and certain other intangible assets  
and non-core investments resulted in a €94. 3m loss after tax 
(201 3: profit of €41.1m)
• Clean EPS~ of 4.8 € cents per share (201 3: 7 . 3 € cents)
• Current trading and outlook: betting volumes ahead but  
softer than expected gross win margins resulted in a decline  
in average daily revenues; trading overall has been broadly  
in-line with expectations and we remain confident about  
the full year outlook
• Recommended full year dividend up 5% to 1.89 pence per share 
(201 3: 1.80 pence) making a total FY14 dividend of 3.78 pence 
per share (201 3: 3.60 pence)

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014 Summary of results
T otal revenue fell 6% to €611. 9m (201 3: €652.4m) primarily 
reflecting the full year impact of ISP blocking in Greece and a 
decline in poker partially offset by the FIF A World Cup. The drop in 
revenue, together with start-up losses from New Jersey of €9.8m 
(201 3: €4. 9m) and €6.7m of losses from the Group’s social gaming 
activities (201 3: €6. 5m), meant that total Clean EBITDA declined to 
€101.2m (201 3: €108.0m).
While amortisation fell by 26% to €51.0m (201 3: €68. 9m), 
depreciation charges increased to €2 6. 3 m ( 2 0 1 3 : €24.4 m ) r e f l ecti n g 
th e i n c r e as ed cap i tal ex pe n d i t u r e; th e n o n-cas h i m pai rm e n t charge 
of €104.4m relating to the write-down of poker was the primary 
driver behind the reported loss after tax of €94. 3m (201 3: profit 
after tax of €41.1m). 
Basic loss per ordinary share was 11. 3 € cents (201 3: earnings per 
share 5.4 € cents). Clean EPS fell to 4.8 € cents (201 3: 7 . 3 € cents).

Growth in nationally regulated and/or taxed markets helped to 
mitigate declines in wagering from dotcom markets which were 
impacted by ISP blocking in Greece. While overall betting volumes 
fell 3%, the total amount wagered in nationally regulated and/
or taxed markets increased by 5% year-on-year driven by a 4 % 
increase in active player days and a 10% increase in new player 
sign-ups. This, together with an increase in gross win margin 
resulted in a modest increase in total gross revenue. However , 
promotions around the FIF A World Cup meant that bonus costs 
increased relative to both the total amount wagered as well as to 
gross revenue so that total net revenue was broadly flat year-on-
year . The addition of new B2B contracts offset the modest decline 
in overall net revenue so that total revenue increased by 1%. 
Higher marketing costs around the FIF A World Cup coupled with 
the full year impact of ISP blocking in Greece meant that Clean 
EBITDA fell slightly to €50.1m (201 3: €53.7m). 
Mobile and touch remains a clear priority for us and we grew 
gross gaming revenues through this channel by 69% in absolute 
terms to €83.8m (201 3: €49. 5m) representing 32% of total sports 
betting GGR (201 3: 19%). The popularity of our new MS2 mobile 
product has meant that in certain markets in December 
2014 mobile represented more than 50% of GGR.

T otal stakes were broadly flat year-on-year with the impact of ISP 
blocking in Greece and a declining poker business that remains 
a driver for partycasino, being mitigated by the full year benefit 
of New Jersey and increased cross-sell from sports betting. 
The cross-sell from sports betting tends to be at a lower gross win 
margin than cross-sell from poker as sports betting customers 
tend to have less activity on the higher margin casino games 
such as slots. 
T otal revenues from nationally regulated and/or taxed markets 
increased by 4 %, driven by a 5% increase in active player days, 
albeit with slightly lower yield. This contrasts with other markets 
where revenues fell by 9%, with the result that overall net 
revenue fell by 6%. Other revenue benefited from a full year’s 
contribution from Borgata’s online casino which helped to 
drive an increase in Clean EBITDA margins to 21.4 % (201 3: 20. 9%), 
even after an increase in cost of sales due to higher gaming 
taxes. While higher EBITDA margins softened the impact of 
the reduction in revenue, Clean EBITDA fell by 3% to €43. 5m 
(2013: €45.0m).

Despite a contribution from New Jersey , the challenges in 
international poker continued to impact overall revenue 
performance during 2014. Further declines were experienced in 
some of the Group’s key regulated markets, notably France, Italy 
and Spain. In addition, activity levels were impacted during the 
summer months by the FIF A World Cup in June and July . 
Despite these challenges, we have improved our product offer 
through the introduction of a number of new features and 
functions such as our universal sit-out feature and ‘casual cash 
games’ as well as a continuous effort to enhance our tournament 
schedule. Whilst seeking to attract players of all levels, we are 
particularly focused on ensuing that our depositing customers 
are well looked after and enjoy their time at the tables. 
We also made good progress on our mobile offering in 2014 so 
that both multi-table and single table tournaments are now 
available on mobile, helping to increase the share of gross 
gaming revenue coming through this channel that rose to 9% of 
poker gross gaming revenue (201 3: 3%). 
Whilst encouraged by the positive response of players to 
these initiatives, the market pressures outlined above meant 
that average daily net revenue declined by 29% to €21 5,600 
(201 3: €301,600). As disclosed at the time of the half year results 
and as detailed in note 10 to the financial information, in 
accordance with IAS 36 a non-cash impairment charge was taken 
against the value of our poker intangible assets totalling €88.4m 
in the year .

Gross revenue increased by 9%, driven by a strong performance 
in the UK where both Foxy Bingo and Cheeky Bingo continued to 
perform well despite increasingly competitive conditions. This is 
in sharp contrast to Italy that remains a challenging market and 
while Gioco Digitale maintained its market-leading position with 
an estimated 23% market share, the market continued to fall by 
14 % in terms of gross gaming revenue. The competitive nature 
of the UK market ahead of the introduction of the UK point of 
consumption tax resulted in higher bonus costs at 54.8% of 
revenue (201 3: 49. 9%) prompting a 2% decline in net revenue. 
The success of Foxy Bingo’s mobile app has continued 
throughout the year . Since its original launch in January 2014 
we have upgraded the application and seen even further 
improvement. For the year as a whole, the share of gross gaming 
revenue coming through mobile and touch has increased three-
fold reaching 24 % for the year as a whole (201 3: 6%). 
Other revenue
Other revenue increased by 14 % to €48. 9m (201 3: €43.0m) 
despite lower revenue from domain sales versus the prior year . 
Inter T rader and B2B both delivered strong growth but it was 
Kalixa that delivered the greatest year-on-year increase helped 
by the acquisition of PXP in May 2014. 
World Poker T our (‘WPT’) has continued to build its international 
presence through major sponsorship deals like Monster® 
and Hublot but also through multi-year licensing deals with 
companies like Ourgame in Asia. WPT is attracting significant 
attention through strong US TV ratings on Fox Sports and 
through its international programme of live events including 
the WPT 500 at Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas and Dusk Till 
Dawn in Nottingham, UK.
Cost of sales
T otal cost of sales increased by 2% to €91. 3m (201 3: €89. 5m), of 
which ongoing gaming taxes totalled €80.2m (201 3: €80.1m). 
As more markets regulate, cost of sales as a proportion of total 
revenue is expected to increase.

Other operating expenses

Customer acquisition and retention spend fell by 3% reflecting efforts to reduce spend in New Jersey and despite increased marketing 
around the FIF A World Cup. Affiliate spend also fell as we sought to reduce our reliance on this channel. Webhosting and technical 
services costs rose by 10% due to the full year impact of hosting costs in New Jersey . Customer bad debts fell to 0.4 % of revenue due to 
the removal of certain payment options and increased exposure to nationally regulated and/or taxed markets. Third-party content 
costs fell by 4 % due to lower casino revenues but increased slightly to 4. 5% of revenue (201 3: 4.4 %) due to the addition of more third-
party games during the year .

As promised, we continued to reduce Clean EBITDA administration costs in 2014, achieving €23. 5m of savings versus the prior year 
and the total now representing 34. 5% of total revenue (201 3: 36.0%). T ransaction fees fell from 4.6% to 4.4 % of revenue due to a change 
in mix in processing volumes as well as improved commercial terms from our suppliers. Staff costs and outsourced services were 
reduced by €11.1m and €1.2m respectively following a series of cost reduction initiatives throughout the year , although there was 
a slight increase versus the half year following the addition of PXP in May 2014. Other overheads were reduced by €8. 3m reflecting 
our efforts to deliver further cost savings. The net result was that Clean EBITDA administrative expenses were reduced by €23. 5m to 
€211.2m (201 3: €234.7m).

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
REVIEW OF 2014 CONTINUED Depreciation increased by €1. 9m due to an increase in capital 
expenditure. T otal amortisation, that is almost entirely related 
to acquired intangibles, continued to fall to 8. 3% of total revenue 
(201 3: 10.6%) as these assets are progressively written down. 
As noted above and in notes 10, 1 3 and 14 to the financial 
information, following a review undertaken on the carrying 
value of these intangibles, predominantly with respect to poker , 
an impairment charge of €95. 9m (of which €94.7m was included 
in the Group’s half year results) has been taken in the year . 
A further €8. 5m impairment has been charged against certain of 
the Group’s non-core investments including those held for sale. 
Reorganisation expenses of €7 . 5m (201 3: €7 .0m) were as a direct 
result of our efforts to achieve the targeted cost savings. 
Taxation 
The tax credit for the period was €3.6m (201 3: charge of €3.8m) 
which arises from a deferred tax credit. The deferred tax credit 
of €1 3.4m (201 3: €6. 9m) is related to the release of deferred tax 
provisions set up on the Merger arising from the amortisation 
and impairments of short life intangible assets. The increase over 
the prior year is primarily due to the impairment of intangibles 
during the year .

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  Current trading, full year outlook and final dividend 
T rading in the first eight weeks of 201 5 has been broadly in-line with our expectations. While betting volumes as well as overall player 
activity on sports and gaming (excluding poker) have been above last year , lower margins in sports betting and casino meant that 
average daily net revenue was down 12% year-on-year .
New gaming and other indirect taxes, continued pressures in European poker and the absence of a major football tournament this 
year represent significant headwinds in 201 5. However , the steps taken during 2014 to reduce costs and the early results from some  
of our recent product launches and other initiatives mean that we remain confident about the full year outlook. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.89 pence per share, a 5% increase over the prior year making 3.78 pence per share  
for the full year .
A summary of the current trading performance for the eight weeks to 25 February 201 5 in terms of net daily revenue relative to the 
same period in 2014 and also to Q4 2014 is shown below:

REVIEW OF 2014 CONTINUED Europe
T wo important milestones were 
achieved during 2014. First, on 14 July 
2014 the European Commission issued 
its recommendation on consumer 
protection and advertising as part of 
its action plan for online gambling. 
While the recommendations are not 
legally binding, they set common 
standards for all Member States and will 
act as a ‘benchmark’ when assessing 
Member States’ regulatory regimes and 
whether they meet the requirements 
set by EU law and could represent a first 
step towards greater harmonisation 
of regulatory frameworks across the 
EU. The recommendation therefore 
complements the Commission’s legal 
approach of re-launching pending and 
new infringement procedures as part of 
its 2012 action plan on online gambling. 
Second, on 16 October 2014 the European 
Commission confirmed that it would be 
taking Sweden to the Court of Justice for 
the European Union (‘CJEU’) for alleged 
breaches of EU law regarding its gambling 
regulations. Having first initiated an 
infringement against Sweden in 2007 , 
this is the first time that the Commission 
has launched such legal proceedings 
against a Member State. In a press release 
issued at the time the Commission 
commented that: 
“changes to the Swedish gambling 
law in order to make it compliant with 
EU law have long been envisaged but 
never implemented.” 
With several other Member States having 
also received infringement notices 
from the Commission regarding alleged 
breaches of EU law in the field of online 
gambling, the Swedish case should 
encourage Member States to ensure 
that their regulatory regimes meet 
the demands set by the EU T reaty and 
encourage them to make the requisite 
changes to comply .
Germany
(27% of net revenue in 2014)
Having been informed that  
bwin.party was one of the 20 operators 
to be awarded a sports betting licence 
under the new State Lottery treaty , the 
licensing procedure remains on hold 
pending the outcome of a series of legal 
actions by unsuccessful applicants that 
are seeking to challenge the selection 
of licencees. A process to facilitate a 
review of the original applications that is 
a necessary step before the merit of any 
legal action can be ascertained, has yet to 
be approved and as such further delays 
seem inevitable.
It remains to be seen whether Germany’s 
evaluation of the State T reaty’s 
implementation indeed satisfies the 
Commission’s question of whether or not 
the restrictions imposed can be justified. 
Further complications may arise from a 
pending case at the CJEU that is due to 
consider whether or not the State T reaty 
is compliant with EU laws. A separate case 
at the German Federal Supreme Court 
has considered, amongst other things 
and having received input from the CJEU, 
the wider implications of the consistency 
of the State T reaty in the light of the 
originally proposed Schleswig Holstein 
regime. The ruling in this case is expected 
during the second quarter of 201 5.
United Kingdom 
(11% of net revenue in 2014)
The Group was granted a continuation 
licence in October 2014 ahead of the 
introduction of the Gambling (Licensing 
and Advertising) Act on 1 November 2014 
and from 1 December the Group has been 
accruing gambling duty . A legal challenge 
against the introduction of the tax has 
been mounted by the Gibraltar Betting 
and Gaming Association. 
Whilst the outcome of the forthcoming 
General Election on 7 May 201 5 may have 
implications for the land-based gaming 
sector , changes to the online regulations 
seem less likely . That said, changes to the 
way that horseracing is funded in the UK 
seem to be inevitable, changes that may 
then have wider implications for sports 
betting generally .
Italy 
(8% of net revenue in 2014)
T otal gross gaming revenue across all 
products for the Italian market fell by 
2% in 2014 to €683m according to official 
statistics with growth in sports betting 
and casino being more than offset by 
a 22% year-on-year decline in poker /
skill games and a 14 % decline in bingo. 
The industry continues to lobby for a 
change in the way that gaming taxes 
are levied, moving from turnover to 
gross gaming revenue and while some 
government documents appear to 
indicate that they may consider such a 
change for offline slots, there has yet to be 
any confirmation that such a change may 
be applied to online sports betting.
Regulatory overview
41
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  France 
(6% of net revenue in 2014)
According to ARJEL, the French regulator , 
online sports betting gross gaming 
revenues in France grew 38% to €227m in 
2014 versus €164m the prior year , driven 
by the FIF A World Cup. This contrasts 
with poker where gross gaming revenues 
declined 7% to €241m (201 3: €258m)
1
. 
Despite concerns expressed by the 
regulator over the declines in poker , there 
is still no concrete sign of any plans to 
improve the regulatory or fiscal regime 
in France. 
Spain 
(5% of net revenue in 2014)
According to data from the Spanish 
regulator
2
, the total online gaming market 
grew by 1 3% in 2014 versus the previous 
year in terms of gross gaming revenue. 
This again was driven by sports betting 
that grew by 21% due to the FIF A World 
Cup. Casino grew GGR by 17% while poker 
declined by 1%. Bingo remains small 
compared with the other products but 
grew by 7% year-on-year . The industry 
is still hoping to launch online slots in 
Spain later this year but an exact date 
remains unclear .
Belgium 
(3% of net revenue in 2014)
Despite an initiative to seek to restrict 
the licensed gambling offer this has not 
happened and in fact bwin.party was one 
of seven operators approved to offer live 
dealer games by the Belgian authorities in 
February 2015. 
Denmark 
(<1% of net revenue in 2014)
According to the latest figures from the 
Danish regulator
3
, the market in Denmark 
is estimated to have grown by 21% in 2014, 
driven by sports betting that is estimated 
to have grown by 30%. Casino grew 
by 8% while poker declined by 1 3%. 
Danske Spil, our local partner , remains the 
market leader . 
Other EU 
(20% of net revenue in 2014)
Elsewhere, there are moves to introduce 
legislation for online gaming in several 
countries including, Czech Republic, 
Hungary , Ireland, Romania, Netherlands 
and Portugal, to name but a few. 
The details of such proposals and whether 
such legislation may become law and 
when remain uncertain.
United States – New Jersey
(1% of net revenue in 2014)
New Jersey remains the largest regulated 
market in the US with a total gross gaming 
revenue in 2014 of $123m. The Borgata/
bwin.party network remained market 
leader throughout the year and in 
December 2014 had a combined market 
share of approximately 33%.
United States – other
New bills proposing to regulate online 
poker in the State of California have been 
introduced, however , with numerous 
stakeholders and a lack of consensus 
on some key areas including who is 
eligible for licensing, it remains unclear 
whether agreement can be reached so 
that the bill can become law. New bills 
are also being considered in other states 
such as Pennyslvania but again there is 
no certainty as to whether or not they 
will receive the requisite support to 
become law.
At the federal level, there is an effort to 
strengthen the Wire Act through a bill that 
contemplates a bar for all forms of online 
gaming in the US. Whilst it has received 
some support, there has also been some 
staunch opposition to the principle that 
the federal government should interfere 
with what has always been a state matter .

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
REVIEW OF 2014 CONTINUED Summary of principal risks
Technology The risk of developing  
and maintaining our own 
proprietary software
Regulation The risk that changes outside 
of the Company’s control 
affect its ability to operate 
and that without compliant 
systems and processes in 
place we could breach 
regulatory requirements
Taxation The risk that we have to pay 
increased taxation as  
a result of changes outside  
of the Group’s control
Shift to a  
new label-led  
approach
The risk that our shift away 
from a product-led approach 
to one driven by label may 
create additional operational 
risk in the short term
Country and 
currency risk 
Our international footprint 
means we are exposed to 
shifts in the global economy 
and exchange rates
There are a number of potential risks and 
uncertainties which could have a material 
impact on the Group’s performance over 
the course of the financial year and could 
cause actual results to differ materially 
from expected and historical results. 
T o mitigate against these risks bwin.party 
co n d u c ts a co n t i n u o u s p r o ce s s o f G r o u p- w i d e 
assessments that examine whether any 
risk has increased, decreased or become 
obsolete; identify any new risks, especially 
from recent key business events; and the 
likelihood of a risk occurring and what 
level of impact it would have on the Group.
Many of the threats and challenges faced 
by online gaming companies are similar to 
t h o s e f a ce d b y o t h e r l e i s u r e a n d e n t e r t a i n m e n t 
industries. They include competition, 
changes to consumer tastes, maintaining 
healthy financial ratios in compliance 
with banking covenants and loss of 
key personnel.
There are also certain risks that are more 
specific to bwin.party and to the online 
gaming industry . These risks and how we 
seek to manage them are summarised in 
this section.
T echnology (increased)
The Group’s customer offer includes 
products operated using different 
labels and gaming licences, the majority 
of which are driven by the Group’s 
proprietary technology . 
201 3 saw the successful completion of 
the dotcom player migration project 
and during 2014 our customer base in 
France was migrated successfully onto 
our target platform. The migration of our 
Italian customers to the target platform 
represents the last of our integration 
projects following the Merger and is due 
to be completed in March 201 5.
The fact that 88% of our customer base is 
already supported by our target platform, 
highlights how important our technology 
is to the Group. In an industry where 
service reliability and integrity are key 
differentiating factors, our continual 
commitment to providing a reliable, safe, 
secure, compliant and continuous service 
has been a key area of focus this year . 
Through the combined efforts of our 
T echnology and Internal Audit and Risk 
Assurance teams, an independent review 
of the Group’s Production Incident and 
Problem Management process was 
performed on behalf of the Audit & Risk 
Committee (‘ ARC’), highlighting risks and 
key areas for improvement. In parallel, a 
Group-wide initiative on achieving close to 
100% system availability was introduced 
and we have made significant progress in 
ensuring our customer facing systems are 
available for 24 hours a day , 7 days a week.
Other technology-related risks, such as 
continuing our operations in the event of a 
natural or man-made disaster , have been 
addressed with a substantial investment 
during 2014 and support from the IT 
Committee and consequently both the 
Group’s disaster recovery and business 
continuity solutions have been updated 
and tested during the year . 
With continuous shifts in how consumers 
choose and are able to access our services 
(via different devices and/or channels), the 
process of maintaining and improving our 
technology will become more complex. 
As mentioned elsewhere, the Group’s key 
focus in 2014 and 201 5 continues to be to 
improve our customer experience through 
an expanded mobile offer across all 
products as well as through maintaining 
high levels of availability .
Regulation (increased)
Focusing on nationally regulated and/
or taxed markets safeguards our gaming 
revenues from potential national 
legislation threatening to prohibit or 
restrict one or more of the products 
that we offer , or online gaming entirely . 
There are potential risks for the Group 
from all markets where regulation is not 
clearly defined or adopted, especially 
in relation to EU legislation and 
associated cases.
T o manage this risk, the Group continues 
to engage (either directly or indirectly) 
with national governments and regulators 
of to-be-regulated markets. The Group’s 
Compliance and Regulatory Affairs team 
keeps abreast of the regulatory landscape 
and reports to the ARC and the Board on 
any developments. However , it should be 
noted that most of the risks in relation to 
the regulatory landscape are outside of 
the Group’s direct control. 
Operating in nationally regulated and/
or taxed markets necessitates that we 
comply with the required rules and 
protocols. Currently , the Group holds 
licences for and offers real money 
gambling in 11 different territories, each 
with their own unique licence obligations. 
The need to sometimes develop 
bespoke technological, operational 
and promotional offers in each market 
requires significant investment. 
The Group is committed to meeting its 
licence obligations and monitors its 
compliance with regulatory requirements 
by performing reviews of its licensed 
operations on a periodic basis with the 
results reported to the ARC. The Group 
also submits the licensed entities to a 
series of external audits by regulators and 
industry specialists to ensure that policies 
and procedures are being followed 
as intended.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance 
Principal risks T axation (increased)
As outlined above the Group’s strategic 
focus is to operate in nationally regulated 
and/or taxed markets. Revenues earned 
from customers located in a particular 
jurisdiction may give rise to further taxes 
in that jurisdiction. If such taxes are levied, 
either on the basis of existing law or the 
current practice of any tax authority , or by 
reason of a change in law or practice, then 
this may have a material adverse effect on 
the amount of tax payable by the Group.
Group companies operate only where 
they are incorporated, domiciled or 
registered. The multi-location set-up of  
the Group gives rise to transfer pricing risk, 
mitigated by the fact that all intra-group 
transactions are documented and take 
place on an arm’s length basis unless local 
legislation or other business conditions 
make an arm’s length basis impossible 
or impractical. 
During the course of the year , a review  
on the transfer pricing arrangements  
was conducted on behalf of the ARC. 
The Group Director of T ax routinely holds 
workshops with senior management and 
business unit leaders during the course of 
the year. 
On 1 January 201 5, new VA T rules came 
into force across the EU impacting 
several areas of the digital economy .  
Gambling has typically been exempt 
from VA T but falls within the rules for 
VA T on electronically supplied services. 
Under EU law, Member States have the 
ability to apply VA T to gambling subject 
to certain limitations and conditions, 
and tax may be due depending on where 
customers are located and how Member 
States implement any exemption.  Whilst 
substantial uncertainty remains, in the 
light of the new rules the bwin.party 
Board expects to file for , and pay VA T in 
certain EU Member States. It is possible 
that VA T could be payable in other EU 
Member States.
New label-led approach (increased)
In 2014, the Group announced a 
fundamental shift in its operations away 
from a product-led approach (sports 
betting, casino & games, poker and bingo) 
towards one driven by label (bwin labels, 
Games labels, US, Studios and Other).
Whilst this shift to a new approach 
created some uncertainty for employees, 
continuous support through regular 
communications via location-driven 
‘T own Halls’ , webinars through the Group’s 
intranet and one-on-one ‘question and 
answer’ sessions with Human Resource 
teams have each helped to maintain a 
transparent and continuous channel 
of communication that has aided 
this transition. 
Having business units and labels 
resourced across various locations does 
give rise to specific location risks as well as 
decentralisation risks; however this new 
approach has allowed the creation of 
teams dedicated to specific labels rather 
than products enabling faster decision-
making, an improved customer offer and 
better service.
The Group’s corporate functions continue 
to be administered from the corporate 
cen tre coveri n g areas such as procu remen t, 
financial reporting, budgeting, legal and 
HR services, with appropriate service 
levels in place to provide each business 
unit with a benchmark of service quality . 
The 201 5 Internal Audit Plan as approved 
by the ARC reflects this new operational 
set-up and findings will be communicated 
to the ARC during the year ahead.
Country and currency risk (unchanged)
Whilst the continuing uncertainty in 
the global economic outlook inevitably 
increases the trading and balance sheet 
risks to which the Group is exposed, 
the diversified nature of the Group’s 
business means that such risks are not 
disproportionately different from any 
other commercial enterprise of a similar 
scale and international reach. 
Conditions in the Eurozone remain 
challenging and reference has already 
been made in previous statements to 
the challenging economic backdrop in 
several European countries, reducing the 
spending power of customers particularly 
in Southern European countries, which 
the Group has attempted to reflect in its 
financial forecasts. The weaker European 
economies are also increasing the risk 
of currency volatility and the potential 
for significant currency devaluation and 
business disruption if one or more of 
these countries exits the Euro currency . 
Accordingly , the Group’s treasury 
processes and policies have been revised 
with the aim of minimising the Group’s 
exposure to the Eurozone economic risk 
and to preserve our ability to operate if 
such events arise.
The functional currency of the Company 
and a majority of the Company’s 
subsidiaries is the euro. bwin.party’s 
treasury policy dictates that all material 
transaction and currency liability 
exposures are fully hedged with financial 
derivatives or cash. Consequently , those 
bwin.party companies that have adopted 
the Euro as their functional currency 
ensure their financial assets and liabilities 
in non-Euro currencies are equal and 
that any residual balance is held in Euros. 
With the so-called ‘GIPSI’ countries 
(Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy), 
if one or more of these countries exits 
the Euro then the Group may be exposed 
to a currency devaluation of its financial 
assets to the extent that the financial 
assets located in the exiting jurisdiction 
exceed its financial liabilities. Accordingly , 
the treasury policy requires that wherever 
practical and subject to regulatory 
requirements, the financial assets located 
in each GIPSI country are limited so they 
do not exceed the financial liabilities 
associated with that jurisdiction.

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED We decided some time ago that we would only succeed over  
the long-term if we adopted a structured, integrated and evidence-
based approach to responsibility , one which fosters innovation  
and goes beyond regulatory requirements. 
Our approach is to:
• understand the needs of consumers; 
• evaluate and innovate our gaming environment; 
• develop best practices for safe and secure e-commerce; 
• seek a transparent and engaging dialogue with relevant stakeholders; and 
• prove that we are doing all this – for real.
Commitments
Our commitment to ‘making responsibility real’ covers eight strategic initiatives  
that we and our stakeholders consider to be important for a sustainable business.
Martin Weigold, Chief Financial Officer , has executive responsibility for our corporate 
responsibility matters, a role he has held since 2005. The overall process is overseen  
by the Audit & Risk Committee comprising three Independent Non-Executive Directors – 
Helmut Kern, Rod Perry and Sylvia Coleman.
 R ea l i n no v at i on 
Real prevention 
Real fairness 
Real governance 
Real people 
Real engagement
Real care for the

Real compliance 
 We use scientific evidence to create a gaming 
environment that is pioneering for the industry in 
terms of innovative, safe and responsible products 
and services.
 We’ve developed an evidence-based Responsible 
Gaming framework to identify risky behaviour and 
help prevent gaming-related problems.
 We create a fair gaming environment that provides 
consumer protection, prevents fraud and fosters the 
integrity of sports. 
We identify, measure and strive to reduce our  
impact on the environment.
 We comply with national and European regulations  
and set the standards for the security of gaming.
We empower employees to realise their individual 
potential and ensure that they remain our greatest 
asset over the long-term.
We enable employees to contribute to local 
communities by creating opportunities to volunteer  
and support good causes. We also contribute to  
society through charitable donations. 
We give our stakeholders a full and clear picture  
of the performance of our management team and  
how the Company is run.
Individualised player protection – 
predictive model
Since 2005 we have been working in 
partnership with the Division on Addiction 
(‘DOA’), Cambridge Health Alliance, a 
Harvard Medical School teaching affiliate, 
to help us establish an evidence-based 
framework for player protection. 
In 2014 we launched our predictive model, 
a pioneering algorithm developed in 
conjunction with the DOA which assists 
in the early detection of possible gaming-
related problems for our customers. 
By applying the predictive model to our 
customers’ gaming behaviour , we are 
better equipped to identify players that 
may be at risk and intervene early with 
tailored and tiered solutions to ensure 
our customers play within their limits and 
gaming remains a fun and safe pastime. 
For more information about our approach 
to individualised player protection see our 
Spotlight on player protection on page 48.

Community and the environment
Environmental awareness and supporting 
our local communities are important 
elements of the Group’s overall approach 
to responsibility . We contribute to 
a variety of responsible gaming 
organisations and charities. 
In 2014 we donated more than €400,000 
to research into player protection and 
to responsible gaming organisations 
including The Responsible Gambling 
T rust, Gambling Therapy , Spielsuchthilfe, 
Spielsuchtambulanz of the TU Dresden, 
Federacion Espanola de Jogadores de 
Azar Rehabilitados, Jogo Responsavel, 
University Clinic Aarhus and the US 
National Council on Problem Gambling.
The Group’s pro bono scheme encourages 
employees to give some of their time 
to good causes. In 2014 our employees 
donated 1,882 hours of their time to a 
diverse range of causes across the globe 
including setting up computer labs in 
schools in India, raising funds for cancer 
research, helping at centres for elderly and 
homeless people, supporting 
children’s charities and environmental 
projects including tree planting and 
helping with repair and construction 
work at a big cat sanctuary . In total our 
employees raised over £1 50,000 for a 
broad range of good causes through 
fundraising initiatives and by donating 
merchandise and event tickets.
Resource consumption and 
environmental impact
We are a low-impact company , but 
we are not complacent and monitor 
our environmental performance by 
measuring the water and energy we 
consume, the amount of physical waste 
we produce and the amount of CO2 gas 
we produce through air travel.
Key metrics for 2014 show that:
•  A total of 3,696 air flights taken by 
employees producing an estimated 
2,148 metric tons of CO2
•  Our highest energy consumption 
resulted from our eight data centres, 
which consumed 10.2 million KWh of 
electricity in total
•  On average, each full time employee in 
our six main offices every month used: 
• 233KWh of electricity;  
• 43 litres of water; and 
• produced 7 . 5kg of waste.
Our approach to the environment and 
the community goes beyond our own 
business. Our suppliers’ corporate 
responsibility agenda relating to the 
environment is also assessed before we 
enter into contractual arrangements. 
We believe that by aligning our interests 
we can make a contribution towards 
sustaining our environment. 
Employees
2014 saw the continued reshaping of our 
business including the reorganisation 
of our senior management structure 
midway through the year . This was the 
first step in simplifying our operations to 
remove duplication, as well as increase 
transparency and accountability .
Lower costs are an important bi-product 
of this new approach that has re-focused 
our business, sped-up decision-making 
and helped to improve the timely 
execution of our strategic plans. 
Increasing responsibility 
and accountability
Our shift to a label-led rather than a 
product-led structure has resulted in 
greater autonomy and accountability 
for our operational business units 
with reduced complexity and costs. 
This has been complemented by a leaner 
corporate centre that is focused on 
delivering services required by each unit 
at a competitive price.
Continuing our transition to Agile
We began our transition to Agile in 
201 3 with the aim of embedding its 
core principles across the Group by the 
middle of 201 5. Originally designed as ‘a 
methodology and approach for software 
development organisations’ the process 
can be tailored to other disciplines 
bringing about operational efficiencies, 
increasing productivity and the timely 
execution of business strategy . 
Our technology operations in Hyderabad 
are already fully Agile and the transition 
to Agile in our European offices is 
progressing well. With a common 
approach our development centres in 
India and Europe are working more closely 
together and through other changes 
made, continuous deployment of our 
system updates, removing the need for 
downtime and improving the stability of 
our platform is within touching distance – 
a key operational KPI for 201 5. 
46
bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
FOCUS ON RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED DISCOVER MORE AT : 
www.bwinparty.com/careers
Our reward structures have been changed 
to reflect and support our shift to Agile so 
that in 201 5 awards made will be driven 
largely by the achievements of specific 
business units and their operational KPI’s 
rather than an individual’s performance. 
The achievement of Clean EBITDA targets 
by the Group as a whole remains the 
key determinant of each unit’s available 
bonus pool.
In our Studios business unit, career paths 
for Agile roles are now fully developed 
and have been communicated across 
our India development centre with 
implementation in Europe coming in 
201 5. Skills certification has now been 
implemented and will be a key element 
in job progression for Agile roles within 
the unit. An additional benefit of this 
skills inventory is that it assists us in 
planning our priorities for learning and 
development planning. 
Across the Group and as part of our new 
performance management process 
which was introduced in 2014, employees 
were able to request 360° feedback. 
140 employees took part in the initiative 
and received tailored feedback and 
advice to help them develop and plan 
their career . Another highlight of 2014 
was the drive to attract top quality 
graduates to our technology centres 
in Vienna and Hyderabad. 201 5 will see 
two groups of graduate hires joining 
fast-track development programmes 
in each location.
Engagement
Structural and operational changes 
always bring a level of uncertainty but 
we are optimistic that the changes we 
are making will have a long-term positive 
impact on the overall level of engagement 
across the Group. In 2014 we introduced 
more transparent and regular Group-
wide communications through multiple 
channels to keep employees informed 
on the progress of our transformation. 
Initiatives such as global CEO video 
conferences, business-focused webinars 
and discussion forums have been 
particularly well-received. 
Leadership 
One of the aims of the transformation 
programme was to increase responsibility 
and accountability . During 2014, 60 leaders 
from across the Group participated in a 
detailed 360° feedback programme based 
on the T ransformational Leadership 
model. The aim was to ensure that those 
in a management role with increased 
autonomy and control had the necessary 
support in place to develop their 
business leadership. 
Employee statistics – 2014
bwin.party is a highly diverse and 
culturally rich organisation with our 
workforce comprising 63 different 
nationalities making it both an 
interesting as well as a challenging place 
to work. Overcoming those challenges 
requires passion, insight and creativity 
– each of which lie at the heart of our 
corporate values.
The continued transformation of  
bwin.party has had an inevitable 
knock-on effect on employee numbers. 
We had 2,311 employees at the end of 
2014, a net reduction over the year of 
around 16.6% that comprised a mixture 
of voluntary attrition at a manageable 
19. 5%, redundancies and new hires to 
strengthen some business areas. 
Our future success depends upon the 
skills, knowledge and endeavours of our 
employees. We are committed to fostering 
and nurturing a culture that enables 
people to learn, develop and achieve, 
irrespective of their nationality or gender . 
Life is fast-paced and highly demanding, 
but for those with the right skills and 
temperament, there is great opportunity .

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  Our vision for responsible gaming has always been to create a safe  
and recreational gaming environment. Since 2005 we have worked in 
partnership with, the Division on Addiction (‘DOA ’), Cambridge Health 
Alliance, a Harvard Medical School teaching affiliate to examine 
gaming behaviour . The unique character of our studies has brought 
about a paradigm shift in addiction research. 
In 2014, nine years of research, in partnership with the DOA culminated in the 
delivery of a predictive model – a cutting edge and pioneering system to help detect 
possible gambling related-problems of our customers at an early stage. 
This is the first scientifically validated model for the early-detection of gambling-
related problems and is based on extensive research. A key focus of the research 
effort since 2005, it has led to the publication of more than 25 peer-reviewed 
publications. Through monitoring the gaming behaviour of our customers and 
applying it against the algorithm developed by the DOA, we aim to help protect 
our customers by early , tailored intervention should we notice indicators that are 
related to risky and potentially problematic gambling behaviour . 
Our aim is to ensure that gaming remains fun and does not assume too great a role 
in the lives of our customers by using the algorithm to intercept gaming-related 
problems before they emerge and by providing players with tools to support 
moderate and recreational gambling behaviour . 
Once players that may be at risk are identified, tailored and tiered interventions 
are undertaken. These range from information delivered to the player as well as 
a manual investigation that can lead to exclusion if further evidence of gambling-
related problems is confirmed. Such an approach ensures the greatest possible 
freedom for customers playing within their limits, whilst helping to protect the 
minority that may be at risk.
This pioneering approach has effectively 
ended the ‘one size fits all’ approach 
to player protection. Instead of over-
protecting the majority of recreational 
players or not sufficiently protecting those 
at risk, through our model we have been 
able to implement a tailored approach 
based on our duty of care to:
• provide an informed choice to the 
majority of recreational gamblers;
• support players that may be at risk by 
helping them to maintain control over 
their gameplay; and
• protect problem gamblers and support 
them to seek professional help.
Practical application of the Predictive 
Model appears to affect consumer 
behaviour in a positive way . 
Early evaluation data appears to 
indicate a potential shift towards a more 
sustainable gambling behaviour . Not only 
did behaviour related to potential 
problem gambling decrease, but also 
churn by means of account closure 
was reduced.
One possible explanation for these 
effects could be that players are more 
aware of additional methods to protect 
themselves and can thereby gauge 
their level of protection more precisely . 
Another explanation could be that 
players value the proactive approach 
towards consumer protection, which 
as a consequence mitigates the risk of 
account closure because of a lack of trust 
in the operator .

business day-to-day .
How does the Board ensure it is effective?
Composition
The Board has a majority of Non-Executive 
Directors. Drawing on their various 
backgrounds and extensive executive and 
business experience, the Non-Executive 
Directors engage with the Executive 
Directors, who manage the day-to-day 
business, in formulating the direction and 
strategy of the Company . The Non-
Executive Directors oversee the 
implementation of this strategy and 
challenge management when appropriate. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
G o v e rn an ce C od e , a m ajo ri ty o f th e D i r ect o rs, 
excluding the Chairman, are deemed  
to be independent, helping to ensure the 
Company is run in the interests of all 
shareholders. The Chairman was deemed

Meetings without Executive 
Directors present
During the year the Chairman has 
met with the Non-Executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors present. 
Whilst the UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends these meetings be held at 
least once a year , the Chairman conducts 
these meetings on a more frequent 
basis, as they prove useful in reviewing 
strategy and its implementation and 
the performance of management. 
The Chairman reports back to the full 
Board any recommendations arising from 
these meetings.
Did the Board appoint any ad hoc 
committees during 2014?
The Defence/July Committee
The Board appointed the Defence 
Committee on 5 March 2014 to enable 
the Company to engage quickly and 
effectively with SpringOwl. The members 
were initially Simon Duffy (who chaired 
the committee), Norbert T eufelberger , 
Martin Weigold and Rod Perry . 
Philip Y ea was also appointed a member 
on 16 April 2014. 
The Defence Committee coordinated 
with the Nominations Committee in 
considering SpringOwl’s arguments for 
four of its nominees to be appointed to 
the Board at the 2014 AGM.
Following SpringOwl’s withdrawal 
of its AGM resolutions proposing the 
appointment of their four nominees, 
the Defence Committee was redirected 
by the Board to oversee the process of 
engaging with third parties to explore 
with Deutsche Bank possible industry 
consolidation options. The Committee 
was renamed the July Committee and 
members meet regularly with Deutsche 
Bank representatives to review and 
direct potential transaction discussions. 
The overall strategy adopted by the July 
Committee is set by the Board and the 
terms of any potential transaction are a 
matter for the Board to decide. 
Since Simon Duffy stepped down from the 
Board and the July Committee on 22 May 
2014, the July Committee has been chaired 
by Philip Y ea.
57
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  The IT Committee
The Group’s technology operation has 
become increasingly sophisticated in 
recent years, as the Group has entered 
more nationally regulated and/or taxed 
markets, each with their own regulatory 
requirements, multiple operational and 
server locations and a range of channels 
and devices through which players 
can gamble. As technology is critical to 
the business, in August 2014 the Board 
appointed an IT Committee to oversee the 
delivery of certain key technology-related 
projects including disaster recovery 
arrangements and a high availability 
improvement programme to reduce the 
amount of platform down-time to an 
absolute minimum. The current members 
of the IT Committee are Helmut Kern (who 
chairs the Committee), Rod Perry (who has 
a background in technology) and Martin 
Weigold. The IT Committee members 
meet regularly with senior technology 
executives to receive updates on projects 
and give guidance on prioritisation and 
overall direction.
How does the Board decide on making 
changes to its membership?
The Board has adopted a formal 
and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors by 
appointing a Nominations Committee 
to lead the process of appointment 
and make recommendations to the 
Board. The Nominations Committee also 
advises the Board on its structure, size, 
composition and matters of Director  
and senior management succession. 
A report from the Nominations Committee  
appears on pages 64 to 66.
How do Directors develop in the role  
and fulfil their duties?
A full induction programme is provided 
to new Directors, which is specifically 
tailored to the needs and experience of 
the new Director and the committees on 
which they sit. The programme provides 
corporate governance information 
provided by the Company Secretary 
which is both general in nature (e.g. 
UK Corporate Governance Code, 
remuneration best practice) and specific 
to the Company (e.g. the delegation of 
authority mandate, the risk register , etc.). 
In addition, new Directors are educated 
on how the Group does business and 
this process includes meetings with 
and presentations from the Executive 
Directors and senior members of 
management, such as the heads of bwin 
labels and gaming labels, head of US, head 
of Studios, head of operations, General 
Counsel, head of internal audit & risk 
management, head of regulatory affairs, 
investor relations director , tax director 
and HR director . 
New Directors may also meet with the 
Company’s external auditors and advisers 
as part of the induction process. After the 
induction programme from time-to-time 
the Company Secretary notifies Directors 
of courses and seminars conducted 
by corporate governance bodies and 
professional advisers that Directors may 
find helpful. 
Working with the Chairman, the Company 
Secretary ensures good information flows 
within the Board and its committees and 
between senior management and the 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company 
Secretary is the guardian of all Board 
procedures and advises the Chairman 
and other Directors when required. 
Agendas and accompanying reports are 
prepared for each Board or committee 
meeting and circulated via a secure 
data-room in advance of each meeting. 
Between scheduled meetings Directors 
are updated on business developments 
with email reports, management 
accounts and regulatory updates and 
where necessary the Chairman of the 
Board or the chairman of a committee 
will convene a conference call to discuss 
and reach agreement on material 
urgent matters. 
The Company Secretary is available to all 
Directors to offer guidance and advice 
on corporate governance, company law 
and share plan matters. The Company 
Secretary presents a report at each 
Board meeting updating the Directors on 
share capital and shareholder changes, 
Group corporate structure changes and 
corporate governance developments. 
bwin.party’s General Counsel is also 
available to all Directors to provide advice 
on general legal and regulatory issues. 
58
bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW CONTINUED In addition, a formal procedure has also 
been adopted allowing Directors to seek 
independent professional advice where 
they believe it is necessary in order for 
them to fulfil their duties to the Company . 
Board committees are also authorised by 
the Board under their terms of reference 
to retain external advice as required for 
each committee to carry out its duties.
In accordance with best practice the 
Board conducts an evaluation of the 
performance of the Board, its committees, 
individuals and the Chairman. For the 
2014 and 201 5 evaluation process, the 
Board engaged Lintstock Limited, an 
independent corporate governance 
advisory firm which works with a number 
of UK- listed and non-UK listed companies, 
to facilitate the process, which adopted 
the following process: 
2014 evaluation process
 
A list of evaluation questions is drawn up by the Chairman in consultation with Lintstock and the 
Company Secretary . Any questions relating to the performance of the Chairman of the Board are set 
by the SID in consultation with Lintstock and the Company Secretary .
Lintstock advisers may interview each of the Directors. This does not 
happen every year , but does happen at least once every three years. 
Lintstock did interview Directors for the evaluation in 2014.
The Chairman discusses the results 
of the evaluation with individual 
Directors where necessary and 
possible options for addressing any 
issues arising from the review. The SID 
does the same with the Chairman 
in respect of the report on the 
latter’s performance. 
The SID meets with the Non-Executive 
Directors to review the results of 
the evaluation of the Chairman’s 
performance. The SID then discusses 
with the Chairman these results and 
any further feedback from the Non-
Executive Directors.
The Board reviews the Lintstock reports and any recommendations and 
agrees any action to be taken.
The questions are circulated to the Directors via Lintstock’s  
secure website and are answered online.
Lintstock prepare a report on the results of the evaluation of the 
Board, committees and individuals, which is passed to the Chairman. 
Lintstock also prepares a report on the results of the review of the 
Chairman’s performance, which is passed to the SID.
The Lintstock reports are circulated to the Directors, together with any 
recommendations from the Chairman or the SID. For 2014 the results were 
circulated to the Nominations Committee first and then the Nominations 
Committee made recommendations to the Board.
59
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  What came out of the 2014 and 2015 performance evaluation processes?
The 2014 performance evaluation was conducted in April 2014 rather than earlier in 
the year , to allow time for the new Chairman to be chosen and ensure the process was 
directed to assist him with taking up the role. This 2014 process was also undertaken in 
conjunction with the Chairman-elect meeting with the Company’s major shareholders 
to understand their views on the Company and the way it was governed. A follow-up 
evaluation process was conducted in the first quarter of 201 5. The issues identified in 
each process are set out below, together with the action taken. 
2014 matters identified Action taken
Although there was no criticism of any Director , given 
the tenure of some of the independent Directors, the 
composition of the Board could benefit from some 
‘fresh blood’ and appointing someone with executive 
e-commerce experience. 
Rod Perry and Helmut Kern decided to retire at the 2015 AGM and the Nominations Committee 
implemented a search with Spencer Stuart, an international executive search firm, for three 
new Directors:
• a successor to Rod Perry, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee;
• a successor to Helmut Kern, Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee;
• an independent Director with experience as an executive in technology in the e-commerce/
digital world. 
Reduce the number of non-independent  
Non-Executive Directors.
Manfred Bodner agreed to step down at the 2014 AGM.
Adopt a formal process for discussing strategic 
issues on a continuing basis through a set-piece 
‘Strategy Day’ .
The Board held a strategic session with its investment bankers, Deutsche Bank AG in July 2014 and an 
all-day strategy session was held on 3 March 2015, facilitated by a third party adviser.
That the respective roles of the Audit & Risk Committee 
and the Board in the area of risk management and 
oversight be more clearly defined.
This matter has been clarified, so the Board focuses on the key business risks identified on pages 43 and 
44 assisted by the Audit & Risk Committee, whilst the latter monitors the remaining 34 major risks on 
the Group’s risk register (see page 72).
That the Board focuses on supporting the CEO in 
accelerating delivery and restructuring the Group so 
that it can best exploit both organic and inorganic 
business opportunities.
The Board reviewed with the CEO the business’s operational shortcomings and supported the CEO’s 
plan to simplify the Group to reduce complexity and improve execution, leading to the T ransformation 
Project being launched in July 2014.
2015 matters identified Action taken
Suggested improvements to the management 
reports for Board meetings. These include a CEO 
‘dashboard’ format to highlight more clearly the key 
issues and KPIs. Competitor performance analysis 
and more information on high-level technology and 
operational developments were areas upon which 
the Directors requested more information. 
The Executive Directors and Company Secretary are reviewing the management reports and, in 
consultation with the Chairman, will develop and adapt reports to address the requests made.
The Board would like to meet formally with the 
of Investor Relations Director and the Company’s 
brokers at least once a year .
The Board met with the Head of Investor Relations and representatives from Deutsche Bank AG in 
March 2015. 
Improve succession planning for senior executives. The Nominations Committee will focus in the first half of 2015 on developing the succession plan for the 
senior executives to ensure the plan is thorough and coherent.
Improve the process of reviewing past key Board 
decisions with a view to finding out ‘what have 
we learned?’
The Board is adopting a more disciplined and formal approach to reviewing past key decisions, which will 
be led by the Chairman. The Board has already reviewed in 2015 the ‘build or buy’ technology strategy and 
endorsed the recommendation to build less, focusing on developing proprietary sports book technology 
and unique differentiating products and buying in casino products.

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW CONTINUED How does the Board engage with shareholders?
The Company keeps shareholders 
informed of business developments 
and developments via its annual report, 
half-year statement and quarterly key 
performance indicator announcements. 
In addition, other price sensitive 
information is publicly disclosed via 
a regulatory news service. All these 
items of information are available on 
the Company’s corporate website, 
www.bwinparty .com. The website also 
contains other information about the 
Group and its business.
Throughout the year the Chairman, CEO, 
CFO, and Investor Relations Director 
meet with shareholders on request or via 
organised investor roadshows supported 
by bwin.party’s brokers as well as by 
attending and presenting at industry 
and investor conferences. During 2014 
there were more than 300 such meetings, 
hosted in the UK, mainland Europe and 
the US.
In addition, during 2014, the independent 
Directors met with certain major 
shareholders regarding the process for 
recruiting candidates to succeed Simon 
Duffy as Chairman.
The Senior Independent Director is also 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which contact through the 
Chairman, CEO or CFO fails to resolve or if 
contact is inappropriate. 
Major shareholders also have the 
opportunity to meet newly appointed 
Non-Executive Directors should they wish, 
but in practice our shareholders have not 
to-date made such a request. 
Who are bwin.party’s major shareholders?

has waived the voting rights in respect of the shares it holds. As at 6 March 2015 the Employee T rust held 1,357 ,278 shares

  On 29 July 2013, bwin.party applied to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (‘DGE’) for a Casino Service Industry 
Enterprise Licence. As part of the application process, certain substantial shareholders of bwin.party were required 
to submit individual Licence applications to the DGE or otherwise dispose of their shareholdings. Emerald Bay Limited 
(‘Emerald’), wholly-owned by Ruth Parasol DeLeon, and Stinson Ridge Limited (‘Stinson’), wholly-owned by James Russell 
DeLeon elected, pursuant to a divorce settlement and for reasons of privacy, to enter into a divestiture agreement with 
bwin.party and the DGE , rather than submit individual licence applications. Under the terms of the divestiture agreement 
executed on 30 October 2013, it was agreed that Emerald and Stinson transfer their entire holdings of bwin.party shares 
(58,498,667 shares in respect of Emerald and 58,498,666 shares in respect of Stinson) into separate trusts when the DGE 
granted the Group a transactional waiver in respect of its licence application. The transactional waiver was granted on 
8 November 2013. The trusts have to divest their bwin.party shares over 24 months commencing on the date that the first 
online wagers were allowed to be taken in New Jersey under the new regulations, which was 21 November 2013. In the 
event the trusts have not disposed of all their bwin.party shares by the end of the 24 month period, the Company will 
take control of the divestiture process and dispose of any remaining bwin.party shares in accordance with the disposal 
provisions in the articles of association over a 12 month period.
How does the Board oversee financial 
reporting, risk management and 
internal controls? 
The Board is required to present a 
fair , balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position 
and prospects. This responsibility 
to present a fair , balanced and 
understandable assessment extends to 
interim and other price-sensitive public 
reports and reports to regulators as well 
as to information required to be presented 
by statutory obligations. The Board is also 
responsible for determining the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is 
willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives and as a consequence it has 
to maintain sound risk management and 
internal control systems. The Board has 
appointed a committee of independent 
Directors, the Audit & Risk Committee 
to monitor these areas and report and 
make recommendations to the Board. 
Please see the Report of the Audit & Risk 
Committee on pages 6 7 to 76.
How does the Board decide what 
Directors and employees should be paid?
The Board is responsible for setting the 
levels of remuneration for the Chairman, 
Executive Directors and the senior 
executive team, which should be sufficient 
to attract, retain and motivate directors of 
the quality required to run the Company 
successfully , but a company should 
avoid paying more than is necessary for 
this purpose. The Board has delegated 
these remuneration matters to a 
committee of independent Directors, the 
Remuneration Committee. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Report prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee is set out 
on pages 77 to 86. The fees paid to the 
Non-Executive Directors (excluding 
the Chairman) are a matter for the 
Board on a recommendation from the 
Executive Directors.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  What are the relationship agreements 
with certain major shareholders?
Emerald Bay Limited (‘Emerald’) and 
Stinson Ridge Limited (‘Stinson’ ) entered 
into a relationship agreement with the 
Company when it floated on the London 
Stock Exchange in 2005, governing 
their combined rights to nominate a 
representative for appointment to the 
Board and governing the process for 
them selling their shares. This agreement 
was superceded by a new relationship 
agreement (the ‘Relationship Agreement’) 
which took effect on 29 January 
2011, having been approved by the 
shareholders at an extraordinary 
general meeting. Under the Relationship 
Agreement, Emerald and Stinson had the 
right whilst they both held in aggregate 
5% or more of the Company’s issued 
share capital, to nominate a suitable 
individual for appointment to the Board. 
This nomination right could be transferred 
to another party where Emerald and 
Stinson transfer 6% or more of the 
Company’s share capital to that other 
party . On 20 February 2014 Emerald and 
Stinson sold 8,304,977 and 41,524,886 
shares respectively (in total equivalent 
to 6.10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital) to SpringOwl Gibraltar Partners 
B Limited (‘SpringOwl’), together with the 
Board nomination right. In conjunction 
with this purchase, SpringOwl executed 
a deed of adherence in respect of the 
Relationship Agreement. On 22 May 2014 
SpringOwl nominated Daniel Silvers for 
appointment to the Board and he was 
formally appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director on 10 June 2014.
Under the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement if a nominee is appointed then 
the nominating shareholder is subject 
to the Company’s share dealing code 
whilst they maintain a representative on 
the Board. 
Once transferred, the shareholder 
that acquired the right cannot sell the 
nomination right and must hold shares 
equivalent to 5% of the Company’s 
issued share capital in order to maintain 
this right.
Androsch Privatstifung, New Media 
Gaming and Holding Limited as well as 
founder shareholders of bwin Interactive 
Entertainment AG also entered into 
a relationship agreement with the 
Company on the same terms as detailed 
above. This relationship agreement 
came into effect on 31 March 2011. 
Their representative on the Board is 
currently Georg Riedl. 
When is the AGM?
Thursday 21 May at 11.30 a.m. CET
A separate notice convening the AGM 
in Gibraltar will be dispatched to 
shareholders more than 20 working days 
before the AGM. The AGM notice will list 
each item of business, which will be dealt 
with by its own separate resolution. 
With the exception of Rod Perry and 
Helmut Kern who will both be retiring at 
the conclusion of the AGM, the Directors 
will each stand for re-appointment 
and there will be separate resolutions 
proposed for each re-appointment. 
All Directors will be present at the 
AGM to answer questions from those 
shareholders that attend. 
In accordance with best practice, the 
Chairman will exercise his discretion 
under the articles and call for all 
resolutions to be decided on by a poll vote 
rather than a show of hands. The voting 
results will be announced via a regulatory 
news service and published on the 
Group’s corporate website shortly after 
the AGM closes.
Does the Company comply with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code?
bwin.party endeavours to comply 
with all the recommendations of 
the Code. From 1 January 2014 to 
date bwin.party has not complied 
with these recommendations in the 
following respect. 
Prior to the Merger , fair market value 
(‘FMV’) options were granted by bwin 
Interactive Entertainment AG to Per Afrell, 
Helmut Kern and Georg Riedl, members 
of that company’s supervisory board. 
bwin was an Austrian company listed 
on the Vienna stock exchange and not 
subject to UK corporate governance 
conventions. The rules of the bwin 
FMV option plans did not provide for 
crystallisation of value on a merger and 
therefore the value had to be rolled into 
new FMV options under the  
bwin.party Rollover Option Plan (‘ROP’), 
a new Company share plan adopted 
for bwin option holders at the time of 
the Merger . This plan was approved by 
shareholders in January 2011. The Board 
has concluded that the legacy FMV 
options held by Per Afrell and Helmut Kern 
do not undermine a determination that 
both these Directors are independent, 
given the circumstances of the grant, 
the quantum of the awards relative to 
the size of their annual fees and that no 
further share awards will be made to any 
of the Non-Executive Directors. It should 
be noted that Per Afrell, Helmut Kern and 
Georg Riedl have not exercised their FMV 
options and will only do so once they 
have left the Board and then only after 
12 months from their departure date.

Customer and creditor payment policy
The Group is committed to prompt 
payment of customer cash-out requests 
and maintains adequate cash reserves 
to cover customer withdrawals and 
balances. Normally payments will be 
made to customers within seven days of 
receiving a customer instruction. In the 
case of other creditors, it is the Group’s 
policy to agree terms at the outset of 
a transaction and ensure compliance 
with such agreed terms. In the event that 
an invoice is contested then the Group 
informs the supplier without delay and 
seeks to settle the dispute quickly .
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the ‘Strategic report’ section 
of this annual report. The financial 
position of the Group, its cashflow, 
liquidity position and borrowings are 
set out in the aforementioned section. 
In addition, note 29 to the financial 
statements on pages 1 32 to 1 39 includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives; 
details of financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources together with a large number 
of players and long-term contracts with 
a number of corporate customers and 
suppliers across different geographic 
areas and industries. As a consequence, 
the Directors believe the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks 
successfully in the current climate 
despite the uncertain and challenging 
economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly , they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report.
Audit
The Directors who held office at the 
date of approval of the 2014 Annual 
Report, confirm that, so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which bwin.party’s auditor 
is unaware; and each Director has taken 
all steps that they reasonably ought 
to have taken as a Director in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information. 
 
Directors’ Report
T ogether with the CEO’s Review and 
Review of 2014 sections of this Annual 
Report and this corporate governance 
section (pages 52 to 63) constitutes the 
Directors’ report for the year ended 
31 December 2014 for the purposes 
of satisfying the obligations under 
the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 
(as amended).

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  What did the Nominations Committee  
do in 2014?
Under Philip Y ea’s leadership the 
Nominations Committee engaged with 
Spring Owl in April 2014 following receipt 
from SpringOwl of a notice nominating 
four individuals for appointment to the 
Board and requisitioning four ordinary 
resolutions to effect these appointments 
at the 2014 AGM. As part of his induction 
and in order to effectively respond to 
SpringOwl’s action, Philip Y ea met with 
many major shareholders to discuss their 
concerns or questions regarding previous 
and future governance of the Company . 
The Chairman-elect also instigated a 
Board performance evaluation review. 
Although there were no material adverse 
findings from the Board review or the 
discussions with shareholders, the 
Nominations Committee concluded 
that given the increasing complexity 
of the Group’s business and regulatory 
environment, combined with the length 
of service of a number of the Non-
Executive Directors and the need to 
prevent the Board from becoming too 
large and unwieldy , change to the Board’s 
composition was required. 
Following the Nominations Committee 
Chairman’s discussions with individual 
Directors, it was unanimously agreed 
that Manfred Bodner would step down 
at the conclusion of the 2014 AGM and 
that Rod Perry and Helmut Kern would 
both retire at the 201 5 AGM, once their 
successors had been selected. In addition 
to searching for candidates to succeed 
Rod Perry and Helmut Kern as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee and 
Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee 
respectively , the Nominations Committee 
concluded that the Board should 
also seek a candidate with extensive 
executive knowledge and expertise in 
information technology , market trends 
and technology delivery in consumer-
facing digital businesses (referred to as 
the ‘Digital Director’), to broaden the 
collective knowledge and expertise of the 
Board. An announcement to this effect 
was made on 16 May 2014.
Who are the members?
• Philip Y ea – Chairman (appointed 23 April 2014)
• Per Afrell
• Sylvia Coleman (appointed 21 May 2014)
• Rod Perry
With the exception of the Chairman, all the members are deemed independent by 
the Board. Simon Duffy chaired the Nominations Committee until 23 April 2014 and 
remained a member until 22 May 2014, when he retired from the Board.
What does the Nominations Committee do?
The Board has adopted a formal and transparent procedure for the appointment 
of new Directors to the Board by appointing a Nominations Committee to lead the 
process of appointment and make recommendations to the Board. The Nominations 
Committee also advises the Board on its structure, size, composition and matters of 
Director and senior management succession. 
The terms of reference for the Nominations Committee are available on bwin.party’s 
corporate website at http://www.bwinparty.com/AboutUs/CorporateGovernance/
NominationsCommittee.aspx.
How many times did the Nominations Committee meet?
The Nominations Committee met six times in 2014 and attendance was as follows:
Director
Attendance and total number of meetings to which  
the Director was entitled to attend
Per Afrell 6/6
Sylvia Coleman 3/3
Simon Duffy 1/2*
Rod Perry 6/6
Philip Yea 5/5
* Simon Duffy was unable to attend the meeting in May owing to a family bereavement just prior to the meeting
The Company Secretary attends all Nominations Committees to record meetings 
and provide advice to the Directors. The CEO is normally invited to attend each 
meeting and the HR Director is invited to attend from time-to-time to participate in 
discussions about succession planning.

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
Nominations  
Committee Report The main focus of the Nominations Committee for the rest of 2014 was to conduct 
the search for three new independent Directors employing the support of Spencer 
Stuart, an international executive search firm. The following process was adopted to 
achieve this: 
Throughout the process the Nominations 
Committee operated within the 
parameters of the Company’s diversity 
policy . The diversity policy ensures the 
Group engages, trains and promotes 
employees on the basis of their 
capabilities, qualifications and experience. 
The policy forbids discrimination or 
pressure to discriminate by its employees 
or others acting on the Group’s behalf or 
their employees, contractors or customers 
in respect of age, sex, sexual orientation, 
race, ethnic origin, marital status or civil 
partnership, nationality , disabilities, 
political or religious beliefs, or on any 
other criteria unrelated to an individual’s 
ability to perform the duties. The policy 
also sets out how the diversity guidelines 
impact recruitment, selection and 
promotion, learning and development, 
the management of part-time workers 
and individual employee responsibilities 
for ensuring enforcement and compliance 
with the policy . Owing to the breadth 
of diversity existing across the Group, 
diversity ratios or objectives have not 
been set. 
The Nominations Committee was also 
mindful but not beholden to the Board’s 
publicly stated aim of having at least two 
female Directors by the end of 201 5. 
The decision was taken at the start 
of the Digital Director search process 
to include Michael Fertik, originally a 
nominee proposed by SpringOwl, as a 
candidate for the Board membership. 
The Nominations Committee had 
gathered significant information on 
Michael Fertik’s background, experience 
and independence in order to respond to 
SpringOwl’s requisition and decided he 
was sufficiently qualified to be considered 
along with other candidates proposed by 
Spencer Stuart.
The Board considered the recommendations from the Nominations 
Committee and resolved which appointments to make
Each sub-committee met and prepared a specification for the role they had been allocated
Spencer Stuart ascertained the chosen candidates’ availability and interest in the 
role and arranged interviews with the relevant sub-committee members
The Nominations Committee met and decided on which candidates to 
recommend for appointment for each role
Each role specification was shared with the  
Nominations Committee and approved
Audit & Risk Committee 
Chairman Role:
Per Afrell 
Philip Y ea
Remuneration Committee 
Chairman Role:
Sylvia Coleman 
Philip Y ea
Digital Director Role:
Rod Perry 
Philip Y ea
The Nominations Committee Chairman split the Nominations Committee  
members into three teams and assigned a role to each team.
The specification for each role was given to Spencer Stuart and it 
commenced a search for individuals who met the criteria for each role
Long-lists of candidates with biographies for each role were presented to 
each sub-committee by Spencer Stuart and each sub-committee reviewed 
its long-list and short-listed candidates to be approached for interview. 
The short-lists were reviewed by the Nominations Committee before then 
being passed to Spencer Stuart
Candidates were interviewed by the relevant sub-committee, which then 
reported its feedback and recommendation to the other Nominations 
Committee members. The candidates also met with the CEO to give them 
the opportunity to ask questions about the business
65
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  Shareholders should be aware that it 
has always proved challenging to find 
appropriately qualified candidates willing 
to serve as a Non-Executive Director of 
an online gaming company based in 
Gibraltar . This can be because of perceived 
regulatory and/or potential personal 
moral challenges associated with the 
sector . A significant number of candidates 
at an early stage of the discussions 
decide they do not wish to proceed in 
the process.
Following this process , the Board 
appointed Barry Gibson and Liz 
Catchpole as independent Non-Executive 
Directors with effect from 1 March 
201 5. Following the retirement of Rod 
Perry and Helmut Kern at the 201 5 AGM, 
Barry Gibson will take up the role of 
Remuneration Committee Chairman and 
Liz Catchpole will Chair the Audit & Risk 
Committee. The overlap of appointments 
was regarded as desirable to assist with 
the induction of the Directors and the 
smooth hand-over of responsibilities. 
Owing to Barry Gibson’s significant listed 
company experience, he will also become 
the Senior Independent Director following 
Rod Perry’s retirement.
The Nominations Committee is still 
considering and interviewing candidates 
for the Digital Director role. It is expected 
a recommendation will be made to the 
Board in the second quarter of 201 5.
How was the new Chairman selected?
As reported in the 201 3 annual report, 
the recruitment of Simon Duffy’s 
successor was delegated to a committee 
of independent Directors, Per Afrell, 
Sylvia Coleman and Helmut Kern. 
The selection process began in December 
201 3 and followed steps similar to those 
described above. 
Spencer Stuart was engaged to assist with 
the recruitment. The process resulted in 
a recommendation to the Board for the 
appointment of Philip Y ea as a Director . 
This was effected on 9 April 2014 on the 
basis he would then succeed Simon Duffy 
as Chairman of the Board when the latter 
stepped down at the conclusion of the 
2014 AGM. 
Why did the Company use Spencer  
Stuart for recruitment?
Spencer Stuart was engaged after a 
tender process involving a number of 
recruitment firms to support the search 
and selection process for candidates 
for the Chairman of the Board role. 
Spencer Stuart is a global executive 
and non-executive search firm and is 
completely independent of  
bwin.party . Following Spencer Stuart’s 
good work with this initial engagement, 
the Nominations Committee unanimously 
agreed to engage Spencer Stuart to find 
candidates for the three independent 
Non-Executive Director roles described 
above. Spencer Stuart follows best 
practice and adopts the Voluntary Code of 
Conduct for Executive Search Firms.
Did the Nominations Committee review 
other areas of succession in 2014?
The Directors considered succession plans 
for the senior executive team in 2014. 
In particular , the Nominations Committee 
focused on three areas:
• Emergency cover for the CEO in the 
even t he i s i ncapaci ta ted or u navoidably 
unavailable on a temporary basis. 
• The retention and succession 
implications for other managers should 
the CEO exit the business.
• The process for recruiting a CEO of 
Studios following the departure of Guy 
Duncan, the Product & T echnology 
Director in January 201 5.
• The process for recruiting a Human 
Resou rces Di rector f ol lowi n g the cu rren t 
incumbent’s decision to retire in 201 5.
During the review, the Nominations 
Committee has been mindful of the 
fact that whilst the Company has 
been in discussions with third parties 
regarding po te n tial b u s i n ess co m b i n a tio n s, 
implementing an effective succession 
and recruitment plan is likely to be more 
challenging and has advised the Board 
accordingly . The Nominations Committee 
will also focus in 201 5 on developing the 
senior management team succession plan 
to ensure it is thorough and coherent.
Has the Nominations Committee made 
any recommendations regarding the 
re-appointments at the 2015 AGM ?
In March 201 5 the Nominations 
Committee met and reviewed the 
proposed re-appointments at the 201 5 
AGM of: 
1. Per Afrell
2. Liz Catchpole
3. Sylvia Coleman
4. Barry Gibson
5. Georg Riedl
6. Daniel Silvers
7 . Norbert T eufelberger
8. Martin Weigold
9. Philip Y ea
On the basis of experience, performance, 
skills and commitment demonstrated, 
and also in light of the results of the 201 5 
Board evaluation results, the Nominations 
Committee advised the Board that it is 
appropriate to recommend each of the 
Directors for re-appointment.

financial statements and the external audit. Therefore, he is regarded as the 
Committee member with recent and relevant financial experience.

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED In respect of the financial statements 
and accompanying reports for the year 
ended 31 December 2014, the Company 
has followed the process detailed above. 
In doing so the Directors confirm that 
they have reviewed the complete 2014 
Annual Report and considered that 
taken as a whole, it is fair , balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for  
bwin.party’s shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy . 
What significant issues did ARC  
consider in relation to the 2014  
financial statements and how were 
these addressed?
Throughout the course of the year , ARC 
determined the following areas of the 
financial statements were of significant 
interest. These issues were discussed with 
management and the external auditors to 
ensure that the required level of disclosure 
is provided and that appropriate rigour 
has been applied where any judgement 
may be exercised. 
Impairment
As presented on the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the 
impairment charge for the year amounts 
to €104.4m. This charge comprises of 
impairments to: 
Goodwill €19.7m 
Acquired Intangibles €59.4m  
Other intangibles €16.8m 
Assets held for sale €5. 3m 
Available for sale investments €2.2m  
Joint ventures €1.0m
The weaker than expected poker market 
across both Europe and New Jersey has 
had an adverse effect on the projected 
utilised value of the poker assets. 
These have therefore had to be written 
down to their value in use. An impairment 
of €19.7m has been charged against 
goodwill, €59.4m against acquired 
intangibles and €9. 3m against other 
intangibles, resulting in an impairment 
charge amounting to €88.4m, which 
was charged in the half-year period to 
30 June 2014.
The remaining impairment charge of €7 . 5m 
against other intangibles, the impairment 
charge of €0.6m against assets held 
for sale and the €1.0m against the joint 
venture, all relate to the social gaming 
division of the Group’s business, which is 
in the process of being sold. €6. 3m of the 
total €9.1m social gaming impairment 
was charged in the interim period to 
30 June 2014. 
The remaining impairment charge of 
€4.7m against the assets held for sale 
relates to the Group’s small retail arm of 
the business, as disclosed in note 1 3 to the 
financial statements and the impairment 
charge of €2.2m against the (available-for-
sale) investments relates to a payment 
processing company , as further described 
in note 14 to the financial statements.
The Point of Consumption (‘POC’) tax 
payable since December 2014 in the UK 
gave rise to a review of the Group’s Cash 
Generating Units (‘CGUs’) with exposure 
to the UK market to consider the impact 
of this levy against the revenues derived 
from UK-based customers. 
In light of the above impairment triggers 
and in advance of the release of the 
half-year report to 30 June 2014, ARC held 
an impairment workshop in August 2014 
where the ARC members, the external 
audit team, the CFO, Finance Director 
and representatives of the Company’s 
Internal Audit department were present. 
During this workshop the Finance 
Director presented multiple scenarios 
which potentially could transpire in 
light of regulatory changes in certain 
markets. A detailed consideration of 
cashflow models, fair value calculations, 
management’s assumptions and 
their sensitivities were discussed and 
challenged at the workshop. The best 
estimates of the tax consequences 
with the Group’s Director of T ax were 
subsequently discussed. 
The impairment reviews of goodwill and 
intangible assets showed no indicators 
of impairment in respect of POC. 
The impairment to the poker and social 
gaming CGU’s were approved by ARC and 
impaired and disclosed in the half-year 
report for the period to 30 June 2014.
Further to this workshop, at the March 
201 5 ARC meeting, all further impairment 
charges were reviewed whilst the 
annual financial results were considered. 
ARC is satisfied that no other impairment 
charges are necessary .
Capitalisation of development  
costs and acquired goodwill 
When reviewing the half-year report for 
the six months to 30 June 2014 and the 
annual financial results, impairments 
to the social gaming arm of the 
business prompted a further discussion 
surrounding the capitalisation of 
development costs across this business 
unit and for the others. Management’s 
key assumptions over capitalisation 
rates, discount rates and the impact of 
regulatory changes and their sensitivities 
were discussed and challenged. 
At the March and May 2014 ARC meetings, 
when reviewing the acquisition of 
Servebase Group Limited, the acquisition 
balance sheet at acquisition date, the 
sale and purchase agreement and the 
fair value calculations for deferred 
contingent considerations were 
discussed. Furthermore, when reviewing 
the 2014 half-year and year-end results 
of the Group, the relevant disclosures 
surrounding this acquisition were 
examined in accordance with IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’ . 
ARC concluded that the key assumptions 
used in the cashflow projections in 
determining the recoverable amount of 
this CGU, the fair value calculation for 
deferred contingent consideration and 
the resulting €22.0m balance of goodwill 
are each appropriately accounted for 
and disclosed. 
As a result of these discussions, ARC is 
satisfied that the additions to the carrying 
value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets are presented fairly and accurately . 
Segmental reporting
As detailed on pages 26 to 27 , the impact 
of the Group’s shift to a label-led approach 
was considered with respect to segmental 
financial reporting. During ARC meetings 
in the second half of 2014, the impact 
of this on the financial statements was 
69
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  discussed with the CFO and the Group’s 
Finance Director . 
ARC concluded that, as financial 
reporting for the purposes of Board 
review and decision-making continued 
on the existing vertical products basis 
throughout the course of the 2014 
financial year , the impact to note 2 of 
the financial statements would only 
be applicable as from 1 January 201 5. 
For comparative purposes and to 
illustrate what the Group’s segmental 
reporting would have looked like had it 
been in place since the beginning of the 
year , this information has been presented 
on page 26 of the Annual Report. 
Provisions for legal and 
regulatory compliance
The Directors keep abreast of all known 
or potential regulatory or legal claims 
against the Group that may arise from 
the Group’s operations. The Directors 
receive frequent updates from the Group’s 
General Counsel. During the year , ARC 
reviewed the likelihood of the outcomes 
of various claims lodged against the Group 
and/or its Board members as disclosed in 
note 24 to the financial statements.
As there have been no material 
developments with the cases disclosed 
in note 24 to the financial statements, 
ARC is satisfied that no provisions other 
than the €1.0m in relation to market exit 
costs, included within other payables , are 
necessary at this present time. Should any 
of these cases develop materially during 
the course of 201 5, ARC will consider if any 
provision needs to be made in respect of 
such cases. 
Revenue recognition
ARC reviewed the judgements made 
in respect of revenue recognition and 
considered the accounting policies 
adopted in this respect. In particular , ARC 
assessed the recognition of revenue from 
new contracts, which involved a review of 
the business’s key contracts. The Group’s 
Internal Audit function include revenue 
recognition as part of their annual review 
cycle and report to the Directors on 
the appropriateness of the controls in 
operation and policies adopted. 
Internal Audit performed a review 
surrounding the change, incident and 
problem management processes in 
the software production environment 
and related databases of the Group’s 
proprietary gaming platform. The results 
of this review, together with those 
identified by an external consultant 
specialising in the Oracle environment, 
were reported to ARC in December 2014. 
It was determined that although no 
material issues were identified in respect 
to the integrity of the gaming data and 
the corresponding revenue postings, the 
Board would appoint an IT Committee to 
work with the product and technology 
management to oversee the resolution 
of certain issues within the technology 
function, specifically the disaster recovery 
arrangements and improving availability 
of the gaming platform. 
In addition to the reviews mentioned 
above, the external auditors performed 
detailed audit procedures on revenue 
recognition and reported their findings 
to ARC. The Directors were satisfied as a 
result of the combined assurance received 
from the internal and external audit 
teams, the revenue recognition treatment 
adopted in preparing these financial 
statements was appropriate.
Taxation
During the year , the Board reviewed the 
Group’s tax strategy and considered 
whether it was aligned with the 
Group’s commercial strategy , corporate 
responsibility position, approach to 
corporate governance, the attitude to 
risk and the Group’s business models. 
The Board also reviewed external 
parameters, including the impact on 
the tax strategy of the changing tax 
environment. The Board concluded that 
the adopted tax strategy is appropriate, 
supports the Group’s business strategy 
whilst simultaneously managing 
effectively the risks associated with tax. 
Owing to the dynamic nature of the online 
gaming sector the Board has decided 
to review the Group’s tax strategy and 
management with the Group’s Director of 
T ax at least once a year .
Furthermore, on behalf of ARC, the 
Internal Audit performed a review of 
the Group’s transfer pricing policies and 
procedures. The results of the review 
identified no material weaknesses, whilst 
recommending improvements to the 
existing procedures be adopted. 
As disclosed in greater detail on page 44, 
on 1 January 201 5 new VA T rules came 
into force across the EU impacting several 
areas of the digital economy , including 
online gaming. The Group took expert 
tax advice to help evaluate the impact of 
this change. Whilst there is substantial 
uncertainty about the application of these 
new rules, the Group expects to file for 
and pay VA T in certain EU Member States. 
This is forecast to reduce total net revenue 
and cashflow by approximately €1 5m in 
201 5 before any mitigating factors.
Who are the external auditors and how 
long have they been appointed?
During the year ended 31 December 
2014, BDO LLP was appointed under an 
engagement letter to act as auditors 
to enable the Company to meet 
its obligations to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the 
Listing Rules. For the purposes of filing 
the Company’s financial statements in 
Gibraltar , BDO LLP and BDO Limited have 
been appointed to act as joint auditors to 
allow an audit report to be issued under 
section 10 of the Gibraltar Companies 
(Accounts) Act 1999. 
BDO LLP and BDO Limited were 
originally appointed in 2004 just prior 
to the Company’s initial public offering. 
E ver since their initial appointment their 
re-appointment has been approved 
by shareholders each year at the 
AGM. Shareholders approved the re-
appointment of the external auditors at 
the 2014 AGM, with 99. 9% of the votes 
cast voted in favour of re-appointment. 
A resolution will be proposed at the 201 5 
AGM to re-appoint BDO LLP and BDO 
Limited as the external auditors.

AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED What is bwin.party’s policy on putting 
the external audit out to tender?
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that FTSE 350 companies 
put their external audit out to tender at 
least once every ten years. The current 
external auditors have served the 
Company since 2004 and their first 
appointment to the public limited 
company was in 2005. T aking into account 
the Financial Reporting Council’s advice 
on companies transitioning to putting the 
external audit out for tender to comply 
with this recommendation and the timing 
of the audit partner rotation, the Board 
has decided on the recommendation 
from ARC to put the external audit out 
for tender in 2017 . Thereafter the external 
audit will be put out for tender at least 
once every ten years. 
In 2014 the BDO LLP partner rotated 
having acted for five years.
How did ARC go about assessing 
the effectiveness of the external 
audit process?
ARC is committed to ensuring that the 
external audit process remains effective 
on a continuing basis. In particular , 
throughout the year ARC paid specific 
attention to the following areas: 
• Reviewing that safeguards against 
independence threats put in place by 
the incumbent auditor are sufficient 
and comprehensive. 
• Ensuring that the quality and 
transparency of communications 
with the external auditors are timely , 
clear , concise and relevant and that 
any suggestions for improvements or 
changes are constructive. 
• Exercising professional scepticism, 
including but not limited to, looking 
at contrary evidence, the reliability of 
evidence, the appropriateness and 
accuracy of management responses 
to queries, considering potential fraud 
and the need for additional procedures, 
and the willingness of the auditor to 
challenge management assumptions. 
• E valuating the results of the annual 
assessments of the audit firm including 
the audit firm’s responsiveness to 
previous suggestions for improvements 
(including those of the Financial 
Reporting Council’s quality reviews) and 
whether their internal processes for 
assessing and monitoring quality have 
been appropriate and sufficient. 
• Considering if the quality of the audit 
engagement team is sufficient and 
appropriate – including the continuity 
of appropriate industry , sector and 
technical expertise (including new areas 
of activity and changes in regulation or 
professional standards) and whether 
it has exercised sufficient objectivity 
to mitigate any independence and 
familiarity threats. 
Feedback is provided to the external 
auditors at every instance by ARC and 
through one-to-one discussions between 
the Chair and the audit partner .
What non-audit services did  
BDO provide in 2014?
ARC has established a policy regarding 
the appointment of external auditors to 
perform non-audit services for the Group 
and keeps this under continual review, 
receiving a report at each ARC meeting. 
This policy dictates that in the Company’s 
financial year , the total fees for non-audit 
services provided by the external auditors, 
excluding non-audit fees for due diligence 
on acquisitions and other specific matters 
noted below, should not exceed the total 
fees for audit services. The total non-audit 
fees as a percentage of the total audit fees 
paid to the external auditors was 5.8%.
In addition to their statutory duties, BDO 
LLP is also employed where, as a result 
of their position as auditors or for their 
specific expertise, they either must, or ARC 
accepts they are best placed to, perform 
the work in question. This is primarily work 
in relation to matters such as shareholder 
circulars, Group borrowings, regulatory 
filings and certain business acquisitions 
and disposals. In such circumstances ARC 
will separately review the specific service 
requirements and consider any impact 
on objectivity and independence of the 
auditors and any appropriate safeguards 
to this. As such ARC believes it appropriate 
for these non-audit services to be 
excluded from the 1:1 ratio set out above. 
In the year ended 31 December 2014 the 
total fees paid to the external auditors in 
respect of due diligence for acquisitions 
was €0.1 million.
The Company has also adopted a policy 
on external auditor independence to help 
ensure the independence of the current 
external auditors is not compromised.
Does bwin.party have an internal audit 
department and how is it effective?
Internal Audit & Risk Assurance Services 
(‘IA’) comprises the Group Risk , Internal 
Audit and Licensed Operations Review 
functions. Group Risk facilitates and 
advises on the Group’s risk process, 
for which the Company’s Board is 
ultimately responsible. 
The mission of the IA function is to provide 
independent, objective assurance and 
consulting services designed to add 
and protect value by improving the 
Group’s operations. IA assists the Group 
to accomplish its objectives by bringing 
a systematic, disciplined approach to 
evaluate and improve the effectiveness 
of risk management, control and 
governance processes. 
71
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  Through IA’s work and meetings with 
both the Executive Group Risk Committee 
and ARC, IA provides assurance to the 
Board that effective and efficient control 
processes are in place to identify and 
manage business risks that may prevent 
the business from achieving its objectives. 
The scope of this work includes:
• Providing assurance to the Board and 
executive management that effective 
systems and controls are in place 
and are being operated to manage all 
significant risks within the financial 
and business systems operated within 
the Group.
• Assisting the business in fulfilling its 
corporate governance responsibilities.
• Supporting operational management 
by providing best practice advice on 
internal controls, including practical 
recommendations to mitigate control 
weaknesses identified during the 
review process.
• Promoting effective control at 
reasonable cost and assisting 
management generally in the pursuit 
of value for money (e.g. by providing 
practical recommendations to 
improve the efficiency of the financial 
and business processes operated by 
the Group).
• Carrying out ad-hoc investigations 
based on any allegations made 
through the Whistleblowing Policy or 
as requested or directed by ARC and/or 
executive management.
The sections on risk below illustrate how 
IA supports the business through driving 
improvements to bwin.party’s control 
environment and by adding value in 
core business areas in the context of the 
Group’s risk profile.
The Board, with the support of ARC, 
has completed its annual review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
control, and is satisfied that it is robust 
and in accordance with best practice. 
In doing so the Directors acknowledge 
that bwin.party’s system of internal 
control can only reduce the probability 
that business risks might impede the 
Company in achieving its objectives. 
It cannot eliminate these risks and can 
therefore provide only reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
How are risks to the business identified?
The Board has overall accountability for 
ensuring that risk is effectively managed 
across the Group and, on behalf of the 
Board, ARC reviews the effectiveness 
of the risk process. IA facilitates a 
process,within defined parameters for 
risk assurance, in order that each business 
area can identify , assess and manage the 
risks in their respective area.

AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED This information is combined with a consolidated view of the business area risks. The top risks (based on likelihood and impact) are 
migrated onto a risk register , which is reviewed periodically by the Executive Group Risk Committee (‘GRC’), ahead of it being submitted 
to ARC for consideration and direction. In some instances key risks will be escalated to the Board for final decision, sometimes with a 
recommendation from ARC.

The GRC, composed of the leadership team and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer , met four times in 2014. The GRC aims to ensure 
that all principal risks are identified by agreeing on the significant risks identified by the workshops and management meetings. 
This process helps to further embed the importance of risk management throughout the core business functions – technology , labels, 
human resources, finance, regulatory affairs, legal and company secretarial.
IA held 52 individual meetings and eight 
workshops during 2014 to assess: 
(i) whether any risk had increased 
or decreased; 
(ii) whether a risk remained unchanged or 
had become obsolete; 
(iii) whether any new risks were now 
relevant, especially from recent key 
business events and changes; and 
(iv) the probability of a risk happening and 
its associated level of impact. 
Given the complexity of the Group’s 
operations, the risk register remains a 
central repository for management and 
the Directors to review and oversee risk 
issues effectively .
Risks identified are measured against a 
defined set of criteria used to consider of 
the likelihood of an occurrence and the 
associated potential Clean EBITDA impact 
to the Group. The extent to which an event 
is likely to occur is scored from 1-4, 1 being 
remote i.e. very unlikely to occur and 4 
being probable, where it has the potential 
to occur or has already happened. 
The impact is measured on a similar scale, 
where 1 is low, with limited damage to a 
stakeholder , and 4 being severe, which 
causes substantial damage to the Group’s 
potential to generate revenue and Clean 
EBITDA. The product of both scores 
gives rise to the residual risk score that 
determines the relative importance of the 
individual risk. 
73
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  These risks are then submitted to ARC which allows the Directors to raise concerns with management and request action be taken to 
mitigate particular risks.
How are these risks managed?
T o ensure our risk process drives continuous improvement across the business, the GRC monitors the on-going status and progress of 
key action plans against each risk quarterly . In addition, risk appetite and mitigation matters remain a key consideration in all strategic 
decision-making by the leadership team and the Board.
Currently the main categories of risk identified by this process are as follows: 
• Technology – the risk of developing and maintaining our proprietary software;
• Regulation – the risk that changes outside the control of the Group affect its ability to operate and that without compliant systems 
and processes in place the Group could breach regulatory requirements;
• Taxation – the risk that the Group incurs increased tax expenditure as a result of changes outside of the Group’s control; and
• Shift to a new label-led approach – the risk that our shift away from a product-led approach to one driven by label management 
may create additional operational risk in the short-term.
Each of these is described in more detail below.
Risk Mitigating Factors
Technology 
The Group’s customer offer includes products operated using 
different labels and gaming licenses, the majority of which are 
driven by the Group’s proprietary technology. 
2013 saw the successful completion of the dotcom player 
migration project and during 2014 our customer base in 
France was migrated successfully onto our target platform. 
The migration of our Italian customers to the target platform 
represents the last of our integration projects following the 
Merger and is due to be completed in March 2015.
The fact that 88% of our customer base is already supported 
by our target platform, highlights how important bwin.party’s 
technology is to the Group. In an industry where service 
reliability and integrity are key differentiating factors, our 
continual commitment to providing a reliable, safe, secure, 
compliant and continuous service has continued to be a key 
area of focus this year .
 
In August 2014 the Board appointed an IT Committee to oversee the delivery of 
certain key technology-related projects including disaster recovery arrangements 
and a high availability improvement programme (see the paragraph below) 
to reduce the amount of platform down-time to an absolute minimum. The IT 
Committee members meet regularly with senior technology executives to receive 
updates on projects and give guidance on prioritisation and overall direction.
Through the combined efforts of our technology and IA teams, an independent 
review of the Group’s production incident and problem management process was 
performed on behalf of ARC, which highlights risks and key areas for improvement. 
In parallel, a Group-wide initiative on maximising gaming platform availability was 
introduced in 2014 under the High Availability Improvement Project and the Group is 
making significant progress with this initiative.
Other technology-related risks, such as maintaining our continuing operations in 
the event of a natural or man-made disaster , have been addressed with support 
from the IT Committee and a substantial investment during 2014 and consequently 
both the Group’s disaster recovery and business continuity solutions have been 
updated and tested during the year . 
With continuous shifts in how consumers choose and are able to access our services 
(via different devices and/or channels), the process of maintaining and improving 
our technology becomes ever more complex. As mentioned elsewhere, the 
Group’s key focus during 2014 and in 2015 continues to be to improve our customer 
experience through an expanded mobile offer across all products, as well as 
ensuring high levels of availability.

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Risk Mitigating Factors
Regulation 
Focusing on nationally regulated and/or taxed markets 
safeguards our gaming revenues from potential national 
legislation threatening to prohibit or restrict one or more of 
the products that we offer , or online gaming entirely. There are 
potential risks for the Group from all markets where regulation 
is not clearly defined or adopted, especially in relation to EU 
legislation and associated cases.
 
T o manage this risk, the Group continues to engage (either directly or indirectly) 
with national governments and regulators of to-be regulated markets. The Group’s 
compliance and regulatory affairs team keeps abreast of the regulatory landscape 
and reports to ARC and the Board on any developments. However , it should be noted 
that most of the risks in relation to the regulatory landscape are outside of the 
Group’s direct control.
Operating in nationally regulated and/or taxed markets necessitates that we 
comply with the required rules and protocols. Currently, the Group holds licences 
for and offers real money gaming in 11 different territories, each with their own 
unique licence obligations. The need to sometimes develop bespoke technological, 
operational and promotional offers in each market requires significant investment. 
The Group is committed to meeting its licence obligations and monitors its 
compliance with regulatory requirements by performing reviews of its licenced 
operations on a periodic basis with the results reported to ARC. The Group also 
submits the licenced entities to a series of external audits by regulators and industry 
specialists to ensure that policies and procedures are being followed as intended.
T axation
The Group has companies and employees spread over a 
number of jurisdictions which creates tax risk if actions and 
decisions are being made in the wrong jurisdictions by the 
wrong companies. In addition, these companies contract with 
one another for services which are subject to scrutiny by local 
tax authorities. 
The Group’s strategic focus is to operate in nationally regulated 
and/or taxed markets. Revenues earned from customers 
located in a particular jurisdiction may give rise to further taxes 
in that jurisdiction. If such taxes are levied, either on the basis 
of existing law or the current practice of any tax authority, or 
by reason of a change in law or practice, then this may have 
a material adverse effect on the amount of tax payable by 
the Group.
 
Group companies operate only where they are incorporated, domiciled or registered 
across countries. The multi-location set up of the Group gives rise to transfer pricing 
risk, mitigated by the fact that all intra-group transactions are documented and take 
place on an arm’s length basis unless local legislation or other business conditions 
make an arm’s length basis impossible or impractical. 
During the course of the year , a review on the transfer pricing arrangements was 
conducted on behalf of ARC. In addition, the Group’s Director of T ax routinely holds 
workshops with senior management and business unit leaders during the course 
of the year . He also meets at least once a year with the Board to review tax strategy 
and management.
On 1 January 2015, new VAT rules came into force across the EU impacting several 
areas of the digital economy. Gambling has typically been exempt from VAT but falls 
within the rules for VAT on electronically supplied services. Under EU law, Member 
States have the ability to apply VAT to gambling subject to certain limitations and 
conditions, and tax may be due depending on where customers are located and 
how Member States implement any exemption. Whilst substantial uncertainty 
remains, in the light of the new rules, the bwin.party Board expects to file for , and 
pay VAT in certain EU Member States. It is possible that VAT could be payable in other 
EU Member States.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  Risk Mitigating Factors
Shift to a new label-led approach
In 2014, the Group announced a fundamental shift in its 
operations away from a product-led approach (sports betting, 
casino and games, poker and bingo) towards one driven by label 
(bwin labels, Games labels, US, Studios and Other). This will take 
effect in 2015.
 
Whilst this shift to a new approach created some uncertainty for employees, 
continuous support through regular communications via location-driven ‘T own 
Halls’, webinars through the Group’s intranet and one-on-one ‘question and answer’ 
sessions with Human Resource teams have helped to maintain a transparent and 
continuous channel of communication that has aided this transition. 
Having business units and labels resourced across various locations does give rise to 
specific location risks as well as decentralisation risks; however , this new approach 
has allowed the creation of teams dedicated to specific labels rather than products 
with faster decision-making, improved customer offer and better service.
The Group’s corporate functions continue to be administered from the corporate 
centre covering areas such as procurement, financial reporting, budgeting, legal and 
HR services, with appropriate service levels in place to provide each business unit 
with a benchmark of service quality. The 2015 internal audit plan as approved by ARC 
reflects this new operational set-up and findings will be communicated to ARC 
during the year ahead.
Is there a whistle-blowing policy?
The Group continues to adopt and 
publicise a formal ‘whistleblowing’ 
procedure by which employees can, in 
confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in financial or other matters. 
This procedure is set out in the Group’s 
employee handbooks having first been 
reviewed and approved by ARC.
The Group seeks the highest ethical 
standards in carrying out its business 
activities, and corrupt practices of any 
sort will not be tolerated. The Group is 
committed to tackling malpractice and 
it is the personal responsibility of every 
employee to manage and reduce the risk 
of malpractice in their business.
The Group actively encourages 
individuals, where they believe that 
malpractice has taken place, to make 
protected disclosures either internally to 
ARC or externally through the outsourced 
service provider , Expolink. Employees will 
be protected where they have reasonable 
grounds to believe that their employer , 
another worker or a third party has 
committed serious malpractice and make 
a disclosure in good faith.
The Group has a written policy available 
to all employees on the Group’s intranet 
and approved by ARC, which sets out 
the type of disclosure which is protected 
and also specifies to whom disclosures 
should be made and the process that will 
be followed. 
ARC is satisfied that robust and 
appropriate arrangements are in place 
for the proportionate and independent 
investigation of such matters and for 
appropriate follow-up action.
Will there be any changes  
to ARC in 2015?
This is my last report to bwin.party 
shareholders. As disclosed on page 21 I will 
be stepping down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the 201 5 AGM. Liz Catchpole, 
who was appointed to the Board on 
1 March 201 5 will succeed me as Chairman 
of ARC. Liz is a chartered certified 
accountant and serves on the audit 
committees of other companies and so 
she will be regarded as the ARC member 
with recent and relevant financial 
experience. Rod Perry is also stepping 
down from the Board at the forthcoming 
AGM and he will be succeeded on ARC by 
Barry Gibson.

Directors’ Remuneration 
Report
What does the Remuneration 
Committee do?
The Board has delegated to the 
Remuneration Committee oversight of 
the remuneration of the Chairman of the 
Board, Executive Directors and senior 
executives reporting into the CEO.
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on bwin.party’s

AboutUs/CorporateGovernance/
RemunerationCommittee.aspx.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors (excluding the Chairman) is 
a matter for the Board of Directors on 
the recommendation of the Executive 
Directors. No other Board committee 
carried out any remuneration-related 
matters in 2014. Remuneration Committee 
Chairman’s Statement
Headlines
• No salary increases for third year 
in succession
• No awards made under Element A of 
the BIP
• Awards to be made under 
Element B of the BIP at 6 7 .18% of 
maximum opportunity
• No proposed changes to 
Remuneration Policy
Shareholders will have read elsewhere 
in the Annual Report that the Company’s 
financial performance continued to be 
disappointing in 2014, with the business 
unable again to deliver revenue growth. 
The business continues to be affected 
by events beyond its control, such as 
regulatory uncertainty in the Group’s 
largest market, Germany , ISP blocking 
measures in a number of European 
markets and ever-increasing regulation 
increasing the complexity of operating 
in multiple markets. E vents, however , 
within the Group’s control also hindered 
performance, such as technology 
platform instability and the delays in 
getting some new products to market like 
mobile casino games. During 2014, the 
management team took significant steps 
to address these internal issues by moving 
to a label-led structure and reducing the 
bureaucracy hindering the business. 
In addition, moving the technology 
function into the Studios model should 
also result in stronger products coming 
to the market more quickly and a more 
stable games platform as Studios aspires 
to be a P &L business in its own right 
rather than just a support function. 
The impact these changes may have on 
the business in 201 5 have been taken into 
account when setting the bwin.party 
2014 Incentive Plan (‘BIP’) targets for 201 5. 
We are now looking for these substantial 
measures to help return the business back 
to revenue growth.
bwin.party’s remuneration policy was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM on 
22 May 2014. Details of the vote are set 
out on page 92. The Remuneration Policy 
is set out on the Company’s website, 
www.bwinparty .com. No changes to 
this policy are proposed in 201 5, so there 
is no requirement to put forward the 
policy to shareholders for approval this 
year , the statutory requirement being 
that the policy should be approved by 
shareholders once every three years. 
The only remuneration item to be 
considered at the 201 5 AGM is an advisory 
vote on this Directors’ Annual Report 
on Remuneration. 
Shareholders will recall that the  
BIP has two elements, Element A which 
focuses on Clean EBITDA performance 
and the achievement of personal 
objectives; and Element B which is 
dependent on the achievement of 
strategic and transformational targets 
set by the Remuneration Committee at 
the beginning of the year . The Company 
achieved 80. 96% of the stretching 
Clean EBITDA budget target set by the 
Remuneration Committee for 2014 and 
the minimum threshold that triggers an 
award entitlement under Element A is 
80% of Clean EBITDA. In light of the failure 
to return the business back to revenue 
growth, the Remuneration Committee, 
with the support of the Executive 
Directors, decided not to make a 2014 
award under Element A, thereby squarely 
aligning the expectations of participants 
with the interests of shareholders.
The strategic and transformational 
targets set for BIP participants for 2014 
are set out on page 88 of this report and 
I am pleased to report that the senior 
management team achieved 6 7 .18% of 
these targets. In evaluating the degree to 
which these targets had been achieved 
the Remuneration Committee engaged 
the Company’s internal audit team (none 
of whom participate in the BIP) to review 
management’s achievement reports 
and this did result in a reduction in the 
final determined achievement rate. 
Shareholders are reminded that share 
awards made under Element B do not 
vest for three years, cannot be sold for 
five years and on-going participation 
in the BIP is subject to minimum 
shareholding requirements.
Reflecting the remuneration policy’s focus 
on performance-related remuneration 
and the general low inflation economic 
environment, for 201 5 there has been 
no rise in the basic salaries payable 
to the Executive Directors and senior 
management team.
This is my last report as Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee, before 
I retire at the conclusion of the 201 5 
AGM. My successor is Barry Gibson, an 
experienced listed company director , 
who has chaired a number of other 
remuneration committees.

In this section, we summarise the purpose 
of our remuneration policy , its linkage 
to our corporate strategic objectives 
and we highlight the performance 
and remuneration outcomes for 
2014. More detail can be found in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 87 to 94.
2. Summary of Remuneration policy
Policy
The Group’s remuneration policy 
continues to be to provide market-
competitive total remuneration packages 
enabling the business to recruit and retain 
high-calibre entrepreneurs required to 
drive the future growth and performance 
of its business. The online gaming sector 
remains a highly competitive and dynamic 
environment and in adopting the current 
remuneration policy , the following key 
factors are taken into account:
• The nature of the market in which 
the Group operates and, in particular , 
the fact that the regulation and 
legality of online gaming varies from 
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, is subject 
to uncertainties and may be impacted 
by adverse changes to regulation of 
online gaming or the interpretation of 
regulation by regulators;
• The need for incentive arrangements 
to incorporate suitable risk adjustment 
provisions to ensure executives do not 
receive unjustified windfalls;
• The need to attract and retain key talent 
and drive high performance; 
• The impact on the Group’s margins 
due to additional cost of compliance 
and taxation;
• The requirement to attract and retain 
Executive Directors and certain senior 
executives who have to relocate and 
discharge all of their responsibilities 
from Gibraltar , versus other larger 
international business locations where 
there are greater career opportunities; 
• The opening of the US online gambling 
market under a federal or state licensing 
regime may have a substantial impact 
on the Group’s financial and share price 
performance. The remuneration policy 
has to be flexible and durable enough to 
accommodate these changes without 
becoming compromised; and
• The need to reconcile UK corporate 
governance guidance with 
market remuneration practices in all 
jurisdictions where the Group has 
employees, including the US.
As a result of the above considerations, 
the Group has adopted a highly leveraged 
incentive policy to ensure that the profile 
of the remuneration on offer is supportive 
of the Group’s business strategy and 
takes into account the effect of legislative 
changes. Particular focus is placed on 
providing a share-based remuneration 
package appealing to entrepreneurial 
and innovative executives. In conjunction 
with this approach, the policy adopts 
comparatively modest elements for the 
fixed elements of the total remuneration 
package, with salaries targeted at median 
quartile levels, minimal benefits and a 
minimum matching pension provision of 
1% of salary .

80 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014 It is the Committee’s intention to operate the BIP as set out above for the 2015 financial year as stated in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
The Policy also provides the Committee with the following flexibility: – “The Committee retains discretion in exceptional circumstances to change the performance measures 
and targets and their respective weightings part way through a performance year if there is a significant and material event which causes the Committee to believe the original 
measures, weightings and targets are no longer appropriate.” The Committee felt that it was prudent in light of the on-going discussions with a number of interested parties on 
potential business combinations with bwin.party to also determine a set of alternative performance conditions for Element B of the BIP (100%) and part of Element A (25%). It was 
the Committee’s view that whilst the above flexibility in the Policy would allow them to change the performance measures and targets in exceptional circumstances; it would 
provide greater clarity and transparency to the Executive Directors to set out some of the potential changes to the performance conditions which might arise as a result of one 
of these potential business combinations involving bwin.party. In addition, the Committee felt that it would protect shareholders interests to have considered some of these 
potential business combinations in advance and the potential effect on the performance conditions rather than wait until they occur and then consider what if any amendments 
to the performance conditions were appropriate.
It is the Committee’s opinion that a number of these potential business combinations involving bwin.party occurring during the financial year would amount to exceptional 
circumstances allowing them to consider whether to introduce alternate performance conditions under the shareholder approved Remuneration Policy. The Committee does not 
currently envisage a set of circumstances where the Clean EBITDA performance condition for 75% of Element A would not remain relevant. The maximisation and delivery of the 
Company’s profit targets seem to the Committee to be essential whatever arises. As these alternate targets are attempting to anticipate potential events which may or may not 
occur and which may be linked to a possible transaction and the potential value of the Company; the Committee has determined that the nature of these performance conditions 
and targets are commercially sensitive and any disclosure at this point could have a detrimental impact on the Company and its shareholders. In circumstances where these 
alternate performance conditions are used, the Committee will provide full disclosure to shareholders of the nature of the performance conditions, the targets set and their level 
of satisfaction at the earliest opportunity.

  These relate to awards made under the bwin.party digital entertainment plc Rollover Option Plan (the ‘ROP’). Prior to the Merger , bwin Interactive Entertainment AG, an Austrian company listed on 
the Vienna Stock Exchange and so not subject to the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, awarded fair market value share options to its non-executive directors. The rules of 
the bwin option plan made no provision for the treatment of outstanding awards on a merger and therefore these legacy awards had to be rolled into options over bwin.party shares under a new 
plan, the ROP . These options have vested and will expire on 22 May 2020. Approximately half of the shares have a strike price of 151 pence and the other half a strike price of 155 pence. No further 
share awards have been or will be made under the ROP

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED F . Who advises the Remuneration Committee?
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) in London has been retained to provide guidance to the Remuneration Committee on 
remuneration matters and in particular general practice and developments in executive remuneration. PwC was appointed by the 
Remuneration Committee in 2010 following a tender process at which a number of remuneration advisory firms participated. PwC’s 
performance is evaluated by the Remuneration Committee at least once a year . During 2014 PwC in France and Italy provided tax 
advisory and compliance services to the Group’s French and Italian subsidiaries. This work was completely unrelated and segregated 
from the work performed by PwC’s remuneration consultancy business and in the Remuneration Committee’s judgement did not 
undermine PwC’s independence. In addition, PwC is a signatory to and follows the provision of the Remuneration Consultants Code. 
PwC worked with the Company to implement the Committee’s policies.
PwC’s fees were based on agreed amounts for each of the projects carried out. The total fees for PwC in relation to advice provided to 
the Committee during the year being reported on were £64,350.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  G. Impact of the new UK Corporate Governance Code
The Committee is comfortable that its Policy is in-line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code (applying for financial years 
beginning on or after 1 October 2014). The following table sets out the key elements of the revised Code and how the Company’s 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors is in-line with the Governance Code:
Code Provision Company Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors’ remuneration  
should be designed to promote  
the long-term success of the Company.
The BIP contains two Elements:
• Element A provides a rolling deferral in shares and an on-going performance based risk adjustment; and
• Shares earned under Element B cannot be sold for 5 years from the date of award.
It is the Committee’s view that the BIP provides a holistic approach to ensuring Executive Directors are 
focused on the long-term success of the Company.
Schemes should include provisions that  
would enable the company to recover  
sums paid or withhold the payment of  
any sum, and specify the circumstances  
in which it would be appropriate to do so.
The BIP includes best practice malus and clawback provisions. The circumstances in which malus and 
clawback could apply are as follows:
• discovery of a material mis-statement resulting in an adjustment in the audited consolidated accounts of 
the Company; 
• the assessment of any performance target or condition in respect of an award was based on error, or 
inaccurate or misleading information; 
• the discovery that any information used to determine the number of shares subject to an award was 
based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information; 
• action or conduct of an award holder which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, amounts to 
employee misbehaviour, fraud or gross misconduct; and
• events or behaviour of an award holder have led to the censure of the Company by a regulatory authority 
or have had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group Company provided that the 
Board is satisfied that the relevant award holder was responsible for the censure or reputational damage 
and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to him.
Malus will apply up to the date of the determination of the award and clawback will apply for 3 years from 
the date of payment and the vesting of awards. The Committee is comfortable that the rules of the Plans 
provide sufficient powers to enforce malus and clawback, if required.
For share-based remuneration, the 
Remuneration Committee should consider 
requiring directors to hold a minimum number 
of shares and to hold shares for a further period 
after vesting or exercise, including for a period 
after leaving the company, subject to the need to 
finance any costs of acquisition and associated 
tax liabilities.
The policy contains the following relevant features:
• Minimum shareholding requirement for CEO of 500% of salary and for the CFO 200% of salary;
• Five-year period from award to sale for Element B of the BIP which continues to apply following cessation 
of employment.
The Committee, therefore, believes that its Policy is in-line with best practice.

This is not a cash bonus. The amounts relate to the value of the proposed Element B BIP awards to be granted in March 2015 (see page 89). Despite the fact that this is a share award vesting on the 
third anniversary of grant and the shares only being eligible for sale on the fifth anniversary of grant, the remuneration reporting regulations require the value of this award to be categorised as a 
bonus. The basis for this categorisation is that there are no further performance conditions to be satisfied after 2014, the year to which these awards relate. These awards have been valued using the 
average share price for the three months ended 31 December 2014 in accordance with the remuneration reporting regulations which was 101.87 pence. As reported elsewhere in this report, there 
was no bonus payment for 2014 in respect of Element A of the BIP

  The amounts shown are the value of the Element B awards under the BIP made on 31 March 2014 at a share price of 122.77 pence
3
  The amounts shown are the values of the shares awarded on 1 January 2015 in respect of the final balance of deferred value from BBP contributions in 2011 and 2012 (see page 80), no contribution 
having been earned in 2013. These awards have been valued using the share price on grant of 101.87 pence

In addition, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance of the Executive Directors and senior executives against 
their personal objectives set for 2014. The objectives for the CFO and senior executives were set by the CEO, whilst the objectives for 
the CEO were set by the Chairman. All these personal objectives were reviewed and approved by the Remuneration Committee at the 
beginning of 2014 before being rolled-out.
The following table set the personal objectives for each of the Executive Directors and whether they were satisfied:
Name Personal Objective Level of Satisfaction
Norbert T eufelberger Participate as an active member of the senior team working together to 
achieve our 2014 business and strategic objectives, ensuring the senior team 
is fully aligned to supporting the organisations 2014 priorities.
As the Clean EBITDA performance prevented a pay-out, no formal 
scoring of personal objectives at the year-end was given, however, 
feedback on performance was given throughout the year.

BIP – Operation of Element B and 2014 performance against objectives
The Remuneration Committee set the following strategic and transformational objectives for 2014 for the purpose of determining the 
level of awards to be made under Element B of the BIP in respect of 2014 performance. 
Strategic/Transformational Project Measurement Metrics for 2014 Actual Result
Roll-out fundamental transformation of 
technology organisation and operations:
New ‘agile’ methodology adopted to increase 
work through-put and utilise a leaner technology 
workforce that develops software more cheaply 
and brings it to market faster.
• ‘Up-skill’ technology employees on ‘agile’ 
methodology and practices.
• Fill skill gaps and refresh talent where necessary with 
a focus on key technology roles.
• Product development lifecycle to be re-engineered, 
documented and measured.
• All of the Studios teams have adopted the Agile 
working methodology having received training and a 
reduction in the number of management levels.
• All skill gaps successfully filled and ‘Scrum Masters’ 
have been ‘up-skilled’. Any further requirement to 
refresh talent will be managed through attrition.
• Documentation of product lifecycle is still on-going.
Lean and efficient engineering: increase 
platform availability, reduce software 
bugs and reduce technology debt 
• Enhance the customer experience by improving 
platform availability and the time taken to fix 
incidents arising from software releases.
• Enable automated software releases to 
production stage.
• Service the de-coupling of the Poker and 
Casino products.
• Improve automated test coverage for overall 
software system.
• Resolve half of the software bugs impacting the 
customer experience and improve the future bug 
resolution rate.
• Only partially successful, with planned availability of 
the gaming platform increased from 99.21% in 2013 
to 99.65%.
• T echnology teams now enabled to deliver automated 
releases.
• Achieved. 
• Partially achieved. 
• Not achieved, but partly due to having increased the 
vigilance of processes in identifying and logging bugs 
in 2014. 
Market Channel Expansion:
All products and all brands available on mobile 
devices (tablets and smart phones) via mobile 
browsing , IOS and Android in key territories: 
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, 
Switzerland and UK (‘Main Markets’)
• For offering hosted on bwin.party proprietary 
software target the percentage of total net gaming 
revenue in 2014 (after tax) (‘NGR’), so:
1.  More than 21% of NGR comes from mobile/touch 
devices.
2.  In the fourth quarter of 2014 more than 24% of NGR 
comes from mobile/touch devices.
Achieved: 
 
1. 25.3% 
2. 31.0% 
Value realisation of non-core  
assets and new business
Identify and sell the Group’s interests in all non-core 
assets and businesses.
Prepared interest in Conspo for sale. Completion due to 
occur in the first half of 2015.
F ailed to complete the sale in 2014 of Winners Apuestas, 
the land-based Spanish licensed sports betting business 
and the WIN social gaming division.
Independent US set-up: 
Establish independent US set-up to support 
state-by-state roll out and establish flexibility to 
maximise value
• Establish independent technology, commercial and 
operational functions servicing the regulated online 
gaming markets in the US.
• The stand-alone US structure should be structured 
to able to lead the opening of new offerings in newly-
regulated states with little central support.
• Independent US technology platform has been set-up 
and commercial and operational hub set up in New 
Jersey.
• US team operating in US subsidiaries sufficiently 
autonomous to lead the offering of licensed games 
into newly regulated states, as and when this occurs. 
Some ancillary support still required from Studios and 
the European regulatory compliance and products 
teams.
Strategic move from ‘volume to value’: 
Further roll-out the revised business approach, 
focusing on servicing those customers that provide 
the most value rather than aiming to increase the 
volume of customers irrespective of their value 
• Achieve in 2014 €25m in total cost savings compared 
with the December 2013 annualised run-rate.
• The annualised workforce cost for the B2C core 
businesses at 31 December 2014 shall be €10m lower 
than the workforce cost at 31 December 2013.
• Achieved €22.99m in total cost savings.
• Achieved a €9.86m reduction in workforce cost.
Leverage technology software platform: 
Launch B2B offering to B2C licensed operator 
operating in dotcom markets
• Launch in 90% of all the B2C operator’s target 
markets, having first obtained the Malta B2B online 
gaming licence.
• Obtained Maltese B2B online gaming licence in Malta.
• Supported B2C operator launching into 29 markets.

2014 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED After the year end the Executive Directors and Strategy Director reviewed the status of the 2014 strategic and transformational 
projects set out above and presented a status report to the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee then engaged 
the Company’s Internal Audit department (none of whom participate in the BIP) to conduct a review of the status report and advise on 
its accuracy . In ascertaining the relative importance of each of the six strategic/transformational projects, each project was assigned 
a weighting (set out in the table below). In addition, ‘on-target’ performance was treated as earning 70% of the maximum contribution, 
thereby incentivising management to outperform and achieve results above ‘on-target’ . Overall the Remuneration Committee 
concluded that the Executive Directors and senior management team had attained an overall achievement rate of 6 7 .18%.
Strategic/Transformational Project Weighting
Level of 
Achievement
Roll-out Fundamental T ransformation of T echnology Organisation and Operations 10% 75.00%
Lean and efficient engineering: increase platform availability, reduce software bugs and reduce technology debt 10% 45.00%

As a result of the above determination of the extent to which the above objectives were achieved, the following Element B share 
awards will be granted in March 201 5 (subject to the Company not being in a prohibited period for Model Code purposes) to the 
Executive Directors in the form of a nil-cost share option or restricted shares:

The Remuneration Committee has chosen to use the FTSE250 Index as the comparator , because the Company has been a constituent 
of this index for the last six years. The following graph plots the value of £100 in bwin.party’s shares and in the FTSE250 Index from 
1 January 2009 to 31 December 2014. The change in value of the holdings in the FTSE250 Index reflects any changes in the constituent

Note:
1
 This value represents the Element B BIP award to be made in respect of 2014. Despite the fact that this is a share award vesting on the third anniversary of grant and the shares only being eligible for 
sale on the fifth anniversary of grant, the remuneration reporting regulations require the value of the award to be categorised as a bonus. The basis for this categorisation is that there are no further 
performance conditions to be satisfied after 2014, the year to which these awards relate. There was no cash bonus payment for 2014 under Element A of the BIP . The maximum opportunity in 2014 
was 550% of salary (250% under Element A and 300% under Element B)
2
 This value represents the Element B BIP award made in respect of 2013. See note above for recognition timing. There was no cash bonus payment for 2013 under the BBP . The maximum opportunity 
in 2013 was 600% of salary (300% under the BBP and 300% under Element B of the BIP)
3
 The Company operated the BBP and V alue Creation Plan in 2013 and 2012. The BBP was subject to an annual assessment of performance and therefore, to the extent anything was earned during the 
year , the total value was accounted for in the ‘ Annual bonus pay out’ column. Whilst technically part of any value earned under the BBP in the years of operation was deferred and at risk of forfeiture, 
the Remuneration Committee believes it would be confusing and potentially misleading to show part of the BBP value in the ‘Long-term incentive ’ column in 2013 and 2012. The Company also 
operated the V alue Creation Plan, which was uncapped, however , the performance conditions were not met and therefore no awards were granted
91
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  I. Percentage change in remuneration of CEO and average Group employee
The following table sets out the percentage changes between 2014 and 201 3 in respect of certain aspects of the remuneration  
of the CEO and an average of the Group’s other employees.
Role Salary Change % Benefits % Short-term incentives %
CEO 0 0 0
Average employee 3.2 0 -23.0
Note: 
The CEO did not receive any short-term incentive payment in 2014 or 2013. The average employee did receive a reduced short-term incentive payment in 2014 as compared with 2013. It should be noted 
that for this purpose the Committee does not view the awards made to the Executive Directors under Element B of the BIP as comparable to a cash bonus paid to employees. Element B awards may 
technically under the remuneration disclosure regulations be counted as bonus for the single figure of remuneration; however , in practice the shares awarded do not vest for three years and cannot be 
sold for a further five years.
J. Relative importance of spend on remuneration and other distributions

2014 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED N. 2015 Element B T argets
The following table sets out additional details of the operational and strategic targets for Element B of the BIP .
Strategic/Transformational Project Measurement Metrics for 2015
Business transformation: 
Split organisation into a label-led structure and 
document relationships between the units with the 
aim of improved efficiency and operational speed, 
with a focus on excellence and cost savings.
• €15m total cost savings to be achieved in 2015 versus 2014.
• Organisational unbundling completed resulting in independent business and service units and a 
contractually defined working relationship between these units.
Labels: 
Build a European regulated markets B2C company 
operating under the bwin and Party labels, sourcing 
commoditised product and services via third parties 
and Studios.
• Labels grow in regulated and taxed markets by at least 6%.
• T urnaround the Party Labels business and stop the decline. 
(Note: Both to be measured net of the impact after deducting any tax (including UK point of consumption tax) or the effect 
of regulatory changes implemented after 2014 and the impact of the 2014 W orld Cup).
Studios: 
Establish operational excellence, product 
standardisation and the business as a competitive 
B2B service provider.
• Increase 2015 unplanned system availability, in-line with the target set by the IT Committee.
• Additional contracted B2B revenue from new customers of at least €10m over 2014. Contracted revenue 
shall mean that a B2B service agreement has been executed and there is transparency on the expected 
annualised revenue.
• Reduce the number of customer facing incidents by 20% by the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the 
fourth quarter of 2014.
• Simplify the IT architecture by decommissioning the V5 gaming platform, delivering the High Availability 
Improvement Project (as agreed in scope by the IT Committee) and improve the poker and casino platform 
architecture. 
Market channel expansion:
All products and all brands available on mobile 
devices (tablets and smart phones) via mobile 
browsing, IOS and Android for customers in the 
following territories – Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, 
Russia, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.
•  Percentage of total net gaming revenue in 2015 after tax from mobile/touch devices to exceed 35%.
• Percentage of total net gaming revenue after tax from mobile/touch devices to exceed 50% by 31 
December 2015.
(Note: T otal net gaming revenues do not include revenues from businesses using third party software where the Group 
cannot control the software development roadmap.)
Value realisation of non-core Assets
• Find strategic investors to accelerate the growth and value of the Kalixa payment processing business.
US set-up: 
Establish an independent US set-up to support 
the regulation of online gaming state-by-state 
with flexibility to maximise value for the Group 
or rationalise to reduce costs until US has opened 
sufficiently to be commercially viable on a stand-
alone basis. 
• Find a strategic investor for the US business (including WPT) and optimise operational efficiency with the 
aim to break-even in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Leverage technology software platform: 
Enhance B2B offering to B2C licensed operator 
operating in dotcom markets.
•  Support B2C operator to expand its brands and casino and poker offerings and the entry in to multiple new 
markets.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the detailed financial, 
operational and strategic targets used for the BIP , disclosing precise targets for the BIP in advance would not be in shareholder 
interests. This avoids the risk of the Company inadvertently providing a profit forecast because profit targets are linked to budgets  
and giving international competitors an unfair advantage because they are not required to report to the same disclosure standard  
as a UK listed company . Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance 
periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the BIP .

The Committee’s policy for setting notice periods is that a maximum 12 month period will apply for Executive Directors. 
The Committee may in exceptional circumstances arising on recruitment, allow a longer period, which would in any event reduce to 
12 months following the first year of employment.
The service agreements are governed by English law and contain non-compete provisions which apply during employment and for 
12 months following termination. The letters of appointment are also governed by English law and contain non-compete provisions

2014 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and 
consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with the Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999, the 
Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 
1999, the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 
(as amended), International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRS’) and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation, and the FCA’s Disclosure 
and T ransparency Rules and Listing Rules.
The Directors are also responsible for 
preparing the Company’s financial 
statements in accordance with the 
Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999 
and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as 
amended). The Directors have also chosen 
to prepare the Company’s financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records which disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company , 
for safeguarding the assets, for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities 
and for the preparation of a Directors’ 
Report which complies with the Gibraltar 
Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 
1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) 
Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies 
Act 1930 (as amended), and a Directors’ 
Remuneration Report which complies 
with the requirements of the UK’s Large 
and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, 
Schedule 8.
Financial statements are published on 
the Company’s website in accordance 
with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website 
is the responsibility of the Directors. 
The Directors’ responsibility also extends 
to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
In accordance with International 
Accounting Standard 1 the Directors are 
required to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year that present 
fairly the financial position of the Group 
and the Company and the financial 
performance and cashflows of the 
Group and the Company for that period. 
This requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the 
Preparation and Presentation of Financial 
Statements’ . In virtually all circumstances, 
a fair presentation will be achieved 
by compliance with all applicable 
IFRS requirements.
In preparing the financial statements the 
Directors are required to: 
a)  select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
b)  present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; and 
c)  provide additional disclosure 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on 
the Group’s financial position and 
financial performance.
In accordance with DTR 4.1.12 of the 
FCA’s Disclosure and T ransparency Rules, 
the Directors confirm to the best of 
their knowledge:
a)  the Group’s financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
and loss of the Group; and
b)  the Annual Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
financial position of the Group and the 
Company , together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• The financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2014 and of the Group’s 
loss for the year then ended;
• The Group and Company’s financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union; and
• The financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar 
Companies (Accounts) Act 1999 and 
the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 
(as amended).
We have audited the financial statements 
of bwin.party digital entertainment plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2014 which 
comprise the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the Consolidated 
and Company statement of financial 
position, the Consolidated and Company 
statements of changes in equity , the 
Consolidated and Company statements 
of cashflows and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union.
Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement 
In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors made a number of subjective 
judgements and significant accounting 
estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future 
events that are, by their nature, inherently 
uncertain (see note 1 to the consolidated 
financial statements). We primarily 
focussed our work in these areas by 
assessing the Directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, including 
the risk of management override and 
bias, forming our own judgements 
and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
The risks of material misstatement that 
had the greatest effect on our Group audit 
in the current year are noted below. This is 
not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit. Our audit procedures relating 
to these matters were designed in the 
context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and not to express 
an opinion on individual accounts or 
disclosures and we do not express an 
opinion on these individual matters.
We discussed these areas of focus with 
the Audit & Risk Committee. Their report 
on those matters that they considered 
to be significant issues in relation to the 
financial statements is set out on pages 
6 7 to 76.

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
Independent Auditors’ Report
T o the Members of bwin.party digital entertainment plc Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Revenue recognition
The main risk is the completeness, existence and 
accuracy of net gaming revenue derived from the 
Group’s gaming system.
We documented and tested the operating effectiveness of the key IT and manual 
controls in the revenue cycle including application and access controls over the 
Group’s main gaming systems. This included conducting test bets, review of change 
management controls, substantive and controls testing over the reconciliations 
and interfaces between the main gaming systems and the nominal ledger . We also 
undertook analytical and other substantive testing, including IT interrogation work. 
We assessed whether the revenue recognition policies adopted by the Group comply 
with IFRS adopted by the EU and industry standards.
Acquisition related and internally 
generated additions to the carrying 
value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets
The risk is a material misstatement in the carrying 
value of these assets, their initial recognition and 
the computation and recording of any impairment 
together with incomplete disclosures of these areas. 
The annual impairment test and recognition 
criterion are complex processes requiring significant 
management judgement and based on assumptions 
about future profitability and cashflows.
In respect of additions to capitalised development costs, we tested a sample of 
projects undertaken in the year against invoices from external suppliers and internal 
payroll costs and assumptions, and challenged the assessment by management for 
that sample as to whether the project spend met all the recognition criteria set out in 
IAS 38. 
Working with our internal valuations team we challenged management’s key 
assumptions, including applicable discount rates, growth rates and the impact of 
potential regulatory changes, used in the cashflow models to assess:
• the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles; and
• the computation of initial recognition criterion.
We assessed the budgets used in the Group’s models and the accuracy of prior year 
forecasts having regard to the current year results. We performed sensitivity analyses 
on these models, particularly where changes in key assumptions could indicate a 
material movement. 
In addition to the above we also reviewed disclosures to the financial statements to 
conclude that they were complete and appropriately balanced. 
Impact of legal and regulatory matters 
on provisioning and disclosure
Given the continuing developing nature of the 
regulatory conditions and legal environment of the 
online gaming sector in a number of jurisdictions 
which the group operates, and the requirement for 
management judgement thereon, there is a risk 
that material legal or regulatory matters are not 
disclosed or appropriate provisions made. 
We considered how the Group monitors legal and regulatory developments and their 
assessment of the potential impact on the business and the appropriate internal and 
external advice taken in respect of these developments. 
We reviewed the litigation and regulatory report provided by Group’s external legal 
counsel, including legal confirmations received from other legal advisors engaged 
by the Group. We discussed each of the key cases noted in the report as well as any 
known instances of breaches in regulatory and licence compliance with both the 
Group’s external legal counsel and the internal compliance department to assess the 
Group’ s determination of the requirement for a provision or disclosure. 
Direct and indirect taxes
The provisioning and disclosure of these taxes have 
been recorded as a risk due to the complexity and 
international nature of the Group structure including 
the number of jurisdictions, particularly in Europe in 
which the Group operates or has physical presence. 
The rules and practices governing the taxation 
of e-commerce activity including indirect taxes 
continue to evolve, requiring application of 
management estimates and judgement with regards 
to the assessment and interpretation of national 
and international tax laws as it impacts provisioning 
and disclosure within the financial statements.
Working with our gaming sector taxation team we reviewed the strategy and 
processes applied by the Group in managing its tax risks and compilation of period 
end charges and provisions in the countries where it operates or where entities 
are registered. 
We reviewed in conjunction with our gaming sector taxation and component audit 
teams, key management estimates and judgements having regard to any external 
advice taken. We challenged the Group’s assessment of those provisions and the 
related disclosures.
97
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  The Audit & Risk Committee’s 
consideration of these risks is set out on 
pages 72 to 76.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both 
in planning and performing our audit, and 
in evaluating the effect of misstatements 
on our audit and on the financial 
statements. For planning, we consider 
materiality to be the magnitude by which 
misstatements, including omissions, 
could influence the economic decisions 
of reasonable users that are taken on the 
basis of the financial statements. In order 
to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that any misstatements 
exceed materiality , we use a lower 
materiality level, performance materiality , 
to determine the extent of testing needed. 
Importantly , misstatements below these 
levels will not necessarily be evaluated 
as immaterial as we also take account of 
the nature of identified misstatements, 
and the particular circumstances of their 
occurrence, when evaluating their effect 
on the financial statements as a whole.
We determined materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole to be 
€5.1M. In determining this, we based our 
assessment on a level of 5% of Clean 
EBITDA. We agreed with the Audit & 
Risk Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences 
individually in excess of €100K. We also 
agreed to report differences below these 
thresholds that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also 
report on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our 
Group audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining 
an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement at the Group level. 
The majority of the accounting for the 
Group is centrally managed from Gibraltar . 
In addition there are component auditors 
covering the Group’s operations in Austria, 
France, India, Israel, Italy , Sweden and 
the UK. At the planning stage of the audit 
we obtained the consolidated results 
broken down by subsidiary location. 
As part of our requirements under ISA 
600 “Special Considerations – Audit of 
Group Financial Statements (including 
the work of component auditors)” we 
request that component auditors perform 
audits to a component materiality set 
by us. For other locations that we do 
not consider significant we request 
they perform procedures specified by 
us including reviews. The materiality 
for Group reporting for components 
performing audits or reviews was €2. 5m 
and €1.25m respectively . 
At the parent entity level we also tested 
the consolidation process and carried 
out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there are no significant 
risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to 
audit, reviews or reviews with selected 
audit procedures on certain balances.
Based on the above scope we were able to 
conclude whether sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence had been obtained as a 
basis of our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed  
by legal and regulatory requirements
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 
2014 for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and 
• The part of the Remuneration Report 
described as having been audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with Section 421 of the UK Companies 
Act 2006.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited financial 
statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Company acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or 
• is otherwise misleading.
In particular , we are required to consider 
whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider 
the Annual Report is fair , balanced 
and understandable and whether the 
annual report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated 
to the Audit & Risk Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.

Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 
62, the Directors’ are responsible for 
preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements and in accordance 
with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with 
the Financial Reporting Council’s (‘FRC’s’) 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
bwin.party digital entertainment plc 
has complied with the requirements of 
rules 9.8.6 and 9.8.8 of the Listing Rules of 
the UK Financial Conduct Authority and 
in accordance with Section 421 of the 
UK Companies Act 2006 in preparing its 
Annual Report, as if it was incorporated in 
the United Kingdom. As auditors, we have 
agreed that our responsibilities in relation 
to the Annual Report will be those as set 
out below.
We report to you our opinion as to 
whether the financial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the 
financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Gibraltar 
Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 
1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) 
Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 
1930 (as amended), and the part of the 
Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance

has not kept proper accounting records, if 
we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by the Listing 
Rules and Gibraltar legislation regarding 
Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements performed in accordance 
with ISAs (UK and Ireland)
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error . This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
within the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
The purpose of this report and 
restrictions on its use by persons other

Retained earnings represent cumulative profit/(loss), share-based payments and any other items of other comprehensive income not disclosed as 
separate reserves in the table above. 
The other reserve of €573.7m is the amount arising from the application of accounting which is similar to the pooling of interests method, as set out 
in the Group’s accounting policies.
Currency reserve represents the gains/losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into Euros. 
Non-controlling interests relate to the interests of other shareholders in certain subsidiaries (see note 32).

Basis of preparation
The Group and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those International Financial Reporting Standards including 
International Accounting Standards (IASs) and interpretations, (collectively ‘IFRS’), published by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(‘IASB’) which have been adopted by the European Commission and endorsed for use in the EU for the purposes of the Group’s full year financial 
statements.
The consolidated and Company financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies (accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended). The financial statements are presented in Euros and rounded 
to the nearest €0.1m.
Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 will be filed with Companies House Gibraltar following the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting.
Adoption of new and revised Standards and Interpretations
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), are effective for the 
first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no effect on its consolidated results or financial position:
IAS 27 (Amended) Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014)**
IAS 28 (Amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014)
IAS 32 (Amended) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014)
IAS 36 (Amended)  Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014)

The Group is currently assessing the impact, if any, that these standards will have on the presentation of, and recognition in its consolidated results 
in future periods.
Basis of accounting
The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of 
certain financial instruments which are held at their fair value.

Notes to the audited consolidated financial 
statements 1. Accounting policies (continued)
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and 
reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. These policies, 
together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found as follows:
Revenue recognition note 1
Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 10
Regulatory compliance, litigation, provisions and contingent liabilities note 24

Contingent consideration receivable and payable notes 15 and 18
Basis of consolidation
Under section 10(2) of the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own 
statement of comprehensive income.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Company’s acquisition of the controlling interest in bwin.party holdings Limited (formerly PartyGaming 
Holdings Limited)
The Company’s controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, bwin.party Holdings Limited (formerly PartyGaming Holdings 
Limited), was acquired through a transaction under common control, using a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests.
Accounting for subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are 
present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those 
variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values. The non-controlling interest is 
stated at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling 
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder’s share of 
changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the 
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost, less any impairment in value.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are 
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders’ 
proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. The choice of measurement basis is 
made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
105
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  1. Accounting policies (continued)
Investments 
Investments include investments in associates, joint ventures and available-for-sale investments. 
Available-for-sale investments
Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, 
associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity. In accordance with 
IAS 39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and 
settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve. On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that 
asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those 
policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment. Losses of an associate 
in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the 
extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Investments in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control; 
that is, when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing 
control.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint 
ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the 
net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest in that 
investment are not recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Intangible assets
Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired 
in the subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed. Goodwill 
arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 
Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment and will be reviewed for 
impairment at least annually.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal 
rights. Identifiable assets are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic 
life of the assets.

bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1. Accounting policies (continued)
Internally generated intangible assets – research and development expenditure
Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Group’s software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to 
new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete their development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate 
proportion of overheads. All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the 
asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible asset’s current level of 
performance, is expensed as incurred. 
Licence costs
Expenditure incurred in order to obtain gaming licences is capitalised and amortised over the life of the licence.
Amortisation of intangible assets
Amortisation is provided to write-off the cost of all intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, over the periods the Group expects to benefit 
from their use, and varies between:
Brand and domain names – 5% to 20% per annum
Capitalised development expenditure – 20% to 33% per annum
Contractual relationships – over the length of the contract
Customer lists and contracts – 5% to 50% per annum
Intellectual property and gaming licences – over the length of the licence
Software – 20% to 33% per annum
Impairment of goodwill, other intangibles and property , plant and equipment
At the end of each reporting year, an impairment review of goodwill is completed. In addition, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its other 
intangibles and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If 
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where 
the asset does not generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset 
is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation 
increase. Impairments related to goodwill are not reversed.
Property , plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of freehold land which is stated at cost and 
not depreciated.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in 
bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, including professional fees. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for 
their intended use.
107
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  1. Accounting policies (continued)
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment with the exception of freehold 
land, evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated at the following rates:
Leasehold improvements – over length of lease
Plant, machinery, computer equipment – 33% per annum
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, vehicles – 20% per annum
Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item is 
accounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul. All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases the 
future economic benefits to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.
Segment information
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses. Each 
segment’s operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance. The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organises the operating segments within 
the Group for decision-making purposes and for the assessment of financial performance. During 2014 the Group reviewed financial statements 
presented by product type which were supplemented by some information about geographic regions for the purposes of making operating 
decisions and assessing financial performance. Therefore, the Group has determined that it is appropriate to report according to product segment 
during the current and the prior year. 
Revenue
Revenue from online gaming, comprising sports betting, casino & games, poker, bingo, and network services (third-party entities that use the 
Group’s platform and certain services), is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Net revenue consists of net gaming revenue and revenue 
generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees. 
Sports betting, casino & games and bingo net gaming revenue represents net house win adjusted for the fair market value of gains and losses on 
open betting positions, certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty points accrued. Poker net gaming revenue represents the commission 
charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his or her participation in the tournament less certain promotional bonuses and 
the value of loyalty points accrued. Revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account 
fees is allocated to each reporting segment.
Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from network services, third-party payment services, sale of domain names, financial markets, software 
services and fees from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions. Revenue in respect of network service arrangements where the third-party owns 
the relationship with the customer is the net commission invoiced. 
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists primarily of betting and gaming taxes and broadcasting costs.
Broadcasting costs are expensed over the applicable lifecycle of each programme based upon the ratio of the current year’s revenue to the 
estimated remaining total revenues.
Clean EBITDA
Clean EBITDA is the Group’s measure of reporting performance and is EBITDA adjusted for exchange differences, reorganisation expenses, income or 
expenses that relate to exceptional items and non-cash charges relating to impairments and share-based payments. Exceptional items are those 
items the Group considers to be non-recurring or material in nature that may distort an understanding of financial performance or impair 
comparability.
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate (their 
‘functional currency’) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are 
recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a 
net investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.
108
bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1. Accounting policies (continued)
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into Euros at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took 
place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate 
ruling at the end of the reporting year. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas 
operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity (the ‘currency reserve’).
Exchange differences recognised in the statement of comprehensive income of Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of 
long-term monetary items, forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the currency reserve 
on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation up to 
the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The financial statements were translated into Euros at the following rates:

Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the Directors’ best estimate of taxation exposures and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting year.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains specific exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale plan, the 
asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. 
These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale.
109
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  1. Accounting policies (continued)
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain 
employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only 
non-market vesting conditions, on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option 
pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the 
liability. Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of 
settlement, with changes being recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group records the expense based on the fair 
value of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For cash payments made by parties related to Principal 
Shareholders, the charge is recorded when there is a commitment to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Company’s (or a subsidiary’s) share 
price are made, by shareholder(s) or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder(s), the transaction is accounted for as a share-
based payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder(s), the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment 
reserve. Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.
Own shares
Own shares relate to shares gifted to the Employee Trust by the Company. The cash cost of own shares creates an own share reserve. 
When options issued by the Employee Trust are exercised the own share reserve is reduced and a gain or loss is recognised in reserves based on 
proceeds less weighted-average cost of shares initially purchased now exercised. 
The cost of own shares repurchased in cash as part of the share buy-back programme is debited to reserves. The shares are cancelled at nominal 
value with a corresponding entry taken to the capital redemption reserve.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group recognises a provision in the consolidated statement of financial position when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an outflow of economic benefits, no 
provision is made. Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties 
relating to the amount or timing of outflow of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cashflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects market 
assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All 
other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of 
financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so 
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans, receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and those 
measured at fair value through profit & loss. 
These include restricted cash and unrestricted bank deposits with maturities of more than three months. Amounts held as security deposits are 
considered to be restricted cash. There are no financial assets that are classified as ‘held to maturity’. A category for ‘in the money’ derivative 
financial instruments is included in respect of foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group. 
Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, 
associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity. In accordance with IAS 
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and 
settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve. On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that 
asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Short-term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. They are 
initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue. They are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables represent short-term monetary assets which are recognised at fair value less impairment and other related provisions, 
which are recognised when there is objective evidence (primarily default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all 
of the amounts due. The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected 
cashflows associated with the impaired receivable.
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash. They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months 
or less.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities include the following items:
• Client liabilities, including amounts due to progressive prize pools.
• Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of 
the liability carried in the consolidated statement of financial position.
• Loans and borrowings, comprising bank borrowings and overdrafts, which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs 
directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the 
liability is outstanding.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability. The 
Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the 
Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  2. Segment information
For management purposes and transacting with customers, during 2014 the Group’s operations were segmented into the following reporting 
segments which reflect the Group’s reporting of results to the Chief Operating Decision Makers (‘CODMs’): 
• sports betting, 
• casino & games, 
• poker, 
• bingo and 
• other 
The segment ‘other’ includes a number of businesses that in aggregate are not large enough to account for more than 10% of the Group’s revenues, 
Clean EBITDA or assets. Included within this segment are: World Poker Tour; the third-party payment processing business, Kalixa; the financial 
spreadbetting business, InterTrader; software services, social gaming, profit on domain sales and the Winners retail business. 
Under the Group’s basis of segmental reporting, a high proportion of costs are allocated directly to each segment, and the remaining central costs 
are allocated pro rata to gross profit. Certain product verticals are dependent on the cross-sell of players from other product verticals and thus 
includes a reallocation of marketing costs between these verticals in order to more accurately reflect the true profitability of that segment on a 
standalone basis. Unallocated corporate expenses are allocated to each of these operating segments. The measure of reporting segment 
performance is Clean EBITDA and the basis for arriving at this was the same as for the Group accounts. This measure will continue to be the case in 
future periods.
These segments were the basis upon which the Group reported its segments in 2014. As from 1 January 2015 the Group will change its basis of 
internal and external segmental reporting to a label-led structure.

Total tax (credit) expense for the year (3.6) 3.8 
The expenses not allowed for tax purposes are primarily depreciation, amortisation and impairment of assets. In 2014 the effect of non-taxable 
income primarily represents IFRS required adjustments to deferred consideration (see note 27) whilst in 2013 it represented the release of the fair 
value provision (see note 20). 
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The Group’s policy is to manage, control and operate Group companies only in the countries in which they are registered. At the year end there were 
Group companies registered in 23 countries including Gibraltar. However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity are 
evolving in many countries. It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the 
financial information.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
As the Group is involved in worldwide operations, future tax charges will be affected by the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions.
Future tax charges will be reduced by a deferred tax credit in respect of amortisation of certain acquired intangibles.

The performance measure of EPS used internally by management to manage the operations of the business and remove the impact of one-off and 
certain non-cash items is Clean EPS, which is calculated before exchange differences, reorganisation expenses, income or expenses that relate to 
exceptional items and non-cash charges relating to share-based payments. Clean net earnings excluding amortisation on acquired intangibles and 
impairments on certain classes of intangible assets attributable to equity shareholders are derived as below.
Management believes that this better reflects the underlying performance of the business and assists in providing a clearer view of the

and broadcast libraries. The value of acquired intangibles is based on cashflow projections at the time of acquisition. The fair value of customer lists 
from existing customers takes into account the expected impact of player attrition.
Other intangibles primarily include development expenditure, long-term gaming and intellectual property licences and purchased domain names. 
Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally. Licences are amortised 
over the life of the licences and other intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years. 
Amortisation charges are charged through administration costs on the income statement.

Impairment
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets. A detailed review was 
undertaken at 31 December 2014 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cashflows derived 
from those assets. The recoverable amounts of all the above CGUs have been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow 
projections from formally approved budgets and long-range forecasts. These budgets and forecasts assume the underlying business models will 
continue to operate on a comparable basis under the current regulatory and taxation regimes, adjusted for any known changes.
Sports
The recoverable amount of the Sports CGU of €350.0m has been determined from value in use calculations based on cashflow projections covering 
the following ten year period. The Group believes that going beyond five years’ cashflows in the value in use calculations is appropriate given the 
Group is an established business and is a market leader in a growth industry.
Operating margins have been based on past experience and future expectations in the light of anticipated economic and market conditions. 
Discount rates are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.

The Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of

In accordance with the Group’s focus on disposing of non-core activities, the Group has classified certain of its non-core assets as held-for-sale. 
Following the decision to classify as held-for-sale, the Directors have reviewed the carrying value of the business groups included within this 
category and an impairment charge of €5.3m has been made against certain business groups. The Directors now believe that the carrying value of 
the holdings represents the lower of cost and the current fair value of each of the business groups held for sale.
The Group is exploring various options with respect to the various non-core assets but believes that external sales represent the most likely option 
for the disposal groups included and the Group anticipates that these sales will likely complete by the end of 2015. The assets and liabilities

There is no unrecognised share of losses arising during the year.
The Group had a joint venture agreement with Nordeus LLC to develop, market, distribute and publish a social betting platform and loaned the joint 
venture company €1m to develop the software platform. In 2014, in line with the Group’s policy to concentrate on its core business, the Group exited 
from its future commitments with respect to Nordeus WIN (Gibraltar) Limited and impaired the loan investment accordingly.
Circulo Payment Limited is a new venture launched in 2014 with Millicom International Cellular S.A., to develop a payment service provider to 
operate in Latin America and Africa. This entity was set up in 2014 and the Group has contributed €0.4m of investment into this business.
Other joint ventures included Conspo Sportcontent GmbH which repaid the final €2m of the loan which the Group had advanced. This investment 
was then transferred into assets held-for-sale as part of the review of non-core investments (see note 13).
Available-for-sale investments
Available-for-sale investments primarily relate to the Group’s interests in several early stage digital entertainment investment funds.
Investments are held in Wave Crest Holdings Limited, a payment processing company, and various gaming and non-gaming investment funds 
including New Game Capital LP and Axon Capital ICT Funds and Aldorino Trust, an investment trust. The value of overall investments fell by €1.8m 
(2013: loss of €4.8m), principally as a result of an impairment charge of €2.2m against the full carrying value of Wave Crest Holdings Limited partially 
offset by an additional investment of €0.4m in a further investment fund. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the investments approximates to their fair values or estimates of the present value of expected 
future cashflows. 
Company
The Company holds the Group’s investment in the Aldorino Trust which was revalued during the period and acquired a €0.4m investment in the Axon 
Capital ICT Funds. Final carrying value of the Company’s investments was €3.2m (2013: €1.4m).

approximates to their fair value which is based on the net present value of expected future cashflows.
20. Provisions
Following the successful settlement of an outstanding dispute, €83.8m of a fair value provision created at the time of the Merger was written-back 
during 2013. The settlement agreed was for €1.9m resulting in a write-back of €83.8m to the statement of comprehensive income and a transfer 
to creditors of €1.9m. During 2013 there was also an agreement reached to settle claims from the state of Kentucky for €11.9m which was paid in 
that year.
Onerous contracts related to provisions made against the future costs of contracts where subsequent changes in legislation in certain countries 
meant that the future economic benefits received by the Group were less than the costs involved with fulfilling the remaining terms and conditions 
of the contracts and were recognised at the Directors’ best estimate based on their knowledge of the markets of the countries involved. €4.2m in 
respect of this provision was brought forward from 1 January 2013 and was fully utilised in that year.
The amounts due for provisions are recognised at fair value based on the above and carried at the best estimate of the provision discounted for the 
time value of money.
There are therefore no brought forward or closing provisions in the current year.

24. Contingent liabilities
From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions against it. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of such 
claims and actions.
As part of its ongoing regulatory compliance process, the Board monitors legal and regulatory developments and their potential impact on the 
business and takes appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Indirect taxation
Group companies may be subject to VAT on transactions which have been treated as exempt supplies of gambling, or on supplies which have been 
zero rated for export to Gibraltar where legislation provides that the services are received or used and enjoyed in the country where the service 
provider is located. Revenues earned from customers located in any particular jurisdiction may give rise to further taxes in that jurisdiction. If such 
taxes are levied, either on the basis of current law or the current practice of any tax authority, or by reason of a change in the law or practice, then 
this may have a material adverse effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group or on its financial position. Where it is considered probable that a 
previously identified contingent liability will give rise to an actual outflow of funds, then a provision is made in respect of the relevant jurisdiction 
and period impacted. Where the likelihood of a liability arising is considered remote, or the possible contingency is not material to the financial 
position of the Group, the contingency is not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Litigation
Given the lack of a harmonised regulatory environment for online gaming in Europe, a number of civil and administrative proceedings are pending 
against the Group and/or its board members in several countries (including but not limited to Germany, Portugal and Spain) aimed at preventing 
bwin.party from offering its services in these countries. Further, there are criminal proceedings pending against a current and former board member 
for the alleged violation of local gaming laws in France.
On 16 October 2014, the Portuguese Supreme Court confirmed a ruling of the Oporto Court of First Instance of September 2011 against Liga 
Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional (‘Liga’), bwin.party digital entertainment plc and bwin.party services (Gibraltar) Ltd (‘bwin.party’). In this ruling 
the First Instance Court had (i) declared the (already terminated) sponsorship agreement between bwin.party and the Liga as illegal, (ii) declared 
bwin.party’s gaming offer and advertising measures as illegal in Portugal, (iii) prohibited bwin.party to exploit mutual bets and lottery games in 
Portugal and to carry out any form of publicity or promotion of the website bwin.com, (iv) imposed on the defendants pecuniary sanctions of (A) 
€50,000 for each day the infraction lasts, payable to the Portuguese Casino Association (‘APC’) and (B) €50,000 for each infraction, payable to Santa 
Casa de Misericórdia da Lisboa, and (v) ordered the publishing of the ruling and the notification of Portuguese media organisations. Following the 
first instance ruling, the Liga and bwin.party already took measures in order to comply with the decision. However, it cannot be ruled out that 
certain activities may still be considered as being in violation of the ruling. As the Liga and bwin.party are of the view that the courts have 
interpreted Portuguese rules on advertising in breach of the Portuguese Constitution, the Liga and bwin.party filed an appeal to the Portuguese 
Constitutional Court on 3 November 2014, which is currently pending.
In June 2012, APC initiated enforcement proceedings against the Liga and bwin.party, requesting the payment of pecuniary sanctions in the total 
amount of €6.35 million for the alleged violation of the First Instance Court judgment during the period between 24 September 2011 and 31 January 
2012. The Liga and bwin.party remain firmly of the view that such enforcement action is formally incorrect and without merit. In June 2012, the 
Oporto Enforcement Court dismissed APC’s enforcement claim for lack of enforceability. APC filed an appeal against this decision, which the Second 
Instance Enforcement Court granted on 25 November 2014 and decided that pecuniary sanctions were enforceable at the time APC initiated the 
enforcement proceeding without assessing the enforcement case on its merits. The Liga and bwin.party submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court 
on 12 January 2015, which is currently pending. Despite the appeal pending at the Supreme Court merely on the formal question of enforceability, 
the enforcement proceedings will continue before the Oporto Enforcement Court, where the Liga and bwin.party will be requested to submit their 
comprehensive defence arguments.

In July 2012, the Spanish gaming operator, Codere, filed an unfair competition complaint against various bwin.party group companies. Prior to this 
complaint, the Spanish Court rejected Codere’s request for a preliminary injunction. The complaint filed by Codere seeks damages and prejudicial 
consequences in the amount of approximately €25m. On 10 July 2014, the Court issued the ruling dismissing Codere’s claim and all of its petitions. On 
16 October 2014, Codere filed an appeal against the ruling of first instance. 
On 28 February 2014, bwin.party digital entertainment plc received a claim filed at the District Court of Limassol by Rodolfo Odoni against Nomato 
Investments Limited and six other defendants, including bwin.party digital entertainment plc and BAW International Limited (now bwin.party 
services (Gibraltar) Limited) in a total of seven defendants, seeking, inter alia, damages in the amount of €6.9m. 
No provision has been made for contingent liabilities relating to the above detailed claims.
In 2007, bwin Argentina S.A. (‘bwin Argentina’) filed an amparo complaint (protective order) requesting extraordinary constitutional protection to 
operate its licence granted by the gaming regulatory authority of the Province of Misiones in case of any threat or act from any specific third parties. 
On 26 June 2012, the court rejected the amparo complaint. Following a final decision against bwin Argentina with regard to requesting constitutional 
protection to operate its licence granted in the Province of Misiones, bwin Argentina must bear all costs of the proceedings (including fees of the 
counsels to the prevailing parties).
As a result of various freezing orders, BBVA Banco Francés has frozen ARS 5,000,000 (approximately €0.5m) and Banco Hipotecario has frozen 
ARS 5,000,000. bwin Argentina has challenged the freezing orders on the grounds that the sums frozen are not proportionate to the debts. On 
14 November 2013, the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed a decision pursuant to which the basis for calculating the legal fees is the amount of bwin 
Argentina’s profits from February 2008 to December 2012. bwin Argentina appealed this decision. Full provision for the frozen funds was charged in 
the 2013 financial year. In August and December 2014 respectively, bwin.party was notified of the Supreme Court’s decisions rejecting bwin 
Argentina’s appeal and subsequent extraordinary appeal. bwin.party has therefore exhausted local remedies. The fees amount to ARS 18,852,489.64 
plus 21% VAT (approximately €1.9m plus VAT), calculated as 25% of the net wins of bwin Argentina S.A. In 2014 bwin.party provided for the €1.0m 
being the outstanding amount of these fees which is included within other payables. 
The Directors do not consider that there are any other contingent liabilities requiring disclosure.

costs of €1.3m were incurred by subsidiaries on behalf of the Company (2013: €1.4m). At year end, the Company did not have any other borrowing 
facilities (2013: €nil). In 2014 the Company received no dividends from subsidiaries (2013: €nil).
Details of amounts owed to and from subsidiaries are included in notes 15 and 18.
27 . Acquisitions during the year
On 26 May 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of Servebase Group Limited. The Group of companies acquired included 
PXP Solutions Limited, a global multi-channel payment gateway whose in-store payments technology is used by 8,000 merchants and retailers in 
27 countries worldwide. Servebase Group Limited’s principal activity is software design with technical support and computer consultancy services. 
The principal reasons for the acquisition was to add in-store payment processing to Kalixa’s product suite as well as provide access to cross-sell 
Kalixa’s products to PXP’s customer base.
Details of the provisional fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows:
Book value

Net assets acquired 1.3 13.0 14.3 
Goodwill 22.0
Consideration 36.3
Cash paid on completion 22.7 
Cash paid on finalisation of completion accounts 2.5
Contingent consideration 11.1
Consideration 36.3
The intangible assets other than goodwill are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of up to three years for developed 
software and up to five years for customer relationships. The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill (none of which is deductible for tax 
purposes) are the expertise of the workforce, synergies of the deal, the opportunity to cross-sell Kalixa’s products to PXP’s customer base and other 
non-recognisable benefits. The amount included above for contingent consideration represents the Directors’ current best estimate of the amount 
payable which they consider is likely to be paid, after the effects of discounting.
Initial cash consideration of £20.1m (€25.2m) was paid with contingent consideration payable of up to £20m (€24.6m) dependent on which of two 
options the Group selects before the first anniversary of the acquisition. Under ‘Option A’ a further £10m (€12.3m) would be payable on the first 
anniversary of the acquisition. Under ‘Option B’ up to £20m (€24.6m) would be payable based on the value of existing PXP Solutions merchant 
volumes transferred to Kalixa for provision of card acquiring services, as measured on each of the first three anniversaries of the acquisition. The 
Group has determined the fair value of contingent consideration taking into account the probability of expected outcomes and appropriate 
discount rates.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  27 . Acquisitions during the year (continued)
Subsequent to the acquisition, various technical development issues, in particular the deferral of work relating to the integration of a third party 
supplier’s platform as they go through a major upgrade, has meant that the value of the merchant volumes which could be transferred to Kalixa for 
card acquiring will be significantly lower than anticipated over the performance period for which deferred consideration is measured. However, the 
anticipated annual synergies are still expected to be realised, albeit later than planned. As a result, the expectations relating to the deferred 
consideration which would be payable were revisited and the balance expected to be paid was reduced significantly. After the unwinding of some of 
the interest relating to the deferred consideration, this has led to a credit to other operating income of €11.3m as required by IFRS with the resulting 
deferred consideration balance of €0.4m remaining within other payables.
In the period since acquisition, The Servebase Group has contributed €3.3m in revenue and €0.3m Clean EBITDA to the Group. Had the acquisition 
been made on 1 January 2014, Group revenue would have been €613.9m with an increase in loss after tax of less than €0.1m. Merger and acquisition 
costs in the year in respect of the acquisition totalled €1.5m.

Financial instruments not measured at fair value within the financial statements
Financial instruments not measured at fair value includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, trade 
and other payables, client liabilities and progressive prize pools, loans and borrowings.
Due to their short term nature, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, joint venture and associate investments, short-term investments, 
trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, client liabilities and progressive prize pools approximate their fair value and are classified in 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of loans and borrowings are classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and has been disclosed within note 21. The loans and 
borrowings have been valued by estimating the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates.

Management controls and procedures
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate 
responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective implementation 
of the objectives and policies to the Group’s treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee (see below). As such, the 
Group’s funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Group’s treasury department. The 
treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage these underlying 
risks. No other derivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the accounting implications 
would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis which are 
recommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee. The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance 
Director. These polices include benchmark exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk. The Group risk management policies 
would also be reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant changes to the Group’s business. Exposures are monitored and reported to 
management on a monthly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded. The internal control procedures and risk 
management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the Internal Audit function. The last internal control review 
was undertaken during 2013 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory. A review will take place during 2015 as part of an ongoing 
two year review cycle.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness 
and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt 
instruments. In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s treasury department ensures that the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, and amounts due from payment service providers (‘PSPs’) 
exceed its combined client liabilities at all times. This excess is defined as the Client Liability Cover. Client liabilities principally represent customer 
deposits and progressive prize pools. 
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts 
due from PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a monthly basis, or more frequently if required.
The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of €200m that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no significant concentration of 
refinancing risk. 
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group. The Group’s principal financial assets are cash, 
bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
In December 2012 the Group entered into a £30m three year amortising term loan of which £5m was repaid in December 2013. As at 31 December 
2014 the drawn balance on this term loan was £25m (2013: £25m). In December 2013 the Group also entered into a £50m revolving credit facility for 
managing liquidity risk. This facility is available for the Group to draw upon until December 2016. As at 31 December 2014 the drawn balance on the 
facility was £20m (2013: £15m). Further details in relation to these facilities are disclosed in note 21.

Capital risk 
In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other 
than to address statutory requirements. The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Group’s net income. Accordingly, the 
Group’s policy is that net debt should not exceed €300 million and that the leverage ratio of net debt/Clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x. For the 
purposes of these limits net debt is defined as borrowings plus client liability less cash.

Credit risk
Operational: The Group’s operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits 
made after playing on the Group’s websites. Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable 
external source. Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis, including aged debtor analysis, and promptly takes corrective action 
if pre-agreed limits are exceeded. For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as 
industry knowledge, their statement of financial position, profitability, customer diversification, geographic diversification, long-term stability, 
management credibility, potential regulatory risk and historic payment track record. 
137
Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  29. Financial instruments and risk management (continued)
These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis. An internal rating of one is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of five is 
assessed as weak.

2 (Strong) 12.6 18.6
3 (Good) 3.1 4.7
4 (Satisfactory) 1.3 2.5
PSPs amounts due 32.4 50.0
Management consider the maximum credit exposure on amounts due from PSPs to be the carrying amount.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any 
partially impaired amounts or any impairment expense for the period. There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment 
grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector. To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group 
seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or, at least, better quality PSPs. 
Note 15 details the movement and level of provisions for PSPs.
Cash investments: The Group only invest cash with a small number of very strong European financial institutions. The Group also invests cash in 
instant access pooled money market funds with a minimum long-term credit rating of AAA on the principal, as defined by Moody’s rating agency. The 
Group can also purchase commercial paper provided the issuer is not a financial institution and has a one year credit default swap, as quoted by 
Bloomberg, of no more than 1%. 
Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities. The Group maintains monthly operational balances with strong local banks in Gibraltar, UK, 
France, Malta, Italy, Israel, Bulgaria, Austria, US and India to meet local salaries, expenses and legal requirements. In Italy, Spain and France the Group 
maintains domestic segregated player funds accounts as required by the respective regulatory authorities. Cash is also held as security in Austria, 
Italy and the UK primarily to support bank guarantees and as reserves for credit and debit card chargebacks. Other than this, non-central cash 
balances are kept to a minimum.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 all cash and short-term investment balances were held at banks.
The treasury department may only make the following cash investments, without prior written authority by the Board:
• cash deposits;
• pooled money market funds;
• certificates of deposit; and
• commercial paper.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value of 
future cash flows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
interest rates (interest rate risk), foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).
Currency and interest rate risk
The Group’s current net cash position is maintained primarily on a floating rate basis. In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the 
Group, the interest rate management policy would be reviewed. 
Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Group’s policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically 
and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and/or by holding cash in the relevant currency. Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge 
some or all of its forecast Sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months. No other forecast cash flows are hedged. The Group 
may also economically hedge material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is 
short (less than one month). Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a monthly basis. A €5m currency tolerance limit 
between Euros and US dollar, Sterling and Canadian dollar (reduced to €3m between Euro and any other currency) is permitted in order to avoid 
executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
138
bwin.party Annual report & accounts 2014
NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29. Financial instruments and risk management (continued)
Net investment exposures: The Group has the flexibility to hold debt in currencies other than Euros in order to hedge non-Euro investments up to 
50% of the net investment value. In managing the mix of on-going debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular 
currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios. 
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk 
The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments arising from a 10% 
strengthening or weakening in the reporting currency against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December. The Group is exposed to 
currency movements in the Euro, arising out of changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-Euro currencies. This analysis 
is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
Whilst the Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds significant amounts of cash at floating rates as well as cash equivalents and 
other assets to meet client liability obligations that are non-interest bearing and LIBOR based loans (see note 21), the exposure is actually not 
significant as the Group’s interest bearing assets and liabilities are naturally hedged. Therefore, interest rate sensitivity analysis has been omitted 
from the table below.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that specified changes occur. 
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause fluctuations in 
interest and exchange rates so that they vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be 
considered as a projection of likely future events and losses.

The Group has adopted and granted awards as a reward and retention incentive for employees, including the Executive Directors. The Group has 
used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value these options unless the Monte Carlo option pricing model is deemed more appropriate. An 
appropriate discount has been applied to reflect the fact that dividends are not paid on options that have not vested or have vested and have not 
been exercised.

bwin.party digital entertainment plc 2014 Incentive Plan (‘BIP’) 
The BIP was approved by the Company’s shareholders on 24 February 2014 and succeeds two previous plans – the Bonus Banking Plan (‘BBP’) and 
Value Creation Plan (‘VCP’). The BIP is split into two separate elements. Element A replaces the BBP and covers a three year period with annual 
performance targets set at the beginning of each year. Depending on the extent to which these targets are met, an amount may be credited or 
debited to the participant’s bonus account on the measurement date. 50% will be credited in the form of nil-cost share options with the other 
50% awarded in cash. Shortly after the measurement date, 50% of the cash balance will be paid to the participant. After the initial three years, half of 
the nil-cost options will vest with the other half plus the balance of any cash award vesting in year four. If the performance targets in any one year 
are not met the bonus account will be debited by 50% of its current value. The maximum annual contribution to the bonus account is 250% of salary.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  30. Share-based payments (continued)
Element B of the BIP , which replaces the VCP , allows for the annual grant of restricted shares dependent on the extent to which the Company has 
completed strategic and transformational objectives during the previous year, these projects having been set by the Remuneration Committee at 
the beginning of that previous year. Any award made under Element B is made in the form of a restricted share award or nil-cost share option. The 
shares vest on the third anniversary of grant, but are only eligible for sale on the fifth anniversary of grant. An annual Element B award may not 
exceed 300% of salary.

bwin.party Rollover Option Plan
These options were granted as a result of the Merger to replace the existing bwin options at the time using the same exchange ratio as for shares. 
They are subject to the original vesting conditions and have no performance conditions. No new awards are to be granted under this plan.
Global Share Plan (‘GSP’)
Awards of free shares worth up to a maximum of £25,000 (or equivalent) may be made to each eligible employee each year. The award may be subject 
to performance conditions. There is flexibility to grant different types of free share award including nil-cost options, conditional awards of shares 
and restricted shares where the employee is the owner of the shares from the date of award.
Additionally, where employees buy shares up to a maximum of £1,500 each, they may be awarded additional free shares on a matching basis, 
up to a maximum of two matching shares for each purchased share. Purchased shares must be held for a minimum of three years for the 
matching shares to vest.
Directors are not eligible to receive any awards under this plan.

Strategic  report Governance Financial performance  30. Share-based payments (continued)
FMV Plan
Options granted under this plan during the period generally vest in instalments over a three year period. There are no performance conditions 
attached to options issued by the Group under the terms of the FMV Plan. Directors are not eligible to receive any awards under this plan. No new 
awards are to be granted under this plan.
Nil-Cost Plan and Retention Awards
No new awards are to be made under the Nil-Cost Plan and are instead to be replaced by Retention Awards. These nil-cost options are not generally 
subject to performance conditions as this is regarded as detracting from their attraction and retention capabilities. Instead, these vest on a phased 
basis over a three to five year period. Awards are made under the Retention Awards and Ivy Action Plan schemes as a % of the employee’s salary on 
an individual and discretionary basis.
Orneon acquisition
As part of the Orneon acquisition the Group granted share options to key management of the acquired entities. These options are not subject to 
performance conditions but require continued employment for a period of two years from the date of acquisition. 
31. Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.89p per share which together with the interim dividend of 1.89 pence per share makes a total 
dividend of 3.78p per share for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: 3.60p). The final dividend, if approved at the Annual General Meeting, will be 
payable to shareholders on the Register of Shareholder Interests on 24 April 2015 (the ‘Record Date’). It is expected that dividends will be paid on 
27 May 2015. Shareholders wishing to receive dividends in Euros rather than Pounds Sterling will need to file a currency election and return it to the 
Group’s registrars on or before 8 May 2015. 
32. Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests include a 28% holding in BES S.A.S, a company incorporated in France. The loss attributable to the non-controlling interest 
was €1.4m (2013: €2.4m).
It also includes a 10% holding in bwin.party entertainment (NJ) LLC, a company incorporated in the US. The loss attributable to the non-controlling 
interest was €0.8m (2013: €0.4m). 
The balance of retained earnings attributable to non-controlling interests is disclosed in the table below:

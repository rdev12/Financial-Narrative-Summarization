John Ketteley
Executive Chairman
“We continued to implement our strategy of 
restructuring and rebalancing our Building 
Systems and Software operations with a  
view to reducing the Group’s risk profile  
and strengthening its financial position.”
In the last six months of the 18 month period ended 31 December 
2011, we continued to implement our strategy of restructuring and 
rebalancing our Building Systems and Software operations with 
a view to reducing the Group’s risk profile and strengthening its 
financial position. Our operating performance also improved and 
in the six month period ended 31 December 2011, our continuing 
operations produced operating profits of £334,000 compared with 
operating losses of £556,000 in the 12 months ended 30 June 2011. 
This has resulted in an operating loss for continuing operations of 
£222,000 after exceptional costs of £365,000, mainly relating to 
restructuring costs, in the period under review. Operating profit 
before exceptional costs amount to £143,000 compared to a loss of 
£3.3m for the 12 months ended 30 June 2010.
In the interim statement for the 12 months ended 30 June 2011, I 
referred to the profits from our software interests being more than 
offset by significantly increased losses of our Precast Concrete 
custodial accommodation and timber frame businesses because 
of a significant reduction in sales and lower margins. We have since 
disposed of Bell & Webster’s precast concrete custodial products 
business based at Hoveringham; we have also disposed of the 
timber frame operations based at Speke; finally, in December 2011, 
we disposed of our remaining Timber Engineering businesses, 
namely Gang-Nail Systems in the United Kingdom and International 
Truss Systems in South Africa.
The purpose and effect of these transactions was to reduce the 
risk profile of our Building Systems interests and to enable us to 
refinance a substantial portion of the trading and exceptional losses 
incurred by Bell & Webster Concrete’s custodial accommodation 
contracts business and by the timber frame manufacturing business.
Eleco is now made up of ElecoSoft
®
 and ElecoBuild
®
ElecoSoft
® 
comprises all our software interests based in Sweden, 
Germany and the United Kingdom. These include the Consultec
®
 
software brand originating in Sweden, the Esign
®
 and Arcon
®
 
software brands originating in Germany, and the Asta software 
brand originating in the United Kingdom.
ElecoBuild

interests, all of which are now based in the United Kingdom and 
include SpeedDeck

Products and Downer Cladding Systems; together with our 
remaining Precast Concrete interests, namely Bell & Webster 
Concrete and Milbury Systems.
Details of these interests and their respective brands are set out in 
the Operating and Financial Review section of this report.
Continuing Operations Performance Summary
Please bear in mind when reviewing the information contained in 
this statement, that the comparative figures shown are in respect of 
a 12 month period ended 30 June 2010, whereas the figures for the 
period under review are in respect of the 18 month period ended 31 
December 2011.
Turnover of Continuing Operations for the period under review 
amounted to £56.8m; Turnover for the year to 30 June 2010 
amounted to £45.9m.
Operating profit from continuing operations for the period under 
review before exceptional losses amounted to £143,000 (2010  
12 months: loss before exceptional losses £3.3m) and the reported 
loss from operations for the period under review was £222,000 
(2010 12 months: £2.7m). The exceptional costs of £365,000 for 
the period under review mainly relate to redundancy costs from 
business restructuring (2010: £2.8m). The Group’s continuing 
operations sustained a loss before tax in the period under review  
of £930,000 (2010 12 months: £3.2m).
Total Group operating loss for the 18 month period under review of 
£2.7m (2010 12 months: £5.5m), is equivalent to a loss per share of 
4.6p (2010: 9.1p loss per share).
The total reported Group loss includes losses of £4.0m of non-cash 
items including depreciation, amortisation and impairment of assets; 
it also includes the benefit of a net gain on disposal of the connector 
plate and timber frame businesses of £5.4m. As a consequence 
total cash outflow overall was limited to £2.2m in the eighteen month 
period under review. It should be noted that £1.2m in connection 
with the sale of our remaining timber engineering businesses was 
also placed in escrow in the period under review.
In the light of the sharp reduction that has occurred for 
ElecoBuild
®
’s Precast Concrete and Building Products interests, 
Eleco has moderated its investment in new capital projects for these 
businesses. Capital investment for the period under review was 
£1.3m (2010 12 months: £1.2m) and we anticipate that this lower 
level of capital investment in our ElecoBuild
®
 interests to continue in 
the current year. However, we expect the development of software 
programs by our ElecoSoft
®
 interests to continue as before.
Chairman’s Statement Eleco plc 
Report & Accounts 
2010/11
06
The actions that the Board undertook during the 18 month period 
under review to maintain the financial stability of the Group in a 
very difficult trading and financial climate gave rise to significant 
additional and unavoidable advisory, legal, banking and other 
professional fees, compared with equivalent costs incurred in the 
year ended 30 June 2011. These costs impacted significantly both 
our trading performance and our cash resources.
Operational Overview
ElecoSoft
®
Our Software businesses performed well and made a positive 
contribution in turnover and profits to the Group in the period 
under review. Turnover amounted to £23.4m in the period under 
review (2010 12 months: £13.7m), and the adjusted operating profit 
amounted to £2.3m (2010 12 months: £0.6m). ElecoSoft
®
 has 
started the current year well.
ElecoBuild
®
Building Products
Our Building Products businesses turnover in the period under 
review amounted to £14.7m (2010 12 months: £8.5m) and the 
adjusted operating profit was £817 ,000 (2010 12 months: loss 
£597,000).
On 19 December 2011 we announced the disposal of the business 
and assets of these businesses to Illinois Toolworks Inc. (“ITW”) 
for a total consideration of £7 .8m, of which £1.2m is currently held 
in escrow. These activities made a profit before tax of £42,000 
in the period under review and their net assets at the date of 
disposal amounted to £1.7m. I would like on your behalf to express 
our thanks to our former colleagues for their efforts and positive 
contribution to Eleco over the years and to wish them well in future 
as part of ITW.
 
ElecoBuild
®
’s Building Products businesses have experienced an 
improving order intake since the beginning of the year, albeit from 
a low base. Improvements in marketing techniques and product 
initiatives are also making a positive impact.
Precast Concrete
Turnover for the period under review was lower at £20.2m (2010: 
£24.7m) and the adjusted operating loss for the period amounted to 
£2.1m (2010 12 months: £2.8m).
Bell & Webster Concrete closed down its custodial contracts 
operations in the period under review and has since disposed of its 
Hoveringham facility; its hotel and student accommodation activities 
also contracted in the period under review due to lower demand. 
However, in the past few weeks it has received an increasing 
number of project enquires, which may be an early indication of a 
potential upturn in demand for its products. That said, management 
are very conscious of the need to contain costs, and in the absence 
of firm orders for its RoomSolutions
TM
 products at acceptable 
margins, that have, in place, contingency plans to reduce still further 
its manufacturing capacity.
Milbury has experienced a reasonable level of orders for its retaining 
walls since the beginning of the year; Bell & Webster Concrete less 
so. Both appear to be benefitting from the withdrawal of a number 
of direct competitors from their market, although the market itself 
remains subdued.
Chairman’s Statement continued
Developing BIM Solutions
Chalmers University of Technology is a highly progressive 
university situated in Gothenburg, Sweden. Chalmers is known 
for research and innovation with a wide range of applications 
including technology in the build environment.
Chalmers is using Consultec ByggProgram’s software as part of 
a research project to produce an integrated Building Information 
Modelling (BIM) solution. This solution is promoted by the University 
as a demonstration model of how BIM can be applied in modern 
day construction. 
Chalmers chose to use Consultec’s BidCon and PlanCon 
software in its BIM courses due to the reputation Consultec  
has within the Swedish construction industry. 
Three courses were conducted at Chalmers during the spring 
semester where students tested the benefits of BIM; outlining the 
process of creating a schedule based on a Building Information 
Model (BIM). The students were taught to create a spreadsheet in 
BidCon, using the calculations with the information in a 3D building 
model to produce a basis for a building schedule. The students 
then used PlanCon to optimise resources for the schedule. 
Students successfully developed a good understanding of the 
linkage between software and how BIM can be used to streamline 
the planning and costing process.
Chalmers University will continue to use BidCon and PlanCon 
within their courses.

Finance
Disposals of assets and businesses, together with a reduction in 
capital expenditure and cash generated from the profitable trading 
of our Software businesses have partially offset the adverse cash 
impact of the poor performance of our concrete and timber frame 
businesses in a very difficult market environment.
As a consequence, the Group was able to restrict its net bank 
borrowings at 31 December 2011 to £4.1m (2010: £1.9m) and as 
noted above, £1.2m of the consideration for the sale of Gang-Nail 
Systems and International Truss Systems is also held in escrow.  
It should also be noted that Group net bank borrowings as at  
29 February 2012 had reduced further to £3.7m (28 February  
2011: £9.3m).
I am pleased to say that our UK bankers, Lloyds Banking Group has 
renewed the Group’s banking facilities with effect from 30 March 
2012 for one year and the Directors are satisfied that the Group 
has sufficient working capital for its present requirements. We 
very much appreciate Lloyds Banking Group’s continued working 
relationship with us in such a difficult trading climate.
Dividends
The Board do not propose to recommend the payment of a 
dividend in respect of the period under review. However, the Board 
has noted the improvement in the Company’s financial position and 
also in the recent performance of its continuing businesses. It will 
in due course consider recommending to its shareholders a return 
to dividend payments as and when the Company’s trading position 
and performance permits.
Employees
Implementing the changes noted above in current markets has 
placed very significant and stressful demands on our employees, 
100 of whom unfortunately became redundant in the period 
under review because of the need to restructure and down size 
some of our Building Systems businesses. Therefore, on behalf of 
shareholders and the Board, I would like to thank all our employees 
for their hard work and dedication during the period under review.

ElecoSoft

 continues to perform well and behind its outstanding 
portfolio of construction software is a highly talented, creative and 
motivated team of software professionals who are engaged on a 
number of exciting opportunities for expansion in the construction 
software space. The challenge for our colleagues in ElecoSoft
®
 in 
the year ahead is to streamline our software businesses, to enhance 
its internal and external initiatives and software development 
collaboration, to bear down on its cost base - and to deliver  
the promise.
Our colleagues involved in our ElecoBuild
®
 businesses have begun 
to apply improved marketing techniques to good effect, which 
has enabled them to recover sales and to put in place a number 
of interesting and creative business initiatives which have already 
resulted in improved performance. ElecoBuild
®
 will continue to 
bear down on costs in the year ahead and may need to consider 
further rationalisation to remain competitive. However, even though 
demand remains weak in certain sectors, and the UK economy 
continues to be fragile, I am confident that our colleagues in 
ElecoBuild
®
 will deal positively with any new challenges faced by 
their businesses as they arise.
Eleco has come through an extraordinarily difficult period this 
past 18 months. However, I am satisfied, that as a consequence 
of the judgements we made and the actions we took to tackle the 
problems we faced, Eleco is now a much better balanced and 
financed Group.
I am confident that Eleco is now well placed to take advantage of 
any improvement in the markets we serve in the year ahead.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) – 
working toward a collaborative future.
Asta Powerproject is being used as a 
planning software tool to develop schedule 
programmes for import into 4D modelling 
software to create 4D BIM (3D CAD + 
Asta Powerproject scheduling). The power 
of visualisation, coordination, simulation 
and optimisation from 3D, 4D, and BIM 
computer technologies allow clients to meet 
customer, design, construction, and program 
requirements more effectively.
Eleco has taken the initial steps in the area of 
BIM by working with leading vendors such as 
Tekla, Synchro, DStudio and Navisworks to 
provide 4D BIM modelling. Such technology 
is already being used to support significant 
construction projects. 
4D BIM improves communication with 
stakeholders by linking the dynamic scene 
with different Asta Powerproject timelines 
and displaying the ongoing consequences 
of building strategies. Any potential issues in 
the construction model, such as structural 
clashes, unsafe work areas and site 
delivery and movement conflicts are quickly 
highlighted before they become a problem, 
which saves considerable time and money.

Operating and Financial Review
Market Background
Eleco’s activities are focused on the construction market with 
operations in the UK, Sweden, Germany and Belgium. These 
operations address their local markets, with the Software businesses 
also addressing markets in other countries by direct to market activity 
and via distributors. 
All markets served by the Group were challenging in the period 
under review with depressed demand stemming from the direct 
impact of a lack of financial confidence and economic growth. 
However, this backdrop has served the Group well to restructure 
its activities to provide a lower cost base from which to exploit its 
various markets in the future.
Group Strategy and Results
In the period the Group has followed a five point strategy to:
•	 Reduce operational overhead and stop trading losses;
•	 Sell excess assets and operations where value can be achieved;
•	 Where possible reduce bank borrowings and renew working 
capital facilities;
•	 Strategically acquire incremental and complementary software 
activities; and
•	 Actively manage the legacy pension liability. 
The result has been a small operational profit for the continuing 
businesses before exceptionals of £143,000 for the 18 months 
ended 31 December 2011 (2010: loss £3.3m) and a loss for the 
period, including all discontinued activities of £2.7m  
(2010: £5.5m). 
Key events in the 18 months to 31 December 2011 and post the 
balance sheet date have been:
•	 Renewal of Group working capital bank facilities with Lloyds TSB 
Bank in March 2012.
•	 Acquisition of Novator Projeckstyrning in March 2012.
•	 Sale of the long leasehold precast site at Hoveringham and 
associated plant in February 2012.
•	 Disposal of the assets and undertaking of Gang-Nail and 
International Truss Systems’ in December 2011.
•	 Disposal of the assets and undertaking of Eleco Timber Frame’s 
activities in Speke together with extraction from the leasehold 
property in August 2011.
•	 Acquisition of Nilsson & Sahlin Arkitekter in August 2011.
•	 Acquisition of Lubekunsult in September 2010.
•	 Cessation of custodial precast contract work, together with 
agreeing the final account on all past contracts.
•	 A 100 employee reduction in the continuing Building Systems 
businesses from 238 people at 1 July 2010 to 138 people at 
31 December 2011.
•	 Implementation of a Group-led pension strategy including the 
completion of a new investment strategy and the first liability 
management programme, Pension Increase Exchange.
The Board continues to monitor the markets and operations of the 
continuing businesses and will take further corrective action  
if necessary. 
An annual impairment review by the Group has resulted in 
impairment charges against continuing businesses property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets totalling £22,000 for the period 
(2010: £726,000).
Net interest receivable from total operations excluding pension 
related items was £63,000 (2010: £41,000). Under IAS19, a 
finance charge of £0.5m (2010: £0.6m) is reported, being the 
difference between the net investment return on assets of the Eleco 
Retirement and Benefits Scheme expected at the outset of the year 
and the unwinding of the discount during the year used to determine 
the Scheme liabilities at the beginning of the year.

were used in a number of high profile international projects including 
the redevelopment of Christchurch in New Zealand, following the 
earthquake there, the Dubai Metro in the Emirates and in the original 
strategic planning phase for the London Olympic Games.
Sweden
Estimating, Site Control and Timber Engineering Software; 
Architectural and Engineering Services
Headquartered in Skelleftea, Sweden, Consultec accounted for 
54% of total software sales in the period under review. Revenue 
amounted to £12.3m for the 18 months ended 31 December 2011  
(2010: £6.3m).
Consultec provides estimation software and services to an 
impressive customer list in the construction, manufacturing, 
electrical and plumbing industries mainly in Sweden, but also 
increasingly in international markets. In September 2010 it extended 
this offering to the ventilation market with the acquisition of 
Lubekonsult AB and in March 2012 acquired the Swedish distributor 
of Asta project management software.  Eleco plc

Operating and Financial Review continued
Consultec also lists project management and site control software 
within its product portfolio and has strengthened the links between 
these products and its estimation tools to produce a broader 
offering for larger clients. Its timber engineering products include 
software for stair design and manufacture and structural analysis 
software for load-bearing beams.
Consultec is also engaged in the provision of architectural and 
engineering services. In 2011, it expanded these activities with 
the acquisition of Nilsson & Sahlin, a leading firm of architects and 
engineers to further strengthen its position in these markets in the 
North of Sweden and to bring in new skills for the design of large 
timber buildings.
Germany
Visualisation Software, Marketing Software and Project and 
Resource Management Software
Our Visualisation, Marketing Software and Project and Resource 
Management Software in Germany accounted for 23% of total 
software sales in the period under review. Revenue amounted to 
£5.5m for the 18 months ended 31 December 2011 (2010: £2.4m).
Visualisation Software
Eleco Software continued to distribute the well established design 
and visualisation software popular with architectural and design 
firms across Germany, Arcon
®
. Development of the next generation 
of Arcon
®
, is now well under way and made good progress in the 
period. This new version of Arcon
®
 will include advances in the user 
interface design as well as major improvements in its graphics and 
rendering capabilities.
Marketing and Visualisation Software
Our colleagues at Esign
®
 have again created major new features 
for its visualisation programs for manufacturers, retailers and their 
customers. It has continued to add leading brands and companies to 
its customer base. It now includes many leading flooring companies 
in its customer base. It also experienced a particularly successful 
Domotex Exhibition in Hanover this year and as a direct consequence 
is now engaged in discussions with a leading Chinese flooring 
distributor. It launched its latest Marketing Management software at 
Domotex which was well received and will more tightly integrate the 
software with existing business systems.
Project and Resource Management Software
In 2009, we acquired the German distributor of Asta products, 
which is based in Karlsruhe. Revenue of Asta Development GmbH 
amounted to £1.6m for the 18 months ended 31 December 2011 
(2010: £1.0m). This accounts for 7% of the total Software sales in 
the period under review.
On 18 December 2011, we learnt of the untimely death of our 
colleague Stefan Wolf, Managing Director of Asta Development 
GmbH. He made an outstanding contribution to our business and 
we wish to record our sadness at the loss of such a valued friend 
and colleague.

Bell & Webster Concrete continues to operate in the contractual 
supply chain of the UK construction industry targeting new build 
hotels and student accommodation. All contracts to supply and 
erect in the more technically demanding market of custodial projects 
have been successfully concluded. The number of projects coming 
to the physical delivery phase in the UK from our core hotel and 
student accommodation markets has resulted in a substantial 
downsizing of the activities of Bell & Webster. The market conditions 
continue to represent a challenging environment for Bell & Webster 
to return to profit.
Milbury Systems supplies precast concrete products to the 
agricultural, waste recycling, flood defence and construction 
markets. Milbury Systems also suffered losses on some contractual 
supply work in the period, but such work has been discontinued 
with appropriate reductions in overheads.
Bell & Webster Concrete has generated significant profits and cash 
for the Group in the past but, as with Milbury Systems, return to 
making a positive contribution to the Group is significantly influenced 
by recovery and growth in the UK construction, specifically precast 
concrete industry.
Key Performance Indicators and Business Monitoring
Each business is monitored in detail by the Board using a range 
of key performance indicators some of which are specific to the 
particular business. 
Business performance is monitored by the setting of budgets with 
each management team, monthly review of delivery to budget with 
reference to the following measures:
•	 Sales and order intake;
•	 Project and product profitability;
•	 Profitability and forecast profitability;
•	 Historic and forecast cash flow;
•	 Overhead control; and
•	 Headcount.
Key Risks
The markets in which the Group operates, especially the UK 
building systems market, continues to be the key risk the Board 
considers to be the main restriction to allowing the Group to achieve 
improved sales and profitability, hence:
•	 The Turnaround Plan reported in the last annual review, while 
in part complete, has remaining tasks to deliver all parts of 
the Group to profitability, specifically the Precast Concrete 
operations.  Eleco plc 
Report & Accounts 
2010/11 11
•	 Whilst both public and private sector finance remains restricted 
and uncertain, the inherent uncertainty in the Group’s markets 
will continue. Macro economic events that effect the flow of 
finance to construction projects in a positive or negative way will 
impact on the Group’s results.
•	 With the current financial environment and the strains put on 
the Group’s customers, the risk of customer insolvency leading 
to loss of business and potential bad debts is a concern. Credit 
insurance is however maintained at all Precast Concrete and 
Building Products businesses to mitigate such bad debt events.
•	 Suppliers to the Group’s businesses are influenced by the credit 
rating agencies views on sectors and operations as they change 
from time to time. This is managed by maintaining the strong 
relationships the Group’s companies have developed with their 
suppliers during the recent past challenging trading period. 
•	 Sustaining profitable growth in all the Group’s businesses is 
determined by retaining our existing high quality team and 
attracting new talent. This will become more challenging as any 
recovery in the Groups’ markets arises. 
Capital and Financing
The Group’s capital structure has changed during the period. 
Specifically in relation to the bank facilities enjoyed by the Group, 
while the term loan that is due to be repaid by July 2016 continues, 
the £10m revolving credit facility used to fund working capital and 
previously reported as due for renewal by July 2012 was replaced 
by a £4.5m overdraft facility in March 2012. The Group’s bank debt 
facilities are further described in Note 22.
Pension Strategy
In the period under review the following has been implemented:
•	 Revised investment strategy that aims to significantly lower 
the investment risk but maintain a return at or in excess of the 
valuation assumptions.
•	 Execution of a Pension Increase Exchange programme.
Further implementation of other deficit reduction measures 
in respect of which the Company, the Trustee Company and 
beneficiary interests are aligned are being explored but remain 
dependent upon final agreement in detail between the Trustee 
Company and the Group. The financial impact cannot therefore  
be disclosed at this time.
Loss Per Share and Dividend
The loss per share on continuing operations was 2.0p  
(2010: loss 4.8p).
The loss per share on total operations activities was 4.6p 
(2010: loss 9.1p).
Having regard to the Company’s current financial position and 
performance, the Board is not in a position to recommend the 
payment of a dividend in respect of the 18 months ended 31 
December 2011 but will consider a return to recommending 
dividend payments as and when the Company’s trading position 
and performance permits.
Shareholders’ Equity and Net Assets
At 31 December 2011, shareholders’ equity amounted to £14.2m 
(2010: £15.3m), after recognising £3.7m (2010: £7 .1m), net of the 
related deferred tax asset, as a retirement benefits liability.
At 31 December 2011, net tangible assets, after taking account of 
the retirement benefits liability accounted for under IAS19, represent 
14% (2010: 43%) of total net assets.

The Group’s cash position reflects trading performance, sale of 
businesses and excess assets, and was in net debt at 31 December 
2011 of £4.1m (2010: net debt £1.9m). 
Of all the strategic transactions in the period under review the sale 
of the connector plate activities of Gang-Nail and International 
Truss Systems for total funds receivable of £8.0m in December 
2011, of which £6.8m was paid in cash at completion was the most 
significant reduction in the accumulated debt of the Group.
Summary
The recovery of the Building Systems businesses under the Plan 
reported in the last annual review was less readily achievable than 
envisaged in the Plan due to the continuing weakness of demand in 
the Building Systems markets. However, much progress had been 
made, despite the market conditions and the continuing operations 
are well placed to exploit their chosen markets.

ElecoBuild
®
 provides the envelope to 
house the most up to date trams in  
the World.
As part of a £100 million upgrade scheme, 
Eleco subsidiary businesses, SpeedDeck 
Building Systems Limited (SpeedDeck) and 
Downer Cladding Systems Limited (Downer) 
supplied the secret-fix roofing and wall 
cladding solution for the new Blackpool  
Tram Depot.
The iconic building incorporates a wave-
effect roof that curves to form the west, 
sea facing wall. The façade continues the 
wave-effect theme with curved secret-fix 
rainscreen panels with an illuminated feature. 
Due to its exposed coastal location, the new 
tram depot required materials that could 
stand up to the rigours of salt spray and 
windblown sand. As such, SpeedDeck’s 
standing seam roofing and Downer’s Façade 
system was selected to meet the life span 
requirements whilst delivering outstanding 
aesthetics.
Paul Grocott, programme manager for the 
tram upgrade, said: “We have got a very 
modern depot, as well as being a new 
landmark building.”
VolkerFitzpatrick, an Asta Power project 
client was appointed as the main contractor 
for the project. Ian Simmons, Building 
Manager from VolkerFitzpatrick, commented, 
“Due to the simple clip fix method associated 
with SpeedDeck, it was possible to quickly 
and easily put the system up, providing 
shelter to the building underneath so that 
internal works could begin. Compared to 
similar systems, SpeedDeck also proved to 
be more cost effective as fewer staff were 
needed to install the system, helping to 
generate savings that were significant to the 
whole project. Due to the secret-fix nature 
of the system, there is no potential for leaks 
to occur. With no exposed fixings, there is 
no possibility of rust or corrosion making the 
system an ideal solution for this project.”
He continued, “From an aesthetic 
perspective, SpeedDeck provides a 
continuous, fluid finish due to its fixing 
method. By using the material across the roof 
and adjoining western elevation, the building 
sits comfortably alongside the seascape.”
The five shades of blue waved façade utilises 
Downer’s corrosion resistant aluminium 
secret-fix system. The waveform panels run 
in two dimensions making the fixing element 
crucial to meet the aesthetic design while 
surviving the seaside environment. 
To generate the exact curvature and flow 
of the waveform, Downer identified specific 
dimensional points by mapping out the whole 
wall surface. Downer then proceeded to 
manufacture the aluminium fixing system to 
create an underlying subframe that, in itself, 
mimic undulating railway tracks from which 
each row of panels hang.
The waveform panels are created from 
Reynobond
®
 aluminium composite material 
through computer controlled machining. 
A combination of structural adhesive and 
mechanical construction provides the 
required strength and smoothness of form. 
Operational since 1885, the Blackpool 
tram network will benefit greatly from the 
new depot as a permanent site to carry 
out periodic maintenance works as well as 
providing a secure place in which the new low 
floor trams can be stored when they are not in 
use. As such, the ElecoBuild
®
 systems have 
been used to help build a strong and robust 
tram storage building that can withstand the 
elements, whilst providing an architecturally 
interesting building exterior.

Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors and senior 
executives
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration 
packages offered encourage and reward performance in a manner 
which is consistent with the long-term interests of shareholders.
 
The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises four 
elements:
i) a basic salary together with benefits-in-kind (such as company 
car, private petrol and medical insurance);
ii) a non-pensionable performance-related annual bonus based 
on the Group’s performance and individual contribution to that 
performance. The Executive Directors are contractually entitled 
to a bonus scheme, but the amount to be paid is determined by 
the Remuneration Committee; 
iii) pension benefits based solely on basic salary; and
iv) performance-related share awards and non-pensionable 
bonuses under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan. 
 
Executive Directors’ contracts
The Executive Directors have service agreements, which provide for 
a notice period as stated hereunder. In the event that employment 
with the Company is terminated without notice, the contracts do not 
provide for payment of a specific sum for compensation.
Commencement dates and notice periods of contracts (as 
amended) are as follows:
J H B Ketteley (3 July 1997: 12 months);
M L Turner (27 January 2011: 1 month); and
M B McCullen (1 March 2007: 12 months).
Interest in contracts
There are no contracts of significance between the Company or its 
subsidiary companies and any of the Directors. During the 18 month 
period, for expenses or services provided in the normal course of 
business, the Group paid £7 ,500 (2010: nil) to J H B Ketteley & Co 
Limited of which J H B Ketteley is a Director and in which he has  
an interest. An amount of £37 ,500 (2010: £25,000) was paid to  
J H B Ketteley & Co Limited under a lease for occupation by the 
Company of 66 Clifton Street, London EC2A 4HB. 
Corporate governance
Although companies listed on AIM are not required to comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board is committed to 
ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are followed 
as appropriate to the Company’s size and activity.
The Board of Directors, which consisted for most of the period of 
the Executive Chairman, Chief Operating Officer, Group Finance 
Director, one other Executive Director and two independent  
Non-Executive Directors, meets at least ten times throughout a year. 
The Directors have access to independent professional advice in 
executing their duties on behalf of the Company.
The Board has established the following committees:
Audit committee
The Audit Committee, which consists of the two Non-Executive 
Directors and is chaired by J B Edwards, has specific terms 
of reference and meets with the auditors at least twice a year. 
The Committee reviews the financial statements prior to their 
recommendation to the Board for approval and assists the Board 
in ensuring that appropriate accounting policies, internal financial 
controls and compliance procedures are in place. 
Remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee, which consists of the two  
Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by J Cohen, is responsible 
for determining the remuneration arrangements of the Executive 
Directors and for advising the Board on the Company’s 
remuneration policy for senior executives.
Nominations committee
The Nominations Committee consists of the Non-Executive 
Directors and chaired by the Executive Chairman, is responsible 
for reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
its Committees and evaluating potential candidates for nomination 
when and if it is deemed necessary to appoint a new Director to 
the Board. The Committee makes its recommendations to the full 
Board for its consideration and approval.
Control environment
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s systems 
of internal financial and other control. These are designed to give 
reasonable, though not absolute, assurance as to the reliability of 
information, the maintenance of adequate accounting records, the 
safeguarding of assets against unauthorised use or disposition and 
that the Group’s businesses are being operated with appropriate 
awareness of the operational risks to which they are exposed.
The Directors have established an organisational structure with clear 
lines of responsibility and delegated authority. Eleco plc

•	 financial reporting, within a comprehensive financial planning and 
accounting framework, including the approval by the Board of 
the detailed annual budget and the regular consideration by the 
Board of actual results compared with budgets and forecasts; 
•	 clearly defined capital expenditure and investment control 
guidelines and procedures; and
•	 monitoring of business risks, with key risks identified and

Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the financial 
statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have to prepare 
the financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company and 
group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as each of the Directors is aware: 
•	 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and
•	 the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information  
to auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Directors’ report are listed on page 13. Having made 
enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors, each 
of these Directors confirms that to the best of each Director‘s 
knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the 
preparation of their report of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware and each Director has taken all steps a Director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.
Going concern
A statement regarding the going concern of the business is set out 
in Significant Accounting Policies on page 23.
Research and development
Product innovation and development is a continuous process.  
The Group commits resources to the development of new products 
and quality improvements to existing products and processes in all  
its business segments.
Employee involvement
The Group is committed to a policy of involvement by keeping its 
employees fully informed regarding its performance and prospects. 
Employees are encouraged to present their suggestions and views.
Employment of disabled persons
The Company’s policy is to provide equality of opportunity for all 
employees without discrimination and continues to encourage the 
employment, training and advancement of disabled persons in 
accordance with their abilities and aptitudes, provided that they can 
be employed in a safe working environment. Suitable employment 
would, if possible, be found for any employee who becomes 
disabled during the course of their employment with the Group.
Policy regarding the payment of suppliers
The Company’s policy is to agree terms of payment with suppliers at 
the commencement of the trading or contractual relationship, and to 
operate within such terms subject to satisfactory completion of the 
suppliers’ obligations. At 31 December 2011, the Group’s average 
creditor payment period was 75 days.
Charitable contributions
During the financial 18 month period no donations to charities and 
good causes were made. The Group does not make any political 
donations.
Directors’ indemnities
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions (as defined in Section 
234(2) of the Companies Act 2006) are in force for the benefit of the 
Directors.

Significant Accounting Policies
Eleco plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled 
in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The 
consolidated financial statements for the 18 months ended 31 
December 2011 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the “Group”) The consolidated and parent 
Company financial statements were authorised for issuance on 
30 March 2012.
The address of the registered office is given on page 13. The nature 
of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in 
the Chairman’s Statement on pages 5 to 7 , Operating and Financial 
Review on pages 9 to 11, Directors Report on page 14 and note 2 
on pages 28 to 31.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which 
is the currency of the primary economic environment within which 
the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out below.
A. Statement of compliance
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use by the European Union and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable for Companies reporting under 
IFRS. On publishing the Company financial statements together with 
the Group financial statements the Company has taken advantage 
of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present 
its individual income statement and related notes that form part of 
the approved financial statements.
B. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except assets classified as held for sale and all 
financial information has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the accounting policies, which follow IFRS in issue, 
adopted by the EU and effective at 31 December 2011.
Discontinued operations
Following the disposal of the connector plate businesses in the 
UK and South Africa the Directors considered that the proceeds 
from the disposal of the businesses should follow the description 
afforded within the legal documentation. Explicitly, the value of 
the business was £7 .8m and there was a financing cost to ITW 
due to the delayed completion of the transaction of £150,000. 
Therefore, £150,000 of finance income has been recognised in the 
consolidated income statement under discontinued operations.
Adoption of new and revised standards
New accounting standards and interpretations are effective for 
the first time in the current period but have had no impact on the 
results or the financial position of the Group. Furthermore, new 
standards, new interpretations and amendments to standards and 
interpretations that have been issued, but are not effective for the 
current period, have not been adopted early.
C. Going concern
The Board has considered a number of factors in determining the 
principle of going concern in the preparation of the Report and 
Accounts for the 18 month period to 31 December 2011.
One of the key factors was the approval of a new day-to-day 
working capital facility through the use of an overdraft which was set 
up on 30 March 2012 for a period of one year. The Directors have 
no reason to doubt that this facility cannot be renegotiated beyond 
one year. This facility replaces the revolving credit facility that was 
due to expire in July 2012. In addition, the Group has a longer term 
debt financing requirement which it funds through a Term Loan, 
repayable in 20 quarterly instalments, that commenced in April 2011. 
In setting the financial covenants the Directors have negotiated 
appropriate cash flow headroom to allow a degree of flexibility were 
there to be a further downturn in economic conditions.
In addition to the approved new funding from the Group’s bankers, 
the Group’s latest budget shows an acceptable UK headroom over 
the period to 30 June 2013, together with all overseas businesses 
forecasting profits and positive cash flows. Other factors that 
were considered include the deferred consideration receivable of 
£1.2m. Of this amount, £400,000 is payable in December 2012 
and the remaining £800,000 in December 2013. Furthermore, the 
Group recognises that it still has assets surplus to requirements, 
specifically in the form of freehold properties which it may be able to 
realise into cash.
The Group’s activities, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Operating and Financial Review on pages 9 to 11. Note 28 to the 
financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s borrowing requirements 
for the next 12 months and the financial covenant tests set out in the 
banking facilities agreement and confirm the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
D. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings for 
the 18 months ended 31 December 2011 and the comparative 
year ended 30 June 2010. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by 
the Group and their results have been adjusted, where necessary, 
to ensure accounting policies are consistent with those of the 
Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through 
voting rights.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised 
profits and losses arising from intra-Group transactions, are 
eliminated in full.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold in the year are included 
in the consolidated income statement from or up to the date control 
passes until control ceases.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is dealt with using the purchase 
method. The purchase method involves the recognition at fair value 
of all identifiable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, including 
contingent liabilities of the subsidiary regardless of whether or not 
they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior 
to acquisition. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Eleco plc

Significant Accounting Policies continued
Business disposals
During the period under review, the Group sold the business 
and assets of its timber frame manufacturing operation in Speke, 
Liverpool on 31 August 2011 and its connector plate businesses 
in the UK and South Africa on 17 December 2011. In addition, 
the Precast Concrete custodial operation based at Hoveringham, 
Nottinghamshire was closed on 30 June 2011 and the site was 
actually being marketed for sale at the period end. Consequently 
the trading results of these operations, together with the contracting 
activities at the Group’s precast concrete operation in Lydney, 
Gloucestershire, have been consolidated in the Group’s income 
Statement under discontinued operations for the period.
In accordance with IFRS 5, prior year income statement 
comparatives have been restated so as to report these businesses 
as discontinued operations.
E. Significant accounting judgements and estimates
Application of the Group’s accounting policies in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires judgements and 
estimates that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses reported in the financial statements. These judgements 
and estimates may be affected by subsequent events or actions 
such that actual results may ultimately differ from the estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an 
annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating 
the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the 
expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also 
to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
value of those cash flows. Further details are given in note 11.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme that provides 
benefits to a number of current and former employees. The value of 
the scheme deficit is sensitive to the market value of the scheme’s 
assets, the discount rates and actuarial assumptions related to 
mortality and other factors. Further details are given in note 24.
Taxation
Taxation legislation is highly complex. In preparing the financial 
statements the taxation liability is estimated taking appropriate 
professional advice. However, determination of the agreed liabilities 
may take some time and the eventual amounts paid may differ from 
the liabilities recorded in the financial statements.
Similarly, judgement is required in relation to the recognition of 
assets and liabilities in relation to deferred taxation, in particular the 
extent to which assets should be recognised.
Revenue recognition on long-term contracts
Revenue and profit is recognised based upon the extent of 
completion and expected outcomes of profit, once these can be 
estimated with reasonable reliability. However, unforeseen events 
may adversely impact on the accuracy of the estimates. Where 
the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, 
contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Further details are 
given in note 1.
F. Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods represents the fair value of 
consideration received or receivable in respect of goods supplied 
to third parties in the period, excluding value added tax and trade 
discounts, and is recognised when goods are delivered. Service 
revenue from software maintenance and support contracts is 
treated as deferred income and taken to revenue in the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis in line with the service and 
obligations over the term of the contract.
Revenue is recognised on contract work in progress at an 
amount appropriate to the stage of completion as measured by 
work performed. The amount of profit attributable to the stage of 
completion of a contract is recognised when the outcome of the 
contract can be estimated with reasonable reliability. Provision is 
made for foreseen losses as soon as there is an indication that a loss 
is apparent. Amounts due from customers under long-term contracts 
are included within trade and other receivables and amounts 
recoverable on contracts. Amounts recoverable on contracts 
represent revenue recognised in excess of invoiced amounts.
G. Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
cost of the acquisition, including expenses, over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. The 
carrying value of goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed 
for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Other intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost 
and on a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the 
date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, an intangible asset 
is held at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
On disposal, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in 
the determination of profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained 
at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for 
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK 
GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful economic lives and charged to administration 
expenses in the income statement. The useful economic life of each 
class of intangible asset is as follows:
Customer relationships – up to 12 years
Intellectual property – up to 5 years
The Group owns intellectual property both in its software tools and 
software products. Intellectual property purchased is capitalised 
at cost and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its expected 
useful life.
Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development 
expenditure on a project is written off as incurred unless it can be 
demonstrated that the following conditions for capitalisation, in 
accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets, are met:
•	 the intention to complete the development of the intangible asset 
and use or sell it;
•	 the development costs are separately identifiable and can be 
measured reliably;
•	 management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and 
commercial viability of the project, so that it will be available for 
use or sale; Eleco plc 
Report & Accounts 
2010/11 25
•	 management are satisfied with the availability of technical, 
financial and other resources to complete the development and 
to use or sell the intangible asset; and
•	 it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefit.
Any subsequent development costs are capitalised and are 
amortised from the date the product or process is available for use, 
on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
The carrying amounts of intangible assets are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and in the case 
of capitalised development expenditure reviewed for impairment 
annually while the asset is not yet in use.
H. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase cost, together 
with any directly attributable costs of acquisition. The carrying 
amount and useful lives of property, plant and equipment with 
material residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, 
except land, on a straight-line basis to write down the assets to their 
estimated residual value over the useful economic life of the asset  
as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Long leasehold buildings –  50 years or term of the lease,  
if shorter
Short leasehold property – over the term of the lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles – 2 to 10 years
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, those components are accounted for as 
separate items of property, plant and equipment.
I. Impairment of assets
Goodwill
The carrying amounts of the Group’s goodwill assets are assessed 
annually as to whether an impairment adjustment may be required. 
When annual impairment testing for assets is required, the assets 
under review are grouped under the appropriate cash generating 
unit for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Goodwill 
is held at CGU level and allocated directly to the CGU under review. 
The Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount, 
based on the higher of the asset’s value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows of the CGU are discounted to their present value using an 
appropriate discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An 
impairment charge is initially made against goodwill of the CGU and 
thereafter against other assets. Any impairment is charged to the 
income statement under the relevant expense heading.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine 
the extent of any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of the assets value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 
Value in use is calculated using cash flow projections for the asset 
discounted at the Group’s cost of capital. If the recoverable amount 
of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the income 
statement.
A previously recognised impairment loss, other than goodwill, is 
reversed only if there has been a change in the previous indicator 
used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the 
last impairment loss was recognised. The reinstated carrying 
amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of amortisation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years.
J. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and 
bringing them to their existing location and condition. The cost of 
manufactured inventories and work in progress includes related 
production overheads based on normal operating activity and is 
calculated using the first in first out method. Net realisable value is 
based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal.
K. Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially stated 
at their fair value. Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost 
as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Allowances for irrecoverable amounts are made when 
there is evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the 
amount due. The impairment recorded is the difference between 
the carrying value of the receivables and the estimated future cash 
flows. Any impairment required is recorded in the income statement 
in administrative expenses.
L. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the 
consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
M. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Assets and businesses are classified as held for sale, and stated at 
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, if their 
carrying amount will be recovered or settled principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. A discontinued 
operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a 
separate major line of business that has been disposed of, has been 
abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
N. Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all of 
the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset, are capitalised at 
the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if 
lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and 
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
charged directly against income. Eleco plc 
Report & Accounts 
2010/11
26
Significant Accounting Policies continued
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
estimated life of the asset or the lease term. Leases, where the 
lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership 
of the asset, are classified as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
O. Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions  
are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
on money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
P. Employee benefits
Pension schemes
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which 
provides benefits based on final pensionable pay. The scheme 
closed to future accrual on 31 December 2009. The defined benefit 
scheme is valued every three years by a professionally qualified 
independent actuary, the rates of contribution payable being 
determined by the actuary.
The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees 
during the year is charged to the income statement in the year. 
The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of 
past service, where amendments to benefits vest immediately, is 
also charged to the income statement in the year. The expected 
return on the assets of the scheme during the year, based on the 
market value of scheme assets at the start of the financial year, is 
included within finance income/charge. This also includes a charge 
representing the expected increase in liabilities of the scheme during 
the year, arising from the liabilities of the scheme being one year 
closer to payment. The resulting net finance amount is reported in 
the income statement.
Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during 
the year are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive 
income in the year, together with differences from actual experience 
and from changes in actuarial assumptions. The net deficit on 
the defined benefit pension scheme, representing the difference 
between the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the 
fair value of scheme assets (based upon market price information 
and in the case of quoted securities the published bid price) is 
reported on the balance sheet.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes and multi-
employer schemes are charged to the income statement as they 
become payable.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted 
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which 
ends on the date on which the relevant employees is unconditionally 
entitled to the award. The fair value of the employees services is 
determined by reference to the fair value of instruments granted 
using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, account is taken of the probabilities of performance 
achievement and other conditions linked to the price of the shares 
of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense 
is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or 
otherwise of non-market conditions. The movement in cumulative 
expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the 
income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Shares, the subject of share awards granted under the long-term 
incentive plan, may be allotted to the employee share ownership 
trust at any time from the date of grant. The shares held by the 
trust do not qualify for dividends and are deducted from equity 
attributable to shareholders of the parent through other reserves. 
The shares allotted to the trust are accounted for at the mid market 
price on the date of transaction.
Q. Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of 
the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each Group company are expressed in UK Pounds 
Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the 
presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of transaction. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating 
monetary items at rates different from those at which they were 
initially recorded are recognised in the income statement for the 
period in which they arise.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in a different 
functional currency to that of the Group’s presentational currency 
are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date and results are translated at the average 
rate of exchange for the year. The use of an average exchange 
rate for the year rather than actual exchange rates at the dates of 
transactions is considered to approximate to actual rates for the 
translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries.
Differences on exchange, arising from the retranslation of the 
opening net investment in subsidiary companies and from the 
translation of the results of those companies at an average rate, are 
taken to reserves and reported in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-
trading inter-group balances reported in foreign subsidiaries are 
regarded as part of the net investment in the subsidiary and treated 
as a movement in the translation reserve on consolidation. When an 
operation is sold, amounts recognised in reserves on the translation 
of foreign operations are recycled through the income statement. Eleco plc 
Report & Accounts 
2010/11 27
R. Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument and arise principally 
through the provision of goods and services to customers (trade 
and other receivables) but also include other types of contractual 
monetary assets. Trade and other receivables are initially recorded 
at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. A financial asset is derecognised only 
where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire 
or the financial asset is transferred and that transfer qualifies for 
derecognition.
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial 
assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Trade payables 
and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recorded 
at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method. Bank borrowings are initially 
recognised at the fair value on initial recognition date, which in 
the case of an arms length transaction is the amount advanced, 
exclusive of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue 
of the instrument and subsequently carried at amortised cost.  
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires.
S. Taxation
Current tax is the tax payable based on taxable profit for the year, 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially 
enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary 
differences and provided on the difference between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, 
deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill 
nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability, unless the 
related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to 
be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to 
apply to their respective period of realisation, provided the expected 
tax rates are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date and charged or credited to the income statement or statement 
of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
T. Equity
The balances classified as share capital and share premium 
represent the proceeds of the nominal value and premium value 
respectively on the issue of the Company’s equity share capital net 
of issue costs (see page 46).
The merger reserve is an undistributable reserve and represents the 
premium not recognised on the issues of shares pursuant to s131 
of the Companies Act 1985 on acquisition of subsidiary companies. 
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences 
arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment and 
income statement of foreign subsidiaries. Shares in the Company 
held by the ESOT are reported in the other reserves.

2. Segment information
Operating segments
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions based on the type of products and services supplied by 
each business unit. The operating divisions are, Software, Building Products and Precast Concrete. IFRS 8 requires operating segments 
to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision 
maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows:
Software: Developer and supplier of resource management software, building project software, design and engineering software and 3D 
design software.
Building Products: Manufacturer and supplier of a range of building products including, metal roofing, cladding systems, acoustic flooring 
and floor joist webs.
Precast Concrete: Manufacturer and supplier of precast concrete rooms, retaining walls, terracing units and prestressed and precast 
retaining structures.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as described in the Group’s significant accounting policies. Segment 
revenue represents revenue from external customers arising from the sale of goods and services, plus inter-segment revenue. Inter-segment 
transactions are priced on an arm’s length basis. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as 
well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Eleco plc

are of the view that this presentation of information enables the users of the financial statements to understand the financial effects of these 
operations no longer being part of the Group.
The assets of the Hoveringham factory have been presented as assets of disposal group held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. In 
the cash flow statement, the cash flows of the businesses that were sold and major activities that have ceased during the period have been 
aggregated with those of continuing operations, but are shown separately in the note below.
The information presented in this note is presented at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell as prescribed in IFRS 5. As a result of 
this treatment an impairment charge of £290,000 relating to leasehold improvements and plant and equipment has been recognised in the

The Group considers each of the operating businesses listed above, which are those units for which a separate cash flow is computed, 
to be a cash generating unit (‘CGU’) and each CGU is reviewed annually for impairment. For each CGU the Group has determined its 
recoverable amount based on value in use calculations.
The value in use was derived from discounted management cash flow forecasts for the businesses, using the budgets and strategic plans 
based on past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU incorporating an appropriate business risk. The key 
assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices 
and direct costs during the period based on industry sector forecasts.
These budgets and strategic plans cover a three year period. The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond this period is 
2.25% which is in line with the medium term GDP forecasts. In addition, a business risk factor is applied to these cash flows dependent 
on the perceived business risk of the CGU. Sensitivity analysis is carried out on all budgets and strategic plans used in the calculations. 
The discount rates used for all CGU’s is 10.20% (2010: 8.48% for years one and two and 10.20% from year three onwards) based on the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The value in use calculations did not identify any impairment compared to the CGU asset carrying value. Eleco plc

23. Deferred tax continued
Deferred tax on temporary differences has been calculated at the rate of 26.0% (2010: 28.0%) In addition to the changes in UK corporation 
tax disclosed, a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 UK budget statement.  
A reduction from 26.0% to 25.0% from 1 April 2012 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011. A further reduction of 1% per annum 
to 23% by 1 April 2014 has been proposed. These further changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, 
therefore, are not included in these financial statements.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as non-current in the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax unprovided in respect of 
investments in subsidiaries is £4,131,000 (2010: £2,162,000) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses 
may be offset. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
24. Retirement benefit obligations
Eleco plc operates one defined benefit scheme in the UK, the Eleco Retirement and Benefits Scheme (“ERBS”). The ERBS provides 
benefits on two scales based on final pensionable pay. The assets of the ERBS are held in a separate trustee administered fund and 
contributions into the ERBS are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The valuation used for disclosures has been based on the most recent full actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2008 updated at 31 December 
2011 by an independent qualified actuary under an appropriate method given the ERBS is closed to new members. Company contributions 
totalled £1,205,000 (2010: £845,000) and the scheme closed to future accrual on 31 December 2010. The estimated amount of 
contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during 2012 is £803,000.
Consultec Group AB and subsidiaries contribute to a defined benefits scheme under the ITP pension arrangement operated by Alecta, a 
Swedish insurance company. Contributions to the scheme totalling £362,000 (2010: £181,000) were made during the period. This is a multi-
employer scheme and accordingly the Group is unable to identify its share of the surplus in the scheme on a reasonable and consistent 
basis. Consequently, the scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions are paid into the fund operated by Alecta pension insurance in respect of each employee at rates defined by Alecta each 
year, having taken account of the solvency margin of the scheme. The solvency margin, which Alecta is required to maintain below 155%,
represents the extent to which the market value of the assets of the fund, calculated by Alecta, exceeds its pension commitments.  
At 31 December 2011, the fund had a solvency margin of 126.0% (2010: 152.0%).
The principal assumptions used by the actuary for the ERBS were (in nominal terms):

27. Acquisitions
On 1 September 2010 the Group acquired the business and certain assets of Lubekonsult AB, which provides cost estimation services 
and software to the Swedish ventilation market, for a total consideration of £384,000. Consideration in the period comprised the payment 
of £274,000 in cash and was satisfied from the Group’s existing resources. Deferred consideration of £110,000 at 31 December 2011 is 
payable in September 2012 and dependent on the achievement of certain financial measures.

In the period since acquisition, Lubekonsult AB contributed £231,000 to the Group’s operating profit. It utilised £22,000 for purchase of 
property, plant and equipment and £3,000 for financing activities.
Included in the £371,000 of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually, separately and reliably 
measured from the acquiree due to their nature. These items include the value of the management and workforce together with synergies 
that are expected to be gained from being part of the Group.
On 25 August 2011 the Group acquired the business of Nilsson & Sahlin Arkitekter AB, which provides architectural services, for a total 
consideration of £187 ,000. The consideration comprised the payment of £42,000 in cash satisfied from the Group’s existing resources 
and deferred consideration of £145,000. Deferred consideration of £145,000 at 31 December 2011 is payable over a four year period from 
acquisition and is dependent on the achievement of certain financial measures. Eleco plc

measured from the acquiree due to their nature. These items include the value of the management and workforce together with synergies 
that are expected to be gained from being part of the Group.
If the acquisitions above had been completed at the beginning of the reporting period, turnover from continuing operations would have been 
£57 .5m, £684,000 higher, and loss from continuing operations would have been £94,000 lower, at £128,000.

d) Market risk: objectives, policies and strategies
The Group’s interest rate risks, liquidity risks and currency risks are managed centrally within policies approved by the Board.
Interest rate risks are moderated by the use of a mixture of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The net interest receivable for the period, 
before interest on pension scheme assets and liabilities, was £63,000 compared to £41,000 receivable last year. No speculative 
transactions are undertaken.
At present there is no policy to hedge the Group’s currency exposures arising from the profit translation or the effect of exchange rate 
movements on the Group’s overseas net assets.
e) Market risk: sensitivities
A sensitivity analysis for financial assets and liabilities affected by market risk is set out below. Each risk is analysed separately and shows 
the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities when a certain parameter is changed. The sensitivity analysis has been performed on period 
end balances each year and therefore is not representative of transactions throughout the year. The rates used are based on historical 
trends and, where relevant, projected forecasts.
(i) Currencies
The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to the value of its financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other 
than Sterling (see note 28c above), arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. The table below shows the impact on the value of the 
Group’s reported net financial assets at 31 December of exchange rates either strengthening or weakening by 10% against Sterling and 
the impact this would have on the reported profit or loss and equity. The Group’s reported equity would be £321,000 lower  
if Sterling strengthened by 10% and £573,000 higher if Sterling weakened by 10%.

(ii) Interest rates
Changes in market interest rates expose the Group to the risk of fluctuations in the cash flow relating to its financial assets and liabilities 
some of which attract interest at floating rates (see note 28b above). Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and 
liabilities as at 31 December, the table below shows the impact of a one percentage point change in the market interest rates on the Group’s 
profit and equity.

g) Credit risk
Group policies are aimed at minimising losses due to customer payment default. Deferred payment terms are only granted to those 
customers who satisfy creditworthiness criteria and individual exposures to customers are monitored. Credit insurance is purchased for 
businesses in the Precast Concrete and Building Products divisions where cost is not excessive to the exposure being covered.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for uninsured trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region is as follows:

h) Capital risk
The Group’s objective is to minimise its cost of capital by optimising the efficiency of its capital structure, being the balance between equity 
and debt. The objective is subject always to an overriding principle that capital must be managed to ensure the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group uses a range of financial 
metrics to monitor the efficiency of its capital structure, including its weighted average cost of capital and net debt to EBITDA and ensures 
that its capital structure provides sufficient financial strength to allow it to secure access to debt finance at reasonable cost.
At 31 December 2011, the Group’s EBITDA for the period was £2,212,000 (2010: loss £1,817 ,000) and net bank borrowings were 
£4,077 ,000 (2010: £1,891,000).
i) Hedging instruments
There were no hedging instruments outstanding at 31 December 2011 (2010: nil). Eleco plc 
Report & Accounts 
2010/11 53
29. Contingent liabilities
The Group routinely enters into a range of contractual arrangements in the ordinary course of events which can give rise to claims or 
potential litigation against Group companies. It is the Group’s policy to make specific provisions at the balance sheet date for all liabilities 
which, in the opinion of the Directors represent a present obligation and outflow of resources to be probable at the balance sheet date. The 
Directors have reviewed the open claims and pending litigation against the Group at the 31 December 2011 and concluded that no material 
unprovided loss is likely to accrue from any such unprovided claims.
30. Related party transactions
Transactions between Group undertakings, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
With the exception of M L Turner, the Directors of the Company had no material transactions with the Company during the year, other than a 
result of service agreements. An amount of £123,000 (2010: £nil) was paid to Shoremountain Ltd of which M L Turner is a Director. This was 
paid under the terms of a consultancy arrangement by the Group.
An amount of £37 ,500 (2010: £25,000) was paid to J H B Ketteley &Co Limited under a lease for occupation by the Group of 66 Clifton 
Street, London, EC2A 4HB.
31. Post balance sheet events
On 3 February 2012 the Group sold its precast concrete factory at Hoveringham, Nottinghamshire. The consideration received was 
£440,000, of which £290,000 was paid on completion and a deferred element of £150,000 is payable in equal instalments over a period of 
30 months commencing one month after completion.
On 14 March 2012, the Group acquired Novator Projektstyrning AB, of Sweden, enhancing its range of product planning software for a total 
consideration of £84,000 settled by cash from the Group’s existing resources. Eleco plc

The financial statements have been prepared under UK GAAP .  
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies, 
which have been applied consistently, is set out below:
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the 
historical cost convention.
Intangible and tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at their purchase cost, together with 
any incidental costs of acquisition, net of depreciation and provision 
for impairment.
The Company owns intellectual property both in its software tools 
and software products. Intellectual property acquired is capitalised 
at cost and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its expected 
useful life not exceeding 20 years. The current intellectual property 
assets held by the Company were attributed a useful life of five years 
and this amortisation period has been used in the accounts.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, except freehold 
and leasehold land, at annual rates calculated to write off the cost, 
less the estimated residual value of each asset, over its expected 
useful life as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Plant, equipment and vehicles 2 to 10 years
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost, together with any 
incidental costs of acquisition, less any provision for impairment.
Finance and operating leases
The capital element of finance lease commitments is shown as 
obligations under finance leases. The capital element of finance 
lease rentals is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations under 
finance leases. The interest element of the rental obligations is 
charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease 
in proportion to the reducing capital balance outstanding. Amounts 
payable under operating leases are recognised in the profit and loss 
account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at that date at which they are granted 
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which 
ends on the date on which the relevant employee is unconditionally 
entitled to the award. The fair value of the employees services is 
determined by reference to the fair value of instruments granted 
using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, account is taken of the probabilities of performance 
achievement and other conditions linked to the price of the shares 
of the Company (market conditions).
Statement of Company 
Accounting Policies
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense 
is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or 
otherwise of non-market conditions. The movement in cumulative 
expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the 
income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Shares, the subject of share awards granted under the long-term 
incentive plan, may be allotted to the employee share ownership 
trust at any time from the date of grant. The shares held by the 
trust do not qualify for dividends and are deducted from equity 
attributable to shareholders of the parent through other reserves.
Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that 
date. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates 
subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an 
exchange gain/loss in the profit and loss account.
Taxation
Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to 
be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences 
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events have occurred at the date will result 
in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less or to receive 
more tax, with the following exceptions:
•	 provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance 
of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings 
only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have 
been accrued as receivable; and
•	 deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the 
Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will 
be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.  Eleco plc

The operating loss from total Building Systems operations during the period triggered a review of the Company loans and investments in 
these subsidiaries. Value in use calculations were performed on the cash flow projections of these business. These cash flow projections 
were based on the business unit budgets and strategic plans discounted by the Group’s WACC outlined on page 37 . The calculations 
identified a shortfall in the value in use of some of the loans and investments compared to their carrying amount which resulted in a 
provision for impairment for the period of £6,218,000.  Eleco plc

Notice of Meeting
NOTICE is hereby given that the seventy-second Annual General 
Meeting of Eleco plc (the “Company”) will be held at the Brewers’ 
Hall, Aldermanbury Square, London EC2V 7HR on 29 May 2012 
at 12.00 noon for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, 
passing the following resolutions. Resolutions numbered 1 to 5 will 
be proposed as Ordinary Resolutions and Resolutions numbered 6 
and 7 will be proposed as Special Resolutions.
Ordinary business
1. To receive the financial statements for the 18 month period

Directors and Auditors.
2. To re-elect M B McCullen, who retires by rotation, as a Director 
of the Company.

of Association, as a Director of the Company.
4. To re-appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as Auditors of the

Special business
5. Authority to allot shares
 That the Directors be generally and unconditionally authorised 
in accordance with section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
“Act”) to allot:
 (a)  shares in the Company or grant rights to subscribe for or to 
convert any security into shares in the Company up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £2,021,941; and in addition
 (b)  equity securities of the Company (within the meaning of 
section 560 of the Act) in connection with an offer of such 
securities by way of a rights issue (as defined below) up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £2,021,941,
 provided that this authority shall expire on the conclusion of the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company but so that the 
Company may, before such expiry, make an offer or agreement 
which would or might require shares to be allotted or rights to 
subscribe for or convert securities into shares to be granted after 
such expiry and the Directors may allot shares or grant rights to 
subscribe for or convert securities into shares pursuant to such 
an offer or agreement as if this authority had not expired.
 “Rights issue” means an offer of equity securities to holders of 
ordinary shares in the capital of the Company on the register on 
a record date fixed by the Directors in proportion as nearly as 
may be to the respective numbers of ordinary shares held by 
them, but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as 
the Directors may deem necessary or expedient to deal with any 
treasury shares, fractional entitlements or legal or practical issues 
arising under the laws of, or the requirements of any recognised 
regulatory body or any stock exchange in, any territory or any 
other matter.
6.  Disapplication of pre-emption rights
 That subject to and conditional on the passing of Resolution 
5, the Directors be empowered, pursuant to section 570 of 
the Act, to allot equity securities (within the meaning of section 
560 of the Act) for cash pursuant to the authority conferred by 
Resolution 5 and as if section 561(1) of the Act did not apply to 
any such allotment, provided that this power shall be limited to 
the allotment of equity securities:
 (a)  in connection with an offer of such securities by way of a 
rights issue (as defined above); and
 (b)  otherwise than pursuant to paragraph 6(a) above up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £303,291, and shall expire at 
the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the 
Company, save that the Company may, before such expiry, 
make an offer or agreement which would or might require 
equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the 
Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any 
such offer or agreement as if this power had not expired.
 This power applies in relation to a sale of treasury shares as 
if all references in this resolution to an allotment included any 
such sale and in the first paragraph of this resolution the words 
“pursuant to the authority conferred by Resolutions” were 
omitted in relation to such sale.
7. Purchase of the Company’s own shares
 That subject to and in accordance with the Company’s articles 
of association, the Company be and is hereby generally and 
unconditionally authorised for the purposes of Section 701 
of the Act to make market purchases (within the meaning of 
Section 693(4) of the Act) of equity securities of the Company 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £606,582 at a price per 
share (exclusive of expenses) of not less than 10 pence and not 
more than 105% of the average of the middle market quotations 
for such equity securities as derived from the London Stock 
Exchange Daily Official List for the five dealing days immediately 
preceding the date on which the equity securities are contracted 
to be purchased, provided that this authority shall expire at the 
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting provided that the 
Company may purchase, before such expiry, make a contract 
to purchase its own shares which would or might be executed 
wholly or partly after such expiry, and the Company may make 
a purchase of its own shares in pursuance of such contract as if 
the authority hereby conferred had not expired.

NOTES:
1. A member entitled to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)  
may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be members of the Company) 
to exercise these rights instead of him. A proxy form is enclosed. A member may 
appoint more than one proxy, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise 
the rights attached to different shares. To be effective, an instrument appointing a 
proxy must be returned so as to reach the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, 
PO Box 25, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4BR no later than 12 noon on 25 May 2012. The 
appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending and/or voting at 
the meeting should he subsequently decide to do so.
2.  Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 
146 Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, 
under an agreement between him or her and the member by whom he or she was 
nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a 
proxy for the AGM. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or 
does not wish to exercise it, he or she may, under any such agreement, have a right 
to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights.
 The statement of rights of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in  
Note 1 above does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described in that 
note can only be exercised by members of the Company.
3.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate 
representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member 
provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
4.  Copies of contracts of service and letters of appointment between the Directors 
and the Company will be available for inspection at the Registered Office of the 
Company during normal business hours until the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting, and at the place of the meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to the Annual 
General Meeting until its conclusion. Eleco plc

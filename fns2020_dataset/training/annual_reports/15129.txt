4569 SurfControl COVER  9/23/04  1:03 PM  Page 2 SurfControl plc Chairman’s statement 01.
Invoicing for the year reached $106.6m,
turnover grew 19% to $87.3m, this
resulted in pre-tax profit of $14.4m 
and at the year end a cash balance of
$87.5m. The last five years have seen a
tremendous level of commitment and
drive from all our employees led in an
exemplary fashion by the executive
management. At the end of this fiscal
year the Group had 522 employees,
and I take this opportunity to thank
every one of them for all that they have
achieved for SurfControl. During my first
year as your Chairman I have had the
chance to meet our teams in the UK,
USA, Europe and in Australia, and I 
have found them facing the future with
confidence and determination. Our
results also reflect the strong and loyal
support of our business partners, and
I thank them for it. Most of all I thank
our customers for choosing our web,
e-mail and instant messaging products
and services.
The vision set out by Rob Barrow and
Steve Purdham some six years ago has
borne great fruit and today we can fairly
claim to be a world class software
company. The Group’s success has
been built upon the enthusiasm and
dedication shown by all the people at
SurfControl. It is their skill and expertise
which has allowed us to compete on
the world stage.
Any more than a few moments spent
on self congratulation would be foolish,
the world is not static – and in a
growing market such as ours the
competition only ever gets stronger.
During this past year we have put in
place a future strategy based on our
core capabilities and upon a thorough
analysis of our chosen markets and our
competition. We have created a platform
for future growth. You will see details of
our future roadmap in Steve’s Chief
Executive Strategic Review but already
we have made significant moves in
technology, geography and markets
with the acquisition of a Linux-based
filtering appliance and the establishment
of a sales and distribution operation in
the People’s Republic of China.
Your Board has changed in composition
to reflect our size and ambition. Rob
Barrow decided a year ago that the
time was right for him to step down as
Chairman. We thank and applaud Rob
for his tremendous contribution to our
company over many years. Two new
Non-Executive Directors have joined 
us: Jane Tozer and Rene Schuster,
strengthening our corporate governance
expertise and adding further breadth to
our international software and services
industry knowledge. We are now a
significant company and your Board
has also spent considerable time and
effort on ensuring we have appropriate
governance procedures in place.
Throughout this report you will see
examples of where we added new
and enhanced information about the
Group’s corporate governance position
and the requirements of the Revised
Combined Code.
I thank you, our shareholders, for your
confidence in our future and I hope
you find this report informative and
encouraging. I look forward to the
opportunity of personally meeting
with you, our shareholders, in the
coming year.
Greg Lock
Chairman of the Board
6 September 2004
In this, my first report to shareholders as the Chairman
of SurfControl, it gives me pleasure to report on a year
of strong results and continued growth.
Today we can fairly claim to be a
world class software company 
FACT: 30-40% OF INTERNET USE
IN THE WORKPLACE IS NOT
RELATED TO BUSINESS
(SOURCE: IDC, AUGUST 2004)
Greg Lock, Chairman SurfControl plc Chief Executive’s strategic review 02.
This, together with the desire to
produce the best technology available
on the market at that time, gave us the
ability to capture mindshare and market
share, to become leaders in our field
and create a growing, cash generative,
profitable business
By 2000, the adoption of the Internet as
the main business communication tool
highlighted that the need to ‘Stop
Unwanted Content’ was about to go
beyond the boundaries of Web Filtering.
This gained further momentum as the
issues of content became universal
across Internet delivery mechanisms
such as E-mail and then Instant
messaging. Furthermore, the content
challenges subtly widened to include
pornography, sport, entertainment,
gambling and eventually the scourge
of SPAM. This led to the evolution and
strengthening of our software family to
include the SurfControl e-mail filter in
2001 followed closely by our Instant
Message Filter.
But it wasn’t just technology that was
driving change; increased use of 
the Internet beyond the US was also 
a key point of flux, and accordingly 
we expanded our reach into other
geographical regions giving us the
global presence that we have today.
Since conception we have experienced
a full range of emotions: excitement,
frustration, fear, and pride as we have
achieved all the objectives that we set
ourselves. At the beginning many long
term goals were ‘set in stone’ to drive
our vision and actions. The most
important ones were building a
business which had sustainable
growth, was both profitable and cash
generative, and in particular generated
$100m of annual sales. 
With our increasing geographical
reach and continued technological
advancement to further increase
revenues, cash generation and profits,
it is with great pride that we can
announce that we have achieved all of
our original goals, mostly ahead of the
original plan produced back in 1997/8.
With invoicing for the year ending
30 June 2004 reaching over $106m,
turnover of $87.3m, cash of $87.5m
and pre-tax profits of $14.4m, over
520 people and 13 offices around
the world together with ‘best of breed’
products, our 2003/4 year has been
another record year.
Building on
our success.
In 1998, when we launched our first web filtering
software we recognised that the market was due to
change from ‘protecting children from Pornography’ 
into ‘Protecting businesses from Unwanted Content’ 
that would affect Productivity, Resources, Legal Liability
and Security. This ‘change’ in mindset from Porn
Blockers to Rich Content Web Filters was the driving
force in our adoption by corporations across the globe.

So after taking a few moments to reflect
and enjoy SurfControl’s significant
achievements we must now focus all
our attention on the future.
We have succeeded. We aim to
continue: winning tomorrow and
beyond is the focus.
In the last 12 months SurfControl has
looked further into the future and defined
the direction, objectives and technology
that we need to evolve. This work
culminated in the announcement in May
2004 of our T echnology Roadmap.
Our future continues with an aggressive
focus on our core strength of Content
Filtering. However the dynamics of our
market are changing at an accelerated
pace, presenting both a significantly
bigger opportunity and increased
challenges.
Our Roadmap has three key components
– technology, geography and market.
To fully appreciate our direction we
need to examine the dynamics of
change in our market.
Winning tomorrow and
beyond is the focus.

At SurfControl we are developing technologies that will enable us to offer a completely integrated
content filtering solution. Annual report + accounts 2004 05.
Charles Darwin stated that “It’s not the strongest of
the species that survives, nor the most intelligent.
It is the one that is the most adaptable to CHANGE. ”,
and SurfControl’s ability to adapt to change during
its early growth is one of the keys to its success.
This ability to adapt to change is also one of the key
strengths as we move towards our next exciting
level of growth and expansion.
we project. we deliver. SurfControl plc Chief Executive’s strategic review continued 06.
The use of e-mail and the web at work
has been the most important business
development in recent times. It has
brought with it fundamental risks and
challenges to the business community
such as legal liability, risks to productivity,
network capacity pressures, and
increased security threats. There was an
opportunity, the market demanded a
solution and we provided it. We provided
software that gave our customers the
power to choose the type of content
they received and the type of content
they sent. We provided it on a multitude
of platforms to fit within differing
technological environments. We enabled
companies to stop unwanted content. 
This market, which also includes anti-
virus solutions, has become known as
the Secure Content Market. In 2003,
it generated combined sales of $3.2
billion. In 2008, it is predicted to
generate $7 .2 billion (IDC) growing at a
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
of 17%. The Secure Content Market
contains three major segments: web
filtering, message security and anti-virus.
It has driven our success to date and
the opportunity is continuing to expand.
However, within this expansion in 
opportunity and market size the
challenges and competition are also
expanding. In particular they are
evolving in terms of technology 
delivery and geography.
At a technology level our focus to date
has been on high quality software
delivery, but as the market has evolved
so have the ways in which filtering is
delivered. Filtering software is run on a
company’s server within the corporate
network. However, in recent times we
have seen an emerging market trend
towards putting in place two other
filtering solutions, firstly, a hardware
solution with the installation of a task
specific filtering appliance, and secondly
a managed service solution, with
content filtering being provided as 
a service by a third party.
The Market Dynamics
– a great opportunity.
In 1996, when the decision was taken to target this
market, it hardly existed – but we knew then it would
be big. Eight years on, the true implications of internet
access in the work place are only just being realised.
> vision
> leadership
> innovation
> evolution
Lyndon B Johnson stated ‘Tomorrow is ours to win or lose’ .
We succeeded by never resting on our laurels. We have
succeeded by doing things better tomorrow that we did
well today. We have succeeded by both driving and
reacting to a dynamic and evolving market. We have
succeeded because every step we have taken has put us
in a position to take the next steps.

The Secure Content Market is set to show
consistent growth for years to come 
(Source: IDC, 2004) Annual report + accounts 2004 07.
The market opportunity for the Secure
Content Appliance is expected to exhibit
70% CAGR between now and 2007
and will be worth $1.6bn.
Beyond Appliances there is also the
emerging opportunity from Managed
Services which is set to show significant
growth in the future.
we listen. we respond.
This is particularly the case with regard
to the control of e-mail. Today, software
remains the most favoured e-mail
filtering tool accounting for 44% of
the market. However the appliance
approach now represents 28% as
does the managed service solution. 
The following factors have encouraged the
growth of demand for the security appliance:
> Reduced complexity. The all-in-one
approach simplifies product selection,
product integration and ongoing support.
> An alternative to software installation
with incremental servers. Customers or,
more often, value-added resellers (VARs),
value-added dealers (VADs), or managed
service providers (MSPs) can easily install
and maintain the products. Increasingly,
this process is handled remotely.
> Install and forget. The appliances are
generally “plug and play,” with very little
installation required. 
> Synergy with high-end software
solutions. Appliances are used in remote
sites at which an enterprise does not have
security professionals on the ground. A
plug-and-play appliance can be installed
and then managed remotely. This
management is synergistic with large,
centralized, software-based firewalls and
content security solutions. 
> Less end user interaction. The black box
approach limits the “damage” users can
do. This reduces support calls and
improves security
> Troubleshooting ease. When a box fails, it
is easier to swap it out than to troubleshoot.
The process gets the node back online more
quickly, and it can be done by a non-
technical person. This feature is especially
important for remote offices without
dedicated technical staff on site.

Of the three content filtering delivery
mechanisms, the appliance market is 
set to grow at the fastest rate 
(Source: IDC, 2003) SurfControl plc Chief Executive’s strategic review continued 08.
Software
Currently we provide web and e-mail
software and we will continue to offer
this solution to new customers and our
global customer base alike. During the
year, we announced several upgrades
and enhancements to our software
solution, and added functionality and
performance. These included the launch
of SurfControl Web filter for Cisco CE
and Blue Coat platforms and upgrades
to our Web Filtering software for
Microsoft Windows, Proxy server and
ISA server, Check Point Firewall 1, Linux
and Nokia IPSO offerings. For many
organisations, software remains the
solution of choice and our software is
consistently viewed by the market as
being the best of breed in its class.
Appliance
This year will mark the launch of the
SurfControl filtering appliance and is
the result of a year of planning and
assessment of the market. SurfControl
examined several ways in which to
address the market and concluded that
the acquisition of an existing appliance
vendor would be the best way forward.
Accordingly, on 19 April 2004, we
announced the acquisition of the
principle assets of SecureM, a provider
of e-mail appliance technology. By
combining our core filtering expertise
with SecureM’s specific Linux based
appliance technology we will launch an
e-mail filtering appliance in the second
half of calendar year 2004 that is
superior to existing competitive offerings. 
This is a major new advance in the
development of SurfControl. But of
course, this is just the beginning and
as part of our technology roadmap
we will build our web filtering into
new generations of SurfControl
fully integrated appliances, offering
both web and e-mail filtering.
Managed Services
In conjunction with the development
of our appliance offering, we are
designing a managed service offering
enabling the remote filtering of e-mail
and web content. This is a natural step
for SurfControl. In fact, we have already
built up a working knowledge of this
area with the provision of our Content
Portal Authority solution for OEMs. This
technology enables ISPs to provide a
centrally managed content filtering
service based on our own core
technology. The managed services
approach completely removes the
delivery of content filtering from within
the corporate network and is becoming
increasingly popular. By providing a
managed service, we will provide
customers with a third option for
content filtering.
Technology – our
three year roadmap 
to success.
Going forward we are going to build upon our software
heritage and our core focus of Rich Content Filtering
and extend our offerings into Appliances and Managed
Services to provide customers with the ability to manage
content using one or a combination of methods that
best suit their needs.

embark on our next stage of development, we
will provide the market with the ultimate choice
– multiple delivery on multiple platforms

we understand. we go beyond. SurfControl plc Chief Executive’s strategic review continued 10.
This means that, in order to access
the larger market opportunity and to
provide a balanced risk for future
growth, it is important to invest in global
infrastructure and expansion. With that

Technology SurfControl plc Financial Director’s review 14.
General
The financial results for 2004 reflect
success at every level for the Group. Sales,
profits, and cash flow all exhibited strong
growth. As a direct consequence, the
Group’s balance sheet has benefited 
from higher cash balances and higher
levels of deferred income, in turn providing
a stronger platform for future investment
and growth.
The Group has strengthened its position
in the Enterprise market, and continued 
to achieve high rates of growth in its
business outside of the Americas – both
key success factors in securing future
increases in market share in the Secure
Content Market. 87% of the Group’s
business in 2004 was generated from
Corporate customers and 35% from
customers outside of the Americas.
This growth has allowed the Group to
make investments for the future. In 2004
the Group laid the foundation for the
launch of both appliance and managed
service versions of our filtering solutions 
all under the single global brand of
SurfControl. At the same time, the Group
has established offices in The People’s
Republic of China and in Paris, expanding
its presence in the non-Americas regions
to better serve the high market growth rates
in demand for Secure Content solutions. 
Acquisitions
In April 2004, the Group acquired Linux-
based e-mail filtering appliance technology
from SecureM, together with their China-
based sales and marketing operations.
The key terms and the accounting for the
acquisition are set out in note 9 on pages
54 and 55. The operational results relating
to the acquired assets were consolidated
from the effective date of the acquisition
but were not significant to the turnover,
costs, or net assets of the Group. Intangible
assets arising on consolidation will be
amortized over a 24 month period, starting
in the fourth quarter of the year under
review. The purchase consideration was
cash, and the impact on the Group’s
liquidity position is set the Group cash
flow statement on page 44.
Exchange rate fluctuations
The reporting currency of the Group is the
US dollar, reflecting the principal trading 
currency of the Group. In addition, Sterling,
the Euro, and the Australian dollar are also
trading currencies for the majority of the
trading areas outside of the Americas. It is
the Group’s policy to conduct and settle
the majority of trading transactions in the
relevant currency of the geographic region,
and therefore the Group’s profit and loss
account is not exposed to significant
realised exchange gains of losses arising
from day to day transactions. The Group is
however exposed to exchange differences
arising from the translation of the
underlying regional financial statements to
the Group’s reporting currency of the US
dollar. The Group’s sales and operations
over the last three years have expanded
significantly in non-US denominated
currency regions, and at the same time the
US dollar has experienced an increased
level of volatility against other major trading
currencies. The combination of these two
factors has increased the Group’s exposure
to such translation differences. The recent
weakness in the US dollar, through
translation differences, has had a number
of impacts on our financial statements in
2004. In the profit and loss statement,
both the Group’s non-US dollar
denominated revenues and costs have
increased, resulting in an immaterial net
effect on reported profitability. In the
balance sheet, all non-US dollar
denominated asset and liability balances
have increased. The principal accounts
affected in 2004 were the Group’s 
cash holdings and deferred income. 
Finance Director’s
review
The financial results for 2004 reflect success 
at every level for the Group. 
In 2004 the Group laid the
foundation for the launch of
both appliance and managed
service versions of our filtering
solutions all under the single
global brand of SurfControl. Turnover
Group turnover increased by 19% to
$87.34m (2003: $73.23m) (2002:
$54.17m). All turnover in the financial
year was organic other than a minor
contribution in the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year from the China operations
acquired from SecureM. Details of trading
from the acquisition are provided in Note 3
on page 50. All Group turnover arose
from sales of the Group’s Internet filtering
product set: being Web filtering, e-mail
filtering, and instant messaging filtering.
The rate of growth in Group turnover in
2004 was less than in previous years
primarily because of the slower new
business growth rates in the Americas, and
challenging market conditions in the US
Education market. Growth rates across all
areas of our business outside the Americas
have been very strong in 2004.
Invoicing, and to a lesser degree turnover,
continued to exhibit patterns of seasonality
within the year, with Q2 and Q4 typically
producing stronger sequential rates of
growth than Q1 and Q3. The Corporate
market is the key target market of the
Group and its turnover grew by 23% 
to $75.59 (2003: $61.66m) (2002:
$44.18m). This market includes the
licensing of technology via software
developer kits (“SDKs”) to Original
Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). OEM
turnover was $4.04m (2003: $4.01m)
(2002: $3.19m). OEM turnover growth
has slowed in 2004 as the Group has
moved from an annual fee in advance 
to a royalty arrangement.
The Education market exhibits its own
seasonality due to the timing of the school
year. Compared to the prior year, Education
market turnover fell slightly to $10.58m
(2003: $10.83m) (2002: $9.06m) due 
to the difficult budgetary environment
experienced by the majority of US state
schools over the last two years.
Home turnover comprises sales of the
CyberPatrol Web filter product into the
home market. Compared to the prior 
year, Home market turnover has
increased 57%, to $1.17m (2003:
$0.74m) (2002: $0.93m) reversing 
the prior year decline of 20%.
The chart below shows the Group’s
turnover profile by customer segment 
for the last three years.
The chart below shows the percentage of
turnover by destination for the Americas
and Non-Americas geographic areas for
the last three years. The Americas remains
the Group’s principal market and generated
$57.40m or 66% of the overall Group
turnover of $87.34m. However, the
market outside of the Americas exhibited
a higher annual growth rate of 44%,
compared to 10% for the Americas. This
reflects both our investment in sales and
marketing in the various regions around
the world, as well as the emerging and
rapid rate of adoption by corporations of
content filtering in these regions. 
Invoicing and deferred income
The Group invoiced $106.63m in the
year, a 16% increase on invoicing of
$92.10m for the financial year 2003
(2002: $65.19m).

FACT: 39% OF WORKERS HAVE

INFORMATION VIA E-MAIL THAT
WAS NOT INTENDED FOR THEM
(SOURCE: SURFCONTROL, SEPTEMBER 2004) SurfControl plc Financial Director’s review continued 16.
A proportion of the Group’s invoicing is not
immediately recognised as turnover, and
is instead deferred over the period of the
contract to which it relates. Such deferred
income typically relates to content list
subscriptions and maintenance contracts.
Full details of the Group’s accounting
policies, including those relating to turnover
and deferred income, are given in Note 1
to the financial statements. As at 30 June
2004, deferred income increased by 38%
to $75.02m (2003: $54.25m) (2002:
$33.9m). Of the carrying balance
$49.04m, or 65%, (2003: $37.54, or
69%) (2002: $26.85m, or 79%) is due
to be released to turnover over the year 
to 30 June 2005. 
The volume and proportion of the Group’s
business generated via its indirect channel
partners continued to increase in the year.
The Company views this progress as a 
key success factor in achieving scaleable
and profitable growth. The chart below
shows the Group’s invoicing profile by
channel segment for each of the financial
years under review.
Selling and distribution costs
The Group’s main area of expenditure is
that of selling and distribution. Costs in
this section of the business amounted 
to $44.03m (2003: $39.74m) (2002:
$32.85m). As a percentage of turnover,
these costs declined to 50.4% (2003:
54.3%) (2002: 60.7%). The relative cost
decline is a result of improving economies
of scale, as well as effective management
of expenditure. Examples of the economies
of scale include utilisation of common
global marketing messages for all of the
Group’s products, the use of existing 
sales skills and sales channels to sell
incremental products, and increasing
market recognition of the SurfControl
brand. It is management’s intention to
continue to seek economies of scale
combined with effective management of
expenditure in the selling and distribution
cost category. The main areas of increased
spend compared to prior years have 
been sales commissions (reflecting the 
16% increase in invoicing), marketing
communication activities, and salary and
benefit related costs associated with an
expanded workforce. Headcount has
increased by 19% to 309 at 30 June
2004 (2003: 259) (2002: 231).
Research and development
Research and development expenditure
was $9.68m (2003: $7.53m) (2002:
$6.36m). As a percentage of turnover
these costs increased to 11.1% (2003:
10.3%) (2002: 11.7%). While cost
efficiencies continue to be achieved
through location of staff in lower-cost
employment areas within the Group, and
outsourcing of certain non-core activities,
R&D investment has been increased and
targeted at key growth areas such as
appliances, Linux, and next generation
products. Headcount increased by 20%
to 136 employees at 30 June 2004
(2003:113) (2002:101). The associated
increases in salary and benefit costs is
the principal area of increased spend
compared to prior years.
Other administrative expenditure 
and amortisation of intangible assets
Other administrative expenses were
$16.81m (2003: $14.58m) (2002:
$12.87m). As a percentage of turnover
these costs declined to 19.3% (2003:
19.9%) (2002: 23.8%). The Group
continues to concentrate on effective
cost management and the attainment of
economies of scale from this function, 
in order to offset the necessary increases
in infrastructure to support a global
organisation with a growing portfolio of
products. Headcount increased 8% to 77
(2003: 71) (2002: 73). The main areas
of increased spend compared to prior
years have been outside services including
IT services, legal, tax and other professional
advice, together with office related costs,
and increased salary and benefits
associated with the increased headcount.
The acquisition of  the e-mail filtering
appliance technology from SecureM 
together with their Chinese based
subsidiary in April 2004 gave rise to an
amortization charge of $1.35m in the
fourth quarter of the year. The unamortized
balance of these intangible assets as at
June 30, 2004 was $12.55m. The
historical acquisitions completed prior to
2004 gave rise to a goodwill amortisation
charge in 2003 of $1.15m (2002:
$70.3m). All such goodwill has now 
been fully amortised.

(SOURCE: IDC, AUGUST 2004) Share option tax provision
The share option tax provision relates to
the potential employer tax liability that
may crystallise on the exercise of all
outstanding options held by Directors and
employees at 30 June 2004, based on
the then closing middle market share
price of £6.10 (2003: £6.375) (2002:
£3.975). The balance sheet provision 
of $0.45m (2003: $0.54m) (2002:
$0.07m) declined slightly over the year, 
in line with the slight reduction in the
Company’s share price. 
Proceeds from disposal of business
The Group sold its MultiView business
unit in February 2001 and has received
deferred payment of sale proceeds on 
a retrospective quarterly basis since that
date. Net proceeds recognised in the
profit and loss account were $0.31m in
2004 (2003: $0.38m) (2002: $0.25m).
In line with the terms of the transaction,
no further sale proceeds will be received
after the 2003/4 financial year.
Profit before taxation
The achievement of a profit before taxation
for the first time in 2003 was an important
milestone for the Group. In 2004 this
position was consolidated, and pre-tax
profit increased by 62% to $14.40m
(2003: $8.88m) (2002: loss of $69.39m). 
Taxation
A net tax charge of $2.86m was recorded
for the year (2002: $2.52m) (2002:
credit of $0.98m), and represents an
effective rate of 20% of pre-tax profits.
Note 8 to the financial statements on
page 53 gives details of matters affecting
the current tax charge, and how it
reconciles to the charge predicted by
applying the UK standard corporation tax
rate to the Group profit on ordinary
activities before taxation.
A deferred tax asset of $6.68m (2003:
$4.18m) (2002: $0.81m) has been
recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The increase in the value of the deferred
tax asset in 2004 primarily reflects the
extent of US tax losses which are expected
to be utilised in the next 18 months.
In accordance with the tax authority
requirements around the world and OECD
guidelines, the Group implements arm’s-
length transfer pricing methodologies
to reflect the domicile of its intellectual
property and the various functions
performed within the Group. The Group
expects to pay corporation tax in the UK
and Australia, and certain US state taxes,
in 2005.
Liquidity, capital resources and
treasury management
The Group has been cash positive at the
operational level throughout the year
under review. This has been achieved by 
a combination of rises in invoicing and
pre-tax profitability, combined with steady
working capital management. The move
to becoming self-financing during 2002
has been strongly maintained with net
cash inflow from operating activities at
$32.64m (2003: $24.09m) (2002:
$11.69m). Net cash inflow from returns
on investments and servicing of finance
was $1.79m (2003: $0.74m) (2002:
$0.63m). The net inflow from returns on
investments in all years came primarily
from bank interest amounting to $1.81m
(2003: $0.78m) (2002: $0.66m). The
Group funded the purchase of all tangible
fixed assets in the year from its own cash
resources, and as in previous years has
minimal finance lease commitments. 
The scale of cash outflow from capital
expenditure is increasing in line with the
size of the Group and was $2.27m
(2003: $1.63m) (2002: $1.06m). 
Net cash inflow from financing was $2.87m
(2003: $1.23m) (2002: $0.38m)
principally in relation to $3.75m of proceeds
from exercise of share options (2003:
$1.27m) (2002: $0.52m). This was
partially offset by a cash outlay of $0.84m
(2003 and 2002: $nil) for the purchase of
own shares. Further such cash outlays of
$0.27m occurred after the year end in July
2004, due to settlement timing differences
on share purchases in June 2004.
At 30 June 2004 the Group had total
cash holdings of $87.48m (2003:
$61.71m) (2002: $35.45m) earning a
current weighted average rate of return on
closing cash of 2.25% p.a (2003: 2.35%)
(2002: 2.71%). Net interest receivable
and similar items, primarily bank interest,
was $1.86m (2003: $1.11m) (2002:
$0.65m). The increase in net interest
receivable directly reflects the Group’s
growing cash balances driven by strong
operational cash flow. 
Annual report + accounts 2004 17.
The move to becoming self-
financing during 2002 has been
strongly maintained with net
cash inflow from operating
activities at $32.64m SurfControl plc Financial Director’s review continued 18.
The Group will continue to apply its
cash resource to fund its working capital
requirement, capital expenditure, tax
obligations, corporate investment
acquisition opportunities, and purchases
of own shares. 
Employee share option schemes
Full details of the Group’s employee share
option schemes can be found on pages
61 to 63. The potential employer tax
liability that may crystallise on the future
exercise of options is estimated and
charged to the profit and loss account
over the vesting period of the option grant. 
The potential dilution of equity from granted
options varies to the extent that they are
“in-the-money” or “underwater”. As at
June 30 2004, there were 1,090,815
options with an exercise price below
£6.10, which was the closing middle
market price on that day. These options
represented 3.5% of the issued share
capital as at June 30, 2004. In addition
there are a further 2,390,679 outstanding
options with a grant price above £6.10
which will further dilute equity if the 
share price rises.
In addition to share options, employees
participated in a variety of incentive
compensation schemes in the year, the
total value of which is disclosed in note 5
on page 51.
Transition to International 
Accounting Standards
The Group is preparing to fully adopt
International Accounting Standards (“IAS”)
which have an effective date for accounting
periods beginning on or after January 1,
2005. The first annual IAS financial
statements for the Group will be prepared
for the year ending June 30, 2006, with
comparatives for fiscal years 2004 and
2005 thereby maintaining the Group’s
current voluntary practice of providing a
three year financial profile. Quarterly
comparative re-stated financial statements
will also be prepared for fiscal year 2005
to maintain our current quarterly reporting
profile for investors and analysts. The
Board considers that it is on schedule 
to adopt IAS in the prescribed time.
Having reviewed all relevant accounting
standards, the potential areas of impact
arising from IAS on the Group’s financial
statements will be accounting for Share-
Based Compensation (IFRS 2), Business
combinations and Goodwill (IFRS 3) and
Intangible Assets (IAS 38). IFRS 2 applies
to share-based payments including
options granted on or after 7th November
2002 which have not fully vested on
January 1, 2005. Since November 2002
the Group has issued 726,000 options,
and therefore the majority of total options
which have been granted by the Company
pre-date 7th November 2002 and will not
contribute to the charge to the profit and
loss account. The resultant charge to the
Group profit and loss account for the fair
value of options when IAS is adopted is
not expected to be significant.
IFRS 3 applies to all combinations arising
on or after March 2004 and therefore the
Group’s recent acquisition of assets from
SecureM will fall under the new standard.
The restatement of the accounting for this
acquisition is not expected to be
significant when IAS is adopted. 
The third area of potential impact is
accounting for research and development
expenditure under IAS 38. Like the
majority of software companies in the UK
and US, the Group currently expenses all
such costs as they are incurred as the
Board believes that it would not be a
prudent accounting policy to capitalise
such costs, given the short life and volatile
market conditions surrounding software
products. Under IAS, the Group may be
required to capitalise a portion of its
current development expenditure.
The presentation, terminology, and the
nature and extent of disclosure of the
Group’s financial statements will also
change under IAS.
This assessment is based upon the
Group’s current range of trading activities
and current publications from the
International Accounting Standards Board,
and therefore the actual impact of IAS on
the Group’s results may differ from that
outlined above. In anticipation of the
adoption of IAS in 2006, the Group will
include estimates of the financial impact
in its 2005 Annual Report.
The Board considers that it is 
on schedule to adopt IAS in 
the prescribed time.

(SOURCE: GARTNER, 2004) Summary
The financial results for 2004 reflect
success at every level for the Group. Solid
turnover growth of 19%, leveraged cost
efficiencies resulting in 65% growth in
operating profit, and a 81% increase in
net profit after taxation (79% increase in
basic earnings per share). Operating cash
flow grew 36% and represented 2.7
times operating profit. The Group balance
sheet gained further strength with no
debt, over $87m of cash, and over $75m
of deferred income giving the Group high
levels of turnover visibility into 2005 and
beyond. This was a record year by many
measures, but the Group must always
look beyond – to new opportunity, to
challenge, and to change.
The Group’s three year product roadmap
published in May 2004 and presents
further opportunities in the areas of
appliance and managed service-based
deliveries of our content filtering solutions. 
This will also present new financial and
working capital challenges for the Group,
for example in managing hardware related
logistics with third party vendors and
providing ‘software as a service’. As the
global market for content filtering continues
to grow and evolve, so will our customer
base grow in different regions around the
world. As we enter fiscal 2005, the Group
is also making final preparation for the
change from UK GAAP to International
Accounting Standards for financial year
2006 and comparative periods. Clearly
2005 will be filled with new opportunity,
challenge, and change.

Advisers Directors’ report
Annual report + accounts 2004 23.
The Directors present their Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2004.
Principal activities and offices
The Group’s principal activity is the development and sale of Internet Web and E-mail Filtering solutions. The Group’s products enable customers to
manage unwanted Internet content that enters and leaves the business so as to significantly reduce the risks to productivity, network resources, legal
liability and security. During the financial year the Group had two product brands, “SurfControl” and “Cyber Patrol”. “SurfControl” is the Group’s brand 
for server based web, e-mail, instant messaging and bundled filtering products and is sold into the corporate and education sectors. “Cyber Patrol” is
designed for client-based products sold into the home market. Software development kits are also incorporated into product offerings provided by
original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners.
In the fourth quarter of the year the Group acquired Linux based e-mail filter appliance technology from SecureM, Inc, together with its Chinese based
distributor at an estimated cost of $13,194,000 in cash (including earn-out based consideration of $3,123,000 at 30 June 2004). This acquisition will
strengthen the Group’s filtering product portfolio and global distribution network. The Group has also announced its intention to offer filtering as a
managed service in the future.
The Group’s products are currently sold in four different ways:
(1) By direct sales after a potential customer downloads a trial copy from the Company’s web site (www.surfcontrol.com);
(2) Indirectly through a reseller or partner who may incorporate the products into a broader secure content management solution;
(3) Indirectly through strategic alliances and OEM partners; and 
(4) Direct e-commerce sales, without interaction of sales personnel.
Financial results and review of developments
The results for the year are set out in the attached audited financial statements on pages 41to 67. The Directors do not recommend the payment of
a dividend and the retained profit for the year of $11.54m is transferred to reserves.
A full review of the operations of the Group during the year, together with an indication of current and future developments can be found in the
Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s Statements on pages1 to10 and the Finance Director’s Review on pages14 to19. 
Share purchases
During the final quarter of the financial year the Company acquired a total of 106,000 of its own 10p ordinary shares for treasury at an aggregate cost
of $1,112,000. The purchases were completed at an average price of £5.83 ($10.41) per share and represented 0.34% of issued share capital at
30 June 2004. At this date the Company has remaining authorisation up to the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to purchase
2,984,000 ordinary shares. The shares were repurchased as the Board believes that it is a good use of shareholder funds given the share price and
the Group’s future market opportunities. 
Research and Development
The Group’s activities in research and development are discussed in the Chairman and Chief Executive’s Review on pages1 to10. A charge of $9.68m
has been recorded in the Group profit and loss account during the period for research and development. Board structure

Directors’ report
SurfControl plc 24. Directors’ report
Annual report + accounts 2004 25.
Employment policy and involvement
The Group believes in developing and maintaining a diverse, multi-talented and highly motivated workforce. The Group is therefore committed to
providing equal employment opportunities by establishing discrimination-free recruitment and employment practices, and maintaining an environment
that is free from any form of discrimination. The Group companies give full consideration to all employment applications from disabled persons.
Disabled employees, and employees who may become disabled during the course of their employment with the Company or Group, are eligible to
participate in all appropriate training and career development generally available to staff.
The Directors acknowledge their responsibilities to consult staff and communicate relevant information to them. All employees have access to the
internal corporate web site. The Company also uses other methods of communication such as staff meetings, web casts, video conferencing, instant
messaging, and e-mail, such that the views of employees can be taken into account in making decisions which are likely to affect their interests.
Creditor payment policy
It is Group policy to pay suppliers in accordance with agreed terms and conditions of purchase, provided that the supplier complies with all relevant
terms and conditions. The policy developed is specific to the Group’s businesses and, consequently, adoption of an external code of payment to
suppliers is considered unnecessary. The average time taken to pay purchase invoices by the Group is 28 days (Company: 35 days).
Political and charitable contributions
The Group made no political contributions during the year. Donations to UK charities amounted to $97,879 (2003: $172,249) (2002: $10,239).
In addition to these charitable donations, the Group donated $10,173 to charities outside of the UK (2003:$4,147) (2002:$127,800).
Corporate responsibility
The Group conducts its business having regard to its various stakeholders and the wider community. The Directors are committed to a management
culture that promotes the health, safety, and general welfare of employees. As mentioned above full and timely communication is maintained with
employees. The Group aims to foster fair and transparent relations with all its customers, whilst maintaining a clear commercial basis to its business
transactions. The Group ensures payment is made promptly to suppliers, irrespective of their size, unless there are sound business reasons to withhold
payment. Group companies support their communities with involvement in local initiatives, and through charitable contributions. The Board recognises
its responsibility to consider social and environmental issues as these arise and to ensure compliance with relevant local statutory regulations. The
Board believes it has adequate information systems in place to assess any environmental and social concerns that may arise from time to time. These
matters will, where relevant, form part of the Group’s risk management strategy although as a software developer the Group has no manufacturing
facilities that pose environmental issues. Waste products are recycled in all offices and management aim to ensure responsible use of energy as far as
it is economic and practical to so.
The Group’s website includes a section dedicated to corporate, ethical, employment and environmental issues. (www.surfcontrol.com/company/csr)
Going Concern 
The Directors have reviewed budgets and have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue as an operational
business for the foreseeable future. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
Auditors
An ordinary resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the Company is to be submitted to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
> Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
> Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
> State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
> Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. Directors’ report
SurfControl plc 26.
Annual General Meeting
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company, in addition to the ordinary business of the Meeting, resolutions will be proposed to renew for 
a further year the authority to allot un-issued shares in the Company, to allot shares for cash free from the pre-emption rights set out in the
Companies Act 1985, to give the Company authority to make market purchases of it shares, and to put into place a long-term incentive
programme for Executive Directors.
Resolution 8 will renew the Directors’ authority to allot un-issued shares in the Company in accordance with section 80 of the Companies Act 1985.
The resolution authorises the Directors to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,657,959 (being one-third of the issued ordinary share
capital of the Company at the date of this notice plus the maximum current options). The authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual
General Meeting of the Company or on the day 15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution (whichever is the earlier). The Directors
have no immediate intention to exercise this authority other than in connection with the group’s employee share schemes.
Under Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985, equity securities in the Company may not be allotted for cash (otherwise than in respect of an
employee share scheme) without first being offered pro rata to existing shareholders, unless the prior approval of the shareholders is given in a general
meeting. The Directors consider that it is in the best interests of the Company to renew the relevant authority given at the annual general meeting in
2003. Accordingly, a Special Resolution to this effect is proposed as Resolution 9 in the notice of the Annual General Meeting. The proposed authority
will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or on the day 15 months from the date of the passing of this
resolution (whichever is the earlier) and permits the Directors during this period to issue up to an aggregate nominal amount of £155,434
(representing 5% of the issued share capital at 30th June 2004) without first offering them to existing shareholders.
Under the terms of the Companies Act 1985 and its Articles of Association, the Company has power to purchase its own shares provided that this
power has first been sanctioned by shareholders. Resolution 10 authorises the Company to make purchases of up to 3,108,674 shares (representing
10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at the date of this notice) at a minimum price of 10p and a maximum price (exclusive of
expenses) of not more than 5 per cent above the average of the middle market quotations for the ordinary shares of the Company as derived from
the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the 5 business days prior to the purchase. The authority will expire at the conclusion of the next
Annual General Meeting of the Company or on the day 15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution (whichever is the earlier). As at 
September 2004 (being the last practicable date prior to publication of this Report) 3,481,494 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the
Company, pursuant to the SurfControl Executive Share Option Schemes were outstanding. If exercised as at the date of this document, those options
would represent 10.07% of the total issued share capital of the Company inclusive of shares issued under option. If the full authority to buy back
shares being sought is used, the same options would represent 11.07% of the total issued share capital of the Company inclusive of shares issued
under option. The fact that the Directors are seeking this authority should not be taken as an indication that the Company will purchase its own shares
at any particular price or indeed at all and the Directors would only consider making purchases if they believed that such purchases would be in the
best interests of shareholders generally, having regard to the effect on earnings per share.
Full details of the resolution in respect to a proposed long-term incentive programme for Executive Directors will be given in the notice of Annual
General Meeting
By order of the Board

6 September 2004 Corporate governance report
Annual report + accounts 2004 27.
Introduction
The Board supports the principles of the June 1998 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Combined Code”) and has broadly complied
with it throughout the year. 
Reports by Sir Derek Higgs and Sir Robert Smith have prompted recent changes to the Combined Code. The Revised Code applies to reporting periods
commencing on or after 1 November 2003 and therefore the Company has no obligation to report on “the Revised Code” this year. However, the Board
takes the matter of corporate governance very seriously, and so this report also sets out the Group’s compliance in relation to the Revised Code, and our
plans to develop our corporate governance practices and procedures in the future. As a result, new or expanded areas addressed in this year’s report
include Board performance evaluation, details of the operation of Board committees, Non-Executive Directors’ Board attendance records, whistle-blowing
procedures, and shareholder communications.
Details of non compliance with the Combined Code and the Revised Code are given on page 32.
1. The Board of Directors
The Group is controlled by a Board of Directors that currently comprise four Executive and four Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors
are George Hayter, Greg Lock, Rene Schuster, and Jane Tozer. 
The Board has adopted a Schedule of Matters reserved for its approval. The Board’s responsibilities extend to setting overall business and market
strategy for the Group as a whole. This involves approving significant strategic decisions such as acquisitions, product and market diversification, and
capital structure. It also involves approving annual operating budgets and monitoring performance against budget, establishing a risk framework and
setting tolerances for a risk profile, and monitoring executive and management performance. All operational decisions within this business and market
framework are delegated to executive management. 
George Hayter, Greg Lock and Rene Schuster are shareholders in the Company. All the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be
independent of the Company and Group, as defined in section A3.1 of the Combined Code, as each Non-Executive Director possesses considerable
outside expertise, and is able to exercise detached judgement in dealing with matters before the Board. The senior independent Non-Executive Director
is George Hayter, who was appointed to the Board on 15 June 1998. Although the senior Non-Executive Director holds stock options in the Company
which were granted in 2001, subject to performance criteria, the Board does not consider that this affects his ability to exercise independent judgement.
Board meetings were held on eight separate occasions during the year. In advance of each meeting, the Board is furnished with timely information
to enable it to discharge its duties, including inter-alia reports covering local operating performance and activities, a Group operational summary,
management accounts with budget variance analysis, most recent forecasts, and status reports on taxation, working capital management, human
resources, information systems, internal control reviews and changes, treasury and strategic matters. The Non-Executive Directors also meet from
time to time, outside of Board and committee meetings, without the presence of Executive Directors.
Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary at all times, and may seek independent professional and legal advice. Although there is
no formal training programme, training is provided to Directors on induction and from time to time on request.
All Board Directors are subject to re-election in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, which require up to one third of Directors to be
eligible for re-election in each calendar year. A Director is also subject to re-election at the Annual General Meeting following their initial appointment to
the Board.
Professional commitments of the Chairman of the Board
The Chairman of the Board is Greg Lock, who is also chairman of Nexagent Limited and held Directorships in Target Group Limited and Liberata
Limited throughout the year.
The biographies of all of the Board’s Directors, and their continuing outside Directorships if any, are set out on page 20 of this annual report. Corporate governance report
SurfControl plc 28.
Board Committees
There are three Committees of the Board, which are:
(a) Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee consists of three Non-Executive Directors: Rene Schuster (Chairman), George Hayter, and Jane Tozer. Simon Acland
was Chairman of the Committee prior to Rene Schuster’s appointment on 1 November 2003. In accordance with the recommendations of the Higgs
Report, Greg Lock resigned from his position on the Committee on 29 January 2004. Other Board Directors and senior Human Resource managers
are from time to time invited to attend Remuneration Committee meetings at the request of the Chairman. The Committee’s responsibilities are to set
the remuneration for the Executive Directors, and to set the remuneration policy for the Group so as to enable the recruitment and retention of high
calibre executives and senior management. The Board’s Remuneration Report on pages 33 to 39 provides further details of the Committee’s
responsibilities and work. The Committee meets no less than twice each year, and it has met five times in the year under review. The full text of the
Committee’s terms of reference may be found on the Company’s website at www.surfcontrol.com/company/cg.
(b) Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of four Non-Executive Directors: Jane Tozer (Chairman), George Hayter, Greg Lock, and Rene Schuster. In the Board’s
opinion, Jane Tozer has relevant up to date financial experience and is suitably qualified to chair this committee. Greg Lock acted as Chairman prior to
Jane Tozer’s appointment on 1 November 2003. Other Board Directors and senior accounting managers are from time to time invited to attend Audit
Committee meetings at the request of the Chairman.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring all accounting, reporting, control and financial aspects of the executive management’s activities, and for
ensuring that an appropriate risk management framework is in place for the Group. It is also responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of
the Company and Group is properly reported with regard to compliance with UK Company law, accounting standards and best practice requirements
of the Combined Code.
The Committee meets no less than four times a year, and meets with the external auditors each quarter to review their reports in relation to the
Group’s accounts and internal controls. The Committee also reviews significant areas of business and financial risk, and assumptions or judgements
made by management in assessing these risks. In addition the Committee and/or the Chairman meet periodically with the external auditors without
the presence of the Finance Director or other Executive Directors. In the year under review, the Committee met four times.
The Board reviews the need for an internal audit function annually. At present an internal audit function is not considered necessary for a number 
of reasons: the small size of the Group, the relative simplicity of the nature and type of transactions entered into by the Group, significant executive
involvement in the Group’s day to day business, the ongoing improvement of internal controls and the operation of key financial controls via peer
review. As the Group increases in size, global reach, and complexity of business mix, the possible need for an internal audit function will continue 
to be reviewed at least annually.
The Company has not historically adopted a formal ‘whistle-blowing’ procedure, although it has always encouraged open communication between staff,
HR, senior management and Executive Directors. The Audit Committee is working to include the formality of written guidelines and to encourage any
employee or Executive Director to communicate matters of concern directly to the Non-Executive Directors if they wish. The written guidelines will upon
completion be published on the Company’s website. These reporting procedures will be reviewed annually to measure their effectiveness and details
will be disclosed in the 2005 Annual Report.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditors.
The Committee keeps under review the cost effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external auditors, as well as maintaining a policy on the use
of external auditors for non-audit services. The policy’s objective is to avoid potential conflicts of interest or circumstances where the external auditor’s
judgement or independence may be compromised, and only to retain the external auditors where their knowledge and expertise provides service over
and above other professional service providers of similar standing. In the year under review, the majority of non-audit services provided by the external
auditors related to tax compliance and planning. Details of the non-audit services, together with their cost, are set out in Note 6 on page 52.
The full text of the Committee’s terms of reference, and its policy on the use of external auditors for non-audit services, may be found on the
Company’s website at www.surfcontrol.com/company/cg.
(c) Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of four Non-Executive Directors: Greg Lock (Chairman), George Hayter, Rene Schuster, and Jane Tozer. The
Committee’s responsibilities are to identify, evaluate and select candidates for Board positions, and to review annually the composition and size of 
the Board. It makes recommendations on appointments and changes to the composition to the Board. During the year under review the Committee (at the time consisting of Greg Lock (Chairman), George Hayter, Simon Acland and Rob Barrow),
recommended two Non-Executive appointments to the Board: the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee. These recommendations were accepted. In making these appointments the Board considered, but did not utilise, the services of an
external search firm. Instead, a list of twenty qualified candidates was drawn up from a variety of sources. Ten of these were interviewed and
considered for the positions. The prime qualities sought for the Chairman of the Audit Committee were recent and relevant financial experience, 
and a passionate commitment to the principles of strong corporate governance. For the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, the qualities 
were high levels of knowledge, experience and understanding of a global software and services business at a senior level.
The full text of the Committee’s terms of reference may be found on the Company’s website at www.surfcontrol.com/company/cg.

Reasons for non-attendance were telephone system failure at a remote location, illness, and unavoidable travel delays.
The attendance record at Board meetings for the Executive Directors was 100% for each individual.
Annual performance evaluations
Previously the Board has not conducted formal annual performance evaluations of the Board as a whole, the individual Non-Executive Directors, the
Chairman, or the Board Committees. Such evaluation to date has been informal and ad hoc. In response to the recommendations of the Revised
Combined Code, the Board conducted an evaluation of its effectiveness in a separate meeting with all members present. Attendance at Board and
Committee meetings was reviewed and each Board member provided his or her assessment of the Board’s collective performance. The review
considered committee terms of reference and the timeliness and efficacy of each committee’s performance and output. Input was obtained from 
the auditors on the performance of the audit committee. 
Whilst the assessment results were very encouraging there were nevertheless clear areas for improvement, and an agenda for implementation has
been put in place. The Group is committed to continuous improvement in its business operations, and this same ethos applies to the Board.
Separately the Senior Independent Director conducted an assessment of the performance of the Chairman with input from each member of the
Board. The Chairman was absent from the discussions. This assessment was shared with the Chairman and suggestions made for improvement were
accepted by him.
The processes and improvement agenda described above will form an integral part of the Board’s work and the formal assessment of performance 
will be conducted annually
For the year under review, as in prior years, the Executive Directors’ performance is appraised by the Chairman (who also obtains feedback from the
Non-Executive Directors) in conjunction with the Chief Executive. This follows the Chief Executive’s own evaluation of their performance and
contribution to the Company. The Chairman also evaluates the performance against objectives of the Chief Executive having obtained input from the
Non Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee considers these evaluations in their decisions on bonus awards for the year, and in the setting
of future compensation for the Executive Directors.

2. Shareholder Relations
The Group keeps in contact with investors through a regular communication programme involving a variety of analyst and institutional meetings,
recorded telephone conference calls, and technology bank conference presentations. On a pre-set schedule, the Group publishes un-audited results
each quarter via Reuters News Service. The Group’s annual and interim reports are circulated to shareholders, all known interested parties, and through
the Financial Times/Daily Telegraph subscription service. The pre-set publication schedule, together with downloadable copies of all financial results, is
also published on the Group’s web site. The Group also publishes on the Company’s web site downloadable copies of all presentations made to
investors or analysts. These activities are an integral part of the Company’s policy of maintaining a high level of transparency with investors and
complying with its obligations as a fully listed company. The Company also hosts an annual Analyst Day where non-financial aspects of the Group’s
operations and products are discussed. The CEO and Finance Director are the primary points of contact for shareholder relations. The Chairman of the
Board is available on an ongoing basis to meet with major shareholders, and promptly responds to any ad hoc requests for meetings. In addition, the
Chairman extends an offer to meet with all of the Company’s top 10 major shareholders each year, together with the CEO.
3. Internal control
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control. Internal control systems are designed to meet the particular
needs of the Group and the risks to which it is exposed, and by their nature can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement of financial information or safeguarding of assets.
Guidance for Directors, “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” was published in September 1999. The Group considers that
it complied with this guidance for the year ending 30 June 2004, and through to the date of the approval of the financial statements.
A review of the business risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of existing internal controls takes place at least annually. Discussed below are
the four major business risks currently faced by the Group, together with the systems and initiatives in place to address these risks.
(a) Quality assured product development
Bringing products to market that meet and anticipate customer demand is critical in the software industry, as life cycles are short and competition is
fierce. If not successful, new business growth will slow and customer retention will suffer. 
To address the risks associated with product development, the Group operates a formal product development life cycle process, and the functions of
Product Management and Engineering are separately managed and staffed. This ensures that product development is ‘market-led’ rather than
‘engineering-pushed’. Close relationships are maintained with our resellers, the major security platform and Secure Content Management vendors, and
of course our customers, in order to ensure timely market feedback within the overall development process. Quality Assurance (QA) extends beyond
assuring feature-rich products and upgrades, to ease of installation, inter-operability with all the popular operating and network environments, and
scalability. For example, the Group recently announced key inter-operability relationships for its Web filtering solution with Cisco and BlueCoat – two
leading vendors of Content Caching Engines. To complement the formal QA process, the QA and Technical Support teams have a formalised escalation
process that explicitly evaluates the potential risk to the wider customer base represented by each reported problem or bug. A global QA database
tracks and evaluates problems captured by the Support teams, and weekly ‘bug’ meetings are held to ensure that problem resolution is timely. The
Group’s global resources support efficient QA and product development by having highly skilled teams in cost-effective regions of the world, such as
China, Australia, and the UK.
To complement in-house development, and to reduce time to market, the Group outsources certain non-core projects. The Group also evaluates
partnering, investment, and acquisition opportunities as a means to cost-effectively reduce time to market. For example, in the year under review the
Group outsourced a number of product translation projects, and acquired the intellectual property of an e-mail filtering appliance.
(b) Acquisitions and new business areas
Historically and in the year under review the Company has acquired businesses and technology to accelerate time to market in executing its strategic
plans with respect to technology, markets, and geographic reach. Acquisitions present a high risk/high reward profile to any company, and this is
particularly true in the field of software and technology, due to the highly competitive nature of the market and rapidly changing market conditions.
Risks arise in three broad categories: Candidate selection, valuation, and integration. The Group seeks to manage these risks in relation to the potential
rewards of accelerated time to market for high quality and competitive product offerings, and the acquisition of teams and channels to deliver such
products. If the rewards outweigh the costs and managed risks, a positive return to investors can be achieved. If the costs and risks outweigh the
rewards, the Group’s financial position could be harmed. The Group seeks to manage these risks by using multi-disciplinary teams to evaluate a wide
range of acquisition candidates before completing any acquisition. Disciplines within the teams include product management, engineering, finance, and
legal. Each team is led by two Executive Directors, being the Finance Director and the President of the region in which the candidate is located. Outside
advisors are used where appropriate to assist in due diligence. The CEO has oversight of the due diligence, and the Board reviews due diligence Corporate governance report
Annual report + accounts 2004 31.
findings, approving valuation and the actual decision to acquire a company or technology. Integration risk is managed by involving Company
management from HR, IS, and other support functions in the latter stages of due diligence to develop a detailed integration plan. Integration
commences immediately upon completion of an acquisition and involves the same multi-disciplinary team that conducted the due diligence, in
conjunction with the acquired entity’s management.
In May 2004, the Company announced a three year product and technology roadmap, which included delivering its filtering solutions via appliance 
and managed service platforms, in addition to the current server software basis of delivery. The acquisition of Linux based e-mail filtering appliance
technology in April 2004 has accelerated the Group’s ability to execute against this product roadmap. Appliances and managed services represent new
business areas of opportunity for the Group, in which the Group has little prior experience, and therefore present new areas of risk. The Group will seek
to manage these new risks by outsourcing non-core activities, such as manufacturing, logistics, and hosting. Additional skills will be hired into the Group
as appropriate.
In April 2004 as a result of the acquisition of the principal assets of SecureM, Inc., the Group acquired sales offices in China; for the first time directly
penetrating this large and culturally different marketplace. New markets afford new opportunities for the Group. Lack of experience in new markets and
cultures also present new areas of risk. The Group will seek to manage these new risks by retaining and hiring locally experienced employees and
managers, utilising external expert advice with regard to local trading and regulatory conditions, and applying additional internal control procedures.
Examples of internal controls include more senior levels of expenditure authorization, increased oversight by Group management, and more frequent
and detailed financial controls relative to the size of the local operation.
(c) Intellectual property
The Group’s intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of the Group’s products, services and
brand. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which the Group’s products and services are distributed.
Unauthorized use of the Group’s intellectual property, or third party intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive to litigate or
settle and could divert management resources and attention. The Group relies on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws,
as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect the Group’s proprietary technology and intellectual property. The Group also
controls access to proprietary technology, and enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the Group’s employees and
consultants, as well as other third parties.
(d) Internal communication and management information systems
The Group operates out of thirteen offices in eight countries, and has grown both organically and by acquisition. Rapid growth on a global basis
presents risks associated with communication, while the use of various local information systems (which are often legacy applications from past
acquisitions) may have a detrimental impact on the production of accurate, timely and relevant management information.
To address the risks associated with communication and management information flows, the Information Systems (IS) team operates as a global
function to create and implement common systems that produce consistent data in standard reporting formats. IS has a formal Management
Information Systems (MIS) development plan covering a rolling two year period. In addition, challenges associated with communication across the
organisation are met through use of tools such as video, telephone, instant messaging and email. Management and executive meetings are also
frequently held, examples of which are given in the Non-Financial Reporting paragraph below.
In addition to the four major business risks discussed above, there are a number of monitoring, reporting, and control risks which are common to
many companies, irrespective of market sector, size, or rate of growth. The principal current control procedures operated by the Group to address
such risks include: 
i) Control environment
The Group’s control environment is the responsibility of the Board, however senior management work hard to improve the level of risk awareness
throughout the Group. Operational managers are delegated with the implementation and day to day monitoring of internal controls. Operational
matters are communicated to the Board through operating unit or global function reports at each Board meeting, held eight times per year. The
effectiveness of financial internal controls is reported to the Board by the Chief Financial Officer at each Board meeting. The Board also receives a
quarterly review from the external auditors, in addition to the year end review, covering the scope of controls that they have sought to rely on in order
to form an opinion on the financial statements.
ii) Risk assessment
As noted above the Board has established a formal procedure to monitor the risk environment and reviews how controls are developed and adapted
to minimise the Group’s exposure. Corporate governance report
SurfControl plc 32.
iiI) Financial reporting
A comprehensive budget is produced once a year and is reviewed and approved by the Board. Rolling quarterly operating forecasts are completed
monthly, and are reported to the Board monthly. Budgets are devolved to local and regional operational management who are responsible for
managing their operating units within budgetary constraints. Individual department managers are aware of and accountable for their authorisation 
limits with regard to expenditure and staff recruitment.
The monthly results of the operating units are reported monthly to the Board and compared to the current budget. In addition, key performance
indicators (“KPIs”) relevant to the Group are monitored more frequently; on a daily and weekly basis by senior management, for example invoicing
levels and sales mix, cash flows, and leads generated by marketing. Any trend in the KPIs away from budget is brought to the attention of the Board. 
iv) Non-financial reporting
Management in sales, marketing, product management, engineering, technical support, human resources and legal meet at least monthly as teams to
monitor and assess progress against current operating plans, as well as opportunities to improve inter-operation. These meetings occur separately in
each major office within the Group. 
Senior management meets monthly via telephone or video link to review and discuss short term tactical and operational matters. These meetings are
global in nature and bring all disciplines together at each meeting. Issues that affect multiple departments, and communication are explicitly targeted as
important agenda items.
The Executive Directors meet twice monthly to discuss operational and strategic matters. Once per quarter these meetings cover strategic matters with
a time-frame extending beyond the current operating plans and budgets.
v) Treasury policy
The Board has a formal policy governing its treasury function, which is reviewed annually by the Board. The policy’s objective is to produce a
competitive yield on Group funds without exposing the Group to a significant level of risk, such that sufficient cash is preserved for working capital 
and investment needs. The following risks are explicitly addressed: liquidity, counterparty, product, interest, and exchange. 
4. Provisions of the Code
Throughout the financial year ended 30 June 2004, and through to the date of approval of the financial statements, the Board consider that the Group
has complied with Section 1 of the 1998 Combined Code except to the extent described below:
Non-Executive Directors’ Service Contracts and Share Options
In accordance with the terms of their original appointments, Non-Executives currently serve under service contracts without a specified fixed term, but
with notice periods of three months. 
The Company has in the past granted options over ordinary shares to the senior Non-Executive Director. These grants occurred several years ago when
the Company was a much smaller business than it is today, reflecting the very significant growth in the business over a short period of time. The senior
Non-Executive Director is considered by the Board to be independent.
In addition, throughout the financial year ended 30 June 2004, and through to the date of approval of the financial statements, the Board considered
that the Group has complied with Section1 of the Revised Combined Code except to the extent described below:
(a) Audit and Remuneration Committee Membership
The Audit and Remuneration Committees did not wholly comprise independent Non-Executive Directors throughout the financial year as required by
provisions B.2.1 and C.3.1 of the Revised Combined Code. Following Greg Lock’s appointment as Group Chairman he resigned from his position on
the Remuneration Committee in Janurary 2004. Greg Lock remains a member of the Audit Committee because the Board believe him to be
independent and highly value his input to the Committee’s work.
(b) Board Performance Evaluations
The Company recently adopted a formal process for evaluating the performance of the Board as a whole, its committees, the individual Non-Executive
Directors, and the Chairman as required by provision A.6 of the Revised Combined Code. As such this process has not been in place for the whole of
the year under review.
(c) “Whistle-blowing” Procedures
The Company’s current informal and unwritten procedures for reporting matters of employee concern have always encouraged open communications
with all levels of staff including Executive Directors, but have not historically included encouraging employees or Executive Directors to communicate
matters of concern to the Non-Executive Directors. These reporting procedures will be formalised and amended to encourage communication with any
and all Board members, from the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Directors’ remuneration report
Annual report + accounts 2004 33.
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to inform shareholders of the Group’s policy on Directors’ remuneration as recommended by the Remuneration Committee
and adopted by the full Board. The report details how the Board has complied with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 from the
Department of Trade and Industry, and section B of the Combined Code. 
Members of the Remuneration Committee and advisers
The Committee comprised of the following Non-Executive Directors during the year:
Rene Schuster (Chairman appointed 1 November 2003)
George Hayter
Jane Tozer
Simon Acland (Chairman resigned 1 November 2003)
Greg Lock (resigned 29 January 2004) 
Simon Acland resigned from both the Committee and the Board. Greg Lock resigned from the Committee to comply with the revisions to the
Combined Code, which state that the Chairman of the Board should not sit on the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee has received market data on competitive levels of compensation in the UK and US from New Bridge Street Consultants and Radford
US during the year. The consulting firms provide information to the Human Resources department from time to time but are not retained to provide
any specific consulting services for the Committee or the Group generally.
During the year the Committee has also consulted Steve Purdham and Greg Lock about its proposals relating to the remuneration of other Executive
Directors. The Committee also consults with other senior members of staff on an occasional basis.
Terms of reference
The Committee works within detailed terms of reference, which are set by the Board. Copies of the Committee’s terms of reference are available from
the Group’s web site, www.surfcontrol.com/company/cg and are summarised below:
> The scale and structure of all aspects of remuneration for the Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman; 
> The Group’s overall policy on executive and senior management remuneration;
> The level and performance basis for share option or other share-based awards to Executive Directors, senior management and staff; and 
> The maintenance of service agreements with the Chairman and Executive Directors.
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are a matter reserved for a Committee of the Board which does not include any Non-Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy
The Committee believes remuneration levels should be competitive, and based on individual contribution. The aim of its policy is to provide 
incentive structures which support the achievement of the Group’s growth and financial performance goals. The current policy is to determine
executive and senior management remuneration by reference to comparisons in the global software technology sector, whilst having regard to the
relative performance and growth prospects for the Group, and the current and expected future performance of the individuals concerned. The
Committee, when setting remuneration for the executives and senior management also takes into account practice applicable to other employees
within the Group.
The Committee is of the view that a significant proportion of executive remuneration should be linked to corporate performance so that the interests 
of the executives are aligned as far as possible with those of shareholders. Performance related payments for the Executive Directors for the financial
year ended June 2004 consisted of a combination of cash bonuses and share options.
There were no significant changes in the structure of executive cash-based remuneration since the end of the financial year, although the Committee is
currently in the process of reviewing long-term incentive arrangements for the Executive Directors. There were no LTIP’s in operation during the year
under review. It is intended that neither Executive nor Non-Executive Directors will receive share options for the foreseeable future, but that Executive
Directors will participate in a new long-term incentive scheme paying due regard to corporate governance best practice. Details of the proposed
scheme will be presented to shareholders for approval as part of the notice of the 2004 Annual General Meeting. Other than the introduction of the
new LTIP, the current intention of the Committee is to continue the same remuneration policy during the next and subsequent financial years. Directors’ remuneration report

Basic salary and benefits in kind
Basic salaries are subject to annual review and are fully pensionable. Salaries are designed to be competitive in order to recruit and retain 
excellent people.
Benefits in kind include a Company car (or allowance where appropriate) for UK based Directors, and access to Group employee medical schemes
and life assurance cover for all Directors. These benefits are not pensionable.
Annual and monthly cash bonus scheme
Annual bonus arrangements are intended to provide incentives to the Executive Directors to achieve the Group’s pre-determined operational objectives
for the year under review. Executive bonuses are based on a mix of financial objectives relating to regional or Group revenue and Group EBITDA with
minimum and threshold achievement levels. 75% of such bonus is payable if the Group attained 95% or more of the target EBITDA. 
Cash bonus payments represented 48% of executive basic pay in the current year (2003: 53%) (2002: 40%). 70% of Executive Directors’ cash
bonus is uncapped. Bonuses are not pensionable.
Share options
The Remuneration Committee regards share options as an important component of total remuneration but intends to make only limited allocation 
of options in the future, for the benefit of senior management rather than Executive Directors as detailed above. The grant of options to senior
management are subject to operational and individual targets, and are set in consultation with the CEO and the Executive team.
Up to now Executive Directors’ entitlement to options under the Group scheme have been subject to the achievement of the following 
performance conditions: 
For financial years 1999-2003 options were granted to executives based on a mix of Group revenue and EBITDA targets for the relevant year of
account. Outstanding options arising from this period have been fully tested as to performance criteria and are eligible to vest in accordance with the
terms of the original grant, or have otherwise lapsed.
For financial year 2004, 280,000 options were granted to the Executive Directors on 3 July 2003 at a price of £6.475, which was the closing middle
market price on that day. Steve Purdham received 100,000 options and the other Executive Directors received 60,000 options each. The options were
subject to the following performance and vesting conditions:
> 80% of options vest on 2 July 2004, subject to achievement of Group target EBITDA for the year ended 30 June 2004, with 75% of such options
vesting if the Group attained 95% or more of target EBITDA;
> 10% of options vest on 2 July 2005, provided that the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) exceeds the median achieved by techMARK listed
companies over the period July 2003-July 2005;
> 10% of options vest on 2 July 2005, provided that the Company’s TSR is in the upper quartile achieved by techMARK listed companies over the
period July 2003-July 2005.
Additionally, in the event that the Group EBITDA for the year ended 30 June 2004 performance condition is not achieved, or only partially achieved,
the unvested options become eligible to vest on 2 July 2005 on the same TSR basis described in the paragraphs above. Fifty percent of the unvested
options would then vest on the achievement of the median TSR and fifty percent on achieving a TSR in the upper quartile, but thereafter no further
retesting of performance is permitted and the options lapse.
None of the above performance conditions have been varied during the financial year. Group EBITDA is assessed by reference to the published
audited annual accounts of the Company. Following a review of the Group’s full year 2004 management accounts, the Committee concluded that the
Group EBITDA targets had not been achieved in all respects, and that accordingly all the relevant options would be re-tested under the above TSR
criteria in July 2005.
Throughout the year under review the Committee has adopted the principle that the greater the potential award of options to participants, the more
stretching shall be the relevant performance target. The Committee has not formally valued share options that it has approved. 
There is no limit set on the number of options held by any individual participants in the Company’s share option schemes, including Directors, as the
allocation of options is wholly at the discretion of the Committee. The Group’s current share option scheme is operated without significant external
management cost. Service Contracts
The Company has service agreements with its Directors. It is the Remuneration Committee’s policy that such agreements should contain notice periods
of not more than 12 months, and that provision for compensation for loss of office is limited in scope to the termination provisions as set in each
Executive Director’s contract. Details of agreements in place for the current Directors is as follows:

Directors’ remuneration report
Annual report + accounts 2004 39. We have audited the financial statements on pages 41 to 67. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 25, this includes
responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibilities,
as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code issued
in June 1998 specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the Corporate governance report and the un-audited part of the Directors’
remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 30 June 2004 and of the profit of the
Group for the year then ended; and
> the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

1. Accounting policies
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the Group’s 
financial statements.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. 
The functional currency of the Group is US dollars as the majority of the Group’s business is conducted in the United States and accordingly amounts
in the financial statements are denominated in that currency.
Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of SurfControl plc and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June 2004.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired
in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition.
Under section 230 (4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss account. 
Turnover and deferred income
Turnover represents the value of goods and services (net of VAT and other regional sales tax) delivered in the normal course of business. Turnover
from perpetual software and appliance license sales is recognised once the license is delivered, all significant obligations in relation to the sale have
been fulfilled, and where the sales price is fixed and determinable. Sales made via channel partners are neither invoiced, nor recognised as turnover,
until the product or service is delivered to the end customer. Turnover from the following items are recognised over the relevant period of the contract
on a straight-line basis: software/appliance support and maintenance, content list subscriptions, Cyber Patrol home product subscriptions, and OEM
contract licenses. Turnover from services is recognised upon completion. Where the proportion of the total sale price attributable to different elements
of the sale is not specifically identified, an estimate is made based upon the published list prices for each of the individual elements.
Deferred income represents the value of goods and services (net of VAT and other regional sales tax) that has been invoiced but not considered
delivered or completed, plus the unrecognised portion of turnover from software/appliance support and maintenance, content list subscriptions, Cyber
Patrol home product subscriptions, and OEM contract licenses. Deferred income is carried forward within creditors, and released to turnover in the
profit and loss account in future periods.
Research and development
All research and development expenditure is written off as incurred.
Technical support
All pre-and post sales support expenditure is written off as incurred.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting
purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group in
independently administered funds. Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Share options
The tax charge arising on the future potential exercise of Inland Revenue unapproved options is charged to the profit and loss account over the period
from the date of grant to the date options unconditionally vest with the employee. The charge is based upon the difference between the option
exercise price and the closing market price at the balance sheet date. Notes to the financial statements
for the years ended 30 June
Annual report + accounts 2004 47.
1. Accounting policies cont.
Intangible assets and goodwill
Intangible assets include the fair value of acquired intellectual property and goodwill. Acquired goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the
consideration and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired) arising on consolidation is capitalised. Acquired intellectual
property is also capitalised, where in the opinion of the Directors it satisfies the recognition criteria given in FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Acquired intellectual property and positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life. For
acquisitions to date, the estimated useful economic life of these assets has been two years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of the business, the profit and loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the un-amortised
amount of any related goodwill.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets fixed are recorded at cost as and when they are delivered and available for use. The carrying value of such assets is written down
by the amount of any impairment, and the loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which this occurs.
Included within tangible fixed assets are the project costs associated with the construction of various software and hardware systems for use within the
Group’s internal systems. Cost includes basic salary, related employer tax costs, and travel expenses for computer engineers, for the duration of the
development stage of the application. Also included in the asset cost are any related external consultancy or engineering fees. All costs relating to initial
planning or aborted projects are written off to profit and loss account as incurred.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are completed, at which time the final asset cost is transferred to Computer
equipment and software or Fixtures and fittings.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful
economic lives as follows:
Computer equipment and software – over 3 years
Motor vehicles – over 4 years
Fixtures and fittings – over 5 years
Investments
Fixed asset investments, which principally relate to the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings, are stated at cost less any provisions for
impairment in value.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a “first in, first out” basis. Net realisable value is determined on
the basis of expected selling price less any further anticipated costs that may be incurred prior to completion or disposal.
Cash and liquid resources
Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand, deposits repayable on demand and investments in instant access money
market managed funds. Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either
readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market. Liquid resources comprise term
deposits of one year or less and certificates of deposit.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. The
corresponding liability for the capital element is recorded as borrowings, and the interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the profit and
loss account over the period of the lease on a straight-line basis. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. 1. Accounting policies cont.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities of each entity denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group are translated at the rates of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in such currencies are recorded at the average rate ruling during the period of the transaction. 
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the opening net assets of entities which principally operate in currencies other than US dollars to
the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date, and the difference between the profit and loss accounts of such entities translated at an average
rate and at the closing rate, are recorded as movements on reserves. All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Relevant rates of exchange were:
Balance sheet rate of exchange (US Dollar to local currency) 2004 2003 2002
UK Sterling 1.81 1.65 1.53
Euro 1.22 1.15 0.99

Employee share option schemes
The Group operated two share option schemes for the benefit of Group employees and Directors during the year.
On 2 April 1992 the “JSB Computer Systems Executive Share Option Scheme” was adopted by the Board of Directors. The scheme has not been
approved by the Inland Revenue. No options were granted during the financial year and there is no intention to grant further options under this scheme. 17. Share Capital cont.
On 11 September 1998 the Board adopted the “JSB Software Technologies 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme” (“the 1998 scheme”). The
scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue although a schedule is incorporated into the rules allowing the grant of unapproved options. The scheme is
administered by the Remuneration Committee. Options may be granted at any time the committee considers appropriate, subject to compliance with
the Model Code on Directors’ dealings. Options may be granted subject to such performance targets as the committee in its discretion may decide and
with approval of the Inland Revenue where appropriate. 
On 14 July 2000 in an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company shareholders approved minor amendments to the 1998 scheme including
revision to the maximum limit on the number of shares for which options may be granted from 15% to 20% of the issued ordinary share capital.
On 31 October 2002 in Annual General Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of a second schedule to the Scheme to facilitate the granting of
options from November 1 2002 to Californian residents staff in a manner consistent with Section 25102(o) of the Californian Corporations Code.

The principal financial risks faced by the Group are counterparty, exchange rate, interest rate and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is managed by placing
cash deposits with banks principally in the UK and US, which have satisfactory credit ratings. To balance interest rate and liquidity risk the Group places
its cash balances in excess of immediate requirements on deposit with the intention of maximising income whilst ensuring funds are available to meet
the Group’s expenditure requirements. Exchange rate risk is managed by minimising balances in currencies other than those of local operations. The
Group’s policy is not to enter into forward exchange contracts
Cash and other liquid resources consist of cash held in current/deposit accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit, and money market term
deposits. Liquid resources at 30 June 2004 had a weighted average period to maturity of 12 weeks and earned interest at a weighted average rate 
of 2.25% per annum.
There was no significant differences between book value and fair value (determined by discounting future cash flows at current interest rates) for these
funds. No details regarding financial exposure of the short term debtors and creditors have been included. The Group does not engage in any hedging
in respect of interest rate risks.
There are no material committed undrawn facilities at year end.

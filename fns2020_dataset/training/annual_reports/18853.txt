1 Constant currency revenue growth is calculated by applying the exchange rates for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 to the year ended 31 December 2014 on a month by month 
basis and by calculating the growth percentage by reference to the total year.
2 Like-for-like sales growth (“LFL”) is calculated by taking retail sales in all locations where 
trading occurred for a full financial year prior to the start of the period being measured and 
calculating sales growth for those locations at constant currency.
3 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating profit for the year, adjusted for exceptional costs, 
loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, depreciation and 
amortisation charges and realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses on 
the revaluation of monetary items. 
4 Adjusted EBIT is defined as operating profit for the year, adjusted for exceptional costs, 
share of the result of associates and joint ventures (“JVs”) and realised and unrealised 
foreign exchange gains and losses on the revaluation of monetary items. 
5 Adjusted EBT is defined as profit or loss before tax for the year, adjusted for exceptional 
costs, interest on the shareholder credit facility, foreign exchange gains and losses on 
the revaluation of external bank facilities and changes in the fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts used to manage exposure to foreign currency gains and losses 
arising on the Euro denominated portion of its external bank facilities.
6 Adjusted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Consolidated Net Income

NEW STORE CONCEPT
During 2014 Jimmy Choo debuted a New Store Concept, developed 
with David Collins Studio and inspired by haute couture salons and 
fantasy shoe closets. This refreshes the look and feel of our stores, 
emphasises our luxury positioning and presents the fashion driven 
products in more space, while retaining the higher product densities 
in the Choo 24:7 collection. The new concept integrates the dual 
gender product portfolio, helping with penetration of the Men’s 
collection globally. 
NEW DOS GROWTH
During 2015 we opened 13 new DOS and converted three franchise 
stores in Singapore and Malaysia to DOS, taking the total DOS 
portfolio to 141 as at 31 December 2015.
Jimmy Choo continues to plan to open 10 to 15 new stores per year. 
This store opening programme is weighted towards China, where 
we remain underpenetrated relative to many larger luxury peers. 
This store opening rate allows us to capture the growth potential 
of the white space while ensuring the quality of execution maintains 
the Jimmy Choo luxury positioning and brand image. 
EXISTING DOS RENOVATION
Jimmy Choo plans to renovate 10 to 15 existing stores each year  
in the New Store Concept. This renovation programme is weighted 
towards the USA and Europe. The initial results are very positive and 
indicate that renovated stores in the New Store Concept outperform 
existing stores by a noticeable margin. During 2015, we refitted a  
total of 15 stores, with 30% of our portfolio in the new format at  
the year end.
FLAGSHIP PROGRAMME
Our planned ten flagship stores are designed to be a more full 
expression of the Jimmy Choo brand in key locations. The New Bond 
Street, Sloane Street, Beverly Hills and Harbour City Hong Kong 
flagship stores are already open with flagship stores planned for New 
York, Milan, Paris, Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing. The programme is 
expected to be completed by the end of 2017. The creation of these 
flagships will not entail increasing our number of DOS in any city, as 
it will be achieved by conversion and expansion of space in some 
existing stores and relocation to expanded space in other locations.

AGAINST A CHALLENGING BACKDROP

NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT
17
2015 was a challenging year for the luxury market, with a slowdown 
in key markets such as Russia and China, as well as currency-led 
fluctuations in shopping patterns experienced in Asia and the USA, 
with the impact also felt in Europe and the UK. Jimmy Choo 
continued to outperform the market even if total growth softened 
from 2014. Revenue during the period increased 7.2% at constant 
currency driven by continued and consistent growth (notably in Asia 
and Japan), new store openings and the ongoing expansion of the 
retail and wholesale channels.
HISTORY & STRENGTHS
Jimmy Choo is a 21st century accessories brand with shoes at its 
heart, with a focus on glamour, style authority, craftsmanship, luxury 
positioning and a distinctive iconic brand, now celebrating its 20th 
anniversary.
Jimmy Choo’s journey started in 1996 from an entrepreneurial 
start-up partnership, where a combination of the shoes of Mr. Jimmy 
Choo, OBE and the drive and inspiration of Tamara Mellon, OBE, 
created a luxury footwear phenomenon. They opened the first store 
in 1996, in Motcomb Street in London SW1 and sold 3,000 pairs of 
the first ready-to-wear shoe collection, with Mr. Jimmy Choo’s niece, 
Sandra Choi, serving as the Company’s Creative Director, a role she 
still holds today.
In 1998, Jimmy Choo opened its first boutique in New York City, 
followed by Los Angeles. Jimmy Choo became an innovator in 
Hollywood, being the first accessory brand to offer award nominees 
and presenters customised shoes for their red carpet appearances. 
The brand’s presence on the red carpet helped to create a global 
following and to make it a favoured brand among celebrities, 
supermodels and royalty.
Throughout its history, Jimmy Choo has been identified by the media 
as a key element of the fashion vibe, with prominence in films and 
television such as “Sex and the City” in 1999, “The Devil Wears 
Prada” in 2006 and the Korean show “My Love from the Star” in 
2013. More recently at the 2015 Oscars, Anna Kendrick and Neil 
Patrick Harris lyricised in the opening number about Jimmy Choo  
and the brand also featured in other productions including “Empire”, 
the television series. We also enjoyed a very high profile success 
following the involvement of Sandra Choi in the design of the Jimmy 
Choo take on the Cinderella shoe. The shoe was famously worn by 
Lily James to the film’s première in Berlin and subsequently featured 
in selected locations around the world, attracting orders for many 
hundreds of pairs.
There has been a sustained period of strong retail expansion 
supported by private equity ownership. In 2011, when JAB Luxury 
GmbH (“JAB Luxury”) acquired Jimmy Choo, we had a vision of 
a long-term continued growth strategy built upon the amazing 
brand and people in the business, underpinned by significant new 
investment in systems and processes.
JAB Luxury recognised Jimmy Choo as a world class brand, 
operating in an attractive market, with a strong design, 
merchandising, production and distribution platform, supported 
by a 360° communication programme.

WOMEN’S SHOES  
THE MAIN DRIVER OF  
REVENUE GROWTH JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT
18
Luxury shoes are a highly complex category, with a range of functions 
(including pumps, boots, sandals, wedges and sneakers) each at 
various heel heights, each in a number of colours and materials and 
each in a range of sizes. This complexity means that in order to grow 
beyond a certain point, systems and processes need to be 
sophisticated and scalable, which requires significant investment 
behind the scenes. Taking Jimmy Choo out of private equity hands in 
2011 provided the environment for that core investment to commence.
As a result of that investment, the business is now scaled for growth 
and set to drive operating leverage to generate significant profit 
growth over the medium-term. We are well positioned to improve 
client service through our forthcoming Omnichannel and Customer 
Relationship Management (“CRM”) projects and to capitalise on 
recent successful infrastructure investments in SAP and the Swiss 
warehouse, which we would expect to drive inventory efficiency, 
thereby reducing markdowns and increasing cash flow.
OVERVIEW OF RESULTS
We are pleased with another year of above market performance 
of the business in 2015. Revenue increased by 7.2% on a constant 
currency basis and 6.1% on a reported basis. Our well invested 
business demonstrated its operational gearing potential with 
indirect costs falling from 12.6% to 12.4% of revenue despite costs 
associated with public company status, while Adjusted EBITDA grew 
to £51.0m. Our store development and transformation programmes 
led to an expected increase in depreciation charges and this led to 
Adjusted EBIT of £33.2m, compared with £35.4m in 2014. Adjusted 
Consolidated Net Income was reported at £19.0m (2014: £22.9m), 
with an improved level of financing costs offset by foreign exchange 
losses on translation. On a total reported basis, Jimmy Choo reported 
Consolidated Net Income of £19.4m, compared to a loss in 2014 
of £10.8m.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (“AGM”)
Consistent with our digital strategy and positioning, we have decided 
to make our AGM electronic this year. We believe that this offers 
vastly improved accessibility to all of our shareholders as well as 
permitting them to vote securely and confidentially in advance, by 
proxy or at the meeting itself. This is consistent with the themes of 
a strong digital approach and innovation for which this business and 
brand is well known.

BOARD COMPOSITION
During the year Bart Becht left the Board, given his continuing 
commitments at Coty Inc.. We value the contribution made by 
Mr. Becht. We also welcomed three new Directors, Anna-Lena 
Kamenetzky, Meribeth Parker and Elisabeth Murdoch to the Board. 
All of our new Directors complement our international Board of 
Directors, which has extensive experience of running public 
companies in a global environment, with experience in luxury goods, 
retail, media, technology and consumer goods.
We believe that by using this wealth of experience to help monitor 
and guide the path of the management of the Company, we will 
ensure that the growth Jimmy Choo has produced to date will 
continue for the foreseeable future. Please see pages 48 to 51 for

GOVERNANCE
We believe that good corporate governance is the key to good 
businesses continuing to grow profitably for the long-term.
The Board is mindful of the need to continue to protect and promote 
the interests of the Company’s minority investors. The Board 
believes that the Board and its Committees, with the addition of 
the new independent Non-Executive Directors Meribeth Parker and 
Elisabeth Murdoch, will provide the appropriate corporate governance 
balance in light of the interests of both the majority shareholder 
and the minority shareholders. All members of the Audit and Risk 
Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors and the 
Conflicts Committee assists in the management of the relationship 
between the Company and its majority shareholder. Further details 
of these measures are contained within this report.
OUTLOOK
We continue to pursue our overall growth strategy of focusing on 
the design of high quality collections which resonate with our clients 
and of growing the retail business through like-for-like growth and 
opening additional stores with a focus on Asia ex-Japan and Japan.
We are rolling out 10 to 15 new DOS per annum, with a focus on 
China and renovating 10 to 15 of our existing portfolio of DOS in the 
New Store Concept each year. We have continued to see good 
growth in both Asia ex-Japan and Japan, while Europe grew (despite 
disruption caused by geopolitical events towards the end of the year) 
as a result of the growth in Chinese tourism, offset by the loss of 
Russian clients. We continue to see outperformance by stores in the 
New Store Concept.
We remain focused on executing our growth strategy and pursuing 
growth without compromising our brand or its luxury position, 
despite the challenging macro-economic environment and the 
difficulties currently faced by the luxury industry. We remain 
confident in our ability to grow faster than the market. Our 
business in Asia ex-Japan (where we are underpenetrated) and Japan 
is growing well and we have significant opportunities to maintain this 
outperformance in the years ahead. 2016 will see the progressive 
implementation of our Omnichannel platform in the USA and Europe 
for our retail and online network. Our collections continue to be very 
well received with Men’s being notably successful. At the same time, 
continuous operating efficiencies and the dynamism and flexibility 
of our teams will allow us to drive margin expansion and a reduction 
in leverage.
I would like to thank Pierre and his highly talented teams for their 
commitment and diligent hard work during the year.

STRATEGIC REPORT
21
Jimmy Choo has a strong position in the luxury shoe market, being 
one of a very small number of luxury shoe specialist brands with the  
requisite scale to compete globally.
DEDICATED AND EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM
The Group is run by a passionate and dedicated Senior Management 
team with a degree of focus on execution which we believe can only 
be achieved by a pure play luxury goods company.
The Senior Management team is highly experienced, with a long and 
successful history of working in the luxury goods sector. The team is 
led by Pierre Denis, CEO, who joined Jimmy Choo in 2012 with more 
than 25 years of experience in the luxury industry and a deep 
knowledge of Asian markets.
LEADING DESIGN TEAM THAT DRIVES PRODUCT AUTHORITY
Jimmy Choo’s design team of 15 is led by Sandra Choi, who has 
been Creative Director for the brand since its inception. Jimmy 
Choo’s design team has a proven track record of developing Sandra’s 
conceptual visions into beautiful products multiple times each year 
through a structured process encompassing line plans, designs, 
prototypes, edits and pre-launch samples.
Jimmy Choo’s design team is at the forefront of the industry in terms 
of its ability to interpret fashion trends. This provides clients with a 
very broad product range that addresses all categories and functions 
of the luxury shoe offering, including evening, day, catwalk and boots 
and the full spectrum of client tastes.
MERCHANDISING EXCELLENCE
Jimmy Choo’s merchandising model is designed to nourish the brand 
through innovation and to drive footfall through the timely delivery 
of fashion-forward products, underpinned by a continuative core of 
iconic products which are continuously reviewed and refreshed. 
The product calendar is managed in order to create a structured 
flow of new products into our DOS and multibrand networks which 
drives editorial focus, footfall and conversion into sales. The 
calendar is based around multiple collection drops each year,  
with the continuative core Choo 24:7 collection complementing 
the seasonal offerings.
Designing successful collections and managing the complexity 
of multiple collection drops each year relies upon the seamless 
interaction, integration and cooperation between Jimmy Choo’s 
merchandising, design, supply chain, brand communication and 
distribution teams. The success of this collaboration is shown in 
Jimmy Choo’s track record of offering a considerable depth and 
breadth in its collections, across multiple functions, heel heights, 
materials, sizes and colours. We have also been able to leverage our 
expertise to replicate this model across our Accessories offering.
BESPOKE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR PRODUCT EXCELLENCE
Jimmy Choo operates a lean and flexible supply chain, outsourcing 
production and logistics to gain flexibility and speed in bringing 
products to market. Those elements which protect the brand are 
owned and managed by Jimmy Choo, including vendor liaison, 
engineering assurance and product development which are managed 
through Studio Luxury S.r.l.. Jimmy Choo produces well over one 
million units per annum in its supply chain. Materials research and 
sourcing, product development, engineering, production planning 
and control, quality assurance, as well as customer service and after 
sales are all controlled by Jimmy Choo.
In order to produce luxury shoes with a high quality finish, Jimmy 
Choo partners with suppliers with the specific skill sets to match 
each particular shoe style. Accordingly, Jimmy Choo’s products are 
produced by specialists in the Florence and Veneto regions of Italy, 
with the exception of espadrilles which are made in Spain. In addition 
to providing specialist skills, this multi-supplier strategy provides 
scalability, flexibility and speed to market, as well as diversifying risk. 
This model enables the Group to drive gross margin improvement 
through early deliveries of new collections and inventory control, 
resulting in lower markdowns.

STRATEGIC REPORT

Jimmy Choo’s online infrastructure was relaunched in November 
2013, with a new, flexible and powerful platform to enable the roll out 
of online sites in new countries, while retaining a core backbone to 
deliver excellent customer service. In August 2015, this was further 
upgraded to a fully responsive site to leverage the growing proportion 
of mobile use (mobile telephone and tablet) which paves the way for 
the progressive Omnichannel roll out starting in 2016. The Jimmy 
Choo online store represents Jimmy Choo’s largest single DOS 
within the retail segment.
More importantly, our online presence provides a powerful route to 
engage with new potential clients and for clients to begin a purchase 
process which may be completed in one of Jimmy Choo’s boutiques. 
As Jimmy Choo invests in supply chain infrastructure to move 
towards an integrated Omnichannel model, we will increase the 
integration of the online platform with the retail channel.
We are already starting to see the benefit of the investment in our 
systems and logistics. During 2015, we moved to a new central 
Swiss warehouse and implemented SAP. We are largely past the 
transition period and are now starting to leverage this investment 
so that we can enhance product availability and improve inventory 
management. We see this as being largely a product of our 
Omnichannel initiative, which is a key leverage project for the 
investments we have made. This leaves just one region for SAP 
implementation in 2016 at which point our SAP landscape will 
be complete.
360° COMMUNICATION STRATEGY FUELS THE BRAND
Jimmy Choo’s status as a globally recognised luxury brand is 
a result of our entrepreneurial and dynamic approach to brand 
communication. The Group applies an all-encompassing brand 
communication strategy which includes celebrity placement, editorial 
and digital influencer engagement, product advertising (in both digital 
and print media), launch events and store layout and display.
We adopt this approach for all our new product launches and our 
success has resulted in Jimmy Choo currently being the top ranked 
brand globally in editorial for luxury women’s shoes. At the end of 
December 2015, we enjoyed a very strong social media following, 
including over 11m YouTube views during the year and now with a 
total of 3m Instagram followers, which are our two fastest growing 
channels. We have continued to enjoy global recognition for our high 
profile product placements, most notably at the Oscars when Anna 
Kendrick and Neil Patrick Harris lyricised in the opening number 
about Jimmy Choo, as well as in other productions such as “Empire”, 
the television series. This builds upon the proven success and 
penetration of the brand and key products in “Sex and the City” 
in 1999 and more recently in the Korean series “My Love from the 
Star” which has elevated the brand significantly throughout Asia.
We also enjoyed a very high profile success following the 
involvement of Sandra Choi in the design of the Jimmy Choo take on 
the Cinderella shoe. The shoe was famously worn by Lily James to 
the film’s première in Berlin and subsequently featured in selected 
locations around the world, attracting orders for many hundreds  
of pairs.

After increasing significantly until 2013, Jimmy Choo’s brand 
communication spend has now settled at an appropriate level, being 
4.7% of revenue in 2014 and 4.9% in 2015. This level of spend has 
allowed us to retain our position alongside our larger luxury brand 
peers. This is a level of spend as a proportion of revenue which is 
within appropriate parameters for a leading luxury shoe brand.
MULTICHANNEL DISTRIBUTION MODEL
Jimmy Choo has successful and effective distribution networks 
with significant opportunity for expansion. In addition, Jimmy Choo 
benefits from having a balanced multichannel distribution network 
with our retail DOS network at the core. 
Jimmy Choo has a particularly strong presence in EMEA, USA 
and Japan, with a growing footprint in the rest of Asia. The Group 
has experienced strong growth in recent years across all of these 
markets. 2015 has seen the continued transformation of our DOS 
network with the opening of 13 new DOS, conversion of three 
franchise stores in Singapore and Malaysia into DOS, the roll out of 
our New Store Concept and the ongoing comprehensive renovation 
programme of our existing portfolio. By the end of 2015, we had 141 
DOS, of which 30% are now in the New Store Concept. See page 15 
for the progress we have made in our retail network.
As part of our DOS strategy, the Group continues to invest 
significantly in its online platform, which has experienced strong 
revenue growth in recent years. This year was no exception with the 
introduction of the new responsive website in August 2015, designed 
to capitalise on the growing trend of shopping on mobile devices. 
This investment, together with the broader investment in the supply 
chain, is expected to lead to the progressive roll out of our 
Omnichannel client offering starting later in 2016.
The Group continues to benefit from our strong multibrand 
distribution offering, which provides attractive economics and acts 
as a lead indicator of collection success and as a benchmark against 
competitors. The Group’s franchise channel acts as an important 
entry model into new markets. These serve as a potential 
springboard to expanding the DOS network once the new region has 
become established, exemplified during the year by the conversion 
of three franchise stores to DOS in Singapore and Malaysia.

OUR MARKET
A CHALLENGING YEAR FOR  
THE LUXURY MARKET
LUXURY SHOE SPECIALIST BRANDS CONTINUE  
TO OUTPERFORM THE MARKET
THE LUXURY MARKET IN 2015
2015 was a challenging year for the luxury industry and the impact 
of foreign currency was an important theme, as the volatility in 
exchange rates affected the whole market and affected our regional 
shopping patterns. This coincided with an increased level of 
competition in the sector and a slowdown in growth in luxury overall. 
LUXURY SHOE MARKET GROWTH
Luxury shoes continue to be a fast growing segment of the luxury 
market with an estimated sales compound growth rate from 2011 
to 2014 of 7%, compared to the luxury market excluding shoes 
which had a compound growth rate of 5% over the same period.
We believe that the strong historical growth experienced in the 
luxury shoe market is a result of a number of factors.
OPTIMAL GATEWAY
Shoes are available at a psychologically accessible price. This makes 
them an optimal gateway into the luxury market, compared to many 
other luxury goods.
ACCESSORIES ARE KEY
Over recent years, consumers have been buying ready-to-wear 
apparel from high street retailers and then upgrading their wardrobe 
with luxury shoes, bags and other accessories.
FOCUS OF RETAILERS ON LUXURY SHOES
Luxury brands and multibrand retailers have both increased their 
focus on shoes in recent years and as a consequence, many 
department stores have considerably expanded their shoe floors.
INCREASING PARTICIPATION OF MEN IN LUXURY
Men continue to become more hedonistic and opinionated on fashion 
matters and over recent years, there has been an increasing trend 
for male clients to purchase luxury fashion goods for themselves. 
We believe that the male segments of the luxury goods market, in 
particular luxury shoes, remain underrepresented by leading luxury 
brands. Luxury fashion companies are beginning to address this 
opportunity, with some market participants launching men only 
stores as well as expanding their product offering for men, 
including shoes.
LUXURY SHOE SPECIALIST BRANDS
Luxury shoes have outperformed the general luxury market in  
recent years. Luxury shoe specialist brands have outperformed the 
luxury shoe market. We believe that luxury shoe specialist brands 
experienced compound revenue growth from 2011 to 2014 of 10% 
compared to 7% for the luxury shoe market as a whole. Jimmy Choo 
has continued to grow ahead of the market.
The luxury shoe business is very complex, with a variety of sizes, 
heel heights, materials and colours. Successfully mastering this 
complexity requires a constant and dedicated focus. We believe 
luxury shoe specialist brands, like Jimmy Choo, are strongly 
positioned to offer this.
As a result of the fragmented nature of the market, there remains 
significant scope for luxury shoe specialist brands, like Jimmy Choo, 
to continue outperforming the luxury shoe market as a whole.
LUXURY SHOE MARKET RESILIENCE
We believe that the luxury shoe market is one of the more resilient 
segments of the luxury goods market. During the global financial 
crisis of 2008 and 2009, luxury shoe sales decreased by 4%, 
compared to a total market decrease of 8%. Over this same period, 
Jimmy Choo’s revenue increased by 2%.

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
LONGER TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT
Our goal is to pursue growth without compromising the Jimmy Choo 
brand. This is achieved by successful product collections driving 
positive LFL sales, opening new DOS and expansion in Asia and 
selected new markets. 
Shoes are at the heart of Jimmy Choo and will remain the core 
offering. Shoes represent just over three quarters of revenue, which 
we do not expect to change substantially. Jimmy Choo is a specialist 
luxury shoe company focused on growing our relationship with our 
customers and clients. Growth will always be pursued within the 
context of protecting the Jimmy Choo brand identity and luxury 
positioning. We believe that Jimmy Choo’s unique brand DNA and 
experienced design team will enable us to continue to deliver 
collections that resonate strongly with our clients.
We aim to deliver earnings growth and returns through focusing on 
growth ahead of the market and margin expansion, together with 
good cash flow conversion.
REVENUE GROWTH
Revenue growth is supported by the store opening programme, 
through which the Group plans to open 10 to 15 new DOS each year, 
as well as the roll out of the recently introduced New Store Concept 
across the estate. In addition to our DOS expansion plans, we intend 
to pursue growth through our multibrand, franchise and JV channels. 
All of these are important for Jimmy Choo’s business model as they 
provide access to new markets.
Our aim is to grow towards a regional mix more in line with the wider 
luxury market through growth in Asia and selected new markets, 
while maintaining our presence in EMEA and the Americas. Jimmy 
Choo’s revenue growth strategy is focused around the following 
key pillars:
• Market outperformance: we believe that Jimmy Choo’s client 
insight, design approach and systems which we have developed 
as a specialist will enable us to outperform the wider luxury 
market. Jimmy Choo has the right specialist resource, knowhow, 
skills and people to excel in this attractive and complex category.
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the 
Company in line with its long-term business planning cycle. The 
long-term planning cycle is a Strategic Planning Process and includes 
a detailed financial forecast for revenue, cost, profit measures, 
working capital requirements, cash flow, capital investment 
requirements and the level of available capital resources. The Board 
believes that a three year planning horizon is an appropriate time 
horizon for the business based on the type of investments that the 
business typically undertakes.
As part of the Strategic Planning Process, the Strategic Plan and 
the financial forecast are reviewed annually by the Board and this 
review includes:
• A review of planning assumptions used in the financial plan, 
tested against historic trends and future market expectations. 
• Challenging the Strategic Plan and the output from the 
financial projections.
• A review of financing, investment and capital requirements 
over the planning period and the business’s ability to make 
investments within the constraints of financing available.
• LFL growth: through continued performance of our collections 
and investment in our DOS network, with selected openings, 
relocations and New Store Concept renovations in Jimmy Choo’s 
existing developed markets of Europe, USA and Japan.
• Retail led growth driven by:
 – Door growth opportunity: expansion of DOS in Greater China, 
where Jimmy Choo is currently underpenetrated compared to 
our peers and potential franchise buyouts and JVs in fast 
growing markets, including the Middle East and South Korea.  
It is expected that around half of Jimmy Choo’s DOS 
development will be in China each year.
 – Online: the Group will continue our investment in online which 
has proved to be one of the key elements of growth in the 
current environment. Recent investments into the supply chain 
and systems upgrades are expected to position the Group to 
capitalise on the growth of the global online trend and provide 
an Omnichannel distribution offering in the medium-term, 
starting progressively in the USA and Europe.
• Wholesale entry: exploration of potential franchise opportunities 
in new markets where Jimmy Choo currently has a limited 
presence, particularly in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Travel 
Retail, alongside continued development of our existing business.
MARGIN EXPANSION
The business is now scaled for growth. Our expectation is that the 
revenue growth initiatives described above, together with increased 
control over distribution, should drive gross margin improvement in 
the business. Direct costs will grow broadly in line with retail revenue 
and indirect costs will grow slower than overall revenue. The new 
systems and logistics investment will help the management team 
to improve inventory efficiency, thereby reducing markdowns and 
increasing cash flow. In 2015, margin expansion was hindered by 
headwinds in market growth and macro-economic conditions; 
however we have taken steps on our cost base to create the 
conditions for margin expansion to resume in 2016.
• The ability for the Company to operate within its current and 
expected financing covenants.
• The Group’s ability to raise external finance based on projected 
business requirements.
In developing the financial forecast, the Directors have also 
considered the principal risks to which the Group is exposed, as set 
out on pages 42 to 44, including strategic, operational, financial and 
reputational risks. These risks are subject to oversight at both the 
Audit and Risk Committee in regard to financial control risk and at the 
Board in respect of enterprise risks. These risks, offset by possible 
mitigating scenarios, were considered in order to stress test the 
Strategic Plan and the detailed financial forecast.
Based on the analysis described above, the Directors have concluded 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and to meet its liabilities as they fall due for 
the period until 31 December 2018. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
JIMMY CHOO OUTPERFORMED  
THE MARKET AGAIN IN 2015 WITH  
ANOTHER RECORD FOR  
REVENUE
PIERRE DENIS
CEO JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT
31
Despite a difficult year for markets in 2015, Jimmy Choo enjoyed 
further progress with another record for revenue driven by continued 
and consistent growth from our well-invested platform.
The impact of foreign currency was an important theme this year 
as the volatility in exchange rates affected the whole market and 
affected our regional shopping patterns. This coincided with an 
increased level of competition in the sector and a slowdown in 
growth in luxury overall. Our collections have performed well and 
our brand has extended its reach and I am pleased to report that 
Jimmy Choo has continued to grow ahead of the market.
Growth was led by Asia ex-Japan and Japan, where our brand 
awareness continues to increase strongly, benefitting from our 
ongoing store development programme and the continued expansion 
of the retail and wholesale channels. In Europe, our growth 
benefitted from increased tourism, although this was in spite of 
fewer Russian visitors and the impact of geopolitical events towards 
the end of the year. Our USA business made progress in a market 
distorted by both foreign exchange fluctuations (affecting buying 
behaviour) and competitive pressures.
Our revenue grew 7.2% at constant currency (6.1% at reported rates) 
with retail revenue up 8.7% at constant currency (7.7% at reported 
rates) with 1.1% LFL. We successfully reversed the decline on first 
half wholesale revenue, delivering 1.3% constant currency growth 
over the year. Adjusted EBITDA increased slightly above last year to 
£51.0m, as higher margins on revenue growth were offset by brand 
communication investment and higher indirect costs driven by our 
continued investment in our store opening and renovation 
programmes. Adjusted EBIT of £33.2m (2014: £35.4m) was lower 
than last year as a result of higher depreciation charges due to our 
continued capital investment in store openings, store renovation and 
replatforming in 2014 and 2015. Adjusted Consolidated Net Income 
of £19.0m was below 2014 despite improved financing costs, whilst 
our reported Consolidated Net Income of £19.4m compares 
favourably with a loss of £10.8m last year.
PRODUC TS
Our focus on shoes and our dedication to product quality ensures 
that we continue to create innovative products which resonate 
strongly with our clients around the world.
As a luxury accessories brand, design and quality is at the heart 
of Jimmy Choo. The products that we design and create are an 
expression of our DNA and enrich the brand. Our teams work hard 
to deliver products of the highest quality and innovation. From a 
design perspective, 2015 was a successful year. Our Creative 
Director Sandra Choi and her team have seen their designs warmly 
received by clients and critics – a key factor in the growing global 
appeal of our brand.
The main driver of revenue growth in 2015 was shoes, which 
continue to be at the heart of the brand, representing over three 
quarters of the business. Accessories volumes remained stable, 
with a trend towards smaller bags. We have also seen excellent 
growth in the Men’s business, now 7% of revenue, where we have 
increased the number of dual gender stores in the year. During 2015 
we also launched the ‘Illicit‘ fragrance and this along with the 
continued roll out of the ‘Jimmy Choo Man’ fragrance contributed to 
strong growth in Licence income. We also made excellent progress 
in both Sunglasses and Eyewear.
CHOO 24:7
The iconic Choo 24:7 collection, which forms the Jimmy Choo 
woman’s perfect wardrobe of shoes, underpins our business, 
representing around half of our shoe sales. The balance between 
our continuative icons and seasonal collections is one of the key 
elements of our merchandising strategy. We introduce new 
colours and fabrics in our iconic shoe styles in line with the seasonal 
collections, which maintains the cohesion of our seasonal look 
and feel and introduces newness into the continuative collection.
MADE TO ORDER
In order to enhance the luxury positioning of the brand and create a 
more bespoke offering for our clients, we launched Made to Order 
shoes during 2014. Clients can have a pair of shoes made, choosing 
from a range of designs and heel heights, fabric colours or materials 
and personalise them with their initials on the sole. Made to Order is 
now available across the retail website and is widely appreciated by 
our clients with a much increased level of business in 2015.
CINDERELL A
One of the best examples of our Made to Order business was the 
Cinderella shoe. We enjoyed a very high profile success following the 
involvement of Sandra Choi in the design of the Jimmy Choo take on 
the Cinderella shoe. This shoe was famously worn by Lily James to 
the film’s première in Berlin and subsequently featured in selected 
locations around the world, attracting orders for many hundreds 
of pairs.
“I think every girl desires a Cinderella moment in their lives. This 
story ignites a love affair and fascination with shoes that never 
dies. The power they have to transform is instilled from a young 
age and the fantasy remains alive forever. I wanted to create a 
shoe that felt magical, with alluring sparkle and a feminine, 
timeless silhouette evoking those childhood emotions.”
SANDRA CHOI, CREATIVE DIRECTOR JIMMY CHOO
COLL ABOR ATIONS
Jimmy Choo has long since believed in collaborations with other 
iconic footwear brands. In June 2015, Jimmy Choo announced a 
limited edition collaboration with Moon Boot
®
, the Italian iconic 
winter boots brand, which took the Moon Boot
®
 construction and 
translated it into a range of sophisticated, ultra glamourous designs 
synonymous with the Jimmy Choo name.
“I’ve always loved the futuristic, yet retro-cool Italian design of 
Moon Boot 
®
 and am delighted to create a Jimmy Choo signature 
look befitting the style.”

Jimmy Choo also has a long history of collaborations with artists 
to create capsule collections. In May 2015, we launched the Choo 
Hound collection which incorporated Brazilian artist Rafael 
Mantesso’s drawings of his English Bull Terrier called Jimmy Choo, 
in the form of a series of illustrations commissioned by our Creative 
Director Sandra Choi to decorate a selection of Jimmy Choo 
accessories.
“All of a sudden, I had friends from all over the world forwarding 
me links to Rafael’s enchanting work featuring his lovable English 
Bull Terrier, Jimmy Choo. I was instantly charmed by the way he 
animated his captivating dog into his artwork. His work is so 
playful, clever and witty and we struck up an immediate 
friendship online. I just knew that I had to incorporate his work 
into a collection.”
SANDRA CHOI, CREATIVE DIRECTOR JIMMY CHOO
MEN’S
Men’s as a category has continued to make excellent progress, 
remaining our fastest growing category. Men’s now accounts for 
around 7% of revenue. The roll out of the Men’s fragrances continues 
to demonstrate the appeal of the brand image in the rapidly 
expanding men’s luxury space.
DIGITAL
Jimmy Choo remains the top ranked brand globally in editorial for 
luxury women’s shoes. At the end of 2015 we enjoyed a very strong 
social media following, including over 11m YouTube views during the 
year and now with a total of 3m Instagram followers, which are our 
two fastest growing channels.
As part of our DOS strategy we have continued to invest significantly 
in our online platform, which has seen strong revenue growth in 
recent years. We introduced our new responsive website in August 
2015, designed to capitalise on the growing trend of shopping on 
mobile devices.
NEW STORE CONCEPT
We continued to drive our retail channel expansion, with 13 new DOS 
opening in the period and a further three converted from franchise 
stores in Singapore and Malaysia, giving a total DOS portfolio of 141 
at the end of 2015. The focus of our retail expansion continues in 
Asia, where we remain underpenetrated relative to our luxury peers.
Our new concept continues to outperform and we refitted a total 
of 15 stores in the year, with 30% of our portfolio now in the new 
format at the year end.
Our planned ten flagship stores are designed to be a more full 
expression of the Jimmy Choo brand in key locations. The New Bond 
Street, Sloane Street, Beverly Hills and Harbour City Hong Kong 
flagship stores are already open. Future flagship stores are planned 
for New York, Milan, Paris, Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing, with the 
programme complete by the end of 2017.
Our development programme continues unchanged with around 10 
to 15 new DOS per annum going forward and a further 10 to 15 DOS 
expected to be renovated each year.
ASIA – A CONTINUING GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
Our highly focused strategy in Asia has been successful, with the 
region continuing to lead the way. Asia ex-Japan grew by 20.1% on a 
constant currency basis, driven by continued new store openings in 
China and the conversion of three franchise doors to DOS in 
Singapore and Malaysia, together with the opening of a new flagship 
store in Harbour City Hong Kong.
We remain underpenetrated relative to the wider luxury market. Our 
brand awareness continues to grow strongly in both Asia ex-Japan 
and Japan. We have significant opportunities to maintain this 
outperformance in the years ahead through our collections and 
through the development of our channels, such as Travel Retail, 
where we have only limited penetration today.
INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES
Following investment in 2014 in SAP and in the website, during 2015 
we continued with our transformation programme, with further SAP 
roll out and a successful move into our central global distribution 
centre in Switzerland. SAP implementation will take place in Japan 
during 2016 as well as the progressive launch of Omnichannel during 
the second semester, which is a key leverage project for the 
investments we have already made. We are already starting to see 
the benefit of the investment in our systems and logistics. We are 
now largely past the transition period and are starting to leverage the 
investment so that we can enhance product availability, improve

I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their contribution to 
this year’s strong results and to our shareholders for their support. 
I would especially like to thank our employees across the business 
for their continued hard work during this transformational year against 
a very challenging market backdrop.

Our overall revenue increased by 7.2% on a constant currency 
basis (6.1% on a reported basis), with continued growth across all 
segments. Retail continues to be the growth engine of the business, 
growing ahead of wholesale, in line with our previously stated 
strategic aim of retail led growth. Retail sales in 2015 represented 
65.3% of revenue. Other, which primarily relates to licensed income 
from Fragrance and Eyewear, also performed strongly, growing 
to 3.3% of total revenue. Revenue was significantly affected by 
currency volatility in 2015, with EMEA impacted by the weakening 
of the Euro and the Americas affected by the strengthening of the 
Dollar, causing significant fluctuations in reported sales both in 
terms of value and its impact on client shopping patterns.
In 2015, retail revenue grew by 8.7% on a constant currency basis 
to £207.7m as a result of the addition of a net 16 new DOS and LFL 
sales 1.1% ahead. Reported revenue was 7.7% ahead of last year. 
LFL sales continue to be positively impacted by the roll out of the 
New Store Concept, with stores which have been refitted with the 
new concept continuing to outperform stores in the existing format. 
During 2015, a further 15 stores were refitted, bringing the total 
stores trading in the New Store Concept at the year end to 30% 
of the DOS estate.
Our wholesale business grew by 1.3% on a constant currency basis 
during 2015. We continued to see organic growth within existing 
key wholesale accounts as well as the opening of a further three 
franchise stores, net of the transfer of Singapore and Malaysia and 
expansion of our wholesale network in EMEA, Asia ex-Japan and 
the Americas.

Asia ex-Japan 42.2 34.8 21 .2% 20.1%
Total 317 .9 299.7 6.1% 7 .2%
Asia continues to be the source of our strongest growth. Asia 
ex-Japan grew by 20.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 
continued new store openings in China and the conversion of three 
franchise doors to DOS in Singapore and Malaysia, together with 
the opening of a new flagship store in Harbour City Hong Kong. 
In Japan, our business grew by 29.0% on a constant currency 
basis driven by strong organic growth and the impact of the store 
development programme, as well as an influx of visitors from the 
Chinese mainland.
In EMEA, sales benefitted from a weaker Euro which aided strong 
growth in international clients, including Chinese clients. This was 
in part offset by the loss of Russian visitors and more recently the 
impact of geopolitical events. Sales in the region were 4.9% ahead 
of last year on a constant currency basis. Sales in the Americas 
region benefitted from the growth in Latin America. We made 
good progress in the USA despite a market distorted by both foreign 
exchange fluctuations (affecting buying behaviour) and competitive 
pressures. Sales in the Americas region were 0.7% below last year 
on a constant currency basis.
Other revenue was dominated by a very successful year in Licensing, 
which saw the full year impact of the launch of ‘Jimmy Choo Man’, 
our first Men’s fragrance launched in the second half of 2014, as 
well as the launch in August 2015 of ‘Illicit’, our third Women’s 
fragrance. Both have been very well received from launch and 
outstripped expectations consistently. Sunglasses and Eyewear 
also performed well.
At a category level, growth was led by shoes which represent over 
three quarters of the business. Men’s continues to remain our fastest 
growing category and now accounts for 7% of revenue.
GROSS MARGIN
In 2015, our gross margin continued to benefit from the favourable 
channel mix shift towards retail, volume growth and the impact of the 
weakening Euro reducing production costs. At the same time, we 
have upweighted our participation in Men’s and also in the fashion 
component of our collections which has partially offset the margin 
improvement, along with higher transportation costs during the 
transition to the normal operation of our Swiss warehouse. As a 
result, gross margin at 62.7% improved by 0.9ppts against a 2014 
gross margin of 61.8%.
COSTS
Total costs charged in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA increased by 9.7% 
in 2015, compared to 6.1% growth in total revenue in the same period.
Selling and distribution expenses increased by £10.1m (12.1%) in 
2015, reflecting the impact of the store development programme, 
including the opening of 13 new DOS, the conversion of our franchise 
stores in Singapore and Malaysia and the renovation of 15 DOS in the 
same period. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT
36
We continued to invest in brand communication during the year, 
with an investment of £15.5m or 4.9% of revenue, up by 9.8% 
against 2014. Our media presence continued to grow and we were 
again ranked as number one in global editorial ranking for luxury 
shoes. We were also ranked again as “Gifted” for our digital 
presence by the digital agency L2, with our social presence again 
being rated “Genius”.
Overheads for 2015 were £39.6m, which was 4.5% ahead of last year, 
while on an underlying basis (excluding the full year effect of costs 
associated with listed company status) overheads fell by 3.1%. This 
was in line with our target of cost increases below revenue growth 
and was achieved through continued tight cost control and process 
efficiency improvements following the completion of the 
implementation of SAP in the Head Office and in EMEA in 2015.  
As a result of the recent investments in systems infrastructure and 
replatforming, we expect that future overhead cost growth will be 
below revenue growth.
Exceptional costs of £2.4m (2014: £13.0m) were incurred during the 
year and were largely related to the majority of the remaining costs 
associated with the replatforming of the business.
PROFITS AND EARNINGS
In 2015, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.5% compared to the prior year, 
with the Adjusted EBITDA margin declining slightly to 16.0% from 
16.8%. This decline was due to gross margin gains and lower 
overhead growth offset by the full year effect of costs associated 
with listed company status, the impact of the store development 
programme and brand communication investment during the year. 
Depreciation and amortisation reflected the continued investment 
in new stores, the roll out of the New Store Concept and the 
replatforming of business systems in 2015 and grew from £14.9m 
in 2014 to £17.8m in 2015, an increase of £2.9m or 19.7%. 
Depreciation and amortisation rose from 5.0% to 5.6% of revenue, 
leading to Adjusted EBIT of £33.2m (2014: £35.4m).
Our lower external loan balances led to decreased financing charges 
of £7.7m (2014: £8.8m). This was offset by a net loss on foreign 
exchange of £0.9m (2014: net gain of £1.8m) which led to Adjusted 
EBT for the year of £24.5m (2014: £28.3m).
Adjusted Consolidated Net Income for the year was £19.0m (2014: 
£22.9m), generating Adjusted EPS of 5.0 pence in 2015 (2014: 6.1 
pence). In overall reported terms, Consolidated Net Income of 
£19.4m compares with a loss of £10.8m in 2014.

1 Adjusted Operating Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA plus/minus non-cash charges in 
respect of share-based payments, realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses on 
the revaluation of monetary items and working capital. Working capital is defined as the sum of 
changes in trade and other receivables, inventories, trade and other payables and provisions.
2 Adjusted EBITDA Cash Conversion is defined as Adjusted Operating Cash Flow (as defined 
above) divided by Adjusted EBITDA.
3 Capital Expenditure is defined as acquisition of property, plant and equipment and other 
intangible assets.
Working capital management remains a key focus in Jimmy Choo. 
As a result, we achieved a reduction in inventory and constrained 
the growth in receivables below revenue growth. Cash conversion 
improved to 96.5% of Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 from 92.2% of 
Adjusted EBITDA in 2014, largely as a result of a stronger working 
capital position in the year.
Free operating cash flow of £1.5m in 2015 increased by £5.6m 
compared to a net outflow of £(4.1)m in 2014. This was driven  
by a significant improvement in cash generated from operating 
activities and lower exceptional payments than in 2014 (which  
were IPO related).

the year, we repaid £7.5m in respect of our term loans related to the 
Capex/Acquisition facility. 
BALANCE SHEET
During the year, total assets increased by £8.9m to £767.9m at 
31 December 2015. Non-current assets increased by £8.0m to 
£655.7m as a result of continued investment in new stores and the 
refit of stores in the New Store Concept and further investment in 
the replatforming of the Group’s information systems. Current assets 
increased slightly against last year to £112.2m, with higher trade 
receivables and cash offset by inventory £3.2m lower on tighter 
stock management during the year. 
Total liabilities reduced by £13.9m to £300.9m at 31 December 2015. 
Non-current liabilities decreased by £13.7m to £185.8m as a result  
of non-current borrowings £7.6m lower than last year and lower 
deferred tax liabilities. Current liabilities reduced slightly to £115.1m 
at 31 December 2015, mainly due to trade and other payables £7.7m 
lower offset by an increase in current borrowings due of £5.2m and 
higher tax liabilities of £2.7m.

STRATEGIC REPORT
37
Jimmy Choo’s Board, Senior Management and employees recognise 
the importance of reducing our impact on the environment and 
increasing our positive social impact in the regions in which we 
operate as well as in a wider global context. Sustainability has always 
been part of our thinking and we have implemented a wide variety 
of sustainability initiatives at a local level. We are always concerned 
to make our business more sustainable and to this end we are 
continuing our work to create a global sustainability strategy and 
policy, both in terms of new initiatives as well as leveraging further 
our existing sustainability initiatives. 
CHARITABLE ACTIVITY
Jimmy Choo has a rich history of innovation, not only in design but 
in its collaborations with artists and charities. Jimmy Choo adopts 
a policy of working with local charities in markets where this is 
established practice and undertakes frequent charity events in which 
a portion of the sales are donated to a local charity. These events, 
particularly in the USA, allow Jimmy Choo to connect with the 
community and to deliver on our values of contributing to the 
communities which we serve. Total donations in 2015 to charities 
amounted to £0.2m.
THE JIMMY CHOO FOUNDATION
Corporate Social Responsibility has always been integral to Jimmy 
Choo and is embedded in our company values. To reinforce this 
commitment the Jimmy Choo Foundation was established in 2011 to 
focus upon the empowerment of women and improving their quality 
of life through education and enterprise.
There is growing recognition that the economic, moral and social 
progress is achieved by giving women the means to contribute to and 
be included in the global economy. According to the United Nations 
Development Programme there is clear evidence that bringing 
women into the economy helps to raise economic productivity, 
reduce infant mortality, contribute to improved health and increase 
the chances of education for the next generation. Simply put, 
progress is achieved through women.
The Jimmy Choo Foundation addresses the most common barriers 
faced by women in developing economies. In order to maximise our 
efforts and impact, the Jimmy Choo Foundation has partnered with 
the global organisation Care International (“Care”), in particular their 
lendwithcare initiative. Founded in 1945, Care is one of the largest 
and most established humanitarian aid organisations focused on 
fighting global poverty. Launched in 2010 and operating in more than 
11 countries, lendwithcare is Care’s groundbreaking programme 
which supports some of the world’s poorest women, enabling them 
to lift themselves out of poverty with pride and dignity. Lendwithcare 
provides female entrepreneurs with access to credit, education and 
financial tools, encouraging them along the way to develop the 
confidence that comes with building a successful enterprise.

SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS 
CONTINUED
Since 2010 lendwithcare has benefitted 20,000 women in developing 
countries through the provision of loans and business training. The 
impact of lendwithcare’s investment is multiplied by these women as 
the benefits are extended to the world around them, creating better 
lives for their families and building stronger communities. The Jimmy 
Choo Foundation, in partnership with lendwithcare, has set a goal of 
supporting more than 8,000 people in developing countries by 2019.
Whilst lendwithcare is the primary beneficiary of the Jimmy Choo 
Foundation, Jimmy Choo still actively pursues and supports 
local charities. 
Funding for the Jimmy Choo Foundation comes from corporate 
donations and fundraising initiatives coordinated by employees of 
Jimmy Choo. The Trustees are Pierre Denis, Sandra Choi, Hannah 
Merritt and Jonathan Sinclair.
ENVIRONMENT 
Jimmy Choo is strongly committed to meeting high environmental 
standards in its operations and throughout its supply chain. Jimmy 
Choo ensures that all of the sourcing of materials is done in a way 
that limits the impact on biodiversity and animal welfare. We comply 
with the Washington Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (“CITES”), which aims 
to regulate the trade of specimens of endangered animals and plants 
by monitoring their exportation, re-exportation, importation, transit, 
transhipment or possession. 
CARBON FOOTPRINT 
In 2015, Jimmy Choo had its carbon footprint independently 
measured by Deloitte LLP. This enabled Jimmy Choo to identify 
areas of risk and prioritise areas on which to focus carbon footprint 
reduction efforts. Over the next 12 months, Jimmy Choo will 
continue to build on activities which currently centre on 93 energy 
reduction initiatives already in place across its operations. In due 
course, we will establish a global energy management programme.
GREENHOUSE GAS (“GHG”) EMISSION STATEMENT
The GHG Protocol categorises GHG emissions into three broad scopes:
• Scope 1: All direct GHG emissions.
• Scope 2: Indirect emissions from consumption of purchased 
electricity, heat or steam.
• Scope 3: Other indirect emissions.
Jimmy Choo has chosen to use an intensity ratio measure based 
upon emissions per £m of revenue in order to put the GHG intensity 
in context for the size of the business.
2015
(tCO 2 e) (tCO 2 e/£M)
Scope 1
Fuel combustion 122 0.38
Scope 2
Purchased electricity 3,351 10.54
Statutory Total (Scope 1 and 2 Emissions) 3,473 10.92
In addition to the statutorily required Scope 1 and 
2 disclosure, Jimmy Choo has voluntarily analysed 
the Scope 3 emissions where it has the ability 
to influence them.
Scope 3
Upstream Scope 3 emissions 1,536 4.83
Total Emissions 5,009 15.75
Note:
tCO 2 e is an abbreviation of “tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent” and is the internationally 
recognised measure of GHG emissions.
Jimmy Choo applies an operational control approach to defining its organisational boundaries. 
Data is reported for sites where it is considered that Jimmy Choo has the ability to influence 
energy management. Data is not reported for sites where Jimmy Choo has a physical presence, 
but does not influence the energy management for those sites, such as a concession within 
a department store. 
We use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (revised edition, 2004) and ISO 14064-1 (2006) to estimate 
emissions and apply conversion factors from Defra, UK Government conversion factors for 
Company Reporting (2014). All material sources of emissions are reported.

ENERGY SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES SCHEME (“ESOS”)
The ESOS Regulations 2014 brought into force Article 8 of the EU 
Energy Efficiency Directive and mandated that all large businesses in 
the UK should undertake comprehensive assessments of energy use 
and energy efficiency opportunities at least once every four years. 
During 2015, Jimmy Choo employed Deloitte LLP as a Lead Energy 
Assessor to conduct an ESOS Assessment. Having notified the 
Environment Agency, Jimmy Choo is therefore compliant with ESOS 
Regulations 2014. We continue to seek ways to reduce our energy 
use and to improve our energy efficiency across the business.
ENGAGEMENT AND REPORTING 
We presently meet all mandatory reporting requirements and 
continue our work to enhance this disclosure.
SOCIAL 
Jimmy Choo is committed to improving working conditions for 
workers both under its direct operations and across its value chain. 
Jimmy Choo’s shoes and accessories are all made in Europe and 
in particular Italy, where factories and tanneries are subject to 
mandatory legislative requirements. Jimmy Choo already expects 
its suppliers and sub-suppliers to include clauses combatting child 
labour in their contracts.
In the unlikely event that Jimmy Choo identifies working conditions 
which do not meet its minimum standards, the Group will work 
closely with suppliers to improve their performance. Jimmy Choo has 
continued to follow through on its commitment to improving working 
conditions for workers both under its direct operations and across 
its value chain. Jimmy Choo has now implemented formal written 
contracts with the majority of its suppliers which include clauses 
combatting child labour. Further efforts are being made to widen 
the scope to include anti-slavery provisions for workers.

CREATING A DIVERSE COMMUNITY
We believe that businesses thrive from the sharing of knowledge and 
experiences. In order to make the most of the cross fertilisation of 
ideas, we employ people from a diverse range of professional and 
cultural backgrounds, not only because it is the right thing to do, but 
also because it enhances our work environment and strengthens our 
ability to nurture and grow the business.
The Group is committed to a policy of treating all of its employees 
and job applicants equally. No employee or potential employee will 
receive less favourable treatment or consideration on the grounds of 
race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, religion or belief, sex, gender 
reassignment, sexual orientation, age, marital status, civil partnership 
status, pregnancy, maternity or disability, or will be disadvantaged by 
any conditions of employment or requirements of the Company that 
cannot be justified as necessary on operational grounds.
We have a comprehensive diversity policy which ensures that 
everyone who works at one of our workplaces, whether they are 
directly employed by Jimmy Choo or not, is protected from direct and 
indirect discrimination, harassment or victimisation, whether 
deliberate or accidental. In addition, we commit to ensuring that the 
work environment is suitable for our employees to carry out their 
duties, with adjustments to equipment, location and working 
practices where necessary.
We have put policies in place to ensure that the recruitment process 
is free from bias and that equal work receives equal pay.
• There should be no discrimination on account of race, colour, 
nationality, ethnic origin, religion or belief, sex, gender 
reassignment, sexual orientation, age, marital status, civil 
partnership status, pregnancy, maternity or disability.
• The Group will appoint, train, develop and promote on the basis 
of merit and capability.
• All employees have personal responsibility for the practical 
application of the Group’s equal opportunity policy, which extends 
to the treatment of employees and clients.
• Special responsibility for the practical application of the 
Company’s equal opportunity policy falls upon all managers and 
supervisors involved in the recruitment, selection, promotion and 
training of employees.
• The Group’s grievance procedure is available to any employee 
who believes that he or she may have been unfairly treated.
• Disciplinary action is taken against any employee who is found to 
have committed an act of unlawful discrimination. Discriminatory 
conduct will be treated as gross misconduct and may lead to 
summary dismissal.
INVOLVING OUR PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS
We want all of our employees to be part of Jimmy Choo’s success. 
This means not only excelling in their particular role, but also taking 
an interest in and influencing outcomes across the business. We do 
this through active two way communication, training, individual 
recognition and variable rewards linked to corporate results.
COMMUNICATION
Our internal communication strategy is designed to ensure that the 
strategic framework and value creation architecture of the Board is 
well understood by all employees. We keep employees up to date 
on the medium-term plans for how we aim to achieve those goals, 
as well as on the day to day progress of the business. 
The Executive Directors present the Strategic Plan for the year 
annually to all corporate employees and managers within the retail 
business. This is supported by regular communication in relation to 
organisational changes in the business and sales data relevant to 
each employee’s region and responsibilities. This regular update 
serves to introduce new colleagues, as well as provide information 
on how we are performing against the strategic framework towards 
which we are all working. 
Jimmy Choo is a dynamic environment and it is important to ensure 
that the views of our employees are taken into account as we change 
and grow. We therefore consult at local, regional and global levels at 
an early stage where any changes may impact our employees. This 
process is supported by a clear open door policy with our HR team 
and a transparent approach, where appropriate, in the business.  
All employees are encouraged to come forward with ideas and 
concerns. This consultation has positive results for the long-term 
growth of the business, such as the introduction of new 
management training specifically designed to help our employees 
develop into the senior managers of tomorrow. 
PROMOTION AND TRAINING
In order to help our employees to grow within the business, training 
is offered throughout Jimmy Choo. Training and development  
does not stop because someone is pregnant or has childcare 
responsibilities. We never assume that such employees are not 
interested in promotion.
We offer training appropriate to each employee’s current 
responsibilities, as well as those they need in order to progress 
within the business to achieve their potential. Training is organised 
by the Company and with external providers, where required, at 
Jimmy Choo’s expense. 
Overall, we employed 1,157 people as at 31 December 2015. Of 
those, 78% (898) were female and 22% (259) were male. Of our 
eight member Executive Management Team, 63% (five) are female 
and 37% (three) are male. Finally, of our eleven member Board, 
27% (three) are female and 73% (eight) are male. 
VARIABLE AWARDS
All employees are incentivised with an element of variable 
compensation linked to metrics relevant to their role and function. 
At retail, this is largely linked to sales commission, whereas in the 
corporate side of the business, the variable component of pay 
is linked to a mix of metrics relating to the Company’s overall 
performance and their particular role and function. This blended 
approach promotes the ethos that everyone at Jimmy Choo is 
responsible not only for their own role but working together to 
promote the whole business within the strategic framework.
VALUES AWARDS
We invite managers to nominate members of their teams  
annually to be recognised in front of their peers as people  
who have achieved something exceptional and acted as  
a role model for our Company “Values”.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

STRATEGIC RISKS
GROWTH 
STRATEGY
Jimmy Choo’s long-term growth is dependent  
on making strategic choices to move into new  
territories, channels and products. The wrong  
strategy or poor execution could put future  
growth at risk.
The Board has approved well-structured growth plans 
and ensured that those plans are adequately resourced.
The Board regularly challenges the strategic plans to 
ensure that downside risks are mitigated.
The Board closely monitors the progress against the 
Strategic Plan, redirecting strategy or execution effort 
when required.

Jimmy Choo competes with other luxury goods 
companies for clients, talent, retail sites, wholesale 
customers and supplier capacity. Failure to compete  
well in any of these areas risks future growth.
Senior Management monitors competitor movements 
and ensures Jimmy Choo hires and retains the best 
people to compete effectively in each area, including:
• Design and Merchandising – continuously focusing  
on future design and consumer trends;
• Supply Chain – negotiating and building strong 
relationships with current and future suppliers;
• Retail – seeking and acquiring appropriate store 
locations and striving for operational excellence; 
• Wholesale – nurturing strong relationships with 
key customers; and
• CRM and client engagement – building on our 
relationships with clients to increase their 
engagement with the brand.
CHANGES IN 
CONSUMER 
PREFERENCES 
AND TRENDS
Future success depends on Jimmy Choo’s ability  
to shape, predict and respond to fashion trends and 
consumer preferences on both products and channels. 
Failure to do so risks surplus inventory, missed sales 
opportunities and reducing salience of the brand  
with clients.
Design and Merchandising teams have a structured 
approach to monitoring trends internally and externally 
and use the feedback to develop each collection to be 
coherent with future design and consumer trends.
Retail teams monitor client channel preferences. 
In addition, Jimmy Choo has started a programme 
of Omnichannel development, which is planned to 
begin a progressive roll out before the end of 2016.
Marketing and Brand Image teams ensure the 
brand book and marketing are aligned and relevant  
to the marketplace.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
KEY PERSONNEL Jimmy Choo needs to attract and retain the best  
people in each area.
People policies and management culture are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that they continue to be effective in 
maintaining Jimmy Choo as an attractive place to work.
Bonuses and incentive plans are reviewed regularly with 
the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they remain 
competitive with the industry.
The Board is responsible for identifying the nature and extent of the 
risks the Group has to manage in order to pursue its growth strategy 
successfully and generate shareholder value over the long-term. The 
Board confirms that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity. 
The Board uses a risk framework which is designed to support the 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing both financial 
and non-financial risks. 
The Group has identified the following key risks. This is not an 
exhaustive list but rather a list of the most material risks facing the 
Group. The impact of these risks, individually or collectively, could 
potentially affect the ability of the Group to operate profitably and 
generate positive cash flows in the medium to long-term. As a result, 
these risks are actively monitored and managed, as detailed below. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT
43
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATING ACTION
THIRD PARTY 
PRODUCTION
If suppliers do not produce product on time, in the 
right quantity, at the right quality levels, or fail to meet 
local laws and regulations, this would constrain the 
availability of stock in stores and for delivery to our 
wholesale customers. 
Jimmy Choo has a dedicated supply chain, as well as 
product development and engineering offices, close to 
where the suppliers are located. This helps to build 
strong relationships with suppliers and manages those 
suppliers tightly to production deadlines and contracts. 
To ensure product availability to support future growth, 
Jimmy Choo plans volume and capacity clearly in advance.
Jimmy Choo maintains knowledge of supplier capability 
on an ongoing basis to determine where constraints 
could arise in the future.
IT SYSTEMS Jimmy Choo’s IT systems need to be robust against 
power outages, computer, network, telecommunications 
failures, computer viruses, security breaches and user 
error. Failure to do so could lead to critical data loss, 
delays or interruption to business operation.
Senior Management reviews the IT strategy and 
operation regularly to ensure that IT systems are robust, 
secure and continue to be appropriate for the size and 
complexity of Jimmy Choo’s business.
In addition, Jimmy Choo maintains a disaster 
recovery plan.
OUTSOURCING 
SERVICES TO 
GLOBAL BUSINESS 
SERVICES 
Logistics, IT and transactional accounting activities are 
outsourced to JAB Luxury’s shared services company, 
LLX Global Business Services SA and its affiliates 
(“GBS”). Reductions in GBS performance risk impacting 
Jimmy Choo’s operations and reductions in GBS 
efficiency would lead to lost business and increased 
costs for Jimmy Choo.
Legal contracts and service catalogues have been 
signed between Jimmy Choo and GBS. Both parties are 
committed to improving the KPIs over time.
Performance is monitored on a daily and periodic basis 
and reported monthly. A clear remediation process is in 
place if required.
PROGRAMME RISK 
AND CHANGE 
MANAGEMENT
Interruption or reduced performance during 
implementation of the operational transformation 
programmes would impact current operations. If the 
scope of transformation reduced, future development 
plans of the business would be put at risk.
The operation of enterprise-wide systems like SAP 
requires a careful and controlled change management 
process to avoid system changes disrupting 
performance and affecting operations. 
Strong programme governance, structures, planning 
processes, reporting frameworks and communication 
plans are put in place on all programmes in Jimmy Choo, 
linking project delivery teams (from GBS) to key staff in the 
business. Within these programmes, Senior Management 
is prepared to enact decisions quickly as required to 
ensure the programme is implemented successfully.
Smaller scale changes are managed through a Change 
Request Board consisting of Jimmy Choo and GBS 
Senior Management. This ensures that system and 
operational changes are fully documented, agreed, 
managed and implemented in an effective way to 
avoid risk and disruption to the business. 
It is also noteworthy that while the wholesale business 
was slightly disrupted by the transfer to the new supply 
chain in the early part of the year, remedial measures 
taken were effective and a substantial portion of the 
shortfall was recovered in the second half and we are 
proceeding to resolve all remaining issues.
COMPLIANCE RISKS
COMPLIANCE 
WITH LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS
Changes in laws and regulations could result in 
Jimmy Choo being non-compliant or incurring costs 
to be compliant (e.g. system changes). If third parties 
(e.g. suppliers) are not compliant, there would be a 
risk to brand image or of financial penalties.
Employees in each area monitor regulatory requirements 
in their area (e.g. Design, Merchandising and Supply 
Chain on consumer product safety, Retail on health and 
safety in stores and Supply Chain and Logistics on 
import and export requirements).
The Jimmy Choo legal team liaise with these teams, 
provide an overall review and act swiftly should 
instances of non-compliance arise. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT
44
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATING ACTION
CUSTOMER 
CONFIDENTIALITY
Failure to comply with legal requirements and 
restrictions on the use of and access to customer data 
could harm Jimmy Choo’s brand reputation, credibility 
and client trust.
Jimmy Choo restricts access to customer data. Robust 
protocols are in place to ensure that client data is secure.
The security function within GBS undertakes regular 
audits to payment card industry standards.
FINANCIAL RISKS
EXCHANGE RATE 
FLUCTUATIONS
Products are purchased in Euro and sold in local 
currencies. In addition, store costs are incurred in local 
currencies. Adverse movements in foreign exchange 
rates would impact revenue growth reported in Sterling, 
as well as gross and net margins.
The Board has approved a hedging strategy which seeks 
to minimise the adverse impact of exchange rate 
fluctuations on adjusted earnings.
However, the impact of significant foreign exchange 
movements (such as those seen in 2015) has a more 
fundamental impact beyond the direct financial effects, 
as it affects consumer behaviour and client purchase 
choices. This is managed through careful attention to 
recommended retail pricing.
ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN AND 
INTERNATIONAL 
MARKET RISK
Economic downturns in countries where Jimmy Choo 
sells products may reduce sales and increase inventory.
Changes in international trade laws, transportation 
costs, or local government instability could all impact 
financial results.
Economic environment and international market risks  
are regularly reviewed by Senior Management, with 
appropriate action taken as required (e.g. reallocation  
of product or resources between regions and active 
management of inventory).
This has been evident with the continued slowdown in 
Russian clients travelling, especially in Europe, although 
the growth in Chinese visitors has offset this in 2015.
REPUTATIONAL RISKS
IMAGE AND 
REPUTATION OF 
THE BRAND
If Jimmy Choo’s products, stores, marketing, customer 
service and corporate profile fail to retain the distinctive 
Jimmy Choo character, quality and values, brand equity 
could be reduced and sales impacted.
Brand quality is at the core of everything that the 
business does.
This ensures that all areas of the business retain, 
maintain or improve the reputation of the brand and the 
Company (e.g. design and quality of products, quality of 
marketing, store environment and client service).
Jimmy Choo’s contracts with franchisees, distributors 
and licensees are drafted to ensure the control of the 
brand is rigorously enforced.
CONTROL OF 
THE WHOLESALE 
DISTRIBUTION 
CHANNEL
Wholesale customers and franchise stores could present 
the brand in a manner not in keeping with Jimmy Choo’s 
brand positioning and DNA, damaging the image and 
reputation of the brand.
Senior Management review all distribution partners 
carefully in advance of accepting them as a Jimmy Choo 
partner.
Jimmy Choo’s contracts with distribution partners 
are drafted to ensure control of elements of the 
brand presentation and these are rigorously enforced 
with partners.
I approve the Strategic Report set out on pages 11 to 44 on behalf of the Board.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present our second Corporate Governance Report 
which describes how the main principles of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) have been applied throughout the 
first complete year as a listed Company. Good governance is aligned 
to the Company’s core values and a full schedule has enabled the 
Board to meet on four formal occasions. Bart Becht has left the 
Board given his continuing commitments at Coty Inc. and three new 
Directors, Anna-Lena Kamenetzky, Meribeth Parker and Elisabeth 
Murdoch have joined since our last Corporate Governance Report. 
We value the contribution made by Mr. Becht and welcome the 
new Directors.
Since 1 January 2015 JAB Luxury continues to be the majority 
shareholder of Jimmy Choo PLC and the Company represents a 
significant investment to JAB Luxury (67.68%). The Board and 
JAB Luxury are mindful of the need to consider the interests of the 
Company’s minority shareholders. The Board believes that the 
Board and its Committees, with the addition of the new Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, will provide the appropriate corporate 
governance balance in light of the interests of both the majority 
shareholder and the minority shareholders. All members of the 
Audit and Risk Committee are Independent Non-Executive Directors 
and the Conflicts Committee assists in the management of the 
relationship between the Company and its majority shareholder. 
Further details of these measures are contained within this report.
Under the existing Relationship Agreement between JAB Luxury 
and the Company, JAB Luxury is able to appoint up to one half of 
the Board while it continues to own 50% or more of the Company’s 
shares. Further details of the Relationship Agreement can be found 
on page 55.
The Board believes that there are sufficient safeguards in place  
in the structures and processes implemented to consider and  
protect the interests of independent shareholders. The Company 
does have a number of areas in which it does not fully follow the 
recommendations of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code. 
These are that the Board has established a joint Remuneration and 
Nominations Committee, rather than separate Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees, which is not made up solely of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and there are two members 
in the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committee. Again, the Board believes that these 
departures from the Code are reasonable in the circumstances of 
Jimmy Choo’s ownership. The Board is considering ways in which 
it can address further recommendations in 2016.
This report includes a description of how the Company has applied 
the principles of the Code during the year and how it intends to apply 
those principles throughout 2016.
PETER HARF
NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN
21 March 2016
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE – COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Company has applied all except three of the main principles 
of the Code as listed below:
A.3.1 The Chairman was not independent on appointment.
B.2.1 There is a joint Remuneration and Nominations Committee. 
The majority of the members of this Committee are not 
determined by the Board to be independent. As the previous 
Chairman of the Committee resigned in July 2015, the 
Chairman is the chair on an interim basis until a successor, 
with the relevant skills and experience, is appointed.  
As a result, this leaves two members on the Committee.
C.3.1 There are two members on the Audit and Risk Committee. 
The Board has decided that, given the professional 
background, experience and contribution offered by the 
two members of the Committee, it is not necessary to 
extend membership of the Committee further at this point. 
The Board will keep this under regular review.

JIMMY CHOO LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
THE BOARD STRUCTURE
The structure and business of the Board is designed to ensure that 
the Board focuses its time and energy on providing entrepreneurial 
leadership to the Group, setting strategy and monitoring performance

BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT
All power to make managerial decisions affecting the future 
development and business prospects of the Company rests with 
the Board. Below the Board is an Executive Management Team 
(“Executive Team”) comprising eight senior managers overseen by 
Pierre Denis and Jonathan Sinclair. This is a diverse Executive Team 
with 63% being female. Corporate governance rules adopted by the 
Board have been cascaded down to the Executive Team and 
throughout the Company.
KEY BOARD ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
CEO which has been agreed by the Board. The roles of the Chairman 
and CEO are held by different people and the purpose of each role 
is clear and distinct and set out in respective job descriptions. The 
Chairman is responsible for the leadership and overall effectiveness

SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
David Poulter is the SID. The SID’s role is to act as a sounding board 
for the Chairman and serve as an intermediary for the other Directors 
when necessary. The SID will meet other Non-Executive Directors 
without the Chairman and Executive Directors present at least once 
a year to discuss governance issues. The SID will also provide feedback 
to the Board on the Independent Non-Executive Directors’ collective 
views on the perceived quality of the relationship between the 
Chairman and the CEO; the degree of openness between the CEO and 
the Board; the visibility of checks and balances within the Executive 
Directors’ team; and whether all questions asked by the Non-Executive 
Directors of the Board have been adequately addressed.
The SID is also available to shareholders to discuss concerns where 
contact through the normal channels of the Chairman, CEO or CFO 
has failed to resolve them or for which such contact is inappropriate.
BOARD INDEPENDENCE
The Board currently consists of nine Non-Executive Directors (including 
the Chairman) five of whom are considered to be independent.

As explained in the Chairman’s introduction, under the Relationship 
Agreement JAB Luxury is able to appoint: (i) up to one half of the 
Directors on the Board while it continues to hold 50% or more of the 
shares; (ii) up to one quarter of the Directors on the Board while it 
continues to hold at least 25% but less than 50% of the shares; and 
(iii) up to one eighth of the Directors on the Board while it continues 
to hold at least 10% but less than 25% of the shares. The current 
appointees are Fabio Fusco, Olivier Goudet, Peter Harf and Anna-
Lena Kamenetzky.
The Board has determined that each of Gianluca Brozzetti, Elisabeth 
Murdoch, Meribeth Parker, David Poulter and Robert Singer are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. In reaching this determination, 
the Board took into consideration the following relationships: 
Mr. Brozzetti advised JAB Luxury in respect of its investment in 
Zagliani; from 1999 to 2012 Mr. Poulter held senior finance positions 
in Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC (in which JAB Luxury’s controlling 
shareholder is a significant investor) including a period as a trustee of 
its pension scheme and Mr. Singer has been a Director of Coty Inc. 
(in which JAB Luxury’s controlling shareholder is the majority 
shareholder) since 2009. Each of these Directors has been appointed 
as an Independent Non-Executive Director of Bally and Belstaff, 
which are companies owned by JAB Luxury. The other Directors 
have concluded that the judgement, experience and challenging 
approach taken by each of Gianluca Brozzetti, David Poulter and 
Robert Singer should ensure that they each make a significant 
contribution to the work of the Board and its Committees. Both 
Meribeth Parker and Elisabeth Murdoch have a wealth of experience 
of great benefit to the Board. Each of these Directors has been 
appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director of Bally and 
Belstaff and they are considered to be Independent Non-Executive 
Directors due to their diverse skills and experience. Therefore, the 
Board has determined that each of them is of independent character 
and judgement and should be regarded as independent directors for 
the purposes of the Code.
The names of the Directors and brief biographies can be found on 
pages 50 and 51.
COMMIT MEN T
The Board expects Non-Executive Directors to commit sufficient 
time to allow them to meet their obligations to the Company. The 
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment set out that each 
Non-Executive Director needs to commit ten days per year to the 
Company but clarifies that more time may be required. Non-
Executive Directors will need to attend scheduled and emergency 
Board and Committee meetings, at least one site visit per year 
and the AGM if required. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors 
are expected to commit appropriate preparation time ahead of 
each meeting.
REL ATIONSHIP AGREEMENT
On 3 October 2014, the Company and JAB Luxury entered into the 
Relationship Agreement which regulates aspects of the ongoing 
relationship between the Company and JAB Luxury. The principal 
purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the 
Company and its subsidiaries are capable of carrying on their 
business independently of JAB Luxury and its associates, that 
transactions and relationships with JAB Luxury or its associates 
(including any transactions and relationships with any member of the 
Group) are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms and that 
the goodwill, reputation and commercial interests of the Company 
are maintained.
The Relationship Agreement will continue for so long as (i) the shares 
are listed on the premium listing segment of the Official List and 
traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed 
securities and (ii) JAB Luxury, together with its associates, is entitled 
to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the votes able 
to be cast on all, or substantially all, matters at general meetings of 
the Company.
The Directors believe that the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
continue to enable the Group to carry on its business independently 
of JAB Luxury and to ensure that all transactions and relationships 
between the Company and/or the members of the Group and JAB 
Luxury and/or its associates are, and will be, on arm’s length terms 
and on a normal commercial basis.
Under the Relationship Agreement, JAB Luxury is able to appoint to 
the Board such number of Non-Executive Directors as discussed 
above. JAB Luxury is entitled to receive, subject to compliance by the 
Company with its legal and regulatory obligations, such financial or 
other information in relation to the Group or any member of the 
Group as is necessary or reasonably required by it: (i) in its capacity 
as a shareholder of the Company, for the purposes of its accounting 
or financial control requirements or in order to comply with its legal, 
regulatory or tax obligations; or (ii) in order for it and other members 
of its group to provide certain advisory services to the Group, 
including but not limited to management accounts, long and 
short-term planning documents and sales and margin reports.
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND INSURANCE
At appointment, all Directors are granted indemnities in respect of 
any liability in relation to a third party regarding the affairs of the 
Company or Group member.
The Company has appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance cover in place in respect of legal action against, amongst 
others, its Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
CONFLICTS COMMIT TEE
The Board has constituted a Conflicts Committee that considers 
on behalf of the Board any contract, arrangement or transaction 
between any member of the Group and JAB Luxury or any of JAB 
Luxury’s associates and any actual or potential conflict of interest 
between any member of the Group and JAB Luxury or any of JAB 
Luxury’s associates which involves, or would involve, significant 
expenditure by the Group. The Conflicts Committee will meet on 
an ad hoc basis as required. The Conflicts Committee is chaired by 
Robert Singer, and its other members are Gianluca Brozzetti, Pierre 
Denis, Elisabeth Murdoch, Meribeth Parker, David Poulter and 
Jonathan Sinclair.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company’s new Articles of Association adopted at the last AGM 
set out the policy for dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest and 
are in line with the Companies Act 2006. The Articles permit the 
Board to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, as long as the 
potentially conflicted Director is not counted in the quorum and 
does not vote on the resolution to authorise. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
GOV ERN A NCE
56
In March 2015, the Board agreed a procedure for dealing with 
conflicts of interest in relation to matters which are scheduled for 
Board consideration following which each Director completed a 
“Directors List” which sets out details of situations where each 
Director’s interests may conflict with those of the Company 
(“situational conflicts”). These lists were subsequently considered 
and situational conflicts authorised. In addition, Directors are 
reminded at the beginning of each Board meeting to notify the Board 
of any further conflicts of interest in accordance with sections 175, 
177 and 182 of the Companies Act 2006. There were no conflicts 
in 2015.
BOARD PROCESS
In 2015, the Board has met four times in line with the usual Board 
calendar. All Directors were present at each meeting, save for 
Mr. Becht in the May meeting and Mr. Goudet in the August meeting 
due to a conflict of commitments. Mr. Becht resigned in July after 
the announcement of his continuing role as Interim CEO and 
Chairman of Coty Inc.. The Board will continue to meet formally at 
least four times a year, with ad hoc meetings called as and when 
circumstances require it to do so at short notice. There is an annual 
calendar of agenda items to ensure that all matters are given due 
consideration and are reviewed at the appropriate point in the 
regulatory and financial cycle. The Board has sought to ensure that 
there is sufficient time to discuss strategy so that the Non-Executive 
Directors have a good opportunity to challenge and help develop 
strategy proposals. The attendance of members at Board meetings 
in the year was as follows:

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
All new Directors received an induction briefing from the Company’s 
legal adviser, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, on their duties and 
responsibilities as Directors of a publicly quoted company. During 
2015, the Company Secretary attended the induction briefings and 
assisted with the Directors’ training needs and requests. Various 
steps are taken to ensure that all Directors continually refresh their 
knowledge and skills so that they can effectively fulfil their roles. 
All Directors have attended site visits to flagship stores in various 
locations throughout the year. Site visits facilitate discussion 
surrounding current business issues.
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT
An agenda and accompanying pack of detailed papers is circulated 
to the Board well in advance of each Board meeting. These include 
reports from Executive Directors and other members of Senior 
Management. A secure Board portal was introduced in May 2015 
which has enabled the Directors to view the detailed papers 
electronically at their convenience. All Directors have direct access 
to Senior Management should they require additional information or 
clarification on any of the items to be discussed. The Board and the 
Audit and Risk Committee also receive further regular and specific 
reports to allow the monitoring of the adequacy of the Company’s 
systems of internal control. Directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense on request.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Mr. Poulter, in his capacity as SID, facilitated the first internal Board 
Evaluation process, the results of which were reviewed in March 
2016. This was undertaken using a detailed questionnaire completed 
by each Director together with follow up discussions. The evaluation 
concluded strong agreement and support for the Board structure and 
processes. Further, the SID led the Chairman evaluation process and 
the Non-Executive Directors met without the Chairman present to 
review his performance. The Non-Executive Directors consider the 
Chairman is providing strong and balanced leadership. This Board 
Evaluation process is internal and will take place annually, with the 
process being externally facilitated at least every three years.
SHARE DEALING CODE
At Admission, the Company adopted Share Dealing Codes which 
cover dealings by PDMRs and relevant employees. The codes 
comply with the provisions set out in the Model Code contained in 
Annex 1 to Listing Rule 9 of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules. 
It restricts dealings in shares and other relevant securities by PDMRs 
and relevant employees during designated prohibited periods and at 
any time when they are in possession of unpublished, price-sensitive 
information. All relevant employees have committed to full 
compliance of the Company’s Share Dealing Codes.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
DIALOGUE WITH SHAREHOLDERS
During the year, the CEO and CFO met with a number of both 
existing and potential investors following the success of the IPO 
roadshow during 2014.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Company’s Audit 
and Risk Committee Report. This report follows the format 
established last year.
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for establishing, 
monitoring and regularly reviewing the Company’s internal controls 
and risk management framework, as well as overseeing the work of 
the external auditor. During the year, the Audit and Risk Committee 
met five times, focused primarily on monitoring the integrity of the 
Group’s financial reporting and enhancing the robustness of the 
control environment and risk management framework post IPO, both 
through the review and challenge of the work of internal audit and 
ongoing dialogue with management. These meetings have taken 
place both at the Group’s Head Office in London and also within  
the regional offices of the Group, which has afforded the members  
of the Committee the opportunity to meet with local management 
personnel and participate in deep dives into certain aspects of the 
Group’s central and regional operations.
A significant part of the back office operations in respect of systems, 
logistics and transaction processing were outsourced to and 
managed by GBS. GBS operates through a series of central and 
regional shared service centres and is effectively under common 
control with Jimmy Choo, offering the benefits of scale and also 
risk management associated with the implementation of the 
replatforming of the Jimmy Choo business. The Audit and Risk 
Committee have oversight of GBS operations and receive regular 
reports on the control environment in GBS.
Further details on the activities of the Committee during the year and 
how it discharged its responsibilities are provided in the report below.

MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
The Audit and Risk Committee currently comprises two Independent 
Non-Executive Directors: Robert Singer (Chairman) and David Poulter.
Both members of the Committee have recent and relevant financial 
experience. Robert Singer is currently a member of the Board of 
Directors and a member (and the Chairman until the end of April 2015) 
of the Audit Committee of Mead Johnson Nutrition and Chairman 
of the Audit Committee for Coty Inc. and Tiffany and Co., having 
previously been CFO of Gucci Group. David Poulter has held previous 
roles as Head of Internal Audit and Senior Vice President, Finance at 
Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC and is a Chartered Accountant.
The Audit and Risk Committee meets as often as it deems necessary 
but in any case at least four times a year, with meetings scheduled 
at appropriate intervals in the financial reporting cycle. Additional 
meetings are held as required. The Audit and Risk Committee met 
five times during the 2015 calendar year and a further two meetings 
have been held since year end to review the 2015 audit and to 
approve the 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements. All 
members of the Committee were present at all meetings.
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend meetings. 
However, standing invitations are extended to the CFO, the Internal 
Audit Manager and the Chief Administrative Officer of GBS. Other 
non-members may be invited to attend all or part of any meeting 
as and when appropriate. Fabio Fusco (Non-Executive Director) acts 
as Secretary to the Committee. The external auditor attends most 
meetings and also meets in private with the Committee when 
it is appropriate to do so. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee has regular contact with the external and internal 
auditors throughout the year.
The Board has decided that, given the professional background, 
experience and contribution offered by the two members of the 
Committee, it is not necessary to extend membership of the 
Committee further at this point. This is something that the Board 
will keep under regular review.
ROLE OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMIT TEE
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
overseeing the internal financial controls and financial reporting of 
the Company and its subsidiaries, reviewing the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems and for maintaining a proper 
relationship with the external auditor. The Committee’s specific 
responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference which were 
adopted in October 2014. These are available on the Company’s 
website and are summarised below.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Internal audit services are provided by JAB Luxury under an Advisory 
Services Agreement dated 13 August 2014. The role of these internal 
audit services is to determine whether the Group’s network of risk 
management, control and governance processes are adequate and 
functioning appropriately.
During 2015, internal audit conducted six audits across the business. 
The key focus areas in the year included a detailed review of store 
development capital expenditure given the significance of this to the 
financial statements, especially in the context of the continuing roll 
out of the Group’s New Store Concept, the development of flagship 
stores and expansion into new locations. Internal audit also reviewed 
the controls over financial transaction processing conducted within 
the regional shared service centres, which were set up with GBS 
following the completion of SAP implementation during the year.
For each audit completed during the year, a full report of all 
findings and remedial actions was presented to the Committee for 
consideration, review and challenge. Internal audit also completes an 
annual risk assessment of the Group through discussion with Senior 
Management, the results of which are presented to the Audit and 
Risk Committee and are used to guide the agenda for internal audit 
in the following year.
During its meeting held in March 2016, the Committee considered 
the effectiveness of the internal audit services provided during 2015, 
taking into consideration the skills and organisation of the internal 
audit function, the approach taken during the year and the quality 
of their reports and recommendations. Having also considered 
input from management and the external auditor, the Committee 
concluded that the internal audit services provided during 2015 
were effective.
At its meeting in November 2015, the Committee approved the 
annual internal audit plan for 2016 which identified areas of focus for 
the year ahead, having taken regard of identified risk areas. The Audit 
and Risk Committee will continue to receive regular reports from 
the internal audit function during 2016, including progress updates 
against the approved internal audit plan. The Committee will use 
these reports as the basis for its assessment of the effectiveness 
of the internal audit function during 2016, as well as monitoring 
the relationship between the internal audit function and the 
Group’s management. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
CONTINUED
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s relationship 
with its external auditor, KPMG LLP. This includes the ongoing 
assessment of the auditor’s independence and the effectiveness 
of the external audit process, the results of which inform the 
Committee’s recommendation to the Board as to the auditor’s 
appointment (subject to shareholder approval) or otherwise.
APPOINTMENT AND TENURE
KPMG LLP was first appointed as the external auditor of the Group 
in 2011. Graham Neale has served as audit partner for the first time 
in 2015, following the retirement of the previous incumbent from 
KPMG LLP.
The audit partner is required to rotate every five years. In accordance 
with the Code, the Committee intends to put the external audit 
out to tender at least every ten years. There are no contractual 
obligations that act to restrict the Audit and Risk Committee’s 
choice of external auditor.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The engagement of the external audit firm to provide non-audit 
services to the Group can impact on the independence assessment. 
The Group has therefore established a policy governing the provision 
of any such non-audit services. The policy specifies services which 
cannot be carried out by the external auditor (generally activities 
that would involve the external auditor taking on management 
responsibility) and sets the framework within which non-audit 
services may be provided. All requests to utilise the external auditor 
for non-audit services must be reviewed by the CFO and above 
£50,000 must be subject to competitive tender and be approved 
by the Audit and Risk Committee.
During 2015, KPMG LLP were engaged to provide non-audit services 
to the Group. These included the provision of tax advisory services. 
The fees paid to KPMG LLP in respect of non-audit services during 
the year totalled £0.2m which is additional to the total audit fee of 
£0.3m. The majority of the non-audit fees incurred during the year 
were in connection with the VAT and direct taxation implications of 
the development of the Group’s Omnichannel platform, which is due 
to progressively roll out in 2016. The Group considered KPMG LLP 
to be best placed to perform this work in the most efficient manner 
possible given their involvement in the redesign of the Group’s 
supply chain in the prior year, which is closely connected to the 
roll out of the Group’s Omnichannel strategy.
The Committee assesses the independence of the external auditor 
and the effectiveness of the external audit process before making 
recommendations to the Board in respect of their appointment 
or reappointment.
In assessing independence and objectivity, the Committee 
considers the level and nature of services provided by the external 
auditor as well as the confirmation from the external auditor that it 
has remained independent within the meaning of the APB Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. The Committee’s assessment of the external 
auditor’s independence took into account the non-audit services 
provided during the year. The Committee concluded that the 
nature and extent of the non-audit fees did not compromise the 
independence of the auditor.
Having reviewed the auditor’s independence and performance, 
the Audit and Risk Committee recommends that KPMG LLP be 
reappointed as the Company’s auditor at the next AGM. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
Significant issues and accounting judgements are identified by the finance team and through the external audit process and are reviewed by 
the Audit and Risk Committee. The significant issues considered by the Committee in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015 are set 
out below:
Risk area Significant issues and judgements How the issues were addressed
Revenue 
recognition
Revenue is a key performance indicator of the Group. 
Whilst the Group’s revenue recognition policies are not 
complex, the Group’s revenue is comprised of a high 
volume of transactions. The maintenance of an effective 
control environment, particularly within our retail channel 
which accounts for 65.3% of total revenue, is therefore 
fundamental to ensuring appropriate revenue recognition.
Controls relevant to the retail channel are formally 
documented within the Retail Excellence Manual that 
was implemented within each store throughout the year. 
The accounting policies for revenue are set out in note 1 
to the financial statements and are unchanged from 
previous periods.
The Audit and Risk Committee considered reports prepared 
by the internal auditor during the year, particularly where 
there has been a change in the control environment 
following the transition to SAP and noted no significant 
issues with respect to the operation of the controls around 
revenue recognition.
The Audit and Risk Committee also considered a report 
from the external auditor, which commented, inter alia, on 
revenue recognition which did not indicate that there were 
any problems with revenue recognised in 2015.
Identification 
and disclosure of 
exceptional items
The Group is undergoing a significant transformation 
programme, in connection with which the Group has 
incurred a significant degree of costs that are considered 
to be exceptional in nature, as they are unrepresentative of 
the underlying operating performance of the Group. This 
programme is expected to conclude in 2016.
In light of wider economic trends and their impact on the 
luxury industry as a whole, the Group has taken steps 
during the year to comprehensively review its global cost 
base and take mitigating actions wherever possible in 
order to reduce the annual operating costs of the business. 
This has included the selective reduction of headcount 
and office space where appropriate. The associated 
termination costs of these restructuring activities are 
expected to continue into the first half of 2016. These 
costs are considered to be exceptional as they are deemed 
to be one-off in nature.
Further details of these costs are provided in note 5 to the 
financial statements.
The Audit and Risk Committee has discussed the nature of 
these costs with management and the external auditor. The 
Audit and Risk Committee are of the view that these costs 
warrant separate disclosure in the notes to the financial 
statements by virtue of the fact they are not representative 
of the underlying performance of the Group. The Audit 
and Risk Committee consider that separate disclosure of 
exceptional costs will aid investors and other users of the 
financial statements in evaluating the performance of the 
business in the year.
Residual value 
of key money
Judgement is required in estimating the residual value 
of key money paid to outgoing tenants to secure a 
leasehold property.
In certain locations, the residual value of key money 
is considered to be equal to cost; either due to legal 
protection offered to tenants in that jurisdiction or because 
it is common practice to at least recover the amounts 
paid at the end of the lease due to the existence of an 
active market for operating leases in premium luxury 
retail locations.
The Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed and challenged 
the key assumptions used in assessing the residual value 
of key money. The Audit and Risk Committee requested 
management to provide an in depth analysis of the valuation 
assumptions applied by location in order to consider the 
application of the agreed approach. Following review, the 
Audit and Risk Committee concluded that the judgements 
applied were appropriate in preparing the financial 
statements for the year.
When considering the financial statements, the Committee also considered the issues included in the Group’s critical accounting policies, 
which are set out in note 2 to the financial statements. Having discussed these matters with management and the external auditor the 
Committee has satisfied itself that such risks are being appropriately managed, the judgements made are reasonable and they are being 
accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting standards and principles. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

FAIR, BAL ANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
At the request of the Board, the Audit and Risk Committee has 
conducted a review of the Annual Report and Financial Statements to 
assess whether it presents a fair, balanced and understandable view 
of the Company’s position and prospects. The Committee’s review 
took account of the process by which the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements is prepared which includes detailed project 
planning, analysis of changes to applicable reporting requirements 
and standards and a robust programme of review and verification at 
various levels of the business and by external advisers to ensure 
accurate reporting.
The Committee is satisfied that the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance and has advised the Board accordingly.
SYSTEMS OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has in place a comprehensive financial review cycle, 
which includes a detailed annual budgeting and forecasting process. 
The budget is prepared annually for approval by the Board and is 
regularly reviewed and updated during the year at key points of the 
business calendar. Performance is monitored against the budget 
through weekly and monthly reporting cycles. During the financial 
year under review, quarterly reports on performance, including 
income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements and key 
ratios were provided to the Board. In respect of external financial 
reporting, the Group finance team is responsible for preparing the 
Group financial statements and there are well established controls 
over the financial reporting process.
The Group has defined and formally documented the core elements 
of the system of internal control at a store, channel and Group level. 
Policies and procedures and clearly defined levels of delegated 
authority have been communicated across the Group. Management 
has identified the key operational and financial processes which exist 
within the business and implemented internal controls over these 
processes in addition to the higher level review and authorisation 
based controls. The control environment is communicated to staff 
through three key documents:
• the Group’s internal governance rules, which set out policies for 
delegation of authority within the business, including contract 
approval and signing limits for all types of expenditure;
• the Retail Excellence Manual detailing controls at store level; and
• the internal control system documentation which describes 
controls over key processes such as financial reporting, 
receivables and payables management.
The Group has continued to develop its governance arrangements 
since Admission which has included the enhancement of various 
policies and procedures to support the systems of internal control 
and risk management. The Audit and Risk Committee has been 
central to this process, in particular in the drafting and review of a 
number of updated or new policies, which have subsequently been 
approved by the Board, covering:
• anti-bribery and corruption policy;
• whistleblowing policy;
• risk framework and risk register; and
• disaster recovery arrangements.
These policies are subject to periodic review.
The Board retains ultimate responsibility for setting the Group’s risk 
appetite, identification of key risks and ensuring that there is an 
effective risk management framework to maintain levels of risk 
within the risk appetite. The Board has however delegated 
responsibility for oversight of the Group’s risk appetite, risk 
monitoring and reviewing areas of financial and control risks to the 
Audit and Risk Committee as well as ensuring sufficient mitigating 
actions are taken. The Committee will provide oversight and advice to 
the Board on current risk exposures and future risk strategy for those 
risks on which it has oversight. Further details of the Group’s risk 
management approach, structure and principal risks are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 42 to 44.
FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTING
The Board is committed to ensuring that all external financial reporting 
presents a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the 
Group’s position and prospects. Under the Schedule of Reserved 
Matters, the Board has responsibility for the approval of all externally 
published information including, but not limited to, annual and 
half-yearly financial statements, regulatory news announcements and 
publications required by regulators or to satisfy statutory requirements.
REVIEW OF EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS
The Board has established a risk and control structure designed to 
manage the achievement of business objectives as set out in the 
system of internal control and risk management above. In addition, 
as part of preparing for operating in a listed environment, a review of 
the existing controls in place was performed and additional controls 
were implemented to ensure compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code prior to Admission. During 2015, internal audit 
completed its annual risk assessment process alongside an update of 
the internal control systems documentation to ensure that the control 
framework identified and implemented prior to Admission remained 
valid. The Directors confirm that these processes have been in place 
since the date of Admission and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
The Directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of 
the system of internal controls for the period under review and to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The 
Board receives regular reports from the Audit and Risk Committee on 
its activities, including the Audit and Risk Committee’s review of 
reports prepared by internal audit on the operation and efficacy of 
internal controls systems.
Such a system is however designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
TREASURY OPERATIONS
The Company adopted a treasury policy prior to Admission which 
sets out the Group’s approach to the management of risks from 
treasury operations. This policy is subject to annual review at the 
Audit and Risk Committee. During 2015, as part of the annual review 
process, the Committee received a presentation from management 
providing an update on the Group’s strategy for managing currency 
risk in light of the significant currency fluctuations experienced in the 
wider economic environment, which the Committee concluded to be 
appropriate in the context of the Group’s treasury policy.
W HIS TL EBLOW ING
The Company has a whistleblowing policy and receives regular 
reports on the quantity and nature of incidents reported. The Audit 
and Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements and the policy will be reviewed 
periodically by the Board. The Group is confident that these 
arrangements remain effective, facilitate the proportionate and 
independent investigation of reported matters and allow appropriate 
follow up action to be taken.

REMUNERATION AND NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Remuneration 
Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2015. This has been 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Company and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.
In line with the regulations, this Directors’ Remuneration Report has 
been split into three parts:
• this Annual Statement;
• the Remuneration Policy Report – which sets out the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy of Jimmy Choo PLC which was approved at 
the 2015 AGM; and
• the Annual Remuneration Report – which sets out details on how 
the Directors were remunerated in the period to 31 December 
2015 and how the policy will be implemented in 2016. This will be 
subject to an advisory vote at our 2016 AGM.
REMUNERATION PHILOSOPHY
The remuneration package for our Executive Directors has been 
designed based on the following key principles:
• Fixed remuneration should be set at a suitable level to attract and 
retain executives with the required calibre to run a company with 
the size and growth profile of the Company. Base salaries are 
generally targeted around market median of a suitable peer group.
• Variable remuneration, in particular long-term incentives, should 
form a significant part of the remuneration package to encourage 
a high-performance culture and to ensure that the interests of 
executives are strongly aligned with those of the Company’s 
shareholders. 
• In line with the above, the total target cash remuneration 
opportunity for Executive Directors (fixed remuneration and target 
annual bonus) is set at around the market median of a suitable 
peer group. The total remuneration opportunity for Executive 
Directors (fixed remuneration, annual bonus and long-term 
incentives) is targeted at around the upper quartile of a suitable 
peer group.
In recognition of our remuneration philosophy, the variable 
remuneration arrangements for our Executive Directors are made up 
of an appropriate balance of both short and long-term incentives to 
ensure that our Executive Directors are focused on delivering both 
annual as well as long-term returns for shareholders. 
• The annual bonus is based predominantly on financial 
performance conditions designed to reward the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy of pursuing growth without compromising the 
brand. For 2016, the annual bonus will be subject to three key 
performance metrics:
(1) A revenue growth metric – to support the long-term growth 
strategy of the business and the sustainability of the brand;
(2) A profit growth metric – to ensure that any growth delivers 
appropriate returns to shareholders; and
(3) A cash conversion metric – to ensure that the business is 
delivering sufficient cash returns to cover its operating costs.
• The long-term incentive programme is the primary tool to be used 
to drive the long-term business strategy and align the interests of 
the management team with those of the Company’s shareholders. 
Following a review this year and given the awards granted to the 
Executive Directors at or shortly prior to Admission, it was 
considered appropriate not to grant a long-term incentive award 
to Executive Directors in respect of 2016. 
• To emphasise the link between the management team and 
shareholders, the Committee encourages the Executive Directors 
to build up significant shareholdings in the Company. Executive 
Directors are therefore expected to build up a significant 
shareholding in the Company over the seven years following 
Admission. The shareholding guideline for Pierre Denis is 500% 
of base salary and for Jonathan Sinclair is 200% of base salary.
2015 PERFORMANCE AND REMUNERATION OUTCOMES
2015 was the first full year as a public company and represented an 
above market year of performance for Jimmy Choo PLC, particularly 
given significant headwinds in the luxury market. Highlights for 
2015 include:
• Revenue growth of 7.2% at constant currency to £317.9m (6.1% 
at reported rates);
• Retail revenue growth of 8.7% at constant currency to £207.7m 
(7.7% at reported rates) with 1.1% LFL;
• Wholesale revenue growth of 1.3% at constant currency to 
£99.8m (up 0.2% at reported rates) despite the impact of the 
conversion of Singapore and Malaysia from Wholesale to Retail;
• DOS count increased by 16 in the year;
• 15 further DOS renovated in the New Store Concept;
• 30% of store portfolio now in the New Store Concept;
• EBITDA of £51.0m, £0.8m ahead of 2014;
• EBIT of £33.2m, down from £35.4m reflecting the impact of store 
development and transformation programmes; 
• Adjusted Consolidated Net Income of £19.0m vs £22.9m last 
year; and 
• EBITDA Cash Conversion of 96.5%.
In light of the level of performance achieved in 2015 against 
objectives that were set, the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committee approved bonus payments of c.21% of salary to the 
CEO and c.9% of salary to the CFO. 
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee is pleased to confirm 
that all remuneration payments to Directors made during the year 
have been in line with the Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM. The Committee is satisfied that 
the Policy has proved fit for purpose, reflecting the long-term 
performance of the Company and remains appropriate to continue 
to be implemented going forward.
I hope that you find the Remuneration Report helpful, clear and 
informative and that you will support the resolutions to approve 
the Remuneration Report at the 2016 AGM.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
The following sets out the Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”) for Directors of the Company. This Policy was approved by shareholders at the 
2015 AGM and took effect from that date, 27 May 2015. Since the Policy has a maximum term of three years, the Committee is not seeking 
approval for it this year and it is set out in the report for reference only. There have been no changes to the Policy and the Committee intends 
that it remains in effect until the 2018 AGM. For clarity, we have updated the Policy to reflect 2016 figures where relevant.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the Executive Directors is set by the Remuneration and Nominations Committee under delegated powers from 
the Board.
POLICY TABLE
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary To recognise the 
responsibilities, experience 
and ability of our talent 
in a competitive global 
environment, keeping our 
people focused on and 
passionate about the brand.
The Committee sets base 
salaries within the same 
framework as those for all 
other employees taking 
into account a range of 
factors, including:
• the individual’s 
skills, performance 
and experience;
• their overall contribution 
to the business 
during the year;
• the cost to the Company;
• salary increases 
awarded across the 
Group as a whole;
• the external economic 
climate; and
• external benchmark 
data at other global 
companies of similar 
size and/or global reach 
within relevant sectors 
and/or companies with 
a high growth profile.
Base salaries are normally 
reviewed, although not 
necessarily increased, 
annually. Base salaries 
may be reviewed more 
frequently at the discretion 
of the Committee.
The Committee considers 
the impact of any base 
salary increase on the total 
remuneration package.
Salaries for Executive 
Directors are targeted 
at around the median 
for the peer group.
Whilst there is no 
maximum salary, any 
increases will normally be 
in line with the range of 
increase for all employees 
across the Group.
The Committee retains the 
flexibility to award increases 
above this level in certain 
circumstances, for example:
• to reflect the individual’s 
development and 
performance in the role;
• to reflect a significant 
increase in the 
individual’s role or 
responsibility; and
• where a new recruit or 
promoted employee’s 
salary has been set 
lower than the market 
level for such a role 
and larger increases 
are justified in the 
Committee’s opinion as 
the individual becomes 
established in the role.

Long-Term 
Incentive Plan
To incentivise and reward 
participants for the delivery 
of long-term performance 
and align the interests 
of Executive Directors 
with our shareholders.
Under the long-term 
incentive plan, awards 
of shares may be 
granted, which normally 
vest subject to the 
continued employment 
of the participant for a 
five year period from 
the date of grant.
Long-term incentive awards 
are normally granted in the 
form of conditional shares or 
options with a total exercise 
price of £1 (or such higher 
amount as determined by 
the Committee at grant). 
They may however be 
awarded in other forms if it 
is considered appropriate.
Unvested awards are 
subject to malus (details 
set out later in this report).
Dividend equivalents may 
accrue over the five year 
vesting period. These 
will normally be paid in 
shares on a cumulative 
reinvestment basis.
The Committee may 
adjust and amend 
awards in accordance 
with the plan rules.
The Committee calibrates 
long-term incentive share 
awards for participants as 
a fixed number of shares.
The Committee will 
determine annual award 
levels for each of the 
Executive Directors 
taking into account its 
philosophy that the total 
compensation opportunity 
for Executive Directors 
should be positioned at 
around the upper quartile 
of an appropriate peer 
group (as determined 
by the Committee).
The maximum award to 
any individual in respect 
of any one financial year 
will be over no more than 
2,500,000 shares. Details 
of the awards in respect 
of each financial year will 
be disclosed in the Annual 
Remuneration Report.
Vesting of awards is subject 
to continued employment.
NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
DISCRETION TO HONOUR ALL PRIOR COMMITMENTS
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the terms were agreed before 
this Policy came into effect or prior to an individual being appointed a Director of the Company and where the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes “payments” include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares 
(including awards granted prior to and shortly after Admission of the Company (including the JC PLC Share Award and the One-Off Share 
Award as detailed below)), in line with the terms of the payment that were agreed at the time the award was granted.
JC PLC SHARE AWARD 
Prior to Admission, a co-investment plan was operated which required executives to invest in shares of Choo Luxury Holdings Limited. In 
return for the participant’s investment in these shares, they were granted matching phantom (i.e. cash-settled) options which participated in 
the growth in the value of the Company from the date of the investment to the end of the vesting period. 
On Admission of the Company, participants exercised a portion of their phantom options. The remaining phantom options were surrendered 
by participants. Following Admission of the Company, participants were granted awards in the form of an option with a nominal total exercise 
price of £1 or conditional share awards. The number of shares awarded was linked to the Black-Scholes value of the phantom options 
surrendered. These awards will normally become exercisable (or will vest) in equal tranches in July 2016, July 2017 and July 2018 subject to 
the participant’s continued employment with the Group. Details of the outstanding awards made to the CEO under the plan are set out in the 
Annual Remuneration Report. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

ONE-OFF SHARE AWARD
Following Admission of the Company, selected senior management 
and the Executive Directors of the Company were granted a one-off 
award in the form of an option with a nominal total exercise price of 
£1 or conditional shares, which normally vest 50% on the fifth and 
50% on the sixth anniversary of the date of grant subject to the 
participant’s continued employment with the Group. The CFO’s award 
vests in equal tranches on the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversary of the 
date of grant, subject to his continued employment with the Group. 
Details of the outstanding awards made to Executive Directors under 
the plan are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report.
REMUNERATION AND NOMINATIONS COMMIT TEE DISCRETION IN 
REL ATION TO FUTURE OPERATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY
In the event of a variation of share capital, demerger, dividend in 
specie, special dividend or similar event, the Committee may adjust 
or amend awards in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
If the Company has been or will be affected by a demerger, dividend 
in specie, special dividend or other transaction which will affect the 
current or future value of the Company’s shares, awards may vest to 
the extent the Committee determines, which may include awards 
being time pro-rated if the Committee considers it appropriate. 
The Committee retains the discretion to amend performance targets 
in exceptional business or regulatory circumstances or to vary such 
targets if acting fairly and reasonably if it considers it appropriate to 
do so. If discretion is exercised in this way the Committee may 
consult with major shareholders as appropriate.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for 
example for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
MALUS 
Under the malus provision, the Committee can reduce awards that 
have not yet vested. Malus may apply where stated in the Policy 
table above.
The circumstances in which malus would apply are set out below:
• where there has been a material misstatement of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the financial year 
during which the award was granted and/or for any subsequent 
financial year ending before either the last date when the award 
becomes exercisable or the final vesting date;
• where there has been serious reputational damage to the 
Company as a result of the participant’s actions or the actions 
of a member of the team for which the participant is directly 
responsible;
• where the participant has deliberately misled the Company, the 
Company’s shareholders or the market regarding the Company’s 
financial performance; or
• gross misconduct. 
CL AW BACK
The Committee can reclaim bonus payments made from 2016 
onwards, for a period of up to two years post the payment date  
in the following circumstances:
• where there has been a material misstatement of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the financial year to 
which the bonus payment relates; or
• gross misconduct.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND APPROACH TO TARGET SET TING
The performance measures for the annual bonus are set by the 
Remuneration and Nominations Committee on an annual basis 
to reflect the Group’s financial objectives for any given year. 
The performance targets applied to the annual bonus are reviewed 
annually, based on a number of internal reference points (including the 
budget for the financial year and prior year performance) and external 
reference points (including consensus forecasts, forecasts for the 
wider luxury industry as well as the wider economic environment). 
The Committee believes that the payouts under the bonus plan 
should only be received for outperformance. Given the level of 
stretch in the performance targets for the annual bonus at all levels, 
the Committee considers it appropriate to set payouts for “target” 
performance at up to 75% of the maximum. Maximum awards will 
only be earned where the performance of the Group has significantly 
exceeded expectations.
The following sets out the performance measures that will be used 
for the annual bonus for 2016:
MEASURES  
• revenue growth;
• net income growth; and
• reduction in net working capital as a percentage of revenue.
WHY
The measures were chosen to support the Company’s key financial 
objectives for 2016 of:
• growth;
• margin expansion; and 
• strong cash flow generation. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS AND SHAREHOLDER ALIGNMENT
The Committee believes that the long-term incentive plan should 
primarily be used as a tool to align the interests of the management 
team with those of the Company’s shareholders. 
In order to achieve this primary objective and to ensure that the 
long-term incentive plan acts as a strong motivation and retention 
tool, encouraging individuals to remain in long-term employment with 
the Company, the Committee considers it appropriate to grant 
long-term incentive awards that are subject to an extended vesting 
period (i.e. five years from the date of grant) rather than granting 
awards which are subject to performance over a shorter period 
(i.e. three years from the date of grant), which the Committee 
considers may drive shorter-term behaviours.
To emphasise the link between the management team and 
shareholders, the Committee also encourages the Executive 
Directors to build up significant shareholdings in the Company. 
Executive Directors are therefore expected to build up a significant 
shareholding in the Company over the seven years following 
Admission. The shareholding guideline for the CEO is 500%  
of base salary and for the CFO is 200% of base salary.

SCENARIO CHARTS
The regulations require the inclusion of a scenario chart which sets out what each of the Executive Directors could receive for varying levels 
of performance in respect of the financial year. The following chart has been updated to reflect the 2016 remuneration package. 
The Committee does not currently intend to grant a long-term incentive award in respect of 2016 and as such no determination has yet been 
made on the number of shares that would be granted to each of the Executive Directors under the long-term incentive plan. The following 
chart therefore only includes the value of base salary, pension, other benefits and allowances and the annual bonus.

The above charts are based on the following assumptions:
• Below threshold is based on fixed pay only, which includes 2016 base salary, pension (assuming both of the Executive Directors 
participate in the pension) and other benefits and allowances. For simplicity, the normal maximum other benefit and allowances cap 
of £200,000 has been used. It is noted that the actual level of benefits will vary by year.
• Target includes fixed pay (as noted above) and target bonus opportunity (50% of the maximum).
• Maximum includes fixed pay (as noted above) and the maximum bonus opportunity. 
• The Committee does not currently intend to grant a long-term incentive award in respect of 2016. The value of long-term incentives 
has therefore been excluded from the above. 
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Purpose Approach to fees
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors – fees
To attract and retain high-calibre  
Non-Executive Directors.
Fees are set at a market appropriate rate with reference to fees paid to other Non-
Executive Directors at companies of a similar size to the Company and to reflect the time 
commitment and the personal contribution expected from Non-Executive Directors. Fees 
are normally reviewed annually.
The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Board based on a recommendation from 
the Remuneration and Nominations Committee. The Chairman is paid a single fee for all 
responsibilities.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board based on a 
recommendation from the Chairman. Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee for 
their role. Additional fees may be paid for additional Board duties such as chairmanship  
of a committee and the SID role.
Fees are paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman are expected to invest 
50% of their net of tax fees in the Company’s shares. Any investment at Admission is 
recognised as a prepayment of such investment of fees.
Fees paid are subject to a maximum cap, which is stated in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. Any changes in this would be subject to shareholder approval.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors  
– other benefits
To enable the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors to undertake their roles.
Reasonably incurred expenses will be reimbursed. Additional fees or benefits may be 
provided, where appropriate, at the discretion of the Board.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive 
arrangements operated by the Company. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NEW HIRES
The remuneration policy for new hires has been updated to reflect 
the clarificatory announcement made on its operation on 8 May 2015.
The Committee aims to attract, motivate and retain Executive 
Directors with the required expertise to develop and deliver the 
business strategy, while at the same time ensuring that the 
remuneration arrangements offered are in the best interests 
of both the Company and its shareholders. 
In determining the appropriate remuneration arrangements for a new 
recruit, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors, 
including but not limited to, the individual’s skills and expertise, local 
market practice, appropriate market data and the individual’s existing 
remuneration package. 
In cases of hiring a new recruit to the Board (including an internal 
promote), the Committee will ensure that the remuneration 
arrangements are in line with the approved remuneration policy and 
all its elements as set out in the Policy table above. The ongoing 
annual remuneration arrangements for new Executive Directors will 
therefore comprise:
• base salary;
• suitable pension and other benefits and allowances (which may 
include a relocation allowance where the Committee considers 
it appropriate);
• an annual bonus opportunity; and
• a long-term incentive award. 
The maximum ongoing level of annual variable remuneration which 
may be awarded to a new executive shall therefore be limited to the 
levels set out in the Policy table (i.e. 200% of salary for the annual 
bonus and 2,500,000 shares under the long-term incentive plan) for 
Executive Directors, excluding buy-out awards.
The Committee retains the flexibility to undertake the following 
actions, as appropriate, in the best interests of the Company and 
therefore shareholders:
• For external appointments, the Committee may offer additional 
cash and/or share awards (buy-out awards) to take account of 
remuneration relinquished when leaving a former employer. As far 
as possible and appropriate, such payments would reflect the 
nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to 
the relinquished remuneration. Where appropriate, the Committee 
retains the discretion to utilise Listing Rule 9.4.2 for the purpose 
of making such an award.
• For an internal appointment, the Committee would honour any 
contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the 
Executive Director level, even in instances where they would 
not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing Policy at the time 
of appointment.
• As set out in the regulatory information statement on 8 May 2015, 
the Committee may also offer additional cash and/or share-based 
elements to secure an appointment, which will be limited to a 
value equivalent to 2,500,000 shares at the time of such 
appointment. The Committee would determine the performance 
conditions and time horizons that would apply to such awards at 
the time. The Committee would provide full disclosure of the 
rationale for such an award in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
in the year following such an award.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
If a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director is appointed, 
remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with 
those detailed in the remuneration policy for Non-Executive 
Directors above. 
SERVICE CONTRACT AND EXIT PAYMENT POLICY 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive Director service agreements, including for early 
termination, are carefully reviewed by the Committee. The 
Committee does not believe that there should be any element 
of reward for failure.
The Committee’s approach to termination payments is to consider 
each case on an individual basis taking into account any pre-
established contractual agreements (including the provisions of any 
incentive plans), the performance and conduct of the individual and 
the commercial justification for any payments. 
The key terms and conditions of the current Executive Directors, 
as stipulated in their service agreements, are set out below:
NOTICE PERIOD
• Each Executive Director’s service agreement is terminable by 
the Executive Director on six months’ written notice.
• The Company may terminate Pierre Denis’ service agreement 
on 12 months’ written notice.
• The Company may terminate Jonathan Sinclair’s service 
agreement on six months’ written notice.
• For new appointments, the Committee’s policy is that Executive 
Director service agreements will provide up to 12 months’ 
notice by the Company and up to 12 months’ notice by the 
Executive Director.
TERMINATION PAYMENTS
• The Company is entitled to terminate each Executive Director’s 
employment immediately and make a payment in lieu of notice 
comprising the executive’s base salary in respect of the notice 
period (or the remaining part of it) and a sum equal to the value of 
other benefits during the notice period (or the remaining part of it).
• Alternatively, the Company may continue to provide Jonathan 
Sinclair with his contractual benefits for the duration of what 
would have been his notice period (or the remaining part of it).
• The Company may elect at its discretion to make the payment in 
lieu as a lump sum or to pay half the payment in lieu as a lump 
sum and to pay the second half subsequently in equal instalments. 
• A duty to mitigate may apply to the payment in instalments.
ANNUAL BONUS
• Where an Executive Director leaves office during the performance 
period (or after the end of the performance year but before 
payment is made) any bonus will be at the discretion of the 
Committee. Any payment will typically be on a pro rata basis up 
to the termination date, taking into account the extent to which 
any performance targets have been met.
• Under his service contract, other than in certain “bad-leaver” 
circumstances, where the Company gives notice to Pierre Denis, 
he is entitled to a pro rata annual bonus taking into account time in 
employment during the financial year and the extent to which any 
performance targets have been met. 
• Upon voluntary resignation or termination for cause, no bonus 
payment would be made.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
• The treatment of long-term incentive awards is governed by the 
relevant incentive plan.
 
JC PLC SHARE AWARD
• If a participant ceases employment with the Group by reason 
of disability, death or dismissal without cause (including mutual 
agreement) the Committee will determine the number of 
unvested awards that will vest taking into account the proportion 
of time elapsed since the original investment was made under 
the co-investment plan and a pre-agreed pro-rating approach 
for each tranche of the award.
• In other circumstances, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, unvested awards will lapse on cessation 
of employment.
• Awards to the extent that they have vested on cessation of 
employment (or for any reason) or that are allowed to vest 
as referred to above, will be exercisable for a period of up to 
12 months from the date of cessation (or if earlier until the  
end of the option exercise period). 
ONE-OFF SHARE AWARD AND FUTURE AWARDS UNDER THE LONG-TERM 
INCENTIVE PLAN
• Unless the Committee in its sole discretion determines otherwise 
(in which case it will determine the terms on which awards vest 
and may be exercised), if a participant ceases to be employed 
by the Group for any reason, any awards will lapse on cessation 
of employment.
OTHER
• Legal fees and outplacement costs may be paid if the Committee 
considers this commercially appropriate.
CHANGE OF CONTROL
• In the event of a change of control, Executive Directors may 
receive a bonus in respect of the year in which the change of 
control occurs, which, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, will be pro-rated by reference to the time elapsed in 
the bonus year and performance achieved. 
• Long-term incentive awards will normally vest, taking into account 
the time elapsed between grant and vest, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise. Awards may alternatively be exchanged for 
an equivalent award in the acquirer, where appropriate. 
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors and Chairman of the Board have letters 
of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. They 
do not have service contracts.
The Chairman’s letter of appointment states that his appointment is 
expected to last for at least six years, subject to annual re-election 
in general meeting. His appointment is terminable at any time upon 
written notice, in accordance with the Articles of Association, his 
resignation or in accordance with the relationship agreement entered 
into between the Company and JAB Luxury.
The appointments of each Non-Executive Director are for a fixed 
term of six years, subject to annual re-election in general meeting. 
The appointments of all the Non-Executive Directors may be 
terminated at any time upon written notice, in accordance with the 
Articles of Association or upon their resignations. In addition, the 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors appointed pursuant to 
the relationship agreement entered into between the Company and 
JAB Luxury may be terminated in accordance with that agreement.
REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE REST OF THE COMPANY
The remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors outlined 
above are consistent with those for the other employees in the 
Group, although quantum and award opportunities vary by executive 
level. Only the most senior executives in the Group participate in the 
long-term incentive plan.
During its deliberations on executive remuneration, the Committee 
considers the reward framework for all employees worldwide, 
ensuring that the principles applied are consistent with the Executive 
Remuneration Policy. Merit increases awarded to executives are 
determined within the broader context of employee remuneration.
Due to the size and geographical spread of the Group’s operations, 
it does not invite employees to comment on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. 
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee recognises the importance of understanding the 
views of shareholders. The Committee is therefore open to listening 
to the views of our shareholders through the year and at the AGM.
The Committee Chairman speaks with the Company’s largest 
shareholder on the subject of remuneration as and when appropriate. 
The Company’s largest shareholder is very supportive of the 
Company’s philosophy and policy on remuneration. The Committee 
will continue to keep its remuneration policy under review to ensure 
that it remains aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives and 
provides strong alignment with shareholder interests.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

ANNUAL REMUNERATION REPORT
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2016
BASE SALARY
No changes will be made to base salaries for 2016, which will 
continue to be as follows:
Pierre Denis £650,000
Jonathan Sinclair £350,000
PENSION
In respect of Pierre Denis, the Company will contribute up to €50,000 
to the Caisse des Français de l’Etranger. In respect of Jonathan 
Sinclair, the Company will contribute 10% of base salary to the 
Company’s Group Personal Pension Scheme if he contributes at 
least 5% of base salary. 
BENEF ITS
The Committee sets benefits in line with the Policy set out on 
pages 64 to 67. For 2016, each of the Executive Directors will receive 
private medical insurance for himself, his spouse and dependent 
children and life assurance. As agreed as part of his relocation 
arrangements on joining the Group, Pierre Denis will also be 
reimbursed for annual school fees in respect of his children (up  
to a maximum of £18,000 per child) and receive a company car. 
ANNUAL BONUS
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors in 
respect of 2016, which is unchanged from 2015, will be as follows: 
Pierre Denis 120% of base salary
Jonathan Sinclair 50% of base salary
For 2016, the annual bonus opportunity will be based solely on the 
following financial performance metrics: revenue growth (measured 
on a constant exchange rate basis), net income growth and a 
reduction in net working capital as a percentage of revenue. For 
2016, performance below threshold, the bonus payout will be nil. 
For threshold performance, the bonus payout will be 25% of 
maximum and for target performance, the bonus payout will  
be 50% of maximum.
Annual bonus awards will be paid in cash. 
The Committee considers the exact performance targets to be 
commercially sensitive and as such these have not been disclosed 
ahead of the financial year. However, in next year’s Annual Report 
and Financial Statements, the Committee will provide shareholders 
with appropriate context on performance against the performance 
targets and the rationale for any bonus payouts, within commercial 
constraints. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PL AN
There is currently no intention for Executive Directors to participate 
in a further long-term incentive plan in 2016.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The following table sets out the Non-Executive Director fee structure 
for 2016, which remains in line with 2015:
Chairman £150,000
Basic fee for Non-Executive Directors £50,000
Board Committee Chairman £15,000
Senior Independent Director £5,000
Fees will be paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman 
are expected to invest 50% of their net of tax fees in the Company’s 
shares, taking into account any investment prepaid at Admission.

2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
ELEMENTS OF THE SINGLE FIGURE OF REMUNERATION (AUDITED)
BASE SALARY
The values shown in the table represent the amount received since Admission of the Company. Annualised base salaries for the Executive 
Directors following Admission were:
Pierre Denis £650,000
Jonathan Sinclair £350,000
PENSION
For Pierre Denis, this represents the Company’s contribution to the Caisse des Français de l’Etranger. 
Jonathan Sinclair did not participate in the pension arrangements in 2015. 
OTHER BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES
The values shown in the table represent the taxable value of benefits received during the financial year. 
For Pierre Denis this includes: company car, school fees (which is only drawn in respect of two of his three dependent children), private 
healthcare and product allowances. 
For Jonathan Sinclair this includes: private healthcare and product allowances.
ANNUAL BONUS
The value shown in the table reflects the annual bonus earned in respect of performance in the year ended 31 December 2015. The bonus 
was paid in cash.
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus awards in relation to performance during 2015 were measured against a basket of metrics and 
objectives. For Pierre Denis and Jonathan Sinclair, they were weighted 100% on Group financial objectives. 
The table below shows the overall outcome against each of the financial measures. The Board considered the financial performance of the 
Group to be above market for the year and in particular, the Group made strong progress against the revenue target set at the beginning of 
the year, which was considered to be very good performance given the significant headwinds in the luxury market. The stretch absolute 
Adjusted Consolidated Net Income targets set at the beginning of the year were not met nor were the net working capital targets.

As a result of the above performance, the Committee considered it appropriate to pay Pierre Denis a bonus of c.21% of salary and Jonathan 
Sinclair a bonus of c.9% of salary.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
No share awards were granted to the Executive Directors during the financial year.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHAREHOLDINGS (AUDITED)
The Committee recognises the importance of aligning Executive Directors’ and shareholders’ interests through the executives building up 
significant shareholdings in the Company. Executive Directors are therefore expected to build up a significant shareholding in the Company 
over the seven years following Admission. The shareholding guideline for Pierre Denis is 500% of base salary and for Jonathan Sinclair is 
200% of base salary. 
The table below shows the shareholding of each Executive Director against their respective shareholding guideline as at 31 December 2015:

this agreement, Pierre Denis purchased 771,428 shares immediately following Admission of the Company. In order to fund his investment, Pierre Denis has entered into a loan agreement with HSBC, 
pursuant to which he agreed to grant a pledge over 2,771,428 shares to HSBC. Pierre Denis has agreed that he will hold these shares in line with and in the same proportions as the vesting schedule 
for the JC PLC Share Awards.

THE REMUNERATION AND NOMINATIONS COMMIT TEE (UNAUDITED)
As of 31 December 2015, the Committee comprised of two Non-Executive Directors:
• Peter Harf (Chairman)
• Gianluca Brozzetti
The Board has decided that, given the professional background and experience offered by the two members of the Committee, it is not 
necessary to extend membership of the Committee further at this point. This is something that the Board will keep under regular review, 
particularly in light of the recommendation of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee determines and recommends to the Board the Group’s policy on executive remuneration, determines the level of 
remuneration for Executive Directors and the Chairman and other senior executives and prepares the Annual Remuneration Report for 
approval by shareholders at the AGM. The Committee also assists the Board in reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board. 
It is also responsible for reviewing succession plans for the Directors, including the Chairman, the CEO and other senior executives. 
The Committee held three scheduled meetings during 2015 (in March, August and November).
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on executive remuneration matters from Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”). Deloitte 
is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it 
has been objective and independent. Total fees received by Deloitte in relation to the remuneration advice provided to the Committee during 
2015 amounted to £46,400 (excluding VAT) based on the required time commitment.

during the year are shown in note 21 to the financial statements. 
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right

meetings of the Company. The percentage of the issued nominal 
value of the ordinary shares is equal to the total issued nominal 
value of all share capital.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the 
transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions 
of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 22 to the 
financial statements. Shares held by the Jimmy Choo PLC Employee 
Benefit Trust abstain from voting.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the 
Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Companies Acts and related legislation. The

Prior to the IPO in October 2014, the Company and JAB Luxury 
entered into a relationship agreement to regulate the ongoing 
relationship between them (the “Relationship Agreement”). The 
principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the 
Group is capable of carrying on its business for the benefit of the 
shareholders of the Company as a whole and that transactions and 
relationships with JAB Luxury and any of their respective associates 
are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. Further details 
of the Relationship Agreement with regard to the conduct of the 
major shareholder are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on 
page 55 and with regard to the right to appoint Directors, are set out 
on page 55.
DIREC TORS
The Directors of the Company as at 31 December 2015 and their 
interests in the shares of the Company are shown on pages 74  
and 77. 
On 1 August 2015, Anna-Lena Kamenetzky was appointed to the Board 
of the Company as a Non-Executive Director following the resignation 
of Bart Becht on 31 July 2015. Meribeth Parker was appointed on 
1 August 2015 as an Independent Non-Executive Director. On 
13 November 2015, Elisabeth Murdoch was appointed following a 
process to identify new Independent Non-Executive Directors.

Consequently, the Directors currently holding office will all be 
required and all intend to seek re-election at the forthcoming AGM to

shares as permitted under the Articles of Association and under 
statute. No share purchases were made during 2015. 
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS
A summary of how the Group recognises its responsibility to 
colleagues, customers, the environment (including greenhouse gas 
emissions) and community is contained within the Sustainable 
Business Report on pages 37 to 39 which forms part of this report.
GOING CONCERN 
The Board is of the opinion that there is a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. In arriving at this 
conclusion the Board has taken account of current and anticipated 
trading performance, current and anticipated levels of borrowings 
and the availability of borrowing facilities and exposures to and 
management of the financial risks detailed on pages 42 to 44. 
Consequently, the going concern basis has been used in the 
preparation of the Company and Group financial statements.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM will be held on 15 June 2016. The Notice of Annual General 
Meeting is contained in a separate letter from the Chairman 
accompanying this report.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
Annual Report and Financial Statements confirms that:

information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and

as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s

with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
KPMG LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as 
auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This Annual Report and Financial Statements includes forward-
looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve 
known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are 
beyond the Company’s control and all of which are based on the 
Directors’ current beliefs and expectations about future events. 
Forward-looking statements are sometimes identified by the use 
of forward-looking terminology such as “believe”, “expects”, “may”, 
“will”, “could”, “should”, “shall”, “risk”, “intends”, “estimates”, 
“aims”, “plans”, “predicts”, “continues”, “assumes”, “positioned” 
or “anticipates” or the negative thereof, other variations thereon 
or comparable terminology.
These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not

Directors or the Company concerning, amongst other things, the 
results of operations, financial condition, prospects, growth, 
strategies (including continued store roll out plans) and dividend 
policy of the Company and the industry in which it operates. In 
particular, the statements regarding the Company’s strategy and 
other future events or prospects are forward-looking statements.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE 
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group  
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken  
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1. OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED
We have audited the financial statements of Jimmy Choo PLC  
for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 85 to 127.  
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the 
risk of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit was:
REVENUE RECOGNITION (REVENUE £317.9M)
Refer to page 58 (Audit and Risk Committee Report), note 1 
(accounting policy) and note 3 (operating segments).
THE RISK
Revenue is a key performance measure for the Group and a key 
driver for gross margin which is a further key indicator of Group 
performance. The Group generates revenue through a high volume 
of individually small transactions recorded in a number of different 
accounting systems. In addition, consideration must be made of 
any returns.
Due to its materiality in the context of the financial statements as a 
whole, revenue is considered to be one of the areas which had the 
greatest effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of 
resources in planning and completing our audit.
OUR RESPONSE
Our audit procedures in this area included:
• for each of the different accounting systems, testing the design 
and operating effectiveness of key controls around the recognition 
of revenue, including those related to the reconciliation of cash 
receipts to sales records;
• for components representing 69% of the total revenue balance 
for the year we tested the accuracy of sales and that they were 
recorded in the correct period by matching the sale transaction 
through to cash receipt;
• for components covering a further 23% of the revenue balance, 
for example those with a different accounting system, we tested 
the accuracy of sales and that they were recorded in the correct 
period by selecting samples of reconciliations between sales 
transactions and cash receipts and agreeing those reconciliations 
through supporting documentation;
• selecting certain manual journals posted to revenue across the 
accounting systems based on criteria such as value and critically 
assessing whether these journals were appropriate by agreeing 
to supporting documentation; and 
• challenging the adequacy of the Group’s provision for returns 
across all revenue streams in the light of the historical pattern 
of credits given for returns.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF JIMMY CHOO PLC ONLY
3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALIT Y AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE 
OF OUR AUDIT
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 
£1.5m, determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit 
before tax normalised to exclude net loss on financial instruments 
and exceptional items being £29.6m of which it represents 5%. In 
2014 materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £2.0m with reference to a benchmark of Group loss before tax 
normalised for interest and exceptional costs being £35.7m of which 
it represents 5.6%. 
We report to the Audit and Risk Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.08m, in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 28 reporting components, we subjected 14 to audits 
for Group reporting purposes and two to specified risk-focused audit 
procedures. The latter were not individually financially significant 
enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes, but did 
represent larger components of the Asia region. These Group 
procedures covered 92% of total Group revenue; 97% of total Group 
profits and losses that make up Group profit before taxation; and 
93% of total Group assets. 
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team 
approved the component materiality of £1.2m, having regard to the 
mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The 
Group audit team visited three component locations in the UK and 
the USA to perform the audit work. The work on all of the remaining 
in scope components was performed by component auditors. 
Telephone conference meetings were held with these component 
auditors. At these meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit 
team were discussed in more detail and any further work required by 
the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditor.
4. OUR OPINION ON OTHER MAT TERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES 
ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
5. WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON THE DISCLOSURES OF PRINCIPAL 
RISKS
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ statement of longer-term viability on page 27 
concerning the principal risks, their management and, based on 
that, the Directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s 
continuing in operation over the three years to 2018; or 
• the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning 
the use of the going concern basis of accounting.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

6. WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT IN RESPECT OF THE MAT TERS ON 
WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the Annual Report that contains a 
material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading. In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit and Risk Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ Statement in relation to going concern set out on 
page 79 and the longer-term viability statement set out in the 
Strategic Report on page 27; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Report on page 52 relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the eleven provisions of the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Jimmy Choo PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the “Group”) is a global luxury shoes and accessories 
brand owner, wholesaler and retailer incorporated and domiciled in 
the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU (“Adopted IFRS”).
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, 
been applied consistently to all years presented in these Group 
financial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these 
accounting policies, that have a significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material 
adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note 2.
1.1 MEASUREMENT CONVENTION
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for financial instruments that are measured at revalued 
amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting year, as explained 
in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on 
the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and 
services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that 
price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the 
Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability 
if market participants would take those characteristics into account 
when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value 
for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated 
financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for 
share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of 
IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17 
and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are 
not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value in use 
in IAS 36. 
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements 
are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the 
significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its 
entirety, which are described as follows: 
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly; and
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.2 GOING CONCERN
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a 
going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for 
the foreseeable future. The Group has considerable financial 
resources, together with a strong ongoing trading performance. 
Details of the Group’s liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in note 18. Financial risk management objectives, details 
of financial instruments and hedging activities and exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk are described in note 23. 
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s forecasts and projections. 
These include the assumptions around the Group’s products and 
markets, expenditure commitments, expected cash flows and 
borrowing facilities. 
Taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance and after making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors consider it 
appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the financial statements.
1.3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
On 16 October 2014, the Company obtained control of the entire 
share capital of Choo Luxury Group Limited by way of a share-for-
share exchange with one share in the Company being exchanged for 
each share in Choo Luxury Group Limited. There were no changes in 
rights or proportion of control exercised as a result of this transaction. 
Although the share-for-share exchange resulted in a change in legal 
ownership, in substance the comparative financial statements reflect 
the continuation of the pre-existing Group, headed by Choo Luxury 
Group Limited. 
SUBSIDIA RIES
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group 
controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential 
voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is 
the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised 
profits on transactions between Group companies are eliminated 
in preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Employee benefit trusts that are controlled by the Group are 
consolidated on the same basis as subsidiaries as set out above.
1.4 ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 
between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Joint 
ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has 
joint control.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
91
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CON TINUED
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised 
at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on 
acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The 
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total 
comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted 
investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control 
commences until the date that significant influence or joint control 
ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an 
equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced 
to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of an investee.
The Group currently has one associate, for which equity accounting 
is applied. In addition, the Group has one joint venture which is 
consolidated as a subsidiary, as the Directors have concluded that 
the Group has control over the entity by virtue of its control over 
voting rights.
1.5 FOREIGN CURRENCY
FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATIONAL CURRENCIES
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s 
presentational currency.
TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective 
functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the 
functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates 
the fair value was determined.
TRANSL ATION OF THE RESULTS OF OVERSEAS BUSINESSES
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and 
fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the 
Group’s presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. The revenue and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this 
rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates 
of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation 
of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
1.6 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group.
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only 
to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver 
cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or 
financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are 
potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own 
equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity 
instruments, or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for 
a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are 
classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts 
presented in these financial statements for called up share capital 
exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value on the 
consolidated balance sheet when the entity becomes a party  
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is 
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire 
or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred.
I. TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except 
for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The 
amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows and is recognised in the consolidated income statement 
in administrative expenses.
II. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held  
at call with banks with an original maturity of three months or less. 
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash  
and cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts in addition to the 
definition above.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, 
borrowings and other non-current liabilities. All financial liabilities are 
recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for 
derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, except where 
they qualify for hedge accounting and are held at fair value. The 
fair value of the Group’s liabilities held at amortised cost are 
approximately equal to their carrying amount. A financial liability 
is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract 
is discharged, cancelled or expires. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CON TINUED
I. BANK BORROWINGS
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of 
the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the 
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and 
the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method.
Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings and 
the cost of foreign currency forward contracts.
II. TRADE PAYABLES
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except 
for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
III. PUT OPTION LIABILITIES OVER NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST
Put options over shares in subsidiaries or joint ventures held by 
non-controlling interests are recognised initially at fair value through 
equity when granted. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value 
at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in 
the consolidated income statement as other finance expenses 
and income.
IV. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its 
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain 
trading transactions. The principal derivative instruments used are 
forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly 
probable cash flows in relation to future sales and product purchases.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain 
or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
1.7 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance 
leases. Operating lease payments are accounted for as described 
at 1.16 Operating leases below.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are 
as follows:
Leasehold improvements between 2 and 10 years
Fixtures and fittings, plant and machinery between 3 and 15 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date or if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
1.8 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum 
of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, 
liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree 
and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss 
as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the 
acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. 
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business 
combination includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured 
at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair 
value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement 
period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding 
adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are 
adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during 
the “measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from 
the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed 
at the acquisition date. 
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period 
adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is 
classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is 
not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 or IAS 37 Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with 
the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. 
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s 
previously held interests in the acquired entity is remeasured to its 
acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the 
acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit 
or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest 
were disposed of. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
93
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CON TINUED
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete 
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, 
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or 
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if 
known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
1.9 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS OF NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not 
result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with 
owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is 
recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to 
non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the 
net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid 
or received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are 
adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the 
owners of the parent.
1.10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL
GOODW IL L
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised 
but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from 
synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
goodwill and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed in 
subsequent years.
For further details see 1.12 Impairment excluding inventories and 
deferred tax assets.
BR A ND
Brands acquired in a business combination are recognised at 
fair value at the acquisition date and are carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment.
The Jimmy Choo brand is the only intangible asset that is considered 
to have an indefinite useful life on the basis that:
• the brand is central to the business strategy, differentiating the 
products in the market through building a reputation for excellence 
and it is not considered realistic to abandon the brand given its 
importance to the business; 
• the brand does not face technological obsolescence and the 
luxury market is not a sector with a definite life;
• the Group is able to protect the brand and associated products 
from counterfeiters or other infringements through securing 
protection of its intellectual property and enforcing this through 
litigation where necessary; and 
• the Group dedicates sufficient resources to support the brand and 
plans to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This includes 
investment across all forms of media to convey the fundamental 
tenets of the brand.
The brand value is not amortised but subject to an impairment 
test which is performed annually or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may  
not be recoverable.
For further details see 1.12 Impairment excluding inventories and 
deferred tax assets.
KEY MONEY
Key money paid to the outgoing tenant to enter a leasehold property 
is stated within intangible assets at cost, net of amortisation and any 
provision for impairment. Amortisation is charged on key money at 
rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value 
(which in some locations and geographies equates to cost) on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The cost of securing and renewing design patents, trademarks and 
other intangible assets is capitalised at purchase price and amortised 
by equal annual instalments over the period in which benefits are 
expected to accrue. The useful economic life of these assets is 
determined on a case by case basis, in accordance with the terms 
of the underlying agreement and the nature of the asset.
A MOR TISATION
Amortisation is charged to the statement of profit and loss on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite 
useful life including the Jimmy Choo brand and goodwill are 
systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. 
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available 
for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Trademarks between 5 and 10 years
Software between 3 and 7 years
1.11 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is based on the weighted average principle and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs 
in bringing them to their existing location and condition. 
Where necessary, provision is made to reduce the cost to no more 
than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition 
of inventory, as well as anticipated utilisation and saleability. 
1.12 IMPAIRMENT EXCLUDING INVENTORIES AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS
FINANCIAL ASSETS (INCLUDING RECEIVABLES)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is 
assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if 
objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event has a negative 
effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be 
estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at 
amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on 
the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding 
of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of 
impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is 
reversed through profit or loss. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CON TINUED
NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite 
useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable 
amount is estimated each year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is 
the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from 
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The 
goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of 
impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”). 
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that 
the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at 
which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes which 
does not exceed the level of individual operating segments. Goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs 
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset 
or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units 
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the 
units on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect 
of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior years are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss 
has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount, only to the extent that the asset’s carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised.
1.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PL ANS
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under 
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and 
has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement 
in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
SHORT-TERM BENEFITS
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an 
undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid 
under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
1.14 PROVISIONS
A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is 
material using a pre-tax market rate adjusted for risks specific to 
the liability.
1.15 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales 
related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied (less 
returns, trade discounts and allowances) and royalties receivable.
Wholesale sales are recognised when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, with 
provisions made for expected returns and allowances. Retail sales, 
returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with 
customers. Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are 
calculated based on historical return levels.
Royalty revenue from licensing agreements is recognised on an 
accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant 
agreement (provided that it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably).
1.16 OPERATING LEASES
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease 
except where another more systematic basis is more representative 
of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset 
are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are 
recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into an 
operating lease such incentives are recognised as a liability. Lease 
incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in 
which economic benefits from the lease are consumed.
Premiums paid to landlords to secure operating leases are recognised 
as assets and depreciated to residual value over the lease term.
1.17 EXCEPTIONAL COSTS
Exceptional items are non-recurring items which are outside the 
normal scope of the Group’s ordinary activities such as costs arising 
from a fundamental restructuring of the Group’s operations or costs 
that are considered to be one-off in nature. Such items are disclosed 
separately within the consolidated income statement.
1.18 FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES
Financial expenses comprise interest payable and changes in the 
fair value of financial liabilities that are recognised in the income 
statement. Financial income comprises interest receivable on funds 
invested and changes in the fair value of financial assets that are 
recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss 
as it accrues, using the effective interest method.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

1.19 TAXATION
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement and 
consolidated statement of other comprehensive income except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in 
which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable 
income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of 
goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries 
to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. 
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
on either the same taxable entities or different taxable entities where 
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
1.20 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
CASH-SET TLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES
Share-based payment transactions in which the Group receives 
goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other 
assets that is based on the price of the Group’s equity instruments 
are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments. The fair 
value of the amount payable to employees is recognised as an 
expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period 
in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. 
The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at 
settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability 
are recognised as staff costs in the Consolidated Income Statement.
EQUIT Y-SET TLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES
Share-based payment transactions in which the Group receives 
goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer its own equity 
instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based 
payments. The payments are assessed at their fair value on the grant 
date. The cost of the share-based incentives is recognised as an 
expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The estimate of the number of options expected 
to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.
When options and awards are exercised, they are settled through 
awards of shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust. The proceeds 
received from the exercises, net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs, are credited to equity. 
1.21 OWN SHARES RESERVE 
Where the Company or its subsidiaries (including the Jimmy Choo 
PLC Employee Benefit Trust) purchase the Company’s own equity 
shares, the cost of those shares, including any attributable 
transaction costs, is presented within the own shares reserve 
as a deduction in shareholders’ equity in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
1.22 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS
ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS
With effect from 1 January 2015, the Group has adopted the 
following standards, amendments and improvements endorsed 
by the IASB during 2014 and 2015:
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle
FUTURE ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS

following standards and interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and 
in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
IFRS 11 (Amendments) Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests 
in Joint Operations 
IAS 16 and 38 Classification of Acceptable Methods 
of Depreciation and Amortisation

The Group chose not to adopt any of the above standards and 
interpretations early. It is anticipated that adoption of these standards 
and interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact 
on the Group’s financial results except for the following standards 
that may alter measurement and disclosure:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and additions to IFRS 9
• IFRS 16 Leases
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and in any 
future year impacted. The key judgements and estimates employed 
in the financial statements are considered below. 
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE 
ASSE TS
On an annual basis, the Group is required to perform an impairment 
review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill and other 
indefinite life intangible assets is less than its recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future 
cash flows, which include estimates of future performance. Details 
of assumptions used in the impairment tests are detailed in note 11.
KEY MONEY VALUATION
Judgement is required in estimating the residual value of key money 
paid to outgoing tenants to secure a leasehold property. In certain 
locations, the residual value of key money is considered to be equal 
to cost, either due to legal protection offered to tenants in that 
jurisdiction or because it is common practice to at least recover 
the amounts paid at the end of the lease due to the existence of  
an active market for operating leases of prime luxury real estate. 
VALUATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The assessment of fair value in a business combination requires the 
recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities in the acquired business. The key judgements 
required are the identification of intangible assets meeting the 
recognition criteria of IAS 38 and their attributable fair values. The 
key assumptions in relation to the brand valuation are the Directors’ 
best estimate of its life and the royalty and discount rate used in 
its valuation.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The vesting of awards granted under the Group’s share-based 
payments scheme is dependent upon continued employment 
within the Group over the vesting period. Judgement is required 
in determining the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
TA X ATION
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon 
future taxable income and the expected recoverability of the balance. 
The estimate will include assumptions regarding future income 
streams of the Group and the future movement in corporation tax 
rates in the respective jurisdictions. The estimation of liabilities in 
respect of current taxation depends on estimates and judgements 
in respect of whether or not and the extent to which items of 
income and expenditure will be taxable. 
3. OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Board of 
Directors. Internal management reports are reviewed by the CODM. 
Key measures used to evaluate segment performance are revenue 
and segment contribution to EBITDA. Management believes that 
these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance 
of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions as 
central costs are not allocated across the segments.
The CODM considers the Group’s segments to be its three channels 
to market, being Retail (including online), Wholesale and Other. 
Retail revenue is generated through the sale of luxury goods to end 
clients through Jimmy Choo directly operated stores in Europe, USA, 
Canada, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan and 
through the Group’s website.
Wholesale revenue is generated through the sale of luxury goods to 
distribution partners, multi-brand department stores and speciality 
stores worldwide.
Other revenue is predominantly generated through receipt of 
royalties from the Group’s global licensees of Jimmy Choo branded 
fragrance, sunglasses and eyewear products.
There are no material inter-segment transactions.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

5. EXCEPTIONAL COSTS CON TINUED
Replatforming costs represent costs associated with strengthening product development (in the Florence facility), reinforcing the team in 
key functions, undertaking regional buyouts in Asia and scaling up the information systems capability and office infrastructure to support 
the growth strategy, as well as associated streamlining of the organisation.
IPO costs represent costs directly associated with the listing of the Group on the London Stock Exchange in October 2014. 31 December 
2014 IPO costs includes an exceptional charge of £1.6m in respect of the accelerated vesting of the Group’s cash-settled share-based 
payment scheme at IPO (note 22). 
Replatforming and IPO costs are considered to be one-off in nature and are therefore appropriate to recognise as exceptional costs.
6. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year. There were no shares issued for the year. The difference between basic and diluted earnings per share is not 
material.
In order to provide a measure of underlying performance, the Group has chosen to present an additional illustrative measure of Adjusted 
earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share has been calculated using Adjusted Consolidated Net Income (see note 29) and dividing 
by the number of ordinary shares outstanding as at 31 December 2015.

11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS CON TINUED
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually or where there is an indication that 
goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
Goodwill of £294.2m arising on the acquisition of Passion Holdings Limited on 1 July 2011 is allocated to the groups of cash generating 
units acquired that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. This 
is consistent with the determination of operating segments. For the purpose of impairment testing, the value-in-use of each operating 
segment is calculated as described below. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions of J. Choo Hong Kong JV Limited, the business line of Jimmy Choo in Shanghai Kutu Trading Co. Ltd., 
J. Choo Russia JV Limited and the current period acquisition described in note 13 is allocated to the Retail segment for impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Studio Luxury S.r.l. is allocated to the Other segment for impairment testing. 
The Jimmy Choo brand, which was valued at £263.8m on the acquisition of Passion Holdings Limited on 1 July 2011 is considered to have an 
indefinite useful life and accordingly is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or where an indicator of impairment is identified. The brand 
is fundamental to the operations of the Group as a whole and is therefore not allocated to cash generating units but tested for impairment at 
the Group level. 
IMPAIRMENT TESTING
The value-in-use is represented by the discounted value of future cash flows that are expected from continuous use of the assets associated 
with the cash generating units and by the terminal value attributable to them. In assessing the value-in-use, the cash flow projections were 
taken from the Group’s five year business plan, approved by the Board of Directors. The cash flow projections are subject to key assumptions 
in respect of discount rates, future revenue, margin and EBITDA growth. The Directors have reviewed and approved the assumptions 
inherent in the model as part of the annual budget process using historical experience and considering economic and business risks 
facing the Group.
The terminal value was determined using a perpetuity long-term growth rate in line with macro-economic estimates of 3%.
In assessing the Group’s value-in-use, a discount rate of 7.5% (2014: 9.9%) has been applied to the groups of cash generating units. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations by assuming a reasonable change in the discount rate, revenue 
growth rates, EBITDA margins and terminal growth rates. The sensitivity analysis indicated significant headroom between the recoverable 
amount under these scenarios and the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles.
No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill or the brand in any of the years presented as, for each 
cash generating unit and the Group as a whole, the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

13. ACQUISITIONS OF SUBSIDIARIES CON TINUED
The book value of the acquired assets was equal to fair value.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition because of the growth potential of the business, the future income generating potential of the assets 
acquired, the workforce and the value of other immaterial intangible assets acquired. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be 
deductible for income tax purposes.

Invoices to customers are generally due for payment within 30 days of the end of the month of issue. The Group’s experience is that the 
majority of customers pay within that timeframe. Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts which are past due at the reporting 
date (see below for aged analysis). In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit 
quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The Group has recognised an allowance 
for doubtful receivables at each reporting date by considering the recoverability of each receivable.

22. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
During the year, the Group operated two equity-settled share-based compensation schemes for its Directors and employees. In the prior 
year, the Group also operated a cash-settled share-based payment scheme, which was cancelled on the IPO of the Group in October 2014. 
Details of each of these schemes are set out in this note.
CASH-SETTLED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
PHANTOM OPTION SCHEME
The Group operated a long-term incentive plan open to invited employees of the Group (the “Participants”), which was accounted for as 
a cash-settled share-based payment scheme. The Participants in the scheme were required to purchase equity in Choo Luxury Holdings 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group (the “Subsidiary”) in order to receive matching phantom options over the shares of 
the Subsidiary. 
A put and call agreement existed between the Participants and the Subsidiary which enabled the Participants to put their equity shares back 
to the Subsidiary at fair value. The Subsidiary could call the shares in the event of a change in control or if the Participants left employment 
with the Group. The put and call agreement was accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment scheme as the Participants were 
required to remain employed by the Group in order to participate in any increase in the fair value of the underlying equity shares. 
The IPO of the Group in October 2014 triggered the vesting conditions of all the options. Of these, 5,387,877 options were exercised at a fair 
value of £1.40, calculated with reference to the IPO price. The remaining 3,571,713 were cancelled and replaced by the equity-settled JC PLC 
Scheme detailed below. 
At IPO, the Participants also exchanged their shares in Choo Luxury Holdings Limited for shares in Jimmy Choo PLC via a series of share-for-
share exchanges. The put and call agreement over the Participants’ shares in Choo Luxury Holdings Limited lapsed at IPO. The liability of 
£3.5m that had previously been recognised in respect of the put and call agreement was therefore reclassified to equity.

EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
JC PLC SHARE AWARD
Following the partial vesting of the Phantom Option Scheme at IPO in October 2014, 3,571,713 options were cancelled and a new 
equity-settled share-based payment scheme implemented (the “JC PLC Share Award”). The number of shares awarded under the JC PLC 
Share Award was calculated by reference to the value attributed to the proportion of previously held phantom options. For each phantom 
option forfeited, Participants received 0.55 share awards, with a nominal exercise price of £1 in total for each exercise. 
The options are due to vest in three stages: one third are exercisable on 1 July 2016; one third are exercisable on 1 July 2017; and 
the remaining third are exercisable on 1 July 2018. The vesting of these options is dependent upon continued employment over the 
vesting period. 
Any vested but unexercised options will automatically lapse on 21 October 2024.

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Directors have overall responsibility for the oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal process for reviewing and 
managing risk in the business has been developed. A register of strategic and operational risk is maintained and reviewed by the Directors, 
who also monitor the status of agreed actions to mitigate key risks.
CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from wholesale customers and the Group’s foreign exchange 
forward contracts.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number of different 
customers. The Group has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. 
The Group only sells to wholesale customers who are creditworthy and mitigates risk in certain markets by trading on terms with 
accelerated payments, bank guarantees and letters of credit, as well as adopting credit insurance when appropriate. The Group monitors 
the creditworthiness of counterparties using publicly available information. As a result, the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant 
and default rates have historically been very low. Sales to retail customers are made in cash or through major credit cards. An ageing of 
overdue receivables is included in note 17.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain 
derivative instruments. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to 
the carrying value of these instruments if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation. The Group’s policy 
is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties, who are either party to the Group’s banking syndicate, or who are 
creditworthy counterparties.
LIQUIDIT Y RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group ensures that it has 
sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there are sufficient cash or working capital 
facilities to meet the Group’s cash requirements. 
The risk is measured by review of forecast liquidity each month to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast 
requirements and by monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no expected significant breaches, which would lead to an 
“Event of Default”. Cash flow forecasts are submitted monthly to the Directors. These continue to demonstrate the strong cash generating 
ability of the business and its ability to operate within existing agreed banking facilities. There have been no breaches of covenants during 
the reported years. For further details of the Group’s borrowings see note 18.
All short-term trade and other payables, accruals, bank overdrafts and borrowings mature within one year or less. The carrying value of all 
financial liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows.
The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s non-current financial liabilities, excluding derivatives used for 
hedging, is as follows:
2015
£000
2014
£000
In more than one year, but not more than two years (9,059) (12,299)
In more than two years, but not more than three years (116,659) (5,862)
In more than three years, but not more than four years (6,045) (116,408)
In more than four years, but not more than five years (6,265) (6,115)
In more than five years – (6,195)
Total non-current financial liabilities (138,028) (146,879)
MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income. 
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest and currency risk. 
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations mainly with regard to the interest expense on the debt carried by Choo Luxury 
Finance Limited. The Group’s bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges linked to EURIBOR/LIBOR plus a margin. The Group’s 
policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants and business plan.
Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a change in interest rates of ±1% is included on page 116.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to the foreign exchange risk which can negatively impact revenue, costs, margins 
and profit.

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES CON TINUED
The Group transacts with its suppliers of finished goods, based in continental Europe, in Euro. In addition to this, the Group is exposed 
to transaction risk on the translation and conversion of surplus US Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan balances, 
generated by its directly owned stores globally into Euro and Pounds Sterling. The Group’s policy allows these exposures to be hedged  
for up to 12 months forward in order to create sufficient certainty to price different collections and assure the business cash flows.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts and nil cost options. 
These contracts are put in place as part of the Group’s treasury management strategy. It enables merchandisers to be given targeted 
exchange rates for products, which are set aligned with the hedge rates for future collections, typically 9 to 12 months before cash flows 
crystallise. In addition, the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign currency gains and  
losses arising on the Euro denominated portion of its external bank facilities.
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date in currencies other 
than the local currency of operation. Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and other amounts to be received 
or paid in cash. Amounts exclude intercompany balances which eliminate on consolidation.

PENSION LIABILIT Y RISK
The Group has no association with any defined benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in 
respect of such a scheme. 
CAPITAL RISK 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to optimise returns to its 
shareholders. The Board’s policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future growth. The Directors regularly monitor the Group’s level of capital to ensure that this can be achieved.
Cash is used to fund the Group’s continued investment and growth of the global brand. It is also used to make routine outflows of capital 
expenditure and tax. The Group has access to a revolving credit facility of €91.6m (£67.6m) of which €21.3m (£15.7m) was utilised at 
31 December 2015 (2014: €14.9m (£11.7m) utilised).
The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within its committed bank credit facilities and has been in compliance 
throughout the reported years. 
FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values. The majority of the financial assets are current. The 
majority of the current interest-bearing liabilities are at variable interest rates. The fair values of the non-current fixed rate interest-bearing 
liabilities are not materially different from their carrying amounts.
The fair value of non-current fixed rate interest-bearing liabilities is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest 
cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. 
The fair value of derivative instruments (currency forwards and options) is determined based on current and available market data. Pricing 
models commonly used in the market are used, taking into account relevant parameters such as forward rates, spot rates, discount rates, 
yield curves and volatility.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
Financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised into the below levels, reflecting the significance of the inputs used in estimating 
the fair values:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments; JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
116
23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES CON TINUED
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable either directly 
or indirectly from market data;
Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs, this category includes all instruments where the valuation technique 
includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation.
The Group recognises derivative financial instruments at fair value. No other financial instruments are carried at fair value. The derivative 
financial instruments have been measured using a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
2015
£000

Cash and cash equivalents 13,838 12,045 
Trade and other receivables 42,659 41,087

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SENSITIVIT Y ANALYSIS
In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on its earnings. At the end of 
each reporting year, the effect of hypothetical changes in interest and currency rates is as follows:

reporting year. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given on page 128. 
The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report starting on page 13.
The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling because that is the currency of primary economic environment in which the 
Company operates.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company was incorporated on 1 September 2014 and, therefore, the comparative information presented represents a four month period.
The Company has control over the assets and liabilities of the Jimmy Choo PLC Employee Benefit Trust and accordingly the assets and 
liabilities of the Jimmy Choo PLC Employee Benefit Trust are recognised in the Company financial statements. No profit or loss account 
is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s loss for the period was £5.0m 
(2014: £1.5m), mainly related to share-based payment expenses and staff costs. 
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with Financial Reporting Standards (“FRS”) 100 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council and applicable legal and regulatory requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and reflect the 
following policies which have been adopted and applied consistently.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, in the year 
ended 31 December 2015, the Company has undergone transition from reporting under UK GAAP to FRS 101 as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” 
as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. This transition is not considered to have had a material effect on the financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payment, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash-flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures have been given in the Group accounts of Jimmy Choo PLC.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the process of applying accounting policies, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect  
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with separately below).
RECOVERABILIT Y OF INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES
Determining the recoverability of investments in subsidiaries requires estimation as to whether the investment could be realised for 
consideration at or in excess of the carrying value. In making such estimations, management has regard to the value in use calculations 
of those investments. As of 31 December 2015, the investment in the balance sheet totalled £491.1m (2014: £489.5m).
2. FEES PAYABLE TO THE AUDITOR
Auditor’s remuneration is detailed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
3. STAFF NUMBERS AND COSTS
The Company has no employees other than the Executive Directors. Full details of the Directors’ remuneration and interests are set out  
in the Annual Remuneration Report.

Ladbr okes continues on its journey to 
modernise the business. While we are 
disappointed that the financial results do 
not r eflect the pr ogress we are making, 
the str ategy is the right one.
Board focus
As you would expect the Board has had much 
to consider in the year . We took time to ensure 
that the major deals such as with Playtech, 
the purchase of Betdaq and the entry into the 
Australian market were executed as effectively 
and efficiently as possible. We also took time 
to consider the future of the international 
business as overseas markets open up or 
deregulate. Closer to home we reviewed 
the current regulatory agenda and what 
opportunities and threats are posed to the 
business. The betting and gaming sector 
is constantly changing, technology is driving 
change and politicians are having to react. 
We do not seek special treatment at the hands 
of the regulators but we do want a fair race. 
We are clear that the actions we take today 
in your interests must also be ones which we 
can sustain over a longer time period. We have 
challenged the business to look at key areas 
such as responsible gambling and community 
involvement to see if there is more we should 
be doing. It is pleasing to report that the 
business is responding. From the Boardroom 
to the shop floor we aim to put responsible 
gambling at the heart of the business. It is the 
right thing to do on every level not least because 
as an industry leader we must not be afraid 
to lead by example. That’s why we are giving 
it even greater prominence as a Board and 
introducing it into executive remuneration 
in 2015. Bookmakers have to be a part of the 
fabric of the community , the future sustainability 
of the business is in providing people with 
a safe and responsible environment in which 
to follow a leisure pursuit. 
Right team
On the Board, John Jarvis announced his 
intention to stand down as a non-executive 
director . We would like to thank John for his 
hard work and thoughtful contributions. In 
seeking to replace John we wanted someone 
with experience of UK and international 
business to assist our thinking as we seek to 
grow our footprint internationally. David Martin 
who joined in October has such experience 
and complements the skills we have across 
the Boardroom table, with digital, retail, betting, 
gaming, international operations and brand 
management all healthily represented.
Dear Shareholder
2013 has been a difficult year where our 
business has taken significant strides in key 
areas but failed to deliver the financial results 
that we expected.
From this viewpoint it has been disappointing 
and one where we accept that shareholders’ 
patience has been tested. The numbers for 
the year are stark, operating profit
(1)
 down 
32.9% to £138.3 million and earnings per 
share
(1)
 down 36.4% to 11.7 pence.
However as a Board, we have had to look 
beyond the bare numbers and distinguish 
between those that reflect the vagaries of 
bookmaking and those that are a consequence 
of the journey this business is still on. We must 
not lose sight of the task set by the Board, to 
create a more competitive and sustainable 
business in a rapidly evolving market. Naturally 
we have to accept that against such a backdrop, 
difficult but necessary big decisions create 
short-term pain for longer term benefits. 
Evolving markets
We are under no illusion about the situation 
we are in. Our markets continue to evolve, 
mobile technology continues to drive 
consumer behaviour and the strength of the 
Digital offer continues to become ever more 
important. That is why it is in Digital that we 
see the most opportunity for shareholders. 
It is why the deal with Playtech to bring their 
product, expertise and customer relationship 
management to our Digital business is so 
important. In partnering with a proven market 
leading expert, we are clear that long-term 
shareholder value is being created. However , 
the deal was not without implications, most 
notably in the short-term performance of our 
Digital business as the painful, but necessary, 
steps were taken to ensure the new operations 
could be established and duplication removed. 
In hindsight, perhaps there was too much 
optimism in how fast and how much could 
be achieved but we passionately believe 
the deal with Playtech is a game changer 
for Ladbrokes and shareholders.
There remains much to do but in committing 
to keep the dividend to at least 8.9 pence per 
share for 2014, we are giving you a 
demonstrable sign that we are confident in the 
Company’s ability to deliver over the next year .
As you would expect, there are no bonuses 
or pay rises for our management team 
associated with this year’s financial 
performance.  However , under the long-term 
incentives there are some payments. One of 
our key tasks is to ensure we have the right 
team and the right incentives in place for 
the business. Three years ago we revamped 
the incentive scheme for our most senior 
managers to reflect a business which required 
a turnaround strategy to be delivered, whilst 
operating in a highly competitive market. 
The aim was to incentivise managers to deliver 
the turnaround and create shareholder value. 
We chose to measure it in the most tangible 
way , through share price performance. 
The payment under the Ladbrokes Growth 
Plan is because the share price did meet 
the criteria of passing the £2 mark for over 
30 consecutive days (see the ‘Directors’ 
remuneration report’). At the year end the 
share price had not sustained this growth and 
was not where we would like it to be. But we 
have made progress against the original task, 
to build a stronger more competitive and 
sustainable business fit to compete in a rapidly 
changing environment, and that in some of the 
actions still being implemented, there are 
further benefits to come. 
Outlook for 2014
Looking ahead the Board is clear that 2014 
presents both challenge and opportunity. 
Our Digital team has to deliver some key 
infrastructure milestones to be able to deliver 
fully the benefits of the Playtech deal. 
Retail has a challenge to drive the benefits 
from the recent investments in the estate to 
keep its offer not only relevant but attractive 
to customers. There are plans to address all 
of these and for us the second half of the year 
after the Football World Cup will be key. The 
Board has confidence in the direction of the 
business but is conscious of the need for 
shareholders to see the sustainable benefits 
of the changes being made.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 13 Our financial results for 2013 masked 
real oper ational progress and we 
remain confident about the direction  
of the business.
2013 saw us continue to build a stronger 
and more competitive business. Our 
financial results reflected the disruption 
from these necessary changes and also 
some market-wide difficulties. They did not, 
however , reflect the real operational 
progress made. W e enter 2014 confident  
in our ability to deliver the final changes 
needed to establish a far more competitive 
offer that will be attractive to customers and 
drive shareholder benefits in H2 and beyond.
Retail excellence
High street betting continues to be an 
attractive proposition for customers and 
offers a resilient source of income despite a 
difficult trading and regulatory environment.
After achieving a record level of net 
revenue in 2012, Retail faced a more 
challenging year with cost and taxation 
headwinds exacerbated by slower than 
expected machines growth in an 
increasingly competitive market. 
The year finished strongly but this was not 
enough to mitigate the well-publicised 
negative impact of the extremely hot 
weather which seriously affected the whole 
market through unprecedented drops in 
footfall in July and August.
However , despite the challenging year for 
Retail, the high street remains an attractive 
proposition for our shops and we invested 
further in Retail to ensure it remains 
relevant and compelling for the customer . 
As well as the expansion of the estate with 
121 new shops, we delivered more content 
with Sky TV , Wifi and a new broadcast 
facility, Ladbrokes TV , for all our shops. We 
also introduced 1,400 Self Service Betting 
T erminals (SSBTs) to offer a greater product 
and betting range, particularly for football 
customers. We have also begun to roll out 
9,000 new machines across the shop estate 
ahead of the Football World Cup. The 
introduction of a more sophisticated cabinet 
is key to maintaining a leading machine 
offer in an increasingly competitive market. 
The focus for 2014 will be to maximise the 
benefits of these investments and further 
improve the competitive offer of the Retail 
estate. We have local management 
incentivised on local performance, looking 
to use the presence of Sky TV , free Wifi and 
SSBTs as a selling point in local marketing 
to maximise the impact.
The complexion of the UK high street has 
changed dramatically over recent years. 
Accordingly we accelerated the expansion 
of our estate, opening new shops in areas 
of higher footfall. Going forward, some 
rationalisation in the bookmaking market 
seems likely, because of rising operating 
costs and the likelihood of pressure on rents 
as the economy recovers. This is a process 
which we should benefit from. During 2014 
we will focus on the optimisation of our 
estate and improving the quality of earnings 
by reducing the tail of non-contributing 
shops with 40-50 shops likely to be closed.
Growing in Europe
Our increasing presence in European 
markets continues to offer benefits as it 
assists the Group in gaining access to growth 
markets and has the potential to mitigate the 
impact of any UK regulatory and economic 
change on our UK Retail business.
Ireland had a difficult year reflecting wider 
economic trends and the continuation of 
a highly competitive trading environment, 
particularly in the Republic. 
In Belgium, we saw a year of consolidation 
after record results in 2012. We have plans 
to introduce SSBT s, virtual products and 
a Digital service ahead of the 2014 Football 
World Cup. T ogether these should combine 
to establish Ladbrokes as the dominant 
multi-channel betting operator in the country . 
In Spain, we recorded another year of 
growth as the slow but steady regional 
regulation process continues to allow us to 
expend the retail activities of Sportium, our 
Joint Venture (JV) with Cirsa Group. We now 
operate in six regions and also agreed with 
Cirsa to extend the JV into digital channels 
which led to the launch of Sportium.es 
in December. 
Digital capability
The Digital market continues to evolve 
driven by technology and changing 
consumer behaviour , with Mobile offering 
the greatest growth opportunity. 
2013 was a significant and busy year 
for our Digital business. We entered a 
transformational agreement with Playtech 
and took significant steps to introduce a 
new and more competitive product offer . 
The change necessary to deliver all this 
activity was not without implications and 
performance in the Digital business 
was impacted.
The deal with Playtech is a critical step 
towards the creation of a compelling Digital 
offer and one befitting the Ladbrokes brand. 
The agreement came into force from 1 May 
and runs until the end of 2017. The first 
significant step was the creation of 
Ladbrokes Israel, which delivers a team 
highly experienced in digital marketing with 
a proven track record in market leading 
CRM and in developing efficient customer 
acquisition processes. We are pleased 
with the transition following what has been 
a major organisational change.
As part of the deal, Playtech are also 
providing a full suite of new gaming/casino 
product, and a new back office system, IMS. 
Product migration started during the year 
with the launch of the new ‘Vegas’ games 
casino as well as a new Poker product. 
In December we launched a new and more 
competitive Mobile offer on the proven 
Playtech Mobenga platform. Mobile is the 
fastest growing area of digital gambling and 
offers the greatest opportunity for the 
Ladbrokes brand. The initial customer 
reaction has been encouraging.
The Mobile launch was preceded by the new 
browser-based sportsbook launch in April. 
In November we launched the Ladbrokes 
Exchange to further differentiate our offer 
Chief Executive’s review
14 and meet the demand from the 
approximately 30% of our customers who 
use an exchange account regularly . This was 
only possible through integrating with the 
Betdaq betting exchange which we 
purchased in February 2013.
We also took further steps to broaden our 
international reach with further progress 
in China and in taking our Digital offer to 
Australia where we see considerable 
growth potential.
Our capability in Digital was further enhanced 
through the creation of a separate Digital 
team with dedicated expert management, 
all of whom have clear areas of expertise 
and accountability.
The focus for 2014 is simple; mobilise our 
business, deliver a single wallet and then 
deliver best in class CRM and growth in 
customer lifetime value.
The Digital offer , particularly Mobile, of 
Ladbrokes is pivotal to our competitiveness 
going forward and the business remains 
absolutely focused on delivering a product 
that attracts customers and delivers for 
shareholders. 
Brand strength offers firm foundations
Our brand is still one of the most recognised 
in the UK and the number one choice for 
people when looking at the betting and 
gaming sector . It has a natural resonance 
with the customer but has been poorly 
served by the product, particularly in Digital. 
2013 was a year when we have begun to 
address this weakness of product and we 
believe the steps taken in 2013 to reposition 
our offer can see the brand act as a catalyst 
to growth, particularly with the growth of 
multi-channel customers. 
Responsible Gambling
The end of 2013 and recent events have 
meant the industry has been firmly in the 
eye of a media and political storm and our 
share price performance has reflected the 
uncertainty. At the centre of this storm has 
been the issue of responsible gambling 
with the catalyst for the debate being the 
Government’s triennial review into stakes 
and prizes. Although this found no evidence 
to change current stake and prize limits, 
the industry was effectively ‘put on review’ 
pending further research over concerns 
the role machines play in causing problem 
gambling. 
Our view is very simple, responsible 
gambling is not a passing regulatory issue 
but a fact of life for all operators. The 
long-term sustainability of any business in 
the sector is intrinsically linked to this issue. 
We rolled out the industry code for harm 
minimisation across our retail estate and 
will fully support further industry-wide 
initiatives on this important topic.
In addition, we are taking actions to reinforce 
responsible gambling’s position at the heart 
of the business. There will be a Board 
committee dedicated to the topic and from 
2015, we will formalise responsible gambling 
measures into Executive remuneration. 
We also have considerable data from our 
Odds On loyalty card and believe this has 
a significant role to play in managing 
responsible gambling. We will look to trial 
new initiatives and use our insights to learn 
more about at risk behaviour and how to 
target information at individual players. 
We will continue to share these learnings 
across the industry .
The wider debate on machines has grown 
to include much comment on the perceived 
increase of betting shops on the UK high 
street. While betting shops generally are 
half the number they were in the 1970s it 
is true that high streets have become more 
accessible and affordable for bookmakers. 
We have always worked closely with local 
authorities and local communities. We have 
always said we understand their need to 
have some say over how their high streets 
feel. The feedback we get is that in the vast 
majority of cases our shops benefit the high 
streets they serve.
Our view is the current level of competition 
in certain locations is unsustainable, rising 
operating costs including taxation and 
content costs and the prospect of rising 
rents will drive some operators out of 
certain locations. While this offers local 
market share growth opportunities we will 
not be afraid to walk away from certain 
shops if we do not see a long-term 
sustainable income. 
2013 also saw a high level of industry 
engagement on the Gambling Act 
regulations which will see a 15% place of 
consumption tax introduced on all online 
sportsbook transactions undertaken by 
UK residents with a likely start date of 
December this year . 
How the tax impacts the wider market is as 
yet unclear . A poorly enforced tax will create 
an uncompetitive environment for 
established UK operators while strict 
enforcement through IP blocking or action 
on payment processing would create 
opportunity for more established players. 
We will continue to make this case at the 
highest level.
Outlook
2014 is a pivotal year for Ladbrokes. 
We will see our competitive offer continue 
to evolve and improve. Key to this will 
be mobilising our business and delivering 
a single customer wallet and improved 
CRM capability.
We remain confident in the business and the 
progress we are making to deliver a more 
competitive and sustainable business in a 
rapidly evolving market. We are very mindful 
of the journey our shareholders have been 
on. We remain highly cash generative and 
have a strong balance sheet with which 
we underwrite a healthy dividend.
We are well placed to maximise on the 
opportunities available to us as we align 
more competitive products with proven 
technology and greater capability behind 
our significant brand presence. We can see 
early, but encouraging, signs of customer 
confidence in the new products, and are 
focused on turning that into benefits 
for our shareholders.
Richard Glynn
Chief Executive Officer
  The long-term 
sustainability of any 
business in the 
sector is intrinsically 
linked to this issue.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 15 UK Retail
After a recor d level of net revenue in 2012, 
UK Retail has faced a challenging year in 
2013, with cost and taxation headwinds 
exacerbated by slower than expected 
machines gr owth in an incr easingly 
competitive market. 
Small decline in OTC
OTC gross win declined by 1.0% (£4.2 million) 
in 2013, a year which did not benefit from 
a major football tournament (Euro 2012 
generated £5.9 million gross win). We have 
continued to experience a slow decline in 
OTC stakes, down 2.1% for the year (down 
5.0% on a like for like number of shops) 
though encouragingly positive during the 
second half.
Gross win margin for the year was 16.9% 
(2012: 16.7%), up slightly on 2012 supported 
by our investment in the trading platform 
and despite a well publicised poor third 
quarter for bookmakers across the market, 
driven largely by particularly customer 
friendly football results during the early 
months of the new football season. 
After a record level of net revenue in 2012, 
UK Retail has faced a challenging year in 
2013, with cost and taxation headwinds 
exacerbated by slower than expected 
machines growth in an increasingly 
competitive market.
Competitive machines market
The growth of machines has been a major 
contributor to UK Retail operating profit over 
the last three years. It was expected after 
such a prolonged period of growth and with 
our machine cabinets approaching the end 
of their lifespan that performance would 
slow during 2013. The slowdown in the 
market has however , been more marked 
than expected. Although the period of hot 
weather in the UK during July and early 
August undoubtedly contributed to this with 
footfall significantly down, it is clear that 
competition in the machines market has 
intensified. Interestingly, lower stake games 
(B3) grew in popularity year on year while 
higher stake (B2) were broadly flat.
In 2013 there were an average 8,874 
gaming machines sited in the estate (2012: 
8,345). At 31 December 2013 there were 
9,091 machines (2012: 8,583).
Cost and taxation pressures
Operating costs increased by 6.6% (or  
£33.1 million). Costs on a like for like basis  
rose by 3.0% with an increase in content 
costs representing the largest part of this, 
driven by a significant increase in the cost  
of horseracing picture rights applied across 
the sector . 
In February the Government changed  
the way in which machine revenues are 
taxed, with a new Machine Games Duty 
replacing the previous system of VA T and 
Amusement Machine Licensing Duty 
(AMLD). This change resulted in additional 
tax of £12.9 million during the year . 
Managing the estate
Shop openings have proven a compelling 
investment (circa 200 new shops added 
since 2012) with growth in profit per shop 
across the estate driving a strong return  
on investment.
The potential for growth in the sector 
remains, particularly from untapped 
opportunities in local markets. However , 
it is clear that although revenue growth 
during 2013 has been suppressed by one 
off and results driven factors, the market as 
a whole is becoming more competitive, with 
a number of shops now finding it harder to 
contribute. We expect this to continue in 2014.
At 31 December 2013 there were 2,297 
shops in Great Britain (2012: 2,196). During 
the year we opened 113 new licenses, 
acquired a further eight and closed 20.
Focus in 2014
In October we agreed a new contract with our 
machine supplier , Global Draw (a division of 
Scientific Games), with new gaming 
machines rolling out to all shops by the 
end of the first half of 2014. With our current 
gaming machines having been introduced 
back at the start of 2011 and competitors 
having upgraded during the intervening 
period, the rollout of a more sophisticated 
and modern gaming machine is key to us 
maintaining a strong offer in what 
has become a very competitive area. Ending 
the former gaming machine agreement 
early has led to an exceptional charge of 
£6.2 million.
During 2013 we extended the range of 
sporting content we are able to broadcast to 
customers through new deals with SIS and 
Sky . During 2014, we will provide our 
customers with more ways to bet as well as 
innovative offers and competitive prices, 
using our expanded and flexible coverage to 
provide customers with the sports they want 
to watch and bet on. We will also be looking 
to drive returns from the investment made in 
SSBT s and the rollout of in shop Wifi, both 
designed to give customers more choice than 
traditional OTC in how they choose to interact 
with us in the shop environment.
We have enlarged our estate footprint over 
the past few years, expanding into areas 
of high footfall and unmet demand. 
Going forward we expect rationalisation in 
the market in response to the imbalance 
between shorter-term increases in taxes 
and content, and slower revenue growth per 
unit. We will be a net closer of shops during 
2014, as we optimise the estate including 
reducing any tail of unprofitable sites to 
improve our quality of earnings.

It has been a difficult year for our Irish 
division, reflecting wider economic trends 
and the continuation of a highly competitive 
trading environment, particularly in the 
Republic of Ireland. Although we have  
seen amounts staked decline as well as an 
unfavourable set of results at Cheltenham 
(circa £2.0 million less gross win versus 
2012), gross win decline of £1.5 million on  
a constant currency basis was mitigated by 
a broader product offering and enhanced 
trading technology and processes.
Operating costs were up 6.7% (3.3% on a 
constant currency basis) during the year ,  
as we replicated changes made to our UK 
operating model in Ireland. Investment in 
the estate with the rollout of Sky, SSBTs in 
the Republic of Ireland, and new Global 
Draw machines in Northern Ireland reflects 
our continuing confidence in the Irish 
market place.

a 1.2% decline in staking offset by growth 
in both football and greyhounds. Overall 
amount staked increased by 2.9%. 
Operating costs were up £1.3 million (4.2%) 
for the year (0.8% on a constant currency 
basis). Despite the challenging conditions, 
operating profit of £8.4 million was flat year 
on year .
The number of Ladbrokes shops declined 
slightly with 17 closures, although 
Ladbrokes’ betting services were made 
available in 53 additional outlets as some 
newsagents took advantage of regulatory 
changes to allow betting products to be  
sold there.
In 2014 we will deliver a number of  
new initiatives including SSBTs and  
virtual product, which will help us develop 
our customer offer . We also intend to 
leverage our strong brand by launching 
a Digital service ahead of the 2014 Football 
World Cup.
At 31 December 2013 there were 359 
outlets, a combination of Ladbrokes shops 
and newsagent outlets offering Ladbrokes 
betting services.

2013 marked the fifth anniversary since the 
start of trading of our Sportium joint venture 
with Cirsa and another record year in terms 
of amounts staked, up 20.8% against 2012 
as the slow but steady regional liberalisation 
process continues to allow us to expand. 
Despite ongoing economic difficulties in 
the region we saw the joint venture 
(pre-addition of Ladbrokes head office costs) 
deliver overall positive EBITDA for the year . 
In 2013, Sportium opened retail outlets  
in Murcia and Galicia making a total of six 
regions where our brand now operates.  
We also opened additional outlets in our 
existing regions of Madrid, Aragon and 
Valencia. In 2014 we are hopeful that a 
further three regions, including Catalunya, 
will also formally approve the provision of 
retail betting services.
During 2013 we agreed with Cirsa to 
extend the joint venture into digital channels 
and consequently in December last year we 
launched Sportium.es, using Playtech 
technology across all our products, 
combining our respective Digital businesses 
– LBapuestas.es and Cirsa.es. Our ongoing 
investment and necessary start up costs 
in Spain, including the new Digital launch, 
means that we expect to generate further 
start up losses as we build our presence.
At 31 December 2013 there were a total 
of 753 outlets where Sportium services 
are available.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 17 Digital
Our Digital business has continued to 
undergo key oper ational changes in  
2013 as we work towar ds r e-establishing 
a competitive offer for customers.
New partners
In March 2013 we announced a new five 
year partnership with the software and 
digital marketing experts Playtech. This was 
a critical step towards the creation of a 
compelling Digital service for our customers 
and one befitting the Ladbrokes brand. 
Playtech is helping us to establish a new 
Digital team in Israel, whose focus is on 
business intelligence, customer relationship 
management (CRM) and growth in 
customer value.
From 1 May 2013 our new, wholly owned 
subsidiary, Ladbrokes Israel began 
operations with a team highly experienced 
in digital marketing, with a proven track 
record in using Playtech’s market-leading 
CRM and in developing efficient customer 
acquisition processes. 
New products
Playtech is also providing us with a full suite 
of new gaming/casino products for our 
customers to enjoy, as well as a new and 
comprehensive back office system. 2013 
has seen us start a period of integration 
which we are on plan to complete during 
the first half of 2014.
Product migration started in 2013 with the 
launch of the new ‘Vegas’ games casino and 
latterly , the successful transition of our Poker 
product which was migrated onto the 
Playtech iPoker network in December . The 
user friendly poker platform allows us to 
launch our own fully branded, customisable 
Poker rooms supporting multiple languages 
and currencies. 
Mobile focus
Mobile gambling is the fastest growing 
and most exciting area of Digital gambling. 
In the UK in 2008, Mobile gambling only 
accounted for 4% of Digital gambling. In 
2013 this had grown to 21%, with estimates 
that penetration will be over half of digital 
gambling by 2017* . 
Mobile has understandably been a key focus 
for us, with the successful launch of our 
new Mobile sportsbook in December . 
Acknowledging these are early days, we 
have seen encouraging signs with amounts 
staked and sign-ups up by more than 50% 
and active players growing by more than 
30% year on year since the launch.  
Mobile generates 31% of sportsbook stakes 
(Q4 2013: 35%). We are expecting to build 
on these growth rates, putting further 
marketing weight behind the product with  
a view to increase our market share in  
this area. 
Continual product development is key to 
customer appeal, which is why we joined 
forces with the mobile technology specialist 
Chelsea Apps Factory towards the end of 
the year . This partnership will help to 
accelerate our mobile offering in what is a 
competitive and growing market.
Differentiation
Back in February we completed the 
acquisition of Betdaq, a provider of peer- 
to-peer style sports betting. Betting via an 
exchange has become a very popular form 
of sportsbetting and is widely used by 
customers, not only as a substitute for , but 
also complementary to, their activity with 
a fixed odds provider , such as Ladbrokes. 
We expect exchange-led betting to become 
an increasingly integrated part of our offer 
over the course of 2014.
Diversification
During the year Ladbrokes strengthened its 
presence in two strategically key markets, 
Australia and Spain, the former through 
a small acquisition of a relatively new 
business, Gaming Investments Pty Ltd, 
which included the online bookmaker 
Bookmaker .com.au and the extensive sports 
affiliate network, Panda Gaming Pty Ltd. 
Although relatively small (initial cash 
consideration of £13.9 million) the 
acquisition extends our global reach, 
providing a low-cost entry into the exciting, 
regulated Australian sportsbetting market.
T owards the end of 2013, we also 
launched Sportium.es in Spain and will 
be combining our existing Spanish online 
business LBapuestas with our established 
joint venture with the Spanish gaming 
company Cirsa.
We continue to maintain a close ongoing 
review of developments in other international 
markets and will seek to launch services 
where regulatory , economic and fiscal 
conditions allow us to grow profitably .
Capability
During the year we appointed a new 
Managing Director of the Digital business, 
Jim Mullen, who began work in October . 
In conjunction with our partners in Israel, 
Jim has been enhancing our capability, 
making several new senior appointments 
in order to strengthen our team. He is also 
overseeing the move to a new customer 
services operation based in Manila. 
Focus in 2014
Much of the transitional change to our 
Digital business has now been concluded. 
During the first half of 2014 we will 
complete the remaining, but pivotal steps 
needed, to migrate the rest of our products 
onto Playtech’s systems and introduce their 
back office system, ‘IMS’ , which will power 
our gaming and sportsbook offer alike.  
This represents a fundamental shift for the 
business which will then be able to compete 
on a more level footing in the second half  
of 2014 and beyond.
Performance overview
Operating profit of £8.2 million was 74.2% 
(£23.6 million) down with revenue declining 
by 1.7% (£3.1 million) and an increase in 
operating costs of £19.2 million (13.3%).
The acquisition during the year of the Betdaq 
and Australian businesses generated  
£13.7 million of net revenue and operating 
costs and betting taxes of £17.0 million. 
On a like for like basis (excluding these 
businesses) net revenue for the year 
declined by £16.8 million (9.4%), with 
operating costs up by £2.3 million (1.6%). 
*Source: H2 Gambling Capital November 2013.
18 Operating profit, excluding these businesses 
was £11.5 million (2012: £31.8 million).
Sports betting
Sportsbook net revenue declined by 5.3%  
in 2013 driven by a 13.1% reduction in 
amounts staked. Part of this decline relates 
to improvements in liability management 
processes, which has helped to reduce the 
impact of ‘unprofitable’ staking. However , 
we also saw a disappointing customer 
response to our new desktop sportsbook 
launched during the second quarter . 
Improvements made during the latter part 
of the year , together with the release of our 
new Mobile product and the plug in of the 
sportsbook into Playtech’s back office 
system, scheduled for the early part of 2014, 
gives us confidence in a much improved 
performance in the months to come. 
Sportsbook gross win margin of 7.9%  
was up by 90 basis points (2012: 7.0%) 
supported by favourable sporting results 
during the early part of 2013 as well as 
the investment in our new trading platform 
and processes.
In play betting is a key driver of market 
growth and we remain focused on providing 
the best pre-event and Bet in Play content 
on the new website and on our new Mobile 
product. In 2013, we traded over 85,000 
events/matches (2012: 70,000) and Bet in 
Play volumes now represents 65% of all 
non-racing sportsbook stakes. 
In December , we signed an agreement with 
Perform, a market-leading provider of 
digital sports media, to provide streaming 
for a number of international sporting events 
– particularly football and tennis – which 
will drive our in play betting performance, 
providing an enhanced overall customer 
experience both on mobile and desktop.
Gaming
Gaming net revenue was down 12.7% to 
£87.6 million. 
We completed the migration of our Poker 
product from our existing supplier 
Microgaming to Playtech in December . 
We expect to migrate all remaining gaming 
products during the first half of 2014 as 
contractual commitments permit. Once fully 
supported by Playtech software we will be 
in a position to compete more strongly with 
more advanced customer relationship 
management driven by Playtech’s back 
office systems.
With the majority of mobile growth over the 
past few years coming from sportsbetting, 
gaming on the mobile is a real focus for 
Ladbrokes and we will explore all cross-sell 
opportunities from the new sportsbook 
mobile platform as well as combining 
the best possible third-party content 
to offer alongside Playtech’s games. 
In December we signed a deal with 
Net Entertainment, which expands our 
range of games further and reaffirms our 
commitment to work with a broad range of 
suppliers, using an open source platform.
Costs
Operating costs excluding the in-year 
acquisitions of Betdaq and the Australian 
business, were up by £2.3 million (1.6%). 
Excluding depreciation and amortisation, 
costs were £3.1 million (2.4%) lower 
than 2012, reflecting reduced staff costs 
(primarily bonus) and marketing in Spain. 
Increased depreciation and amortisation 
for the year (additional £5.4 million) reflects 
the investment in our new website and 
trading platform.

Core T elephone betting 
Traditional T elephone betting is a declining 
part of the bookmaking sector , with many 
customers migrating to Digital services on  
a PC, tablet or mobile. T owards the end of 
2012 we introduced a minimum stake  
per call of £25 which has accelerated this 
process. Amounts staked of £186.4 million  
in 2013 were 30.1% lower than 2012. 
Net revenue for the year of £6.5 million was 
down 31.6%, reflecting the decline in 
amounts staked, with the gross win margin 
of 3.9% flat year over year . A reduction in 
operating costs of £2.0 million ensured  
that the operating loss for the year was 
restricted to £1.6 million (2012: £1.5 million).
High Rollers

Excluding High Rollers, revenue decreased 
by £6.5 million (0.6%) to £1,111.2 million 
(2012: £1,117.7 million). The decrease is 
mainly attributable to a decline in Digital 
revenue across both Sportsbook and 
Gaming, reduced revenue in Core T elephone 
Betting due to lower activity from high 
staking customers as well as a result of 
implementing a £25 minimum transaction 
limit per call and a lower OTC performance 
in UK Retail.

decreased by £67.8 million or 32.9% to 
£138.3 million (2012: £206.1 million), 
reflecting reduced profits from all divisions, 
partially offset by decreased corporate costs.
Corporate costs
Before exceptional items, total corporate 
costs decreased by £7.3 million to  
£17.8 million (2012: £25.1 million).  
The reduction is primarily due to no bonus 
accruals as 2013 targets were not met, 
reduction in share-based payment charges 
and a credit of £2.7 million arising on the 
Hilton hotel guarantees (see note 24 in the 
financial statements).
Finance expense 
Before exceptional items, net finance 
expense of £25.0 million was £4.7 million 
lower than last year (2012: £29.7 million) 
mainly due to a lower blended average 
interest rate of 6.7% (2012: 7.6%). 
Profit before tax 
The reduction in trading profits has  
resulted in a 42.2% decrease in profit from 
continuing operations before taxation and 
exceptional items to £119.2 million  
(2012: £206.4 million).
Exceptional items before tax
T otal exceptional items before tax of  
£51.6 million (2012: £5.7 million) includes 
the following:
• £27.2 million of asset impairments 
comprises £15.8 million against certain 
IT software assets principally arising as a 
result of the business combinations and a 
net impairment charge in the Retail estate 
(£11.4 million);
• £9.6 million of restructuring costs  
across the Group which are largely due  
to changes in the Group operational 
structure following the business 
combination with Playtech;
• £8.4 million of integration costs in respect 
of the business combinations with 
Playtech and Betdaq;
• £6.2 million fee for early contract renewal 
in relation to machines in UK Retail 
designed to provide a machine refresh  
in the whole estate two years early;
• £5.4 million loss on closure of shops in  
UK and European Retail and closure of 
Digital sites;
• £2.9 million of corporate transaction  
costs associated with the business 
combinations in the year;
• A credit to the income statement of 
£(2.8) million following the required 
annual re-assessment of the contingent 
consideration in relation to business 
combinations offset by £1.1 million of 
costs associated with the Australian 
acqusition in respect of estimated 
contingent consideration payable to 
key management; and
• A profit on the sale and leaseback of 
freehold shops in the UK Retail estate 
of £(6.4) million.
Taxation
The Group taxation charge for continuing 
operations before exceptional items was 
£6.1 million. This represents an effective  
tax charge of 5.1% (2012: 5.2%). There was  
a tax credit of £5.5 million in relation to 
exceptional items in 2013 (2012:  
£0.3 million credit).
Dividend
The Board has announced a final dividend 
of 4.60 pence per share (2012: 4.60 pence 
per share) taking the full year dividend to 
8.90 pence per share (2012: 8.90 pence 
per share). 
The dividend will be payable on 15 May 2014 
to shareholders on the register on  
28 March 2014.
Earnings per share (EPS) – Group
Underlying
EPS (before exceptional items and High 
Rollers) decreased by 36.4% to 11.7 pence 
(2012: 18.4 pence), reflecting the decreased 
profit before tax.
Total
EPS (before exceptional items) decreased 
by 43.1% to 12.3 pence (2012: 21.6 pence), 
reflecting the decreased profit before tax. 
EPS (including the impact of exceptional 
items) was 7.3 pence (2012: 21.0 pence). 
Fully diluted EPS (including the impact  
of exceptional items) was 7.2 pence  
(2012: 20.6 pence) after adjustment for 
outstanding share options and other 
potentially issuable shares. 
Cash flow , capital expenditure,  
borrowings and banking facilities
Cash generated by operations was  
£212.7 million. After net finance expense 
paid of £23.5 million, income taxes paid  
of £2.9 million, £89.6 million on capital 
expenditure and intangible additions,  
£36.7 million spent on business 
combinations and £9.5 million cash inflow 
from sale and leaseback of freehold 
properties; cash inflow was £69.5 million. 
Post dividend payment of £81.2 million, net 
cash outflow was £11.7million.
At 31 December 2013, gross borrowings  
of £422.0 million less cash and cash 
equivalents of £23.4 million resulted in a net 
debt of £398.6 million (31 December 2012: 
£386.9 million).

Risk management process and methodology
We have adopted an integrated approach to 
our risk management and responsibilities. 
The effective understanding, acceptance 
and management of risk is fundamental to 
the strategy of the Group and what could 
materially affect the ability to achieve 
strategic goals. 
The Risk Committee considers the following impact areas in assessing risks:
– Legal and regulatory
– Betting and gaming compliance
– Financial management and bookmaking
– Reputation
– T echnology
– Data integrity and fraud protection
– Customers
– Employees
– Health & Safety
– Human Rights, as appropriate
• For each risk identified within these impact areas the likelihood, consequence, 
risk owner (Executive Committee Member) and operational lead are identified 
by the Risk Committee
• The risk owner and operational lead suggest the appropriate mitigating control 
and actions which are reviewed for appropriateness and monitored regularly 
by the Risk Committee
Throughout the year the risk management approach is the subject of continuous review and updated to reflect new and developing 
issues which might impact business strategy.
A Risk Matrix and risk indicators have been established and further developed which helps to monitor progress on risks.
• Overall responsibility for risk management 
as an integral part of strategic planning

22 Principal risks and uncertainties
There are general business risks faced by Ladbrokes that are comparable to those faced by 
most other businesses. General business risks include:
• Marketplace – changes in the economic environment, weakening of the Eurozone and 
changes in consumer leisure spend.
• Financial – availability of debt financing and costs of borr owing, taxation and pension fund liability .
• Operational – recruitment and retention of key talent, execution and management of key 
projects and international expansion.
In addition, there are more specific risks 
which are either unique to Ladbrokes or 
apply to the industry in which we operate. 
The risks outlined here are those principal 
risks and uncertainties that are material  
to the Group. They do not include all those 
associated with Group activities and are not 
set out in any order of priority.
Specific risks that are material to Ladbrokes are:

Marketplace
Competition Digital Capability and  
Retail Excellence
Ladbrokes faces competition primarily from other land-based 
bookmakers, online betting exchanges and other online 
gambling oper ators. In particular , the online gambling market  
is char acterised by intense and substantial competition and by 
r elatively low barriers to entry for new participants. In addition, 
Ladbrokes faces competition from market participants who 
benefit from greater liquidity as a result of accepting bets and 
wagers from jurisdictions in which Ladbrokes chooses not to 
oper ate (because of legal reasons or otherwise).
Ladbr okes’ performance and competitive position ar e 
continuously monitor ed and, wher e appr opriate, changes  
are instituted, including in r elation to marketing, pr oduct 
development, yield management, cost contr ol and investment. 
Acquisition opportunities, with a view to taking advantage of 
market consolidation, are continuously evaluated.
Betting and gaming industry
T axes, laws, r egulations and licensing Regulatory 
Leadership
Regulatory , legislative and fiscal regimes for betting and gaming 
in key markets around the world can change, sometimes at 
short notice. Such changes could benefit or have an adverse 
effect on Ladbrokes and additional costs might be incurred in 
or der to comply with any new laws or regulations.
Regulatory , legislative and fiscal developments in key markets 
are monitor ed closely , allowing Ladbr okes to assess and adapt 
quickly to changes in the envir onment and minimise risks to 
the business. Ladbr okes engages with its r egulators and the 
relevant tr ade or ganisations with r egar d to the betting and 
gaming r egulatory fr amework and other issues of shar ed 
concern, such as pr oblem gambling.
Incr eased cost of pr oduct Digital Capability and  
Retail Excellence
Ladbrokes is subject to certain financing arr angements 
intended to support industries from which it profits. Examples 
ar e the horser acing and the voluntary greyhound r acing levies 
which respectively support the British horser acing and 
gr eyhound industries. In addition, Ladbrokes enters into 
contr acts for the distribution of television pictures, audio and 
other data that are broadcast into Ladbrokes’ betting shops.  
A number of these are under negotiation at any one time.
Ladbr okes engages with the r elevant tr ade associations and 
the principal bodies of sport and event industries with r egar d 
to sports rights payments, including the statutory horser acing 
levy , animal welfar e and other issues
Operational and bookmaking
T r ading, liability management and pricing Pricing, T r ading and 
Liability Management
Ladbrokes may experience significant losses as a result  
of a failure to determine accur ately the odds in relation  
to any particular event and/or any failure of its risk 
management processes.
Ladbr okes’ cor e expertise is risk management and it has 
developed the skills and systems to be able to offer a wide 
r ange of betting opportunities and accept large bets. Ther e is  
in place a highly experienced tr ading team and risks ar e 
spread across a wide r ange of events. A bookmaker’s odds  
are determined so as to provide an aver age r eturn to the 
bookmaker over a lar ge number of events and ther efore, over 
the long term, Ladbr okes’ gr oss win percentage has remained 
fairly constant.
High fixed cost base Retail Excellence
Ladbrokes has a relatively high fixed cost base as a proportion 
of its total costs, consisting primarily of employee, rental  
and content costs associated with its betting shop estate.  
This means that falls in revenue could have a significantly 
adverse effect on Ladbrokes’ profitability unless the Group 
r educes its costs substantially in the short to medium term.
Business r e-engineering initiatives have been implemented to 
reduce the cost base. Structur al contingency plans have been 
put in place and wher e possible centr al facilities have been 
co-located. The futur e str ategy to incr ease online revenues will 
reduce the pr oportion of the Company’s fixed costs.

Ladbrokes’ oper ations are highly dependent on technology  
and advanced information systems and there is a risk that  
such technology or systems could fail. In particular , any  
damage to, or failure of online systems and servers, electronic 
point of sale systems and electronic display systems could result 
in interruptions to financial controls and customer  
service systems.
Ladbr okes has a level of r esilience in place which  
seeks to eliminate single points of failur e within key  
technology locations.
Data management Digital Capability ,

Customer and Br and
Ladbr okes processes sensitive personal customer data  
(including name, address, age, bank details and betting and 
gaming history) as part of its business and therefore must 
comply with strict data protection and privacy laws in all 
jurisdictions in which the Group oper ates. Ladbrokes is  
exposed to the risk that this data could be wrongfully 
appropriated, lost or disclosed, or processed in breach  
of data protection regulation. This could also result in  
pr osecutions and the loss of the goodwill of its customers  
and deter new customers.
Security systems ar e deployed to pr otect tr ansactional data. 
Sophisticated hardwar e and security mechanisms are used to 
ensure all sensitive and confidential data is fully encrypted.

24 Corporate responsibility
Behaving responsibly has always been a priority for Ladbrokes and 
Fair Play is built into the way we do business. As a leading betting 
and gaming company, it is important that we maintain high social, 
ethical and environmental standards (including human rights as 
appropriate) across the organisation and comply with relevant 
legislation in all countries of operation. 
Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) goal is to lead the way in 
responsible betting and gaming. Our CR strategy is agreed on 
an annual basis by the Executive Committee and endorsed by 
our Group Board. The success of our CR strategy relies on us: 
• Maintaining responsible business practice throughout all our 
channels and markets; 
• Developing responsible relationships with all our stakeholders, 
including our employees, customers, regulators and the 
communities we serve; and
• Running responsible operations wherever we are located and 
being mindful of our wider impacts. 
The social, environmental, ethical and human rights issues 
associated with the Ladbrokes core businesses, our joint ventures 
and major partnerships are reviewed by our CR Committee, our 
Risk Committee, and ultimately by the Board on a regular basis. 
We manage our CR performance in line with the Group strategic 
priorities and disclose relevant information to our stakeholders, 
including FTSE4Good, the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), 
the UK CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme and CDP . A detailed account 
of our progress to date is available in the CR reports on our Group 
website. A summary is presented below.
Leading the way in responsible betting and gaming 
Our industry continues to be the subject of public debate and 
over the past year a number of anti-gambling campaigns have 
received extensive media coverage. As a leading industry brand, 
we feel that is our responsibility to engage with the debate, to 
provide relevant information and data to support public decision 
making and industry research, and to work with our peers and 
government bodies to continually improve standards in responsible 
betting and gaming. Our approach is being recognised externally 
and we were pleased to receive a 100% score in our latest DJSI 
assessment for promoting responsible gaming.
• Responsible gambling. During 2013 we appointed a new Head  
of Responsible Gambling to lead our initiatives. T ogether with  
other members of the Association of British Bookmakers, we  
have developed a new player protection code of practice, which is 
available on our website. Our policy upholds the three aims of the 
UK Gambling Commission to: protect the young and vulnerable; 
prevent gambling from being a source of crime or disorder , being 
associated with crime or disorder or being used to support crime; 
and ensure that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way.
Responsible gambling is at the heart of our business. It is not 
a new issue and we are committed to evolving our procedures 
based on evidence and measured results. 2014 will see us 
formalise a number of responsible gambling performance 
measures into senior executives’ remuneration. A committee 
will be established, reporting to the main Plc Board, to oversee 
this and put the measures into practice from 2015 at the latest.
We will also trial initiatives aimed at providing additional insight 
into “at risk” behaviour . We will share the results with industry 
colleagues. 
• Harm minimisation and player protection. We were instrumental 
in developing the new ABB (Association of British Bookmakers) 
code on responsible gambling and player protection, launched in 
October . The code leads the way as a harm minimisation strategy 
and mandates improved performance across four levels: 
providing adequate information on how to gamble responsibly; 
providing tools to help customers better control their activity; 
training staff to detect signs of potential problems; and 
undertaking central analysis of data to spot signs of abnormal 
activity. This is the first code of its kind to be published worldwide. 
Elements of the code are not new to Ladbrokes and indeed reflect 
activities that we have been carrying out for some time. Others are 
truly ground-breaking. During 2013 we developed a new positive 
interaction training programme to help our employees better 
understand player behaviour , to encourage them to interact more 
in our shops and to have the confidence to intervene if they spot 
any signs of potential problems. This training is being rolled out 
across all our UK outlets and the materials have been made 
available worldwide for other locations to follow. We have been 
piloting new systems for player protection, involving both 
automated systems on machines and verbal/written tools for our 
employees, and better communication of responsible gambling 
information. In 2013 we were also the first gaming business to 
establish a Primary Authority partnership with Milton Keynes 
covering age-restricted products.
• Understanding our customers and providing excellent customer 
service. During 2013 we launched the Voice of the Customer 
programme, using focus groups and other feedback channels to 
help understand our customers better , to pilot our new products 
and to provide appropriate information about their gambling 
activity. Whilst we strive to be more open with our customers 
on an individual basis, we have also been working on our data 
security systems, maximising data protection and ensuring 
their privacy.
• Supporting research, education and treatment. We continue 
to support initiatives to research, minimise and treat problem 
gambling through the Responsible Gambling Trust (RGT). 
Through our membership, we support a number of 
problem gambling charities, including the Gordon Moody 
Association, the Central and North West London National 
Problem Gambling Clinic and the GamCare Treatment 
Network. In 2013, we donated £674,375 to RGT and our CEO, 
Richard Glynn, continues as a trustee.

A positive influence on our communities 
We try to contribute positively to the societies in which we operate 
– not only through direct and indirect employment and payment of 
taxes and levies, but also by supporting our communities to address 
issues of local and national concern.
• Our vision to be a good employer . We are a people-driven 
business and as such want to attract and retain the most talented, 
passionate people. Our employment base is diverse and reflects 
our local and international communities. Our policies are 
consistent with the requirements of the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights and maintain the spirit of the International Labour 
Organisation core labour standards. During 2013, we have 
reviewed our talent development programmes to help support our 
employees throughout their career with us, from apprenticeships 
through to leadership positions. We realise that we could do more 
to bring women into the senior levels of our business and to 
address this have planned a new Women in Leadership 
programme for 2014. 
 
• Increasing employment in our communities. 2013 saw the 
launch of our first UK-wide apprenticeship scheme, following a 
successful pilot in two regions of the UK, the South Coast and the 
Midlands, involving 50 apprentices. Apprentices are given training 
as part of Ladbrokes Get Set! training programme with successful 
trainees receiving accredited training in customer service, literacy 
and numeracy as well as a dedicated course developed by 
Ladbrokes on Responsible Gambling. Ladbrokes is working with 
Lifetime Training, one of the UK’s top training providers, who will 
assess and deliver individual coaching needs. We extended the 
scheme to cover South Yorkshire, Scotland and London and set 
ourselves a target of employing 200 apprentices by the end of 
2013, which we exceeded by employing 317 in total. 
• A good neighbour . We continue to engage with our communities 
through Ladbrokes Community Trust (LCT) and Ladbrokes 
Community Fund (LCF) and are supporting health, employment 
and education programmes throughout the UK. During 2013, LCF 
supported the Family Employment Initiative operated by the UK 
Coalfields Regeneration Trust in the Dearne Valley. We funded two 
full time counsellors to support local unemployed families to help 
get them back into work. The project has enabled over 2,000 
residents back into employment since it began operating in 2006.
• Reducing crime and anti-social behaviour . We continue to work 
with our local authorities to reduce crime and anti-social 
behaviour both on and around our premises. We were saddened 
by the death of one of our employees earlier this year following an 
incident in our shop in Morden and have been fully supporting the 
investigation leading to conviction. We have deepened our 
partnerships with Crimestoppers, the Association of Business 
Crime Partnerships and the Safe Bet Alliance (SBA). Through our 
work with SBA we continue to promote the Voluntary Code of 
Safety & Security – National Standards for Bookmakers. The Safe 
Bet Alliance has been in operation since 2009 and in the first two 
years in London alone there was a 60% reduction in robberies. 
This decline in offences has continued nationally, highlighting the 
sustainability of the initiative. We were also pleased to receive a 
100% score from DJSI for our anti-crime policy and approach.
• Keeping our employees and customers safe. We monitor our 
Health & Safety performance on a monthly basis. During 2013 
there have been minor increases in our accident rates in the UK, 
with nine reportable incidents as compared to four in the previous 
year . Having said that, our accident rates remain low compared to 
UK national averages for retail. We have successfully continued 
our Primary Authority relationship with Liverpool City Council 
covering general Health & Safety and have piloted a new fire-
safety initiative with them. This will eventually be rolled out 
nationally and be made available to other businesses.
• Making economic contributions to our communities, locally and 
internationally. The leisure industry is playing an increasingly 
important part in global economies. A report launched in March 
2013 demonstrated that the British betting industry remains  
a key contributor to the UK economy, directly supporting around 
38,800 full-time equivalent jobs and generating £2.3 billion toward 
GDP .
(1)
 As a major business with a presence in 24 countries and 
employing over 14,400 people, the social and economic footprint  
of our operations is extensive. In 2013, we contributed over 
£255 million in wages and salaries, of which £224 million was in 
the UK. We paid over £19 million in taxes to 350 local councils 
in the UK and generated a further £222 million in taxes to the 
UK Treasury and the greyhound and horseracing industries. 
An additional £27 million is paid in taxes throughout the world. 
This is an effective tax-rate of 69.8% on profit

26 Sensitive to our wider impacts 
As a company with a large Retail estate supplemented by central 
office-based activities, our key environmental impact relates to 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily through the electricity 
and gas we consume on our premises. GHG emissions contribute 
to climate change which in turn poses risks to our increasingly 
global business. 
• GB energy efficiency programme. Since 2008, when we initiated 
an ambitious energy efficiency programme, we have brought 
down the absolute GHG emissions of our GB operations by 21% 
despite having increased the Retail estate by over 26% in floor 
area. Our intensity figures, i.e. emissions per employee, revenue 
and floor area have also improved significantly over this period. 
The GB Retail estate has also been leading the way in shop design. 
Our new shops are 30% more energy efficient due to intelligent 
specifications and processes.
• Global carbon footprint. During 2013 we have also been 
measuring our global carbon footprint to identify where our major 
impacts are – more work will be done on this during 2014.

Compliance statement
In 2013 the Company complied with all of the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2012 by the 
Financial Reporting Council which is available at www.frc.org.uk
Board
Role
The Board provides strategic leadership and oversight. It is committed 
to high standards of corporate governance throughout the Group’s 
operations. Each director brings experience, independence of 
character and judgement to their role. The independent non-executive 
directors bring a broad perspective to the deliberations of the Board. 
They support the development of the Group’s strategic direction, 
provide critical and constructive challenge to the executive directors 
and exercise oversight through their participation in the work of the 
Board’s principle committees on matters such as remuneration, risk 
and financial reporting. Responsibility for ensuring that the Group’s 
annual report and accounts are fair , balanced and understandable 
is a matter for the Board as a whole.
Composition
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, two executive 
directors and seven independent non-executive directors.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed 
by the Board.
• The Chairman has a primary responsibility for the running of the 
Board and for relations with shareholders.
• The Chief Executive is responsible for operations and for the 
development of strategic plans and initiatives for consideration 
by the Board.
John Kelly acts as Senior Independent Director . His role is to provide 
a sounding board to the Chairman and to serve as an intermediary 
for the other directors when necessary.
The significant commitments of the Chairman are contained in his 
biography on page 30. There were no significant changes to those 
commitments during 2013.
Diversity
The Company recognises the value that diversity brings to its 
boardroom and believes that the Board performs better and 
supports its overall objectives within the business strategy when 
it includes the best people representing a range of capabilities, 
experience and perspectives. In line with this, the Company aims 
to foster a diverse Board, including a mix of gender , ethnicity and 
backgrounds. The report of the Nomination Committee on pages 
36 and 37 contains further information on Board composition 
and diversity.

Of the 12 Board meetings held during the year, eight were scheduled and four 
were ad hoc. John Jarvis and Christine Hodgson were unable to attend one of the 
ad hoc meetings.  
In addition, the Chairman met during the year with the non-
executive directors without the executive directors present.
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved 
for its decision and approval which includes:
• approval of the strategic and annual profit plans, 
• key announcements e.g. financial statements, 
• dividends declarations, 
• major acquisitions and disposals, 
• material contracts,
• treasury policy and other Group policies.
The section ‘Internal control and risk management systems’ on 
pages 33 and 34 contains further information on how the Board 
operates.
Board support
The Company seeks to ensure that the Board is supplied with 
appropriate and timely information to enable it to discharge its 
duties. The Board requests additional information or variations to 
regular reporting as it requires. A procedure exists for directors to 
seek independent professional advice in the furtherance of their 
duties, if necessary.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board 
through the Chairman on all governance matters.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. All directors receive an induction on joining the Board. 
A combination of tailored Board and committee agenda items 
and other Board activities, including briefing sessions, assist the 
directors in continually updating their skills and the knowledge and 
familiarity with the Company required to fulfil their role both on the 
Board and on Board committees. In addition, external seminars, 
workshops and presentations are made available to directors. 
The Company provides the necessary resources for developing 
and updating directors’ knowledge and capabilities.
Board evaluation
An annual formal Board evaluation is undertaken focusing on 
the performance of the Board and of its committees and individual 
directors. In 2013 the evaluation was externally facilitated by 
Lintstock Limited. Lintstock has no other connection with the 
Company. The evaluation exercise used questionnaires tailored 
to the requirements and specific circumstances of the Company. 
The questionnaires were completed by each director in relation 
32 to their own performance and on the effectiveness of the Board 
and its committees.
The evaluation is thematic and considers:
• Board composition, expertise and dynamics; 
• Board support and time management; 
• Board committees;
• strategic oversight;
• risk management and internal control;
• succession planning and human resources management; 
• priorities for change.
The Chairman conducts an appraisal of each director . The Senior 
Independent Director , having consulted with each of the other 
directors, conducts an appraisal interview with the Chairman. 
The results of the evaluation were considered by the Board and 
the individual committees and actions arising were agreed.
Board committees
The Board has five standing committees: 
 
The terms of reference of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, are available on the Company’s 
website at www.ladbrokesplc.com/investor-centre
Details of the work of the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee 
and Remuneration Committee are shown on pages 35, 36 and 40 
respectively.
The Finance Committee meets as required to deal with all routine 
business excluding matters that are specifically reserved to the 
Board or to another committee and specific matters delegated 
to it by the Board requiring attention between scheduled Board 
meetings. Any two directors can conduct the business of this 
committee. 
The Disclosure Committee meets on an ad hoc basis to consider 
and make decisions relating to the handling of inside information 
concerning the Company and the Group. 
The Disclosure Committee is responsible for ensuring the timely 
and accurate disclosure of inside information to the market in 
accordance with the Company’s obligations under the UKLA ’s 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules and for monitoring compliance 
with the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures.
Attendance at meetings of the Disclosure Committee and Finance 
Committee are set out in the table below:

The Audit Committee has established a US sub-committee to 
oversee regulatory matters connected with the application for , and 
subsequent operation of, gaming licences in Nevada. The Committee 
would also have oversight of any additional licences arising from 
future opportunities in other US states with regulated (or looking 
to regulate) sports wagering or internet gaming activities. The 
membership of the sub-committee comprises Peter Erskine and 
Christine Hodgson. The Committee has met twice during 2013 
with both Peter Erskine and Christine Hodgson in attendance.
In addition, the Executive Committee, Risk Committee, Investment 
Committee, and Compliance Committee referred to elsewhere are 
not formal Board committees.
Internal control and risk management systems
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the internal control and 
risk management systems operating throughout the Group and 
for reviewing their effectiveness. No such systems can provide 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group’s systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide the 
Board with reasonable assurance that potential problems will 
normally be prevented or will be detected in a timely manner for 
appropriate action.
The Company had procedures in place throughout the year and 
up to 24 February 2014, the date of approval of this Annual Report, 
which accord with the Internal Control: Revised Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code published in October 2005.
The Board has delegated the detailed design of the systems of 
internal control and risk management to the executive directors.
Control framework
The control framework and key procedures during 2013 in relation 
to the financial reporting process were as follows:
The Group operates through two primary Business Channels and 
four Business Support Units:
There is an Executive Head responsible for each of these Business 
Channels and Business Support Units.

Business planning
Corporate strategy and Group-wide business objectives are 
reviewed annually by the Board and the Group profit plan is 
approved by the Board. The Business Support Unit management 
integrate Group-wide objectives into business strategies for 
presentation to the Board with supporting financial objectives. 
Operating plans for each Business Support Unit comprise 
financial and operating targets, capital expenditure proposals 
and performance indicators and are reviewed by the Executive 
Committee.
Reporting and oversight
The Chief Executive and the Executive Heads comprise the Executive 
Committee and meet monthly to consider Group strategy, financial 
performance, business development and management issues. 
Other senior executives participate as appropriate. In addition there 
are weekly and monthly financial and operational review meetings 
together with an annual programme of plan/reforecasting and 
strategy reviews attended by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer together with, as appropriate, other Executive Heads  
and executives.
The Board regularly receives reports from Executive Heads covering 
areas such as operations, forecasts, business development, strategic 
planning, human resources, legal and corporate matters, compliance, 
health and safety and corporate responsibility.
Investment
There is a Group-wide policy governing appraisal and approval 
of investment expenditure and asset disposals. An Investment 
Committee comprising of the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer , consider all significant financial commitments, including 
past investment appraisals. Major projects are reported on at 
each scheduled Board meeting. Post-investment appraisals are 
undertaken on a systematic basis and are formally reviewed by 
the Board twice yearly.
Risk
An ongoing process is in place for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group. Key risks and their financial 
implications are appraised by the Executive Committee which 
is assisted by a committee of Business Support Unit executives 
(the Risk Committee). This is an integral part of the strategic 
planning process. The appropriateness of controls is considered, 
having regard to cost/benefit, materiality and the likelihood of risks 
crystallising. Key risks and actions to mitigate those risks are 
considered at each regular Board meeting and are formally 
reviewed and approved by the Board twice yearly. Each key 
risk is assigned executive director/Executive Head ownership.
Policies and controls
Key policies and control procedures (including treasury, compliance 
and information system controls) are documented and have Group- 
wide application. There are also operating procedure manuals that 
are integrated with Group-wide controls. High standards of business 
ethics and compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies 
are demanded from employees at all levels. T o underpin the 
effectiveness of controls, it is Group policy to recruit and develop 
management and other employees of high calibre, integrity and 
with appropriate disciplines. A system of annual self-certification 
of compliance with key controls and procedures is operated 
throughout the Group.
The role of the Audit Committee in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
systems of internal control and risk management is explained in the 
Audit Committee section. The Group has an internal audit function, 
outsourced to Deloitte LLP , which reports to management and the 
Audit Committee on Group operations.
The Board also conducts an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
internal control and risk management systems. The assessment 
takes account of all significant aspects including: risk assessment; 
the control environment and control activities; information and 
communication; and monitoring.
Anti-bribery and whistleblowing policies
The Board recognises that as a global betting and gaming business 
there is potential for exposure to bribery and corruption. Failure by 
employees, suppliers or agents to comply with anti-bribery and 
corruption legislation (including the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act), or any failure in policies and procedures to 
monitor and prevent non-compliance, anywhere in the world, could 
result in substantial penalties, criminal prosecution and significant 
damage to the reputation of the Company.
The Board ensures that there are a number of policies, procedures, 
management systems and internal controls in place across the 
business to prevent bribery and corruption occurring. This includes 
policies on whistleblowing, anti-bribery , gifts and hospitality , charitable 
donations and sponsorship. Supplementary audit, monitoring and 
review processes are designed to identify breaches of Group controls.
The whistleblowing policy enables and encourages employees to 
report in confidence any possible malpractice, impropriety or other 
matters of concern which may arise in the business. Any matters 
raised in accordance with the policy are investigated thoroughly 
and reports are provided at each meeting of the Audit Committee.
Relations with shareholders
There is a regular programme of meetings with major institutional 
shareholders to consider the Group’s performance and prospects. 
In addition, presentations are made twice yearly after the 
announcement of results, the details of which, together with the 
Group’s financial reports and announcements, can be accessed 
at www.ladbrokesplc.com. During 2013 the Chairman met with 
several institutional investors and their representative bodies in 
addition to results presentations and the Annual General Meeting. 
Other directors are available to meet the Company’s major 
shareholders if requested.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns, where contact through the usual channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer has failed to 
solve, or for which such contact is inappropriate.
A report on investor relations, which includes updates on meetings 
with major institutional shareholders, is given at each Board 
meeting. The Company’s brokers also present to the Board annually. 
Principles of ownership, corporate governance and voting guidelines 
issued by the Company’s major institutional shareholders, their 
representative bodies and advisory organisations are circulated to, 
and considered by, the Board.
The Company corresponds regularly on a range of subjects with 
its individual shareholders who have an opportunity to question 
the Board at the Annual General Meeting. Further information on 
our relations with shareholders is contained in the ‘Shareholder 
information’ section on page 114.
34 Audit Committee
The Audit Committee monitors and reports to the Board on the 
integrity of the financial statements of the Company; reviews the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal financial control and risk 
management systems and internal audit function. It oversees 
the Company’s relationship with the external auditor , which 
includes assessing the auditor’s independence and making 
recommendations to the Board on the auditor’s appointment 
and remuneration. 
The members of the Committee that served during the year were:
Appointment date Committee r ole
Darr en  Shapland 16 F ebruary 2010 Chairman
John Kelly 1 September 2010 Member
Christine Hodgson 1 May 2012 Member
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
directors. Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board at 
the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which consults 
with the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Board has satisfied itself that the members of the Committee 
have recent and relevant financial experience.
Meetings and attendance 2013
The Committee meets as required, but not less than three times 
a year . Other directors, including the Chief Financial Officer , 
attend Audit Committee meetings. The Committee met for private 
discussions with the external auditor , Ernst & Young LLP , whose 
representatives attend all of its meetings, together with the internal 
auditor , Deloitte LLP .
Details of the number of Committee meetings held during the year 
and the attendance of Committee directors is shown below:

Committee support
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources to undertake its 
duties. It has access to the services of the Company Secretary (who 
acts as secretary to the Committee) and all other employees. The 
Committee is able to take independent legal or professional advice 
when it believes it necessary to do so.
The main activities of the Committee in 2013 included:
• the critical review of the significant financial reporting issues in 
connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial and 
related formal statements, with the assistance of reports received 
from management and the external auditor;
• assessing the scope and effectiveness of the systems established to 
identify , assess, manage and monitor financial and non-financial risks;
• monitoring the integrity of the Company’s internal financial 
controls. The Committee does so by reference to:
(a) summaries of business risks and mitigating controls;
(b) regular reports and presentations from the heads of key risk 
functions, internal audit and external audit; and
(c) the results of the system of annual self-certification of 
compliance with key controls and procedures;
• monitoring and reviewing the plans, work and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function, including any actions taken following any 
significant failures in internal controls;
• reviewing, with the external auditor , its terms of engagement, the 
findings of its work, and at the end of the audit process reviewing 
its effectiveness; and
• reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor .
The external auditor reports to the Committee on the actions taken 
to comply with professional and regulatory requirements and with 
best practice designed to ensure its independence. In addition, the 
Committee has adopted a policy on the engagement of external 
auditors for the provision of non-audit services which can be viewed 
at www.ladbrokesplc.com/investor-centre
The policy sets out controls intended to ensure that the independence 
of the external auditor is not impaired and stipulates: 
• the nature of non-audit services that are permitted to be 
performed by the external auditor;
• levels of authority for management to engage the external auditor 
for approved non-audit services;
• that any non-audit services to be provided by the external auditor 
for a single project or specific services for fees in excess of 
£100,000 must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee.
Details of non-audit services are presented to the Committee for its 
review at each meeting. Fees for non-audit services provided by 
Ernst & Young LLP in the year amounted to £0.2m (2012: £0.7m). 
The Committee is satisfied that the overall level of fees for non-audit 
services is not material in the context of the total fee income 
received by Ernst & Young LLP and that the provision of approved 
non-audit services has not compromised the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor .
The performance of the external auditor is reviewed by the 
Committee on an annual basis through a qualitative assessment 
of the services provided against the agreed audit plan and taking 
account of feedback received from management. Following this 
review the Committee is satisfied that the external audit process 
operates effectively.
In October 2013 the Competition Commission announced measures 
requiring all FTSE350 companies to conduct a tender for external 
audit services every 10 years. In advance of this, the Company 
reported last year that it anticipated that its external audit services 
would be put out to tender during 2013. Ernst & Young LLP (and its 
predecessor partnerships) was appointed the Company’s auditor 
prior to flotation and no tender process had been conducted prior 
to 2013. 
A rigorous tender process was conducted during the year which 
resulted in the Committee recommending to the Board that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is appointed auditor with effect 
from the 2014 financial year subject to shareholder approval being 
obtained at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.

Accounting and key areas of judgement
The main areas considered by the Audit Committee in relation to the 2013 accounts are set out below:
Matter consider ed Action
Taxation
Accounting for uncertain tax positions and the 
level of deferred tax asset recognition and 
disclosure in relation to accumulated tax losses 
are based on a series of judgements. These 
judgements have an impact on the corporation tax 
rate and recognition of deferred tax assets. In 
addition to the recognition, the Audit Committee 
also considers the appropriateness of the 
disclosures provided in the Annual Report.
The Audit Committee receives regular reports from management on the corporation 
tax rate as well as the judgements exercised in arriving at the corporation tax rate, 
the deferred tax recognised and disclosed. Assumptions underlying the positions 
taken on significant deferred tax assets are supported by reports from other tax, 
advisory and legal firms. Ernst & Young LLP also report on the tax position to 
management and the Audit Committee.
Accounting for acquisitions
The Group has completed a number of major 
acquisitions during the year resulting in the 
recognition of goodwill, other assets and 
liabilities and estimates of the fair value 
of contingent consideration, all based on a 
number of assumptions. The Audit Committee 
considers the valuation of the assets and 
liabilities, and challenges management’s 
assumptions that underpin these.
Management is required to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration 
at the acquisition date and to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities 
acquired, including any separate intangible assets. Management engaged 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to support this process.
The Committee has reviewed the valuation reports prepared by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and management’s accounting papers on the various 
acquisitions. The various inputs and assumptions used within these valuations 
together with the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired were also reported 
on by Ernst & Young LLP .
Carrying value of long-lived assets
In addition to the licences in the Retail estate, as 
a result of the aquisitions during the year and the 
significant level of investment in technology over 
the past three years, the Group has significant 
goodwill and other intangible assets which need 
to be reviewed for impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are tested 
for impairment annually.
The Audit Committee reviewed the methodology and the outcome of the various 
impairment review papers presented by management. These have also been 
reported on by Ernst & Young LLP .
Exceptional items
The Group classifies certain items in the income 
statement as exceptional, in order to assist users 
of the financial statements in understanding its 
underlying performance.
Following the acquisition of Playtech and Betdaq there have been a number 
of exceptional items. These include business integration and other transaction 
related costs.
The Committee has reviewed the items considered exceptional by management 
which have been discussed at three of the past four Audit Committee meetings. 
The Committee has challenged the appropriateness and classification of these 
items of costs as well as income as exceptional. Exceptional items have also been 
reported on  by Ernst & Young LLP . 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee reviews and makes recommendations 
to the Board on: the composition of the Board, taking account of the 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity; succession 
planning for the directors and other senior executives; the search and 
nomination of candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they 
arise; candidates for the role of Senior Independent Director and 
for membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, 
in consultation with the Chairmen of those Committees; and makes 
recommendations to the Board concerning the directors standing 
re-election by shareholders.

Committee support
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources to undertake 
its duties. It has access to the services of the Company Secretary 
(who acts as secretary to the Committee) and all other employees. 
The Committee is able to take independent legal and professional 
advice when it believes it necessary to do so.
36 Diversity
The Company has a well established and published equal 
opportunities policy that guides all colleagues in how they fairly 
deal with all colleagues and customers irrespective of age, gender , 
sexual orientation, religion, disability or ethnic origin. That policy 
applies on how people are selected to work at the Company and 
applies at all levels. The Company has a succession policy that 
ensures all key roles including director positions are considered 
and the Company considers candidates for roles from the widest 
possible field. The Board regularly reviews succession arrangements 
for all key roles and the Nomination Committee reviews succession 
arrangements for directors. The Board’s Strategic report includes 
details of wider workforce gender diversity which are shown on 
page 26.
The Board endorses the aims of the Davies’ Report entitled 
‘Women on Boards’ and when considering future appointments, 
with the support of the Nomination Committee, will aim to build on 
its current position. The Company currently has two women on the 
Board (Christine Hodgson and Sly Bailey) and therefore 20% of the 
Board is made up of women. The Company’s current aspiration is to 
increase the percentage of women on the Board to 30% by 2015 
and to continue to ensure appropriate representation by women, 
both on the Board and throughout the business, whilst at all times 
ensuring the Company selects on merit.

Committee activities
During 2013 the Committee conducted a search for an additional 
independent non-executive director who would join the Board with  
the intention of acting as Chairman of the Board’s Remuneration 
Committee in due course. An initial search for candidates was 
conducted by JCA Group search consultants. JCA does not have  
any other connection with the Company . This initial search, whilst 
identifying some potential candidates, did not lead to an appointment 
being made. Further search activities, which involved direct 
approaches to potential candidates rather than use of search firms 
and advertising, identified Mr David Martin as a candidate meeting the 
Committee’s criteria. The Committee recommended his appointment 
to the Board which was effective from 31 October 2013. Mr Martin 
became chair of the Remuneration Committee on 5 December 2013 
taking over from John Jarvis who is due to retire from the Board at 
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2014.
On 19 February 2014, the Committee met to consider the output of 
the 2013 Board evaluation and in terms of candidates for re-election 
at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and the Board’s composition in 
terms of size, experience and diversity. The Committee concluded 
that each of the current directors is devoting sufficient time to their 
duties and responsibilities and brings relevant skills and judgement 
to the work of the Board. Each of the current directors, with the 
exception of Mr John Jarvis, will stand for election at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting.

purchases of up to 91,759,548 of the Company’s ordinary shares.  
No purchases of Company shares were made during the year . 
Details of shares allotted during the year are shown in note 26 to  
the consolidated financial statements. T o the extent the authorities 
granted by shareholders remain unused they remain in effect until 
the earlier of the Annual General Meeting in 2014 or 30 June 2014.
Corporate responsibility
The 2013 Corporate Responsibility (CR) report is available at 
www.ladbrokesplc.com and highlights, with which the following 
should be considered in conjunction, are given on pages 25 to 27.
The processes described in the section Internal control and risk 
management systems on pages 33 and 34 applied to CR (including 
Human Rights issues as appropriate), as did the practices described 
on page 32 for ensuring the Board is supplied with appropriate and 
timely information and training and for assisting the directors to 
update their knowledge. In addition to business presentations 
regularly made to the Board at which CR was considered as 
appropriate, the Board conducts an annual CR review and Board 
members regularly receive CR updates. CR performance is included 
in business unit accountability systems and remuneration 
arrangements. The Remuneration Committee in determining 
executive remuneration takes into account CR matters as described 
in the Directors’ remuneration report.
The risks and opportunities relating to CR in 2013 and going forward 
primarily revolve around the reputation of the Group and the quality 
of its brands.
38 Of particular importance was the promotion of responsible 
gambling and the protection of children and the vulnerable. CR also 
impacted (i) the performance of the Group’s employees on whom 
the Group relies for the provision of high quality services to 
customers and (ii) the health and safety of these employees and the 
customers they serve. 
Performance indicators continued to be developed in accordance 
with Group-wide CR. No breaches of CR policies and procedures 
material to the Group were identified by the Board in 2013.
The identification and management of CR issues, the CR reporting 
framework and any associated data has been reviewed by the 
Company’s CR adviser , Carnstone Partners LLP .
Details of the Group’s disclosure of its greenhouse gas emissions 
are set out in the Group’s strategic report on page 27.
Employee policies
The Board values two-way communication between senior 
management and employees on all aspects of the Company’s 
strategy, Company performance, management effectiveness and 
approach to wellbeing.
There is a rolling three-year internal communications strategy 
and delivery plan which includes interventions such as regular 
management roadshows, virtual strategy briefings, visits to 
operating units, responses to the annual colleague opinion 
survey and updates on performance against the Company’s 
Vision and Values.
The internal communications channels include a mobile device 
platform, face to face events, a corporate intranet, phone 
broadcasting, SMS alerts, a Company magazine, leadership 
and line manager briefing packs.
The UK Retail Colleague Forum, which was launched in 2012 as an 
evolution of our Staff Council, provides a further mechanism for 
employee dialogue and engagement.
In addition, those employees who are eligible are also encouraged to 
become involved in the Group’s performance through participation 
in share schemes.
Throughout the Group, the principles of equal opportunities are 
recognised in the formulation and development of employment 
policies.
It is the Company’s policy to give full and fair consideration to 
applications from people with disabilities, having regard to their 
particular aptitudes and abilities. If an employee becomes disabled, 
the Company’s objective is the continued provision of suitable 
employment, either in the same or an alternative position, with 
appropriate adjustments being made if necessary. Employees 
with disabilities share equally in the opportunities for training, 
career development and promotion.
Significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon 
a change of control following a takeover bid
The agreements between Ladbrokes Group Finance plc (LGF), 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and eight separate 
banks for the provision by the banks of revolving credit facilities 
of up to £540 million on a committed basis provide that the banks 
may give notice of cancellation if a change of control occurs. 
On cancellation the amounts drawn would be immediately 
repayable. In the context of a takeover bid, the acquirer would 
normally arrange substitute facilities. In addition, LGF issued a 
bond in March 2010. The bond has a ‘Put Event’ that allows 
bondholders to exercise a put option when a change of control 
occurs. The put option allows the bondholders to require LGF to 
purchase the bonds at a price of 101 pence.
Amendment of the Company’s articles of association
The Company’s Articles may be amended by the members of the 
Company by special resolution (requiring a majority of at least 75% 
of the persons voting on the relevant resolution).
Financial risk management
A description of the Group’s financial risk management objectives 
and policies and its exposure to price, credit liquidity and cash flow 
risk is contained in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 
and forms part of this report. 
Going concern
In assessing the going concern basis, the directors considered the 
Group’s business activities, the financial position of the Group as 
described in pages 14 to 21 and the Group’s financial risk 
management objectives and policies as included in note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that 
it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing its financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s Annual General Meeting will be held at Deutsche Bank 
AG, Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB 
on 7 May 2014 at 11.00am.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 39 Directors’ remuneration report
Dear shareholder
As the new Chairman of Ladbrokes’ Remuneration Committee, 
I am pleased to present the 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
We fully support the spirit of transparency in which the new 
disclosure regulations for UK-listed companies have been drafted. 
Last year , prior to their introduction, we took the opportunity to 
incorporate a substantial number of the proposed changes into our 
2012 report and hopefully you found the structure and content of 
that report helpful and concise. You will notice in this year’s report 
some further changes in order to align our disclosure with the 
requirements specified in the final legislation.
In line with the new regulations shareholders will be invited to 
approve both:
• our remuneration policy with effect from the AGM on 7 May 2014 
(Policy Report) which will be subject to a binding shareholder 
vote; and 
• our annual report on remuneration detailing how our policy has 
been implemented in the year ended 31 December 2013 and will 
be implemented in the year ending 31 December 2014, which will 
remain subject to an advisory vote.
Summary of Ladbrokes remuneration principles
The principles underlying the Ladbrokes remuneration policy 
continue unchanged. T otal remuneration packages should therefore:
• be strongly aligned with shareholder value creation;
• be aligned with and support the business strategy;
• enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate key individuals; 
and
• be positioned competitively against market practice, while paying 
no more than necessary.
It is these principles that the Remuneration Committee has in mind 
when determining remuneration arrangements for executive 
directors. As a result, a significant portion of remuneration at 
Ladbrokes is variable, rewarding management to deliver the Group’s 
key strategic goals and generate long-term value for shareholders. 
During 2013, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration 
arrangements in place for executives. The Remuneration 
Committee considers that the existing remuneration framework 
remains appropriate.
2013 performance
In 2013, our financial performance has been disappointing despite 
delivering key operational goals. In particular , profit has suffered  
due to a combination of the challenging trading environment and 
the short-term issues in delivering our long-term Digital strategy, 
particularly given the costs of integration, as we seek to build 
long-term value for shareholders.
In respect of the annual bonus, the Remuneration Committee set 
stretching targets in relation to Group profit performance, which 
were not met. As a result, executive directors will not receive a 
bonus in respect of 2013. 
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) is intended to reward strong 
shareholder value creation and earnings growth over a three-year 
cycle. Given the Company’s growth in share price and increased 
dividend yield since the beginning of 2011, the T otal Shareholder 
Return (TSR) portion of the 2011 PSP award vested at 50% of 
maximum. However , our Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance 
was not sustained over the period and therefore none of the EPS 
portion of the award will vest. Therefore 25% of the overall award 
will vest following the announcement of the Company’s results.
Upon the appointment of Richard Glynn in 2010, shareholders 
approved the Ladbrokes Growth Plan (LGP), a one-off share plan  
to incentivise the turnaround of the business. The first performance 
test under this plan occurred at the end of June 2013. The executive 
directors and key senior executives earned 40.7% of the shares 
under the plan as a result of the share price exceeding 220p for 
a period of 30 consecutive dealing days in Q1 2013, two-thirds of 
which remain subject to continued employment. We recognise 
that our share price has decreased recently, and as our executive 
directors have voluntarily not sold any shares they have been 
exposed to the decrease in share price in the same way as all 
other shareholders. 
2014 proposals and future Remuneration Committee activities
In 2014 we are making adjustments to the annual bonus plan, 
which are intended to focus colleagues across all parts of the 
business on the delivery of our strategic goals. The proportion 
of bonus based on strategic and individual objectives is being 
increased from 30% to 40% but will remain subject to a group 
profit underpin. The proportion of bonus payable at threshold 
performance level for 2014 has been reduced from 25% to 0%.
We have decided to introduce malus provisions on our 
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) and our PSP in line with best practice. 
This will allow us to reduce or cancel unvested awards in 
exceptional circumstances.
During the coming year , we intend to review the remuneration 
framework to ensure that it remains fit for purpose for 2015 and 
beyond. We will consult with major shareholders in respect of any 
material changes and welcome your views. Where appropriate we 
will also seek a binding shareholder vote to approve the changes, 
in accordance with the new regulations.
The Remuneration Committee values all feedback from shareholders, 
and hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.
Statement fr om David Martin, 
Chairman of the Remuner ation Committee
40 Policy Report
The following sections set out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’). This Policy will be put forward for shareholder approval at the 
2014 AGM in accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006. Subject to shareholder approval, the effective date of this Policy is 
the AGM on 7 May 2014.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is the Company’s policy to honour in full any pre-existing obligations that have been entered into prior to the 
effective date of this Policy. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments 
for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy, where the terms of that payment were agreed:
(i) before the Policy came into effect, or 
(ii)  at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee,  
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an 
award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 
Further details regarding the operation of the Policy can be found on pages 48-53 of this report.
Policy table
Fixed remuneration
Element Purpose and link to str ategy Operation Maximum opportunity P erformance measur es
Salary
• Core element of 
remuneration reflecting 
individual role  
and experience.
• Salary levels are set to 
both support retention 
and recruit people of the 
necessary calibre.
• The Remuneration Committee typically takes 
into consideration a number of factors when 
setting salaries, including:
 – the individual’s skills, experience  
and recent performance;
 – business performance;
 – affordability;
 – market practice for comparable roles  
at companies of a similar size and 
complexity; and
 – pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
• Salaries are typically reviewed annually, with 
any change normally being effective from 
1 March. The Remuneration Committee may 
determine salary increases at any point as it 
considers appropriate.
• Whilst no maximum level of salary has been 
set by the Remuneration Committee, executive 
director salary increases are determined in the 
context of wider workforce increases and any 
increases to executive directors will normally 
be in line with these. The Remuneration 
Committee considers any increases out of line 
with this very carefully .
• Higher increases may be awarded in certain 
circumstances, at the Remuner ation Committee’s 
discretion. For example, this may include:
 – Significant increase in the scope and/or 
responsibility of the individual’s role; and
 – Development of the individual within the role.
• For example, where an executive director has 
been appointed to the Board at a lower than 
typical salary , larger increases may be awarded 
to move them closer to market practice as their 
experience develops. This allows Ladbrokes to 
bring the new incumbent to an appropriate 
salary over time with reference to performance 
in the first few years in the role.
• None, although overall 
performance of the 
individual is one of the 
key considerations in 
setting salary levels.
Benefits
• Fixed element of 
remuneration providing 
market competitive 
benefits.
• Benefits are provided to 
both support retention 
and recruit people of the 
necessary calibre.
• Benefits to executive directors may include 
private healthcare (for the executive director 
and his family), critical illness, disability and 
life assurance, injury in service benefits, an 
allowance for tax advice and a cash allowance 
in lieu of a company car .
• The Remuneration Committee may 
review the benefit allowance for existing 
or new executive directors at any point. The 
Remuneration Committee may also remove 
benefits that executive directors receive or 
introduce other benefits if it considers it is 
appropriate to do so.
• Where executive directors are required to 
relocate or complete an international assignment, 
the Remuneration Committee may offer 
additional benefits, if considered appropriate, or 
vary benefits according to local practice.
• Executive directors are also eligible to 
participate in any all-employee share plans 
operated by the Company on the same basis as 
other eligible colleagues. Ladbrokes currently 
operates two all-employee share plans (the 
Share Incentive Plan and the Savings-Related 
Share Option Scheme).
• Whilst no maximum limit exists, benefits are 
set by taking into account a number of factors 
including market practice for comparable 
roles within appropriate pay comparators. 
• None
Retirement 
benefits
• Fixed element of 
remuneration to assist 
with retirement 
planning.
• Retirement benefits  
are provided to both 
support retention and 
recruit people of the 
necessary calibre.
• Executive directors can opt to join the 
Company’s defined contribution scheme  
or take a cash supplement.
• The cash supplement and/or employer 
defined contribution level is kept under review 
by the Remuneration Committee.
• The cash supplement is not included  
in calculating bonus and long-term  
incentive quantum.
• In general, the levels of cash supplement and/
or employer defined contribution provided are 
intended to be broadly market typical for the 
role. The Remuneration Committee reserves 
the right to make adjustments to these levels 
in the event of market movements.
• Whilst there is no maximum pension level,  
the current level is 22.5% of base salary.
• None

bonus
• Incentivise performance 
on an annual basis 
against key financial 
metrics and demanding 
individual objectives.
• Deferral element  
into shares is intended  
to enhance shareholder 
alignment and  
reinforce retention.
• Awarded annually based on performance in 
the relevant financial year .
• The Remuneration Committee reviews and 
determines the performance measures and 
targets each year .
• Bonus level is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee after the year end based on a 
review of performance against targets.
• A portion of bonus, currently one-third, is 
compulsorily deferred into an award of shares 
under the DBP . Awards are normally 
structured in the form of conditional share 
awards but may be settled in cash or 
structured as nil-cost options. This deferred 
bonus element is not subject to performance 
conditions and will not normally vest for a 
period of at least three years.
• Participants may receive the value (in cash or 
shares) of dividends paid on the shares that 
vest in respect of the period between the grant 
and satisfaction of a deferred bonus award.
• Operated in accordance with the terms of 
the annual bonus plan and deferred bonus 
plan rules which includes the capacity for the 
Remuneration Committee to adjust or amend 
the terms of the awards.
• Maximum awards  
(in shares or cash) in 
respect of any financial 
year as a percentage of 
base salary are 170% for 
the Chief Executive 
and 130% for other 
executive directors.
• Performance is measured against 
a combination of financial measures (currently 
profit-based) and strategic and/or individual 
objectives. At least 60% of the bonus will 
be based on financial measures and the 
remainder on strategic and/or individual 
objectives. No bonus will be awarded if a base 
level of profit is not achieved in the bonus year .
• Individual performance objectives for executive 
directors are reviewed and approved by the 
Remuneration Committee at the start of the 
financial year and clearly aligned to the 
strategic objectives of the Company.
• Between 0% and 100% of the maximum 
award applies for achievement between 
threshold and maximum performance.
Performance 
Share Plan 
(PSP)
• Incentivise executive 
performance over the 
longer term.
• Performance measures 
linked to the long-term 
strategy of the business, 
and the creation of 
shareholder value over 
the longer term.
• Awards are normally structured in the form of 
conditional share awards but may be settled 
in cash or structured as nil-cost options.
• Vesting of these awards is dependent on 
achievement of stretching performance 
targets over at least three years.
• Participants may receive the value (in cash or 
shares) of dividends paid on the shares that 
vest in respect of the period between the grant 
and satisfaction of a PSP award.
• Operated in accordance with the terms 
of the PSP rules which were approved 
by shareholders on 18 May 2007 which 
includes the capacity for the Remuneration 
Committee to adjust or amend the terms  
of the awards.
• Awards of up to 250% 
of base salary can be 
granted under the 
plan rules in respect  
of any financial year .
• The normal award levels 
for the existing executive 
directors as a 
percentage of base 
salary are 175% for the 
Chief Executive and 
150% for other executive 
directors, although the 
Committee may grant 
awards above this, 
subject to the plan limit.
• Awards vest based on performance against 
a combination of performance measures.
• At least 50% of the award will be based on 
financial measures (currently EPS) and a 
further portion of no more than 50% will 
be based on TSR performance.
• Any balance would be linked to performance 
against specific strategic objectives.
• For ‘threshold’ levels of performance 25% of 
the award vests, increasing on a straight line 
basis to 100% of the award for maximum 
performance. 
• In accordance with the rules of the PSP , the 
performance condition may be replaced or 
varied if an event occurs or circumstances 
arise, e.g. a significant regulatory change, 
which causes the Committee, acting fairly and 
reasonably, to determine that a substituted or 
amended performance condition would be 
appropriate (taking into account the interests of 
the shareholders of the Company) provided that 
the amended performance condition would 
continue to achieve its original purpose.
Notes to the policy table
Malus
The remuneration policy has been reviewed in 2013 and changed to 
include malus provisions for awards granted under the DBP and 
PSP to deal with exceptional circumstances. Malus provisions will 
apply for awards granted from 2014 onwards, under which 
the Committee may cancel or reduce vesting of unvested awards 
or impose further conditions on those awards in the event of a 
material misstatement of the Group’s financial results or gross 
misconduct on the part of the participant(s). 
Corporate events affecting share plans
The plans shall be operated in accordance with the relevant rules  
as approved by shareholders and amended from time to time in 
accordance with those rules. In particular , the plan rules provide for 
adjustments in certain circumstances. For example, awards may be 
adjusted in the event of any variation of share capital, demerger , 
special dividend, reorganisation or similar event.
In the event of a change of control or winding up of the Company, 
existing share awards under these plans will be treated as follows: 
• Deferred bonus awards will vest in full on the date on which the 
change in control occurs.
• PSP awards will vest in line with the plan rules to the extent  
the Remuneration Committee determines that performance 
conditions have been satisfied and on a time-apportioned 
basis, subject to Remuneration Committee discretion to 
determine otherwise.
• Outstanding LGP awards will vest on or immediately prior  
to the relevant event in line with the plan rules to the extent the 
Remuneration Committee determines is appropriate taking into 
account the extent to which performance conditions are achieved 
and the time elapsed since grant, or on such basis as the 
Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.
• Awards may vest on a voluntary winding up of the Company  
on the same basis.
42 Performance measures – annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures are chosen to provide an 
appropriate balance between incentivising executive directors to 
meet financial targets for the year and to deliver specific strategic, 
operational and individual goals. This balance allows the 
Remuneration Committee to effectively reward performance 
against the key elements of our strategy.
The precise bonus targets are set by the Remuneration Committee 
each year to ensure that executive directors are appropriately 
focused on the key objectives for the next 12 months. In doing so, 
the Remuneration Committee intends to take into account a number 
of internal and external reference points, including the Company’s 
business plan.
Performance measures – PSP
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable 
returns to shareholders. The Remuneration Committee strives to 
achieve this by aligning the performance measures under the PSP 
with the long-term strategy of the Company and considers that 
strong performance under these metrics should result in 
sustainable value creation.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a combination of 
financial/strategic measures and a measure of value delivered to 
shareholders is most appropriate when measuring long-term 
sustainable performance at Ladbrokes.
Additional disclosure – legacy arrangements LGP
The LGP was approved by shareholders on 14 May 2010. Full details 
of the LGP are set out in the circular sent to shareholders seeking 
approval for the LGP at the time of implementation. As a legacy 
arrangement, the LGP is not included within the Policy table above. 
However , we have chosen to voluntarily disclose summary details of 
the LGP here for ease of reference. 
• Purpose and link to strategy – The LGP is a one-off long-term 
incentive plan which was designed to incentivise over 140 key 
senior executives to support revitalisation of the business and 
create significant, sustainable long-term shareholder value. The 
plan rewards value creation of between £400 million to £1.3 billion 
for shareholders.
• Operation – One-off awards were made under this plan in 2010 to 
the CEO and in 2011 to other participants. No further awards will 
be made under the plan. The performance period for all awards 
is five years, which began in June 2010 and ends in June 2015. 
A portion of the award was eligible for vesting at the end of year 
three of the performance period (June 2013). A further portion 
may vest at the end of year four (June 2014) if targets have been 
met at this time. The remainder of the award may vest at the end 
of year five (June 2015), subject to the achievement of the 
performance targets. Participants may receive the value of 
dividends paid on any vested shares.
• Maximum opportunity – Executive directors were required to 
invest up to 150% of base salary in shares and can potentially 
receive up to a four times matching award in respect of that 
investment. The matching award will normally only vest to the 
extent this investment is retained. In the case of the Chief 
Executive, he was required to invest in circa 1 million Ladbrokes 
shares and received a four times matching award.
• Performance measures – Awards are subject to share price 
performance conditions. Any share price target must be attained 
throughout a period of 30 consecutive dealing days. 25% of the 
award will vest if a share price of £2.00 is achieved. 100% of the 
award will vest if a share price of £2.97 is achieved. Vesting will be 
on a straight line basis between the minimum and maximum 
share price targets (i.e. between £2.00 and £2.97).
The Remuneration Committee has the authority to amend the 
targets if it is necessary to take account of exceptional factors 
including, for example, corporate events or exceptional market 
or industry factors which would otherwise render the 
targets inappropriate.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Company
The remuneration policy for our executive directors is designed to 
be aligned with the remuneration philosophy and principles that 
underpin remuneration for the wider Group.
Although there are differences in pay between the executive 
directors and the wider colleague population, all reward 
arrangements are built around the common objectives and 
principles outlined below:
• Performance alignment – The Company aligns key Group 
financial measures under the colleague bonus arrangements with 
those of the executive directors to ensure consistency across the 
organisation and delivery of strategic goals. This is then supported 
by relevant team and individual targets to focus colleagues on key 
deliverables in their area of the business.
Participation in performance-related share plans ensures key 
colleagues are incentivised to drive shareholder value creation. 
Key personnel have been invited to participate in the PSP  
and/or the LGP with the same performance metrics as the 
executive directors.
• Colleague share ownership – Ladbrokes is committed to 
strengthening and widening colleague share ownership. 
It therefore operates two all-employee share incentive plans. 
All of the Company’s UK colleagues can participate in the 
Company’s HMRC-approved Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and 
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.

(NED) fees
• Sole element of 
remuneration, paid for 
fulfilling the relevant 
role.
• The Non-Executive Chairman receives an 
all-inclusive fee for the role.
• The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Chairman is set by the Remuneration 
Committee. The Chairman receives a basic 
annual fee.
• NEDs receive a basic annual fee in respect of 
their Board duties. Further fees are paid to 
NEDs in respect of chairmanship and 
membership of certain Board committees.
• Fees are normally based on the level of fees 
paid to Chairmen and NEDs serving on boards 
of similar companies, the time commitment 
required of the role and the duties involved 
and take into consideration the requirement to 
attract and retain the quality of individuals 
required by the Company.
• Fees are normally reviewed at least once 
annually.
• The Board is responsible for determining fees 
for other NEDs although the NEDs are not 
involved in discussions about their own fees.
• There are currently no clawback provisions in 
place to enable recovery of sums paid.
• Fees are normally paid in cash although the 
Company retains the right to settle all/part of 
the fees as shares of equivalent value.
• Whilst there is no maximum individual fee 
level, fees are set at a level which is 
considered appropriate to attract and retain 
the calibre of individual required by the 
Company but the Company avoids paying 
more than necessary for this purpose.  
The Board may determine fee increases  
at any point as it considers appropriate  
in line with market movements and to  
take into account the time commitment  
and duties involved.
• Fees are paid for the following roles/duties:
 – Non-Executive Chairman;
 – Senior Independent Director;
 – Other NEDs;
 – Supplementary fee for chair of the Audit or 
Remuneration Committee*;
 – Supplementary fee for membership of the 
Audit and/or Remuneration Committees. *
 * Not paid to Chairman or Senior Independent 
Director
• The Chairman and NEDs will not normally be 
eligible for annual bonus, share incentives and 
pensions.
• Reasonable expenses (e.g. travel, 
accommodation and subsistence) 
associated with Chairman and NEDs’ duties 
will be reimbursed, including any tax due on 
the benefits.
• None.
Recruitment policy
Principles and approach
In determining remuneration arrangements for new appointments 
to the Board (including internal promotions), the Remuneration 
Committee applies the following principles:
• The Remuneration Committee is at all times conscious that any 
arrangements should be in the best interests of Ladbrokes and 
our shareholders, without paying more than is necessary;
• The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration all relevant 
factors, including the calibre of the individual, the nature of the role, 
local market practice, the individual’s current remuneration 
package, Ladbrokes’ remuneration policy, internal relativities 
and existing arrangements for other executive directors;
• Salaries will reflect the skills and experience of the individual, and 
may be set at a level to allow future salary progression to reflect 
performance in the role. The Committee also retains the right to 
determine that in the first year of appointment any annual bonus 
award will be subject to such conditions as it may determine;
• Typically, the remuneration package for a new appointment will 
be based on (or be transitioned onto) the same elements of the 
remuneration package as the other executive directors, in line 
with the policy table presented above.
It would be expected that the structure and quantum of the variable 
pay elements would reflect those set out in the policy table above. 
However , at recruitment, the Committee would retain the discretion 
to flex the balance between annual and long-term incentives and 
the measures used to assess performance for these elements, with 
the intention that a significant portion would be delivered in shares.
At recruitment, variable pay could, in exceptional circumstances, 
be delivered via alternative structures, again with the intention that 
a significant portion would be share-based, but in all circumstances 
subject to the overriding cap of 420% of salary.
The Committee retains discretion to make appropriate 
remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet the 
individual circumstances when an interim executive director is 
required to fill a role on a short-term basis or if exceptional 
circumstances require that the Chairman or a non-executive 
director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis.
Buy-outs
T o facilitate recruitment, the Remuneration Committee may make 
compensatory payments and/or awards for any remuneration 
arrangements subject to forfeiture on leaving a previous employer .  
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will take account of any 
terms attached to the forfeited arrangements. Awards will take such 
form as the Committee considers appropriate taking into account all 
relevant factors such as the nature of the award, any performance 
conditions attached to those awards, the likelihood of those conditions 
being met, and the proportion of vesting/performance period. The 
Committee’s intention is that the value awarded would be equivalent 
to the value forfeited.
Recruitment of the Chairman and non-executive directors
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive 
director , remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with 
those detailed in the relevant table above.
Disclosure
The remuneration structure of any new director will be disclosed 
in a timely manner and, as far as possible, in the relevant RIS 
notification at the time of appointment. In the next remuneration 
report, the Remuneration Committee will explain to shareholders 
the rationale for the relevant arrangements.
44 Executive Director service contracts
The key employment terms and other conditions of the current executive directors, as stipulated in their service contracts, are set out below:
Provision Policy
Notice period
• It is the Company’s policy for service contracts to require six months’ notice by the executive and 12 months’ notice from the Company.
• In a recruitment scenario, an executive director may initially be hired on a contract requiring the Company to provide 24 months’ notice which 
then reduces, pro rata over the course of the first year of the contract, to requiring 12 months’ notice from the Company.
• Richard Glynn’s contract pre-dates this policy and provides that both parties give 12 months’ notice to terminate the contract.
T ermination payment
• It is the Company’s policy for new service contracts that it may terminate employment by making a Payment In Lieu of Notice (PILON) equivalent 
to the value of base salary and benefits (including pension allowance) in respect of the notice period. This is the case with Ian Bull’s contract.
• In Ian Bull’s contract, there are specific provisions requiring a reduction in any phased PILON payments in the event that he finds alternative 
employment during the 12 months notice period.
• Richard Glynn’s contract dates from before this policy was put into place and does not contain a PILON clause. If the Company terminates his 
employment, the termination payment would be computed on a damages basis reflecting Richard Glynn’s loss as a result of termination and 
his legal obligation to mitigate loss. As outlined above, Richard Glynn has a 12 month notice period and the Company would seek to keep the cost 
of any departure to a minimum taking into account his contractual obligations and the circumstances of his departure.
Remuneration and benefits
• Participation in all incentive plans, including the annual bonus and the PSP , is non-contractual.
• Outstanding awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
Policy on payment for loss of office
The Remuneration Committee takes a number of factors 
into account when determining leaving arrangements for 
an executive director .
• The Remuneration Committee must satisfy any contractual 
obligations (i) being consistent with the Policy set out in this report, 
or (ii) if they are inconsistent having been entered into on a date on 
or before 27 June 2012 in accordance with relevant legislation.
• The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the 
relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises the 
leaver provisions of share plans under which executive directors 
may currently hold awards.
• Other payments which may be made as a result of loss of office 
include legal fees within an agreed maximum limit, outplacement 
counselling within an agreed maximum limit, payment for any 
outstanding accrued holiday and any other payments required 
by statute.
• The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that there should 
be no reward for failure. When exercising any discretion under the 
plans referred to below, the Committee will take into account the 
circumstances of the individual’s departure and his performance 
in the role.

• Ill health and disability
• Death
• Redundancy
• Other scenarios at the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion
Where a participant has a minimum of nine months’ full service in the 
relevant year a cash bonus will be paid. This amount will normally be 
subject to the achievement of the financial and individual objectives set 
at the beginning of the plan year . Any payment will be following the end 
of the relevant financial year and will normally be pro-rated for time 
served during the year , unless the Remuneration Committee determines 
otherwise.
Any amounts which would have ordinarily been deferred into the deferred 
bonus plan may be paid in cash at the same time.
The Remuneration Committee, however , has the ability to exercise its 
discretion to pay a bonus as it considers appropriate.
No bonus.

Committee determines that awards should vest early.
In either case, awards will vest to the extent that performance conditions 
have been satisfied and on a time apportioned basis, unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise.
Unvested awards lapse

date or earlier if the Remuneration Committee so determines. The award 
will be time pro-rated by reference to the performance period, unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise.
The exception to this is upon death, when awards shall vest immediately to 
the extent the Remuneration Committee determines is appropriate taking 
into account the period of time that has elapsed since grant and the extent 
to which performance conditions have been satisfied.

Non-Executive Director letters of appointment
The non-executive directors, including the Chairman of the Company, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and 
responsibilities. They do not have service contracts with either the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below:
Provision Policy
Period
• After the initial term, non-executive directors are typically expected to serve a further three-year term.
• Whilst appointed for a three-year term, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Chairman and all non-executive directors are subject 
to annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM.
Termination
• The appointment of a Chairman or a non-executive director is terminable without notice by either the Company or the director .
• Non-executive directors and the Chairman are not entitled to any compensation upon leaving office.
Availability of documentation
All executive directors’ service contracts and the letters of appointment for non-executive directors are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office during normal hours of business, and at the place of the Company’s 2014 Annual General Meeting on  
7 May 2014 from 10.45 am until the close of the meeting.
Illustration of our forward-looking remuneration policy
In support of the remuneration philosophy, Ladbrokes’ remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant 
proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of stretching short-term and long-term performance targets, aligned with the creation 
of sustainable shareholder value. In particular , there is an emphasis on long-term share-based incentives, i.e. the PSP .
The Remuneration Committee considers the level of remuneration that may be received under different performance outcomes to ensure 
that this is appropriate in the context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders.
The following charts provide illustrative values of the remuneration package for executive directors under three assumed performance 
scenarios.
In line with the regulations, the illustrations show the potential remuneration levels under Ladbrokes’ forward-looking remuneration policy. 
As such, it excludes potential payouts under our legacy one-off Growth Plan which was approved by shareholders in 2010. These charts are 
for illustrative purposes only and actual outcomes may differ from that shown.

Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the pay and 
conditions of colleagues throughout the Group when determining 
remuneration arrangements for executive directors. Information 
relating to wider workforce remuneration is provided in regular 
updates to the Remuneration Committee. This takes the form of a 
comparison of reward elements across all main workforce groups, 
updates on total reward communications and details of business 
wide reviews such as annual bonus awards and salary increases.
In particular , the Remuneration Committee pays specific attention to 
the general level of salary increases and bonus outcomes within the 
wider population.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee does not directly consult with 
our colleagues as part of the process of determining executive pay, 
the Committee does receive feedback from colleague surveys and 
takes this into account when reviewing executive pay. In addition, 
a significant number of our colleagues are shareholders and so are 
able to express their views in the same way as other shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback 
received in relation to an AGM at its next meeting following the AGM. 
As outlined on page 53 we received a 96.85% vote in favour of the 
2012 Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2013 AGM. 
This represents the end of the Policy Report
The Remuneration Committee has borne in mind individual 
shareholder views and best practice guidelines during the year . 
In particular the executive directors have committed to holding any 
shares under the PSP vesting in 2014, net of settlement of tax 
liabilities, for a minimum of six months after vesting has taken 
place. Furthermore we will be reviewing our PSP arrangements 
during 2014 and the Remuneration Committee will consider the 
period over which shares must be held.
In addition, Richard Glynn and Ian Bull voluntarily agreed not to 
exercise LGP shares following the first vesting date in August 2013 
until after 1 July 2014. 
The Remuneration Committee continues to be mindful of 
shareholder views when evaluating and setting on-going 
remuneration strategy, and we commit to consulting with 
shareholders prior to any significant changes to our 
remuneration policy. 
Minor amendments to policy
The Remuneration Committee may make minor changes to this 
Policy, which do not have a material advantage to directors, to aid 
in its operation or implementation without seeking shareholder 
approval for a revised version of this policy.

Methodology
(a) 
Salary and fees – this represents the base salary or fees paid in respect of the relevant financial year. No sums were paid to third parties in respect of any executive 
director’s services (2012: nil).
(b) 
Benefits – this represents the taxable value of all benefits paid in respect of the relevant financial year. Executive director benefits include private healthcare (for the 
executive and his family), critical illness, disability and life assurance, injury in service benefits, allowance for tax advice and a cash allowance in lieu of a company car.
(c) 
Cash allowance in lieu of pension – executive directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions equivalent to 22.5% of salary.
(d) 
Annual bonus – this reflects the nil bonus awarded in respect of the performance year and consequently there is no deferred bonus awarded for 2013.
(e) 
Long-term incentives – this figure represents the value of long-term incentive plans with a performance period ending in the relevant year. For 2013, this represents the 
value of the 201 1 awards under the Performance Share Plan (performance period from 1 January 201 1 to 31 December 2013) and also the value of the shares earned 
under the LGP at the first testing date covering performance in the period from 30 June 2010 to 29 June 2013.
• PSP: The value for 2013 represents an estimate of the market value of the shares that will vest following the publication of the Company’s results and is based on a three-
month average share price of 179.8p to 31 December 2013. Further detail in relation to achievement of performance conditions is on page 49. The 2012 values in this column 
(relating to awards with the performance period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012) have been revised from last year’s report, based on the actual share price of 
223.8p at the date of vesting on 21 February 2013 and inclusive of the supplementary shares delivered in respect of dividend equivalents (Richard Glynn: 71,578 shares).
• LGP: The new reporting regulations require us to recognise amounts relating to long-term incentives at the point at which performance conditions have been met, even if 
amounts remain subject to further continued employment requirements. The first performance test under the LGP occurred at the end of June 2013, and as a result 40.7% 
was earned by the executive directors. One third of this amount became capable of release in August 2013. This represents £1,213,000 and £452,000 for Richard Glynn and 
Ian Bull respectively, including associated dividend equivalents, valued using the share price of 210p on the vesting date of 6 August 2013. Richard Glynn and Ian Bull both 
voluntarily agreed not to exercise their share rights until after 1 July 2014. Therefore both executive directors have been exposed to the subsequent decrease in share price in 
the same way as other shareholders. The value of the proportion of the award that is capable of release as at 12 February 2014 is Richard Glynn £880,000 and Ian Bull 
£328,000, including dividend equivalents. Two thirds of the total earned amount is not yet capable of release, as it remains subject to a continued employment requirement. 
This proportion will vest in two equal tranches in June 2014 and June 2015 if the individual remains in employment at that time. The total shown in the table above also 
includes a value relating to the proportion of the earned award which remains subject to this continued employment requirement. Further details in respect of the 
achievement of performance conditions is provided on page 49.
(f) 
The Chairman receives a fee of £250,000 per annum. Other non-executive directors receive a basic fee of £43,000 per annum. The senior independent director receives 
a basic fee of £60,000 per annum. Additional fees are payable for the role of Chairman of the Audit or Remuneration Committee at a rate of £10,000 per annum and for 
membership of the Audit and/or Remuneration Committee at a rate of £7 ,000 per annum. 
David Martin was appointed as a non-executive director on 31 October 2013. His fee is paid to Arriva plc by mutual agreement. Christopher Rodrigues did not seek 
re-election at the 2013 AGM and therefore he stepped down from the Board as at 1 May 2013.

70% of the 2013 annual bonus was based on profit for the year 
(excluding profit from High Rollers). 30% of the 2013 annual bonus 
was based on individual objectives, which are primarily financial 
in nature. Furthermore, no portion of the award could vest without 
the achievement of a threshold level of profit over the bonus year .
2013 profit excluding High Rollers and exceptional items was 
£138.3 million. As a result, the threshold level of profit for any 
element of bonus to be paid was not met and accordingly no 
bonuses were awarded in respect of the 2013 financial year . The 
specific profit targets are considered commercially sensitive so have 
not been disclosed.

29 June 2013.
Following the 2013 performance test, shares become capable of 
release in three equal tranches in August 2013, June 2014 and June 
2015. The latter two tranches remain subject to continued 
employment. Richard Glynn and Ian Bull have voluntarily committed

Performance Share Plan awards
As outlined in the policy table, PSP awards are granted over Ladbrokes 
shares with the number of shares under award determined by 
reference to a percentage of base salary . Award levels in 2013 took  
into account individual performance prior to grant.
The following table provides details of the awards made under 
the PSP on 26 February 2013. Performance for these awards 
is measured over the three financial years from 1 January 2013 
to 31 December 2015. They are subject to the same performance 
conditions as for previous PSP awards.

Share Incentive Plan awards
Executive directors are eligible to participate in HMRC-approved 
all-employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible 
colleagues. During 2013, Richard Glynn and Ian Bull participated 
in the Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Under the plan during 2013, 
Richard Glynn purchased 453 shares and 226 bonus shares were 
awarded to him along with 74 shares in respect of the dividends 
paid by the Company on 9 May 2013 and 31 October 2013. Ian Bull 
purchased 453 shares and 226 bonus shares were awarded to 
him along with 22 shares in respect of the dividends paid by the 
Company on 9 May 2013 and 31 October 2013.
Payments to past directors
As disclosed in the 2012 Directors’ remuneration report, Richard 
Ames resigned as a director of the Company on 1 August 2012 and 
ceased employment in the Group on 30 November 2012.
The key features of his treatment upon cessation of employment 
were disclosed in last year’s report. Some of these payments 
became payable in the 2013 financial year as follows:
• Seven monthly instalments of £31,662 as the balance amount 
for the compensation payment agreed in settlement of all 
claims for loss of office. This amount would have been mitigated 
had Richard Ames obtained alternative employment during 
this period.
• As disclosed last year , under the annual bonus plan, a pro-rated 
portion of Richard Ames’ 2012 bonus was paid in March 2013 at 
the same time as for all other continuing executives.
• As disclosed in last year’s report, in relation to the Performance 
Share Plan and Ladbrokes Growth Plan, the Remuneration 
Committee determined that Richard Ames should be treated as 
a good leaver . Therefore his share awards would continue to 
subsist, and would vest to the extent that relevant performance 
targets are met at the end of the relevant performance period. 
The vested amount would be subject to time prorating to reflect 
his period of employment during the performance period.
• In 2013, Richard Ames received 315,445 shares in relation to 
his pro-rated 2010 award under the PSP and 294,555 shares 
earned under the LGP , of which he received 110,876 shares 
on 6 August 2013.
Payments for loss of office
In 2013, there have been no payments to directors for loss of office.
Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests
Directors’ shareholdings and share ownership guidelines
The Company’s shareholding guidelines require executive directors 
to build up over time a personal shareholding equivalent in value to 
at least one year’s base salary. Executives are encouraged to retain 
vested shares earned under the Company’s incentive plans until the 
shareholding guidelines have been met. 
Shares which the executive directors hold outright and/or vested 
shares under the Company’s share plans count towards the 
requirement. Unvested share awards only count towards the 
requirement if vesting is not subject to any further performance 
conditions or other conditions such as continued employment.
On this basis, Richard Glynn and Ian Bull have met the Company’s 
shareholding requirement in full.

Historical TSR performance and CEO remuneration outcomes
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE250, the FTSE250 index provides an appropriate indication of market movements against which 
to benchmark the Company’s performance. The chart below summarises the Company’s TSR performance against the FTSE250 index over 
the five-year period to 31 December 2013.
The table below the chart summarises the CEO single figure for total remuneration, annual bonus pay-outs and L TIP vesting levels as a

(2) 
Increases in total compensation in 2012 and 2013 have been as a result of increased pay-outs under the Company’s long-term incentive plans, e.g. PSP and LGP .  
Richard Glynn has not received any changes to salary or cash allowance in lieu of pension since his appointment in April 2010.

Implementation of remuneration policy in 2014
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is 
proposing to implement the remuneration policy in 2014.
Base salary
In determining salary increases for 2014, the Remuneration 
Committee took into consideration business performance, 
affordability and pay and conditions across the Group and 
determined that there will be no increase in 2014.
The table below shows base salaries for 2014:
Base salary  
fr om 1 Mar 2014
Richar d Glynn £580,000
Ian Bull £400,000
Benefits
Benefits are generally set at an appropriate market competitive 
level, taking into account a number of factors including market 
practice for comparable roles within appropriate pay comparators.
There will be no changes to the benefits package received by 
executive directors in 2014.
Cash allowance in lieu of pension
The current executive directors have elected to receive a cash 
allowance of 22.5% of salary in lieu of pension, and there will 
be no change to cash allowance levels for 2014.
The table below shows cash allowances for 2014.
2014  
c ash al low ance in lieu of pension  
£ (% of salary)
Richar d Glynn £130,500 (22.5%)
Ian Bull £90,000 (22.5%)
52 Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for executive directors will 
remain at 170% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 
130% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer in 2014.
The table below provides further information on the performance 
measures against which performance will be measured:
R elativ e weighting (% of bonus opportunity)
Financial – Gr oup profit 60%
Individual – mainly specific financial targets 40%
Profit is the key financial measure. Profit attributed to High Rollers 
is excluded from the profit performance calculations for annual 
bonus purposes. However , the impact of High Rollers may be 
included in the assessment of individual objectives for those directly 
responsible for the relevant areas of the business. The individual 
objectives element of the bonus remains subject to a profit 
underpin in 2014.
At this stage, the Committee considers that the exact annual bonus 
targets remain commercially sensitive. However , in next year’s 
annual report, we commit to providing shareholders with as much 
context as possible on performance against those targets and the 
resulting bonus out-turn rationale, within commercial constraints.
Performance Share Plan
The usual maximum PSP award will remain at 175% of salary for 
the Chief Executive Officer and 150% of salary for the Chief Financial 
Officer in 2014. The exact award levels have not yet been 
determined but will not exceed these levels. The performance 
conditions and targets will remain unchanged. 
Non-executive director remuneration
The table below shows the NED fee structure as at 1 January 2014.
2014 fees
Chairman of the Boar d fee £250,000
Senior independent director £60,000
Board member £43,000
Additional fee for Audit or Remuner ation 
Committee Chairman* £10,000
Additional fee for membership of the Audit 
and/or Remuner ation Committee* £7,000
*Not payable to Chairman or Senior Independent Director. 
Consideration by the Committee of matters relating to 
directors’ remuneration
The Ladbrokes Board entrusts the Committee with the responsibility 
for the remuneration policy in respect of executive directors and 
senior executives and ensuring its on-going appropriateness 
and relevance. In setting the remuneration for these groups, 
the Committee takes into account the pay and conditions of the 
wider workforce as a matter of course.
The table below shows the Committee members during the year 
and their attendance at Committee meetings:

Committee.
During the year , the Committee received independent advice on 
executive remuneration matters from Deloitte LLP . Deloitte LLP 
received £69,000 in fees for these services. Deloitte LLP is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, 
voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Deloitte LLP also 
provide the Company with internal audit and miscellaneous tax 
and consulting services. The Committee has appointed Deloitte LLP 
to the role of independent advisers to the Committee.
The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte LLP 
during the year and is satisfied that it has been objective and 
independent.

Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements 
1 Corporate information 
Ladbrokes plc (the Company) is a limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded. The 
address of its registered office and principal place of business is 
disclosed in the corporate information section of the Annual Repo rt. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together, ‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 December 
2013 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
directors on 2 4 February 2014.  
The principal activit ies of the Group are described in note 5. 
2 Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted for use in the European Union.  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling 
(£), which is the Group’s functional and presentational currency. All 
values are in millions (£m) rounded to one decimal place except where 
otherwise indicated. 
To assist in understanding its underlying performance, the Group has 
defined the following items of income and expense as exceptional in 
nature: 
●
profits or losses on disposal or impairment of non -current assets or 
businesses; 
●
unrealised gains and losses on derivative financial instrumen ts;  
●
corporate transaction costs ; and 
●
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. 
Any other non -recurring items are considered individually for 
classification as exceptional by virtue of their nature and size. 
The exceptional items have been inc luded within the appropriate 
classifications in the consolidated income statement.  
3 Changes in accounting policies 
The Group has combined ‘cost of sales before depreciation and 
amortisation’ and ‘administrative expenses’ into ‘operating expenses 
before depreciation and amortisation’ within the consolidated income 
statement. This is consistent with how costs are reported and 
managed within the business. The prior year comparative consolidated 
income statement has been restated to reflect this change. 
From 1 January 2013 the Group has applied, for the first time, certain 
standards, interpretations and amendments. These include IFRS 13 
Fair Value Measurement , IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011) and 
amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS 7 
Financial Instruments: Disclosures .  
The Group has adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. It establishes 
a single source of guidance for fair value measurements. The standard 
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
including a requirement to incorporate own credit risk in fair value 
measurement of liabilities , and requires disclosures about fair value 
measurements. In general, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 13 are 
more extensive than those required in the curren t standards. Although 
the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the 
results or financial position of the Group, the Group has included 
additional disclosures to reflect the requirements of the standard.  
The Group has adopted the r evision of IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The 
most significant change relates to the net interest on the pension asset 
calculation being based on a single discount rate rather than the 
expected asset return. The impact on the Group of applying this revision 
was a decrease to profit of £0.2 million and an increase to other 
comprehensive income of £0.2 million. The prior period income 
statement and statement of comprehensive income for the period 
ended 31 December 2012 have not been restated, as the decrease to 
profit and decrease to other comprehensive expense of £0.2 million is 
not material to the Group.  
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements, which require the Group to separate items of 
other comprehensive income into two distinct categories: items that 
will not be reclassified subsequently to the income statement; and 
items that will be reclassified subsequently to the income statement 
when specific conditions are met. Income tax on items of other 
comprehensive income is required to be allocated on the same basis.  
The Group has adopted the amendment of IFRS 7. The most significant 
change relates to offsetting financial assets and liabilities. The 
amendments require disclosure about rights of set -off and related 
arrangements and are required for all recognised financial instruments 
that are set off in accordance with IAS 32. The disclosures also apply to 
recognised financial instruments that are subject to an enforceable 
master netting arrangement irrespective of whethe r they are set off in 
accordance with IAS 32. The adoption of this standard did not have a 
significant impact on the results, financial positio n or disclosures of the 
Group. Several other amendments apply for the first time in 2013. 
However, they do not im pact the annual consolidated financial 
statements of the Group or the interim condensed consolidated 
financial statements of the Group.  
4 Summary of significant accounting policies  
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Group at 31 December each year. The underlying 
financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same 
reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the po wer to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. 
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated, using the purchase method of 
accounting, from the date on which control is transferred to the Group 
and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred from the Group.  
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a 
subsidiary are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the separately 
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where 
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those 
used by the Group. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial information requires the use of 
assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions. Use 
of available information and application of judgement are inherent in 
the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future may differ from 
those reported. In this regard, management believ es that the 
accounting policies where judgement is necessarily applied are those 
that relate to: the measurement and impairment of goodwill and 
indefinite life intangible assets; the measurement and accounting for 
business combinations; the measurement of pension and other post -
employment benefit obligations; the determination of the initial fair 
value of betting and gaming transactions; the recoverable amount of 
trade receivables; income tax and the valuation of financial guarantee 
contracts. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. 
62 63 
 
Further information about key assumptions concerning the future and 
other key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below. 
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible as sets 
The Group has determined that betting shop licences have indefinite 
lives. 
The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite life intangible 
assets are impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an 
estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the cash generating units to which the 
goodwill and intangible assets are allocated. Estimating a value in use 
amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected 
future cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to choose a 
suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows. Further details are given in notes 13 and 14. 
Business combinations 
The Group applies judgement in determining whether a transaction is a 
business combination, which includes consideration as to whether the 
Group has ac quired a business or a group of assets. 
For business combinations, the Group estimates the fair value of the 
consideration transferred, which includes assumptions about the 
future business performance of parts of the Group and an appropriate 
discount rate to determine the fair value of any contingent 
consideration. Judgement is also applied in determining whether any 
future payments should be classified as contingent consideration or as 
remuneration for future services. 
The Group then estimates the fair val ue of assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed in the business combination, including any 
separately identifiable intangible assets. These estimates also require 
inputs and assumptions including future earnings, customer attrition 
rates and discount rates. The Group engages external experts to 
support the valuation process, where appropriate. 
The fair value of contingent consideration recognised in business 
combinations is reassessed at each reporting date, using updated 
inputs and assumptions based on the latest financial forecasts for 
the relevant business. Judgement is applied as to whether changes 
should be applied at the acquisition date or a s post-acquisition 
changes. Further details of these judgements are given in note 33. 
Pension and other post -employment benefit obligations 
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post -employment 
benefits is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial 
valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, expected 
rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and 
future pension increases. Due to the long -term nature of these plans, 
such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Further details 
are given in note 29. 
Betting and gaming transactions 
Betting and gaming transactions are measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable from customers. This is normally 
the nominal amount of the consideration but on certain occasions, the 
fair value is estimated using valuation techniques, taking into account 
the credit profile of customers in determining the collectability of the 
consideration. In addition, where there are indicators that any trade 
receivable is impaired at the balance sheet date, management makes 
an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Further details are 
given in note 18. 
Income tax 
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions.  
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for 
income taxes due to uncertainty of the amount of income tax that may 
be payable, and in respect of determining the level of the future taxable 
profits of the Group that support the recoverability of deferred tax 
assets. Further details are given in note 10. 
Financial guarantee contracts 
The valuation of financial guarantee contracts and related indemnities 
requires use of assumptions of the risks of default of the guaranteed 
entities and the credit profiles of the counterparties. Further details are 
given in note 24. 
Investments in joint ventures  
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a 
long-term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or 
more other venturers under a contractual agreement.  
The Group’s share of results o f joint ventures is included in the Group 
consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Group consolidated 
balance sheet at cost plus post -acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of n et assets of the entity less any impairment in value. The 
carrying value of investments in joint ventures includes acquired 
goodwill. 
If the Group’s share of losses in the joint venture equals or exceeds its 
investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further 
losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on 
behalf of the joint venture.  
Investments in associates 
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long -term 
interest and is able to exercise signif icant influence over the financial 
and operational policies but does not have control or joint control over 
those policies. 
The Group’s share of results of associates is included in the Group 
consolidated income statement using the equity method of account ing. 
Investments in associates are carried in the Group consolidated 
balance sheet at cost plus post -acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of net assets of the entity less any impairment in value. The 
carrying value of investments in associates includes acquired goodwill. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of 
the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net 
fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. In 
accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, goodwill is not 
amortised but reviewed annually for impairment and as such, is stated 
at cost less any provision for impairment of value. A ny impairment is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement and is 
not subsequently reversed. On acquisition, any goodwill acquired is 
allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment 
testing. Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of 
the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the 
operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
operation.  
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and those 
acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately 
from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial 
recognition. The costs relating to internally generated intangible assets, 
principally software costs, are capitalised if the criteria for recognition 
as assets are met. Other expenditure is charged against profit in the 
year in which the expenditure is incurred. Following initial recog nition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses.  
The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be either 
finite or indefinite. Where amortisation is charged on assets with finite 
lives, this expense is taken to the consolidated income statement 
through the ‘depreciation, amortisation and amounts written off non -
current assets’ line item. Useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis.  
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment 
annually, either individually, or at the cash generating unit level.

An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal, with any gain or loss 
arising (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the item) included in the consolidated 
income statement in the year of disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Land is stated at cost less any impairment in value. Buildings, plant and 
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line 
method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its 
useful economic life as follows: Buildings – 50 years or estimated 
useful life of the building, or lease, whichever is less, to estimated 
residual value. 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – four to 10 years as considered 
appropriate to write down cost to estimated residual value. 
The carrying values of plant and equipment a re reviewed for 
impairment annually as to whether there are events or changes in 
circumstances indicating that the carrying values may not be 
recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values 
exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash 
generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of pla nt and equipment is the greater of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset 
that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in the ‘depreciati on and amounts written off non -current 
assets’ line item. 
An item of property, plant and e quipment is derecognised upon 
disposal, with any gain or loss arising (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
item) included in the consolidated income statement in the year of 
disposal. 
Leases 
Leases that transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits 
incidental to ownership of the leased item are capitali sed at the 
inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at 
the present value of the minimum lease paymen ts. Lease payments 
are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the 
lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly 
against income. 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the benefits and risks 
of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating 
lease payments, other than contingent rentals, are recognised as an 
expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis 
over the lease term. 
Recoverable amount of non -current assets 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is a ny 
indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the 
recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset 
does not generate cash infl ows that are largely independent of those 
from other assets or groups of assets. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than three 
months, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to the 
contracts that give rise to them. 
The Group classifies financial assets at inception as loans and 
receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or 
available-for-sale financial assets . 
Loans and receivables are non -derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. On 
initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value net 
of transaction costs. Subsequently, the fair values are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any allowance 
for impairment. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative 
financial instruments. Financial assets through profit or loss are 
measured initially at fair value with transaction costs taken directly to 
the consolidated income statement. Subsequently, the fair values are 
remeasured, and gains and are recognised in the conso lidated income 
statement. 
Available for sale financial assets comprise equity investments that are 
neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value 
through profit or loss. Available for sale financial assets are measured 
initially at fair value. Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured , and 
gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.  
Trade receivables are generally accounted for at amortised cost. 
The Group reviews indicators of impairment o n an ongoing basis and 
where such indicators exist, the Group makes an estimate of the 
asset’s recoverable amount. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities comprise interest bearing loans and borrowings, 
contingent consideration, ante-post bets, guarantees and derivative 
financial instruments. On initial recognition, financial liabilities are 
measured at fair value plus transaction costs where they are not 
categorised as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include contingent 
consideration, derivative financial instruments, ante-post bets and 
guarantees. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured 
initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly to the 
consolidated income statement. Subsequently, the fair values are 
4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
 
64 65 
 
remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
All interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair 
value net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial 
recognition, fixed rate interest bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. 
The Group has provided financial guarantees to third parties in respect 
of lease obligations of certain of the Group ’s former subsidiaries within 
the disposed hotels division. Financial guarantee contracts are 
classified as financial liabilities and are measured at fair value by 
estimating the probability of the guarantees being called upon and the 
related cash outflows from the Group. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities  
Financial assets are derecognised w hen the right to receive cash flows 
from the assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its 
contractual right to receive the cash flows from the financial assets or 
has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party, and either: 
●
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or 
●
substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been retained 
nor transferred but control is not retained. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, 
cancelled or expires. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross 
currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps, to 
hedge its risks associat ed with interest rate and foreign currency 
fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially 
and subsequently at fair value. The gains or losses on remeasurement 
are taken to the consolidated income statement. 
Derivative financial ins truments are classified as assets where their fair 
value is positive, or as liabilities where their fair value is negative. 
Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are 
only offset if the transactions are with the same counterp arty, a legal 
right of offset exists and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on a 
net basis. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the directors ’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date 
and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the 
discount is recognised as a finance expense. 
Foreign currency translation 
The presentation and functional currency of Ladbrokes plc and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries are Pounds Sterling (£). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling at 
the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the foreign currency rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the 
consolidated income statement. Tax charges and credits attributable to 
exchange differences on those borrowings are dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of 
the initial transaction. Non -monetary items measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
when the fair value was determined. 
The main functional currency of overseas subsidiaries is the Euro (€).  
At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas 
subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling (£) at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements 
are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. The post -tax 
exchange differences arising on the retranslation, since the date of 
transition to IFRSs, are taken directly to a separate component of 
equity. On disposal of a forei gn entity, the deferred cumulative amount 
recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign entity is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Income tax 
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary 
differences at t he balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences: 
●
except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor the tax profit; and 
●
associated with investments in subsidiaries and a ssociates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences and carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry 
forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losse s can be utilised: 
●
except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 
time of the transaction, aff ects neither the accounting profit nor the 
tax profit; and 
●
in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, deferred tax assets are 
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the deducti ble 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the 
deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the yea r when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax balances are not discounted. 
Interest or penalties payable and receivable in relation to income tax 
are recognised as an income tax expense or credit in the consolidated 
income statement. The impact of the change in the current year is 
described in note 10. 
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised 
in equity and not in the consolidated income statement.

The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included as part of receivables or paya bles in the 
consolidated balance sheet. 
Pensions and other post- employment benefits 
The Group’s defined benefit pension plan , the Ladbrokes Pension Plan 
holds assets separately from the Group. The pension cost relating to 
this plan is assessed in accordanc e with the advice of independent 
qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.  
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 
Any past service cost is recogni sed immediately to the extent that the 
benefits have already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight 
line basis over the average period until the benefits vest. The retirement 
benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value 
of scheme assets less the value of the defined benefit obligations as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost. 
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged 
to the consolidated income statement in the period to which the 
contributions relate. 
In accounting for the Group’s defined benefit pension plan, it is 
necessary for management to make a number of estimates and 
assumptions each year. These include the discount rates, future 
changes to salaries, employee turnover, inflation ra tes and life 
expectancy. In making these estimates and assumptions, management 
considers advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries. 
Where actual experience differs to these estimates, actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised directly in equi ty. Refer to note 29 for details of 
the values of assets and obligations and key assumptions used. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on 
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group ’s own equity 
instruments. 
ESOP trusts 
Where the Group holds its own equity shares through ESOP trusts 
these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any consideration 
paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in 
the reconciliation of movements in shareholders ’ funds and no gain or 
loss is recognised wi thin the consolidated income statement or the 
statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of these shares. 
Dividends 
Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the 
year end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have 
been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable from customers for goods and services provided in the 
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales -
related taxes. 
For licensed betting offices, on course betting, Core Telephone Betting, 
mobile betting, High Rollers, Digital businesses (including sportsbook, 
casino, games, other number bets), revenue represents gains and 
losses, being the amounts staked and fees received, less total payouts 
and the fair value of reward points issued from betting activity in the 
period. Open betting positions are carried at fair value and gains and 
losses arising on these positions are recognised in revenue. 
When a bet is placed and reward points are issued under the Odds On 
loyalty scheme, the fair value of the reward points is deferred and 
recorded as a liability. The deferred revenue is recognised when the 
reward points are used or when they expire. 
Revenue from the online poker business reflects the net income (rake) 
earned from poker games completed by the period end. 
In the case of the greyhound stadia, revenue represents income arising 
from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, including 
sales of refreshments. 
Finance expense and income 
Finance expense and income arising on interest bearing financial 
instruments carried at amortised cost are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate 
method. Finance expense includes the amortisation of fees that are an 
integral part of the effective finance cost of a financial instrument, 
including issue costs, and the amortisation of any other differences 
between the amount initial ly recognised and the redemption price. 
Net gains and losses in respect of mark -to-market adjustments on 
financial instruments carried at fair value, foreign exchange 
adjustments and net gains and losses on financial guarantees are 
included in exceptional items in the consolidated income statement. 
Share-based payment transactions 
Certain employees (including directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled share- based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for 
shares or rights over shares (equity settled transactions). 
The cost of equity settled transactions is measured by reference to the 
fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value is 
determined using a binomial model, further deta ils of which are given 
in note 30. In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of 
any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of 
the shares of Ladbrokes plc (market conditions). 
The cost of equity settled transacti ons is recognised together with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date). 
The cumulative expe nse recognised for equity settled transactions at 
each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the 
opinion of the directors of the Group at that date, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will ultimately 
vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except 
for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which 
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are 
satisfied. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share 
dilution in the computation of earnings per share as shown in note 12. 
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee 
share trust for the granting of non -transferable options to executives 
and senior employees.  
4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
 
66 67 
 
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as 
treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction 
from equity. Refer to consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
Future accounting developments 
The following new standards, interpretations and amendments have 
been issued but were not effective for the financial year beginning 
1 January 2013 and have not been early adopted:  
On 12 May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure o f 
Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements and 
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures which are all 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. 
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities 
including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 
will require management to exercise significant judgement to 
determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to 
be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that 
were in IAS 27.  
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and removes the 
option to account for jointly -controlled entities using proportionate 
consolidation. Instead entities that meet the definition of a jo int venture, 
based on rights to net assets only, must be accounted for using the 
equity method. 
IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures required by IFRS 10, IAS 27, IAS 
28 and IFRS 11 in one standard. These disclosures relate to an entity’s 
interests in su bsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured 
entities. A number of new disclosures are also required including how 
the entity determines that it controls another entity where judgement is 
used. 
As a consequence of the IASB consolidations project, IAS 27 is 
renamed Separate Financial Statements and is limited to accounting 
for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities, and associates in separate 
financial statements. IAS 28 has been renamed Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures, and describes the application of the 
equity method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in November 2009 for 
financial assets and reissued in October 2010 to include financial 
liabilities. The Group is required to adopt this standard for the year 
ended 31 December 2015. IFRS 9 addresses the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. The key requirements of IFRS 9 
are that at initial recognition, all financial instruments are measured at 
fair value with different requirements for subsequent measurement for 
debt and equity instruments. The standard provides relief from the 
requirement to restate comparative financial statements for the effect 
of applying IFRS 9. 
On 29 May 2013, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable 
Amount Disclosures for Non- Financial Assets (Amendments to IAS 36). 
These narrow-scope amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of 
Assets address the disclosure of information about the recoverable 
amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less 
costs of disposal. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. 
Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement entitled Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of 
Hedge Accounting (Amendments to IAS 39) were issued in June 2013 . 
The narrow-scope amendments will allow hedge accounting to 
continue in a situation where a derivative, which has been designated 
as a hedging instrument, is novated to effect clearing with a central 
counterparty as a result of laws or regulation, if specific conditions are 
met (in this context, a novation indicates that parties to a contract agree 
to replace their original counterparty with a n ew one). The 
amendments are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2014.  
In May 2013, the IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 21: Levies, an 
interpretation on the accounting for levies imposed by governments. 
The guidance clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy 
when the activity that triggers the payment, as identified by the relevant 
legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a 
minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability s hould 
be anticipated before the minimum threshold is reached. IFRIC 21 is 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. 
The Group has decided not to early adopt the above standard s and 
amendments, and is currently assessing the imp act on its financial 
statements. 
There are no other IFRSs or IFRICs in issue but not yet effective that are 
expected to have a significant impact on the Group.

5 Segment information 
Management has determined the Group ’s operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors to make strategic decisions. 
The performance of the Group ’s continuing business is assessed and measured according to the nature of the services provided. IFRS 8 requires 
segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used by the Board for assessing performance and allocating resources, and the Group ’s 
operating segments are aggregated into the five reportable segments detailed below: 
●
UK Retail: comprises betting activities in the shop estate in Great Britain. 
●
European Retail: comprises all activities connected with the Ireland (Northern and Republic of), Belgium and Spain shop estates. 
●
Digital: comprises betting and gaming activities from online and mobile operations which includes Ladbrokes Israel, Ladbrokes Australia and Betdaq. 
●
Core Telephone Betting: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone, excluding High Rollers. 
●
High Rollers: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone from High Rollers.  
The Board continues to assess the perf ormance of operating segments based on a measure of net revenue, profit before tax and net finance expense. 
This measurement basis excludes the effect of exceptional income and expenditu re from the operating segments. 
Transfer prices between operating segm ents are on an arm ’s-length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

In addition to salary, employees may qualify for various benefit schemes operated by the Group. Eligibility for benefits is normally determi ned primarily 
according to an employee ’s length of service and level of responsibility. The amounts of some benefits are proportion ate to individual salary. 
Benefits may include paid leave for holidays, maternity and illness, as well as insured benefits. The latter can cover privat e healthcare for the employee 
and their immediate family, long -term disability, personal accident and dea th in service cover. Company cars, including fuel benefits, are provided 
predominantly to meet job requirements but also to certain executives. 
The principal benefit schemes are: 
(i) Pensions 
Ladbrokes Pension Scheme (LPS) 
Under the n ew auto-enrolment legislation, employees meeting the statutory eligibility requirements are automatically enrolled in the LPS, a 
defined contribution scheme. The contributions paid by the Group and employees meet those statutorily required. Subject to meeting certain 
eligibility and employment grade criteria, employees can choose for the Group to match their contributions up to specified limits. For the majority 
of employees the maximum match is 6% of broadly base salary. The maximum match is higher for some employees, depending upo n grade.  
(a) Ladbrokes Pension Plan (LPP) 
This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007. Members contribute on average six per cent of pensionable salary per annum . Benefit 
generally accrues to provide a target pension of half (for joiners before June 2002: two thirds) of final pensionable salary for an employee attaining 
age 65 with at least 40 years ’ membership. A spouse ’s pension is payable following death. 
LPP – Executive Section 
Members contribute on average seven per cent of pensionable sala ry per annum. Benefit accrues to provide a target pension from all sources of 
two thirds of final pensionable salary for an executive attaining age 6 5 with at least 2 6.7 years’ membership (for joiners before June 2002, 
employees attaining age 6 0 with at le ast 20 years’ service). A spouse ’s and children ’s pensions are payable following death. 
LPP incorporates an Earnings Cap on Pensionable Salary. Executive directors and senior executives, for whom this applies, have a choice between: 
(i) membership of the Executive Section of the LPP plus a cash supplement of up to 22.5 per cent of base salary in excess of the Earnings Cap; 
or 
(ii) a cash supplement of up to 22.5 per cent of base salary in lieu of membership of the LPP. 
(ii)Share-based payments 
Details of employ ee share schemes operated by the Group are shown in the Directors ’ remuneration report on pages 40 to 53 that forms part of the 
Annual Report 201 3. 
Details of options granted in 201 3 and outstanding at 31 December 201 3 are shown in note 30. Details of dire ctors’ remuneration and the policies 
adopted in determining it can be found in the Directors ’ remuneration report on pages 40 to 53.

The Group has further tax losses at 31 December 2013 of £ 78.6 million (2012: £106.9 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable 
profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is insufficient 
certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of temporary differences may be deducted . There are no significant 
taxable temporary differences associated with inves tments in subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures. 
The standard rate of UK Corporation Tax was reduced from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013. This will be reduced to 21% from 1 Apr il 2014 and, as 
announced by the Chancellor in the Budget on 20 March 2013, to 20% from 1 April 2015.  
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 20%. Th e reduction to 20%, effective 
1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.

Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of business combinations including the deferred tax liability arising on statutory 
licence acquisitions.  
During the current year, goodwill has been recognised on the business combinations with Playtech (£34.9 million), Betdaq (£31.5 million) and Gaming 
Investments Pty Ltd (£2 3.0 million). In the prior year, goodwill of £1.7 million w as recognised on the acquisition of Stadium Technology Group LLC. 
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences. The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are considered to ha ve an 
indefinite life for a combination of reasons: 
●
Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well -established markets; 
●
there is a proven , sustained demand for bookmaking services; 
●
existing law acts to restrict entry; and 
●
Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost. 
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capital ised costs in respect of internally generated software together with software acquired 
as part of business combinations .  
The customer relationships intangible asset s relate to the Group ’s acquisition of its former partner in the Nordic region and the curr ent year acquisitions 
of Betdaq and Gaming Investments Pty Ltd .  
Brand and domain names intangible assets relate to the Group’s acquisitions of Betdaq and Gaming Investments Pty Ltd.

14 Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment at each reporting date by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets 
with their recoverable amounts ( being the higher of fair value less c osts to sell and value in use). 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) expected to ben efit from the synergies of the 
combination. If the re coverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill allocated to that group would be 
regarded as not impaired. The carrying amounts of goodwill by segment are as follows: 
 
2013 
£m 
2012 
£m 
Goodwill   
UK Retail 35.4 35.4 
European Retail 12.7 12.7 
Digital  90.5 1.7 
 138.6 49.8 
No impairments were identified in both years. 
Licences 
Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets. Each CGU represents the lowest 
level within the Group at which the licences are monitored for internal management purposes which in the majority of instance s is an individual shop. 
Where the cash flows of one or more shops are not entirely independent, these are grouped to form a CGU . During the year, these groupings have been 
reassessed which has led to an £8.7 million reduction in the impairment charge at 31 December 2013 across the UK and European Retail shop estate. 
The carrying value of licences at 31 December 2013 was £486.1 million (2012: £488.6 million) allocated as £311.7 million to UK Retail (201 2: £324.2 
million) and £174.4 million to European Retail (201 2: £164.4 million). 
Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined 
The recoverable amounts of th e CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These are based on budgets approved by management for the next 
three years extrapolated thereafter using a 2.5% growth rate (201 2: 2.5%). This rate does not exceed the average long -term growth rate for the relevant 
markets. 
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations 
The key assumptions taken into account by management are the amounts staked, the gross win margin and the discount rate appli ed. The estimated 
amounts staked and gross win margin are b ased upon historic experience, management ’s best estimate of future trends and performance taking 
account of industry sources. The pre -tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections for CGUs in UK Retail is 12.4% (201 2: 11.4%), in European Retail is 
between 11.3% and 12.4% (2012: between 10.3 % and 11. 4%) and in Digital is 11.0% (2012: 11.0%) . 
The recoverable amounts of certain individual UK Retail CGUs were below their carrying amounts at 31 December 2013 and accordingly an impa irment 
loss of £13.7 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £ni l) within the 
‘Depreciation, amortisation and amounts written off non -current assets’ line as an exceptional item . In respec t of European Retail shop licences there 
has been a reversal of £2.3 million of previously recorded impairment charges as the recoverable amounts of certain CGUs were above their carryin g 
amounts at 31 December 2013 (2012: £nil). The credit of £2.3 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 
31 December 2013 within the “Depreciation, amortisation and amounts written off non -current assets” line as an exceptional item. 
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensi tive to changes in cash flows or discount rate. Change in the cash flow projections or the discount rate 
would trigger a further impairment loss. For example, an increase of 0.5% in the pre -tax discount rate would have resulted in an additional impairment 
loss of approximately £2.5 million (2012: £1.2 million) for UK Retail and £2.2 million (2012: £4.8 million) for European Retail, or a reduction in projected 
cash flows of 5% would have resulted in an additional impairment loss of approximately £8.8 million (2012: £0.9 million) for UK Retail and £10.1 million 
(2012: £3.4 million) for European Retail. For Digital, no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in an impairment.

The Group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £333.7 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: £348.5 million). In 2013 and 2012 the facilities, 
including all of the bank loans in the tabl e above, are due to expire in more than two years but not more than f ive years (in December 2016). 
23 Financial risk management objectives and policies 
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, foreign exchange 
rates and interest rates. The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Group ’s treasury exposures to reduce risk in accordance with policies 
approved by the Board. 
The Group’s principal financ ial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, and cash and short -term 
deposits, together with certain derivative financial instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group ’s 
operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables and accruals that ari se directly from its 
operations. At 31 December 201 3 and at 31 December 2012 the Group had no significant derivatives. 
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group ’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken other than betting and 
gaming transactions. The Group ’s exposure to ante -post betting and gaming transactions is not significant. 
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Boa rd reviews and agrees policies for 
managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments. 
  
 
80 81 
 
23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equi valents. 
The Group’s policy for the year ended 31 December 2013 was to maintain a minimum of 25% (2012: 25%) of total borrowings at fi xed interest rates to 
reduce its sensitivity to movements in variable short -term interest rates. At 31 December 2013, £223.0 million or 52.8% (2012: £222.4 million or 54.8%) 
of the Group’s gross borrowings were at fixed rates. 
Interest on financial instruments at floating rates is re -priced at intervals of less than six months. Interest on financial instruments at fixed rates is fixed 
until the maturity of the instrument. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is 
applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.

£m 
2012 
£m 
100 basis points increase  (0.2) (0.9)  – – 
200 basis points increase – (2.0)  – – 
The sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities, subject to interest at 
floating rates, held by the Group at the year end. Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a ma terial impact on income and 
equity for the year. As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented. 
Foreign currency risk 
Other than the translation of foreign currency subsidiaries, there is no significant foreign currency exposure. 
The total carrying value of the Group’s foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2013 was £0.6 million (2012: £nil). This consisted of a £0.5 million 
overdraft denominated in Australian dollars and a £0.1 million overdraft denominated in Euros. The Group had no other foreign currency borrowings at 
31 December 2013 (2012: £nil).  
Credit risk 
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterpa rties and customers. 
It is the Group ’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances 
are monitored on an ongoing basis. Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior management on an individ ual basis. 
The Group’s High Rollers division consists of individuals who place sizeable stakes. The Group manages this activity and the associated ris k exposure by 
utilising senior management expertise to manage the levels of stakes placed. Of the £2.4 million (2012: £3.3 million) trade receivables balance, £2.2 million 
(2012: £2.8 million) relates to the Group ’s Core Telephone Betting and High Rollers divisions. 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalen ts and a loan to a joint venture, the 
Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of th ese instruments. 
Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents is managed by rest ricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and 
by setting an exposure ceiling per bank. 
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group. This risk is partly mitigated by the 
indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees. For further detail of these guarantees refer 
to note 24. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between con tinuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities. The 
Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium -term and long -term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium -term 
funding requirements. At 31 December 2013, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £333.7 million (2012: £348.5 million). Total 
committed facilities had an average maturity of 2.9 years (2012: 3.9 years). 
The total gross contractual undiscounted cash flo ws of financial liabilities, including interest payments, fall due as follows. Cash flows in respect of 
financial guarantee contracts reflect the probability weighted cash flows. The maximum exposure is described in note 24.

Capital risk management 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a credit rating that enables the Group to raise funds at an 
economic interest rate and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value . The Group manages its 
capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust 
the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. 
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio. The target range is less than 2.0 (201 2: less than 2.0) times net debt to EBITDA ratio. The ratio 
at 31 December 2013 was 1.9 (2.0 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers) and at 31 December 2012 was 1.3 (1.5 adjusted to remove profit from 
High Rollers).

Fair value of financial instruments 
Assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss and available for sale financial assets are carried at fair value. The fair value of cash at 
bank and in hand approximates to book va lue due to its short -term maturity. The fair value of the £ 225 million 7.625% bond at 31 December 2013 was 
£252.9 million (2012: £251.9 million) and is classified as a level 1 fair value measurement for disclosure purposes , as the fair value is determined based 
on quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities. The amortised cost of interest bearing loans and borrowings, wi th the exception of the £ 225 
million 7.625% bond, and the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximates to fair value.

Included within other financial assets is the Group’s investment in TBHG, a  financial asset measured at initial fair value of £3.4 million on 28 February 
2013 which was acquired in connection with the business combination with Betdaq. This investment is classified as a level 3 financial instrument as its 
fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data . There have been no changes in the fair 
value of the investment at 31 December 2013 (refer to note 33). 
Included in trade and other payables are £5.9 million of ante-post liabilities (2012: £5.2 million). Other current financial liabilities are deferred revenues 
associated with the fair value of reward points issued; both are classified as level 3 financial instruments as their fair va lue is measured using techniques 
where the significant inpu ts are not based on observable market data. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in the consolidated 
income statement. 
Included within other non -current financial liabilities is contingent consideration associated with business combinations of £53. 6 million (2012: £nil) , 
classified as level 3 financial instruments, as its fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market 
data. The fair values are remeasured at each reporting date and gains and losses from changes therein are recorded in the consolidated income 
statement within exceptional items (note 6). A full description of the valuation techniques, significant inputs and assumptions and the changes in the fair 
value estimates fro m the date of acquisition to 31 December 2013 are disclosed within note 33.  
Also included within other non- current financial liabilities are f inancial guarantee contracts of £5.0 million (2012: £7.7 million) , classified as level 3 financial 
instruments as their fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data. Further i nformation 
about financial guarantee contracts, including sensitivities, and a reconciliation of changes in fair value in the year , is included below. 
The intangible assets recognised on the acquisitions of Playtech, Betdaq, Gaming Investments Pty Ltd and Chronicle Bet were measured at fair value on 
acquisition (as level 3 financial instruments as their fair value is measured using t echniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable 
market data). However, these have not been included in the table above as they are not remeasured at fair value after initial recognition. A description of 
the valuation techniques, significant inputs and assumptions is described in note 33. 
Financial guarantee contracts 
The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed ho tels division. The Group received 
an indemnity f rom Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Group may subsequently i ncur under these 
third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 2017 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combinati on of minimum contractual and 
turnover based elements.  
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all years up to 2042 is £707.6 million (2012: £8 27.9 million), with a 
maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Incl uded in the maximum liability exposure is £449.5 million (2012: £475.5 million) in relation to 
the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £258.1 million (2012: £352.4 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element. The 
maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non -cancellable agreements into which the Group has entered. 
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2013 is £303.9 million (2012: £351.6 million). Included in the n et present value of 
the maximum exposure is £175. 5 million (2012: £182.1 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £128.4 million 
(2012: £169.5 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.  
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligat ions. During the year the 
Group novated its obligations in respect of one of the hotels that has led to the significant reduction i n the gross and discounted liabilities at 31 December 
2013.  
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of 
a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.  
At 31 December 2013 the Group has recognised a financial liability of £5.0 million (2012: £7.7 million) in respect of these g uarantees. In addition to the 
passage of t ime, the liability has reduced in 2013 due to a number of factors. The Group has been released from its obligations for one o f its hotels, the 
liability on which was due to expire in 2033. The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate. A rate of 1.7% has been used at 
31 December 2013 (2012: 2.2%). The default rate has been reduced as the remaining hotels under guarantee are considered to be in prime locations and 
furthermore have not suffered financially through the recent UK and Eu ropean recession. The £2.7million credit arising as a result of these factors has 
been included within the Group’s corporate costs. The table below provides a breakdown of the movement in the liability since 1 January 2013: 
  
Liability

Reduction due to passage of time, change in default rate and year end discount rate  (1.1) 
Reduction due to release from one hotel guarantee  (1.6) 
At 31 December 2013  5.0 
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.3 million. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate 
would reduce the financial liability by £0.3 million.

The Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust (LSOT) is used in connection with the Company ’s Deferred Bonus Plan, the Ladbrokes Growth Plan, the Restricted 
Share Plan, the Performance Share Plan and the 2010 Share Award Plan (together ‘the Plans’) (refer to note 30 for further details of the Plans and the 
various performance conditions). The LSOT may also be used in connection with the Company ’s other share -based plans, including the 1978 Share 
Option Scheme and the International Share Option Scheme. The trustee of the LSOT, Computershare Trustees (CI) Limi ted, subscribes for the Company ’s 
shares or purchases them in the open market, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated commitments of t he Group, with financing 
provided by the Company. 
The Ladbrokes Share Incentive Plan (LSIP) is currently used in connection with the Company ’s OWN share plan ( the OWN plan ) and Freeshare share plan 
(Freeshare) (refer to note 30 for further details). The trustee of the LSIP, Computershare Trustees Limited, purchases the Company ’s shares in the open 
market, as required, using: (i) deductions made from the salaries of participants in the OWN plan; and (ii) dividends paid on the shares held by the LSIP. 
Under the OWN plan, to match those shares acquired using participants ’ salary deductions, one additio nal share is allotted by the Company to the LSIP 
for every two held per employee. 
All expenses of the LSOT and LSIP are settled directly by the Company and charged in the financial statements as incurred.

Defined contribution schemes 
The total cost charged to the consolidated income statement of £2.2 million (2012: £1.4 million) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the 
Group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme. 
Defined benefit pla ns 
The Group’s only significant defined benefit retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension p lan for UK employees. This 
was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007.  
At retirement each member’s pension is related to thei r pensionable service and final pensionable salary. The weighted average duration of the expected 
benefit payments from the Plan is around 16 years.  
The Plan’s assets are held separately from those of the Group. The Plan is approved by HMRC for tax purpos es, and is managed by an independent set of 
Trustees. The Plan is subject to UK regulations, which require the Group and Trustees to agree a funding strategy and contrib ution schedule at least every 
three years. Under the current contribution schedule in p lace, the Group pays contributions to the Plan of 22.2% of p ensionable salary roll in relation to the 
ongoing accrual of benefits plus £0.75 million each year to cover the expenses of running the Plan and £5.3 million each year until 30 April 2019. The next 
review of the funding strategy and contribution schedule is currently underway and will be completed during 2014. There is a risk to the Group that 
adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make additional contributions to recover a ny deficit that arises.  
The initial results of the formal actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2013 were updated to 31 December 2013 by an independent q ualified actuary in 
accordance with IAS 19 (Revised) Employee Benefits. The value of the defined benefit o bligation and current service cost have been measured using the 
projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19 (Revised). Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately through other comprehensive 
income.

The actual return on plan assets over the year was a gain of £ 22.8 million (2012: gain of £ 20.1 million).  
The 2013 figures have been calculated under IAS 19 (Revised). There has been no impact on the disclos ed defined benefit obligation, fair value of assets or 
net assets on moving from the previous version of IAS 19. However, the net charge to the income statement has increased by £ 0.1 million (relative to that 
under the previous version of IAS 19), and the actuarial loss recognised for 2013 has decreased correspondingly by £ 1.0 million.  
The 2012 prior year figures have not been restated under IAS 19 (Revised) as any changes would not be material to the Group.

The Plan assets are held exclusively within instruments with quoted market prices in an active market with the exception of t he holdings in an insurance 
policy. At 31 December 2013 these represented c irca 0.3% of the Plan’s total assets.  
The Plan does not invest directly in property occupied by the Group or in financial securities issued by the Group. Although, as the Plan holds pooled 
investment vehicles, there may at times be indirect employer related investment. At 31 De cember 2013 these represented less than 0.1% of the Plan’s 
total assets. 
The investment strategy is set by the Trustees of the Plan in consultation with the Group. The current long -term strategy is to invest in a matching portfolio 
sufficient to meet the next 15 years of cash flows with the remaining assets invested in return seeking funds.

The post-retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard SAPS mortality table with the CMI 2009 projections, wh ich takes into 
account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience. The assumption used implies that the expected lifetime of members aged 65 in 
2013 is 86.9 years for males and 88. 5 years for females. For members with large pensions a longer lifetime is assumed (90. 2 for males and 90. 5 for 
females).  
Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income s tatement in respect of 
the plan. For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication o f the impact on the defined benefit obligation for the 
year ended 31 December 201 3:

2012

– 0.5% pa decrease in the discount rate   8.3 8.2 
– 0.5% pa increase in price inflation 5.0 4.2 
– One year increase in life expectancy 2.4 2.4 
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market 
conditions at the accounting date. This is unlikely in practi ce, for example, a change in discount rate is unlik ely to occur without any movement in the value 
of the assets held by the Plan. 
30 Share-based payments 
The Company has the following share- based payment plans, all of which are settled by equity: the Restricted Share Plan; the Deferred Bonus Plan; the 
Performance Share Plan; the Ladbrokes Growth Plan; the 2010 Share Award Plan; the International Share Option Scheme; the 1978 Sha re Option 
Scheme; Sharesave; the OWN Plan; and Freeshare. The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed in more detail below : 
(i) Restricted Share Plan 
Awards made under the Restricted Share Plan will vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. 
(ii) Deferred Bonus Plan 
For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest after three years. For other employees, one third of the 
gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest after two years. 
(iii) Performance Share Plan 
An award under the Performance Share Plan consists of a conditional allocation of shares t hat will vest, subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions, at the end of the three year performance period. The awards have two separate performance conditions; half of the award vests based on TSR 
and half of the award vests based on EPS growth. 
(iv) Ladbrokes Growth Plan 
Awards are subject to share price growth performance conditions. Any share price target must be attained throughout a period of 30 consecutive dealing 
days and performance is assessed over a five year period. Up to one third of the a ward may vest at the end of year three if the performance targets have 
been achieved at that time. A further third may vest at the end of year four if the targets have been met at that time. The r emainder of the award may vest 
at the end of year five, subj ect to the achievement of the performance targets. 
(v) 2010 Share Award Plan 
An award under the 2010 Share Award Plan consists of a one -off compensatory share award to the Chief Executive in the form of a nil cost option. 
The award is not subject to performance conditions and is exercisable after three years from grant . 
(vi) International Share Option Scheme and the 1978 Share Option Scheme 
The share options granted are all market value options with a three year vesting period. Vest ed options lapse if they have not been exercised within 
10 years of the date of grant. All options have an EPS growth based performance condition. Options have not been granted since 2009 and there is no 
present intention to grant options in the future. 
(vii) 1983 Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘ Sharesave’) 
Under Sharesave, options are granted at a 20% discount to market value. The scheme operates with a savings period of either t hree or five years, at the 
end of which the option may be exercised. 
(viii) OWN Plan 
Under the OWN Plan, employees can contribute up to £75 per month to acquire shares. For every two shares purchased, the Group provides a match of 
one additional share. 
(ix) Freeshare 
Under Freeshare, an award of up to £ 250 in value was made to participating employees on reaching one year’ s service. Freeshares have not been 
awarded since 2010 and there is no present intention to make awards in the future. 
For a more detailed description of each of the above plans, refer to the Directors ’ remuneration report.

Of the 5,629,931 share options outstanding at 31 December 2013, 2,362,274 (31 December 2012: 2,546,355) are at a price above the year end share price of 178.9 pence 
(31 December 2012: 198.3 pence). The total value of these shares is £7.0 million (2012: £7.8 million). 
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £2.15 (2012: £1.67). The weighted average fair 
value of options granted during the year was 36.0 pence (2012: 36.0 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options 
outstanding at 31 December 2013 is between two and three years (2012: between one and three years). The range of exercise prices for options 
outstanding at the end of the year was £ 1.10 – £3.60 (2012: £1.10 – £3.60). 
At 31 December 2013, there were 3,493,368 options outstanding with an exercise price between £1.10 and £2.00, 884,160 options outstanding with an 
exercise price between £2.01 and £ 3.00, and 1,252,403 options outstanding with an exercise price between £3.01 and £3.60. 
At 31 December 2012, there were 3,864,439 options outstanding with an exercise price between £1.10 and £2.00, 1,023,361 options outstanding with an 
exercise price between £2.01 and £ 3.00, and 1,522,994 options outstanding with an exercise price between £ 3.01 and £3.60.

Expected life (years) 3.68 3.94 
Risk free rate (%) 0.40 0.60

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group ’s share price over the previous three years. The expected life used in 
the model has been adjusted, based on management ’s best estimate, for the effects of non -transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.

31 Commitments and contingencies 
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee 
The Group has a number of lease agreements that, pursuant to their economic substance, qualify as non -cancellable operating lease agreements. 
These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings. The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be summarised as follows: 
Lease terms 
Shop leases are typically agreed on five year exit cycles (either expiry or break), with a maximum term length of 15 years. Some leases are shorter in 
duration or with earlier exits, to reflect our assessment o f risk. 
Determination of rent payments 
Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement. 
Terms of renewal 
The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have been agreed 
upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions wi th the lessor. 
Restrictions 
There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group, concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of t he existing lease arrangements. 
Subleases 
The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.

In September 2012, the UK Government’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced a change to UK legislation with respect to the 
requirement for a UK company to be subject to annual audit. An additional audit exemption has been introduced, such that for a subsidiary of a parent 
established in a European Economic Area state, that subsidiary can be exempt from annual audit if certain conditions are met. The principal co nditions are 
the requirement for the subsidiary ’s shareholders to agree to the exemption and a guarantee to be issued to the subsid iary by the parent undertaking, 
guaranteeing all of the subsidiary’ s outstanding liabilities at the year end, until they are satisfied in full.

33 Business combinations 
Playtech 
On 10 March 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of The Nation’s Traffic Limi ted (TNT). On the same day, the Group signed a five year 
agreement with PT Turnkey Services Limited (Playtech) for the provision of marketing, operational and CRM services (marketing services agreement) to 
the Digital division of the Group, which also incl uded a provision for the acquisition of an experienced and skilled digital marketing team with a track record 
of success with online gaming companies in order to accelerate the growth of Ladbrokes’ online and mobile revenues. On 1 May 2013, TNT was renamed 
Ladbrokes Israel Limited and by this date 40 experienced marketing personnel, the majority from Playtech, had joined Ladbrokes Israel Limited under the 
agreed terms of the acquisition.  
In addition to the business combination described above, the marketing services agreement also provides the use of Playtech p roducts, CRM tools and 
multiple brand approach, designed to drive customer lifetime values which will ultimately accelerate Ladbrok es’ ability to grow online and mobile 
revenues. The consideration for these other services is excluded from the business combination and will be expensed as incurred. The costs associated 
with these arrangements are on an arm’s length basis.

The fair val ue of the total consideration for the business combination at the date of the transaction was £35.3 million, including cash o f £1.3 million and 
contingent consideration based on the growth of Ladbrokes’ Digital EBITDA between 2012 and 2017. The estimated f air value of this contingent 
consideration at 10 March 2013 was £34.0 million. This contingent consideration is payable in April 2018 and April 2019, with advance payments due 
before these dates should performance exceed certain targets. 
The fair value of the contingent consideration has been estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis at the acquisition date.  
The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are a range of EBITDA projections of the Digital business for 2017, which are based on the projections in 
place at the time of the acquisition with an estimated uplift for the benefits of the transaction, the predicted Ladbrokes pl c EBITDA multiple in 2017 (8.25x); 
and the discount rate applied (a range of 12.9% to 16.1%, depending on the year). All of these assumptions have been applied on a probability -weighted 
basis. 
The contingent consideration is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For example, an increase of 10% in EBITDA projecti ons would result in a n 
increase in contingent consideration of £ 11.0 million and a decrease of 2% in the discount rate would result in an increase in contingent consideration of 
£3.0 million. An increase of 1x in the EBITDA multiple would increase the contingent consideration by £3.4 million. 
The Group has performed a n estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination, as follows:

Cash consideration 1.3 
Contingent consideration 34.0 
Total consideration 35.3 
Cash consideration 1.3 
Cash and cash equivalent balances acquired (0.5) 
Net cash flow on acquisition 0.8 
The goodwill of £34.9 million arises from the acquisition of a highly skilled and experienced marketing team which has a prov en track record of success 
in digital marketing, business intelligence and CRM systems, to grow the lifetime values of online custo mers. None of this goodwill is expected to be 
deductible for tax purposes. 
Ladbrokes Israel Limited has been consolidated in the Ladbrokes plc consolidated financial statements from 1 May 2013. Prior to its acquisition and the 
transfer of Playtech employees into the company, the company did not trade and therefore had no revenue or profits.  
Acquisition-related costs of £1.2 million have been charged to exceptional items in the consolidated income statement for the period ended 
31 December 2013. 
The Group r emeasures the contingent consideration at fair value at each balance sheet date. The estimated fair value of the contingent c onsideration at 
31 December 2013 is £28. 9 million, which is classified at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The £5. 1 million reduction in the fair value since the acquisition 
date has been recorded in the income statement within exceptional items.  
Betdaq 
On 28 February 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Global Betting Exchange Alderney Limited (GBEA), a company registered in 
Alderney which operates the Betdaq betting exchange business. This acquisition was for total consideration of €42.8 million ( £36.8 million), comprising 
cash consideration of €15.0 million (£12.9 million), the issue of Ladbrokes plc sha res with a fair value of €18.6 million (£16.0 million) and contingent 
consideration with a fair value of €9.2 million (£7.9 million) at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration given as Ladbrokes plc shares is 
based on the number of shares issued (6,952,405 ordinary shares of 28
1
/3 pence each) and the market value of the shares on the acquisition date, 
28 February 2013.  
The contingent consideration is linked to the performance of the business over a four year period and is capped at €535.0 mil lion. The fair value of the 
contingent consideration has been estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis at the acquisition da te. The key assumptions in estimating the fair 
value are the EBITDA projections of the Betdaq business for 2016, the predicted Ladbrokes plc EBITDA multiple in 2016 (8x) an d the discount rate applied 
(15%). All of these assumptions have been applied on a p robability-weighted basis.  
The contingent consideration is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For example, an increase of 10% in EBITDA projecti ons would result in an 
increase in contingent consideration of £1.7 million and a decrease of 2% in the discount rate would result in an increase in contingent consideration of 
£0.5 million. A decrease in the EBITDA multiple of 2x would result in a decrease in contingent consideration of £2.0 million.

Net cash flow on acquisition 12.8 
The fair value of the brand name has been estimated based on the present value of the after- tax royalty savings attributable to owning the brand over an 
estimated useful life of 10 years. The key assumption in estimating the fair value is a royalty rate of 6%. The customer relationships were valued using the 
income approach method based on a three year average life for the customer base. The key assumptions in estimating the fair v alue are future revenue 
and customer churn. Any reasonable change in these as sumptions would not result in a material change to the fair value. 
The goodwill of £31.5 million, which includes £0.9 million arising as a result of deferred tax on fair value adjustments, ari ses from the acquisition of the 
skilled senior management and em ployees of GBEA, who have significant know -how in the betting exchange sector, as well as the potential to achieve 
synergies by exposing existing customers of the Group to Betdaq and the potential future access to the Betdaq exchange techno logy. None of th is goodwill 
is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
GBEA has been consolidated in the Ladbrokes plc consolidated financial statements from 28 February 2013. Since the date of acquisition, GBEA has 
contributed £9.7 million of revenue and a net loss o f £0.4 million. 
In connection with the acquisition described above, on 28 February 2013 the Group also acquired 10% of the issued share capit al of TBH Guernsey 
Limited (‘TBHG’), a company registered in Guernsey, for cash consideration of €4.0 million (£3.4 million). This company owns the technology behind the 
Betdaq betting exchange business, and licences this technology to GBEA. 
The transaction also gives the Group a call option to acquire the remaining shares after four years and a put option to sell its 10% stake and to recover the 
purchase consideration of €4.0 million in full. The fair value of these options is not considered material. These options are currently not exercisable. The 
Group has accounted for its investment in TBHG as an available for sal e financial asset, initially recognised at fair value of €4.0 million (£3.4 million). There 
have been no changes in the fair value of the investment at 3 1 December 2013.  
Acquisition-related costs of £1.3 million have been charged to exceptional items in the consolidated income statement for the period ended 3 1 December 
2013. 
The Group remeasures the contingent consideration at fair value at each balance sheet date. The estimated fair value of the c ontingent consideration at 
31 December 2013 is £9.5 millio n, which is classified at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The £1.6 million increase in the fair value since the acquisit ion 
date has been recorded in the income statement within exceptional items.  
Gaming Investments Pty Ltd  
On 6 September 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Gaming Investments Pty Ltd (GIPL), a fast growing online sports betting 
business in Australia, under its newly formed Australian arm 'Ladbrokes Australia' . GIPL’s business includes Bookmaker.com.au Pty Ltd, operator of the 
online bookmaker Bookmaker.com.au and Panda Gaming Pty Ltd, operator of an extensive racing and sports focused affiliate network in Australia. 
The fair value of the total consideration for the business combination at the date of the trans action was £28.4 million, including cash of A$2 3.9 million 
(£13.9 million) and contingent consideration based on the EBITDA for Ladbrokes Australia for the year ending 30 June 2016, capped at A$125.0 million 
(£72.7 million). The estimated fair value of thi s contingent consideration at 6 September was $24.9 million (£14.5 million). This contingent consideration is 
payable in 2016.  
A further earn out payment with an estimated fair value of A$17.1 million (£10.0 million) is linked to the continued service of certain key individuals and 
has therefore been excluded from the business combination accounting. This additional earn out payment will be recorded withi n exceptional operating 
expenses in the income statement over the earn out period (6 September 2013 to 30 June 2016).

The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are the EBITDA projections of the Ladbrokes Australia business for 2016, the predicted Ladbrokes plc 
EBITDA multiple in 2016 (8.6x) and the discount rate applied of 17.5%. The contingent consideration is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For 
example, an increase of 10% in EBITDA projections would result in an increase in contingent consideration of A$2.5 million (£ 1.5 million) and a decrease of 
2% in the discount rate would result in an increase in contingent consideration of A$1.2 million (£ 0.7 million). An increase of 1x in the EBITDA multiple 
would increase the contingent consideration by A$4.1 million (£2.4 million). 
The Group has performed a n estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination, as follows: 
 £m 
Net assets acquired:   
Intangible asset – brand name 0.6 
Intangible asset – customer relationships 0.5 
Intangible asset – domain names 1.3 
Intangible asset – software 1.7 
Property, plant and equipment 0.3 
Trade and other receivables 1.3 
Trade and other payables (1.8) 
Cash and cash equivalents 2.7 
Deferred tax liabilities on fair value adjustments (1.2) 
Identifiable net assets 5.4 
Goodwill 23.0 
 28.4 
Satisfied by:  
Cash consideration 13.9 
Contingent consideration 14.5 
Total consideration 28.4 
Cash consideration 13.9 
Cash and cash equivalent balances acquired (2.7) 
Net cash flow on acquisition 11.2 
The fair value of the brand name has been estimated based on the present value of the after- tax royalty savings attributable to owning the brand over an 
estimated useful life of three years. The key assumption in estimating the fair value is a royalty rate of 1 %. The customer relationships and domain names 
were valued using the income approach method based on a one year average life for the customer base and an average life of 10 years for domain 
names. The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are future revenue and customer churn. Any reasonable change in these assu mptions would not 
result in a material change to the fair value. The fair value of software has been estimated bas ed on the depreciated cost to replace approach and is 
expected to have a useful life of five years .  
The goodwill of £ 23.0 million, which includes £ 1.2 million arising as a result of deferred tax on fair value adjustments, arises from the acquisition of the 
skilled senior management and employees of GIPL, who have significant experience and know-how of the bookmaking business in Australia. None of this 
goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
GIPL has been consolidated in the Ladbrokes plc co nsolidated financial statements from 6 September 2013. Since the date of acquisition, GIPL has 
contributed £4.0 million of revenue and £2. 9 million net loss. Had GIPL been included for the period from 1 January 2013, revenue for the full year ended 
31 December would have been £ 11.8 million higher and a loss for the Group would have been £5.9 million higher than disclosed in the income statement.  
Acquisition-related costs of £ 0.3 million have been charged to exceptional items in the consolidated income stat ement for the period ended 31 December 
2013. 
The Group remeasures the contingent consideration at fair value at each balance sheet date. The estimated fair value of the contingent considerati on at 
31 December 2013 is £15.2 million, which is classified at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The £0.7 million increase in the fair value since the acquisition 
date has been recorded in the income statement within exceptional items .

The Group has performed a n estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination, as follows:

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in 
relation to the consolidated financial statements 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the directors consider 
the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, as fair, balanced 
and understandable and that it provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the di rectors have elected to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
Company law the directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they ar e satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
●
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
●
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
●
state whether the applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained by the f inancial statements; 
●
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to sh ow and explain the Company ’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 200 6 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in pages 30 
and 31 of this Annual Report, confirm that, to the best of each person ’s 
knowledge and belief: 
●
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group; and  
●
the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report contained in the Annual 
Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Group, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of 
Ladbrokes plc on the consolidated financial statements 
 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Ladbrokes plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 
1 to 33. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as ado pted by the European Union.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.   
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor  
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set 
out on page 98, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (U K and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumst ances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non- financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge ac quired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.  
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
●
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
●
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union; and  
●
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement  
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest effect on the 
overall audit strategy; the allocation of resourc es in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team:  
●
The accounting for business combinations, including the new 
agreements with Playtech and the acquisitions of Betdaq and 
Ladbrokes Australia; 
●
The accounting for the Group’s uncertain tax po sitions and the 
recognition and disclosure of deferred tax; 
●
The impairment review of the Group’s goodwill, intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment; and 
●
The risk of fraud in revenue recognition and from management override 
of financial controls. 
Our application of materiality  
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our 
audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit and on the 
financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement we define 
materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that 
the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on 
the financial statements, would be changed or influe nced. 
We also determine a level of performance materiality which we use to 
determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude 
of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material for the 
financial statements as a whole. We determined planning materiality for 
the Group to be £ 6.0 million (2012: £9.0 million) , which is approximately 5% 
(2012: 5%) of profit before tax and exceptional items, and below 2% (2012: 
2%) of equity. We used profit before tax and exceptional items to exclude 
the impact of exceptional items wh ich do not reflect the underlying 
performance of the Group. This provided a basis for determining the 
nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and 
assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, 
timing and extent of further audit procedures. 
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the 
Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that overall 
performance materiality for the Group should be 50% (2012: 50%) of 
planning materiality, namely £3. 0 million (2012: £4.5 million) . Our objec tive 
in adopting this approach wa s to ensure that total detected and undetected 
audit differences did not exceed our planning materiality of £ 6.0 million for 
the financial statements as a whole.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all adjusted and unadjusted audit differences in excess of 
£0.3 million (2012: £0.45 million) that relate d to our specific testing of the 
various balances. We also agreed to report differences below those 
thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
An overview of the scope of our audit  
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to the 
Group financial statements, we selected four components which represent 
the principal business units within the Group’s five reportable segments 
and account for 86% (2012: 87%) of the Group’s revenue, 77% (2012: 91%) 
of the Group’s profit before tax and 9 5% (2012: 90%) of the Group’s total 
assets. Three of these components were subject to a full audit, whilst the 
remaining one was subject to a specific scope audit where the extent of 
audit work was based on our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s business operations at 
that location. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. For the remaining components, we performed other 
procedures to confirm there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement in the Group financial statements. 
The audit work at the four locations and the statutory audits were executed 
at levels of materiality applicable to each in dividual entity which were much 
lower than Group materiality. All audit work at the four locations was 
performed by the Group audit team, including at the Group’s locations in 
Gibraltar and Ireland. 
Our response to the risks identified above was as follows : 
●
In respect of the accounting for business combinations, we read the sale 
and purchase agreements and other relevant documentation to 
understand the substance of each transaction, met with management’s 
external valuation experts to understand the valuatio n approach and 
challenged whether the accounting and disclosure was in line with the 
accounting requirements. 
  
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 99 100 
Independent auditor’s report to the members of 
Ladbrokes plc on the consolidated financial statements 
continued 
 
In particular, we challenged the inputs and assumptions to the fair 
value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including 
separately identified intangible assets, as well as the contingent 
consideration at the acquisition date and subsequently at 
31 December 2013. 
●
In respect of the accounting for the Group’s unce rtain tax positions and 
the recognition and disclosure of deferred tax, with support from our 
relevant tax specialists we understood and challenged the legal basis for 
each uncertain tax position to assess whether the Group’s accounting 
position was appropriate. We also reviewed the Group’s correspondence 
with the relevant tax authorities on each position to corroborate the 
accounting positions. 
We also reviewed and challenged the inputs and assumptions used by 
the Group in the recognition and disclosure of deferred tax assets, 
particularly in respect of carried forward losses. 
●
In respect of the impairment review of the Group’s goodwill, intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment, our audit work focused on the 
key inputs and assumptions to the value in use calculations. These 
included a challenge of the historical accuracy of management’s 
forecasts and corroboration of the discount rate and long -term growth 
rate, as well as applying a sensitivity  analysis to assess the impact of 
changes in these key assumptions. 
●
We carried out testing relating to controls over revenue recognition for 
each of the Group’s principal revenue streams, being UK Retail, Digital 
and High Rollers. We also performed substantive testing and analytical 
procedures to validate tha t the revenue recognition procedures adopted 
complied with IFRS. 
●
We performed analytical procedures and journal entry testing in order to 
identify and test the risk of fraud arising from management override of 
controls, which focused on the risks disclosed above. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the Annual Re port and Accounts is: 
●
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or 
●
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or 
●
is otherwise mislea ding.  
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report and Accounts is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to 
the Audit Committee which we consi der should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion:  
●
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or  
●
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
●
the directors’ statement, set out on page 39, in relation to going concern; 
and  
●
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.  
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements 
of Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

Notes to the Company 
financial statements 
 
 
1 Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention except as otherwise stated. They have been drawn up to 
comply with applicable UK accounting standards. The parent Company 
loss for the year was £745.0 million (2012: profit of £562.1 million). 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a 
cash flow statement under the provisions of FRS 1 (revised 1996) Cash 
flow statements. The Ladbrokes plc consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 20 13 contain a consolidated statement of 
cash flows. 
2 Change in accounting policies 
The Financial Reporting Council issued changes to the UK financial 
reporting framework, which will result in companies reporting either under 
the principles of EU -adopted IFRSs or a new set of UK financial reporting 
standards. In certain cases companies will be able to report reduced 
disclosures. 
This new financial reporting framework is effective for the year ending 
31 December 2015, and is required to be applied retrospecti vely. The 
Company has taken the decision not to adopt the new requirements for 
the year ended 31 December 2013. 
3 Summary of significant accounting policies  
Investments  
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for 
impairment. 
The Company assesses these investments for impairment wherever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an 
investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment 
exists, the Company makes an estimate of the reco verable amount. If the 
recoverable amount is less than the value of the investment, the 
investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
profit and loss account. 
An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the Company 
has control over its operating and financial policies. 
An undertaking is regarded as an associate if the Company holds a 
participating interest and has significant influence, but not contro l, over its 
operating and financial policies. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to the 
contracts that give rise to them. 
The Company classifies financial assets at inception as either financial 
assets at fair v alue or loans and receivables. On initial recognition, loans 
and receivables are measured at fair value. Financial assets at fair value 
comprise guarantees provided to the Company. Financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss are measured initially at fair value, with 
transaction costs taken directly to the profit and loss account. 
Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured and gains and losses from 
changes therein are recognised in the profit and loss account. 
Financial guarantees provided to th e Company are classified as financial 
assets and are measured at fair value by estimating the probability of the 
guarantees being called upon and the related cash inflows to the Company. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities comprise guarantees given to third parties and 
contingent consideration. On initial recognition, financial liabilities are 
measured at fair value plus transaction costs where they are not 
categorised as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured initially 
at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly to the profit and loss 
account. Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured and gains and 
losses from changes therein are recognised in th e profit and loss account. 
Financial guarantee contracts 
The Company has provided financial guarantees to third parties in respect 
of lease obligations of certain of the Company’s former subsidiaries within 
the disposed hotels division. 
Financial guarantee contracts are classified as financial liabilities and are 
measured at fair value by estimating the probability of the guarantees 
being called upon and the related cash outflows from the Company. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities  
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows 
from the assets has expired or when the Company has transferred its 
contractual right to receive the cash flows from the financial assets or 
has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash fl ows in full without 
material delay to a third party, and either: 
●
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or 
●
substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been retained nor 
transferred but control is not retained. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, 
cancelled or expires. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or liability, at appropriate rates, in 
respect of transactions and events recognised in the financial statem ents 
of the current and previous periods that give the entity a right to pay less, 
or an obligation to pay more, tax in future periods. Deferred tax assets are 
only recognised to the extent it is probable that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which they can be recovered. 
No provision is made for any taxation on capital gains that would arise 
from the future disposal of any fixed assets shown in the financial 
statements at valuation, except to the extent that at the balance sheet 
date there is a b inding sale agreement. 
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.  
Foreign currency translation 
The presentation and functional currency of the Company and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries, is P ounds Sterling (£). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in pounds 
sterling (£) at the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated into Pounds Sterling (£) at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date (the closing rate). 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the profit and loss 
account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings 
that provide a post- tax hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. 
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at 
which time they are recognised in the profit and loss account. Tax charges 
and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are 
also dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
initial transaction. Non -monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair 
value was determined. 
Pensions 
The Company is the principal employer of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, a 
funded defined benefit group plan. The pension cost relating to th e plan is 
assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries 
using the projected unit credit method. 
Any actuarial gains or losses are taken to equity in the period in which they 
arise. Any past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that 
benefits have already vested and, otherwise, are amortised on a straight 
line basis over the average period until the benefits vest.

3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the 
fair value of plan assets less the present value of defined benefit 
obligations as adjusted for any unrecognised past service costs. If 
necessary, the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the amount that can 
be recovered through reduced Company contributions in the future plus 
any refunds that have been agreed at the balance sheet date. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds 
received net of direct issue costs. 
Share-based payments 
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by 
reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair 
value is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are 
given in note 30 of the consolidated IFRSs financial statements. In valuing 
equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance 
conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 
Ladbrokes plc (market conditions). 
The cost of equity settled tr ansactions is recognised, together with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award (vesting date). The cumulat ive expense 
recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company 
at that date, bas ed on the best available estimate of the number of equity 
instruments, will ultimately vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are 
treated as vesti ng irrespective of whether or not the market condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. 
ESOP trusts 
Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an ESOP trust 
these shares are shown as a reduction in equi ty. Any consideration paid or 
received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in the 
reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and no gain or loss is 
recognised within the profit and loss account or the statement of total 
recognised gains and losses on the purchase, sale or cancellation of these 
shares. 
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or canc ellation of the Company’s own equity 
instruments. 
4 Profit and loss account disclosures 
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss

Financial guarantee contracts 
The Company has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. The Company 
received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Company may subsequently incur 
under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 2017 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combinat ion of minimum 
contractual and turnover based elements.  
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all years up to 2042 is £707.6 million (2012: £827.9 million), with a 
maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is £449.5 million (2012: £475.5 m illion) in relation 
to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £258.1 million (2012: £352.4 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element. 
The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non -cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered. 
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2013 is £303.9 million (2012: £351.6 million). Included in the n et present value of 
the maximum exposure is £175.5 million (2012: £182.1 million) i n relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £128.4 million 
(2012: £169.5 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.  
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appr opriate, to novate its obligations. During the year 
the Company novated its obligations in respect of one of the hotels that has led to the significant reduction in the gross and discounted liabilities at 
31 December 2013.  
The financial guarantees liabili ty has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of 
a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.  
At 31 December 2013 the Company has recognised a financial liability of £5.0 million (2012: £7.7 million) in respect of these gua rantees. In addition to the 
passage of time, the liability has reduced in 2013 due to a number of factors. The Company has been rel eased from its obligations for one of its hotels, the 
liability on which was due to expire in 2033. The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate. A rate of 1.7% has been used at 
31 December 2013 (2012: 2.2%). The default rate has been reduced as the remaining hotels under guarantee are considered to be in prime locations and 
furthermore have not suffered financially through the recent UK and European recession. The £2.7 million credit arising as a result of these factors has 
been i ncluded within the Company’s operating costs. The table below provides a breakdown of the movement in the liability since 1 January 2013:

Reduction due to passage of time, change in default rate and year end discount rate  (1.1) 
Reduction due to release from one hotel guarantee  (1.6) 
At 31 December 2013  5.0 
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.3 million. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate 
would reduce the financial liability by £0.3 million.

15 Pensions 
The Company’s only significant defined benefit pension plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan. This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007. 
The latest available formal actu arial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 June 2010. A valuation is being carried out with an 
effective date of 30 June 2013, but this has not yet been completed.  
The initial results of the 30 June 2013 actuarial valuation w ere updated to 31 December 2013 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with 
FRS17. The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method. 
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 as sumptions used for the Plan. The table also sets out as at 31 December 2013, the fair value of assets, a 
breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the surplus (or deficit) of assets compared to the FR S17 
liabilities, the related deferred tax liability (or asset) and the net pension asset (or liability).

The pension asset recognised on the Company balance sheet has been restricted under FRS 17. The asset has been restricted to the present value of the 
liability expected to arise from future service, being the amount that could be expec ted to be recovered from reduced contributions to the plan. The net 
pension asset for the Company is lower than the net pension asset for the Group . This is as a result of technical differences between IAS 19 and FRS 17 
regarding the size of an asset that can be recognised on the balance sheet. 
The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the expected rates of return on each of the major ass et classes invested in, 
weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes at the bala nce sheet date, using the figures shown above. The sources used to determine the 
expected rates of returns include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and ana lysts’ or the Government’s 
expectations. 
The contributions made by the employers in 2013, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were £9.5 million (2012: £10.1 million). 
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 22.2% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional £441,667 per month to remove the shortfall in 
funding identified at 30 June 2010 and £ 62,500 per month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan. These lead to an expected contribution 
of £9.2 million in 2014. As the plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method use d to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the 
service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase over time as the average age of the members hip increases.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in 
relation to the Company financial statements 
  
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the directors consider 
the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, as fair , balanced and 
understandable and that it provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Unde r that law the directors have elected to prepare 
the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are require d to: 
●
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
●
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
●
state whether the applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained by 
the financial statements; 
●
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounti ng records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of  
Ladbrokes plc on the Company financial statements 
  
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Ladbrokes 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the Company 
Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 17. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparatio n is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audi t 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor  
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ respons ibilities set 
out on page 111, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the parent Com pany financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financi al statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. Th is includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; a nd the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non- financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any i nformation that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the i mplications 
for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements: 
●
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2013; 
●
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
●
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
●
the part of the Directors’ remunerat ion report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
●
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent Company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
●
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
●
the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
●
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
●
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 2013.

Unsolicited calls 
The Company is aware of shareholders receiving unsolicited calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. Calls are typically from 
people stating the y are “brokers” based overseas and they offer to “buy” 
the individual’s shares at inflated prices claiming that there is a “secret” 
takeover or merger. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any 
unsolicited advice, offers to sell or buy their shares o r offers of free 
company reports. Operations to buy shares at inflated prices or to sell what 
often turn out to be worthless, high risk or even non -existent shares are 
commonly known as “boiler room” scams. 
More detailed information on boiler room scams is available at 
www.ladbrokesplc.com. If you think you have been contacted by share 
fraudsters, you can report the matter to the F CA by calling 0800 111 6768 
or by completing the online form available at www. fca.gov.uk.

Overview
Accoya
	
is	the	world’s	leading	high	technology	long	life	
wood	(www.accoya.com).	Created	via	acetylated	wood	
modification,	a	highly	sustainable	process	which	also	
uses	sustainably	grown	timber,	the	Accoya
	
process	
creates	a	modified	wood	that	matches	or	exceeds	the	
durability,	stability	and	beauty	of	the	very	best	tropical	
hardwoods	and	other	man-made	materials.
Applications
Accoya
	
wood	is	ideal	for	windows,	external	doors,	
cladding/siding,	decking,	structural	and	civil	engineering	
projects	due	to	world	class	dimensional	stability	and

Chairman’s 
Statement
This	year	has	seen	a	significant	step	forward	for	the	Group	as	EBITDA	turned	
positive	and	we	announced	two	significant	developments	towards	fully	
exploiting	our	technology	for	both	Accoya
®	
and	Tricoya
®
.	We	have	worked	
closely	with	Solvay	in	establishing	new	arrangements	which	will	allow	us	to	
double	the	Accoya
	
capacity	in	Arnhem,	the	first	phase	of	which	will	be	on	
stream	in	2017.	In	addition	we	announced	in	February,	BP’s	participation	as	
the	proposed	consortium	partner	to	join	with	Medite	and	Accsys	to	fund,	build	
and	operate	the	world’s	first	Tricoya
	
wood	elements	acetylation	plant.	These	
developments	have	been	achieved	as	a	result	of	the	dedication	and	commitment	
of	all	of	our	employees	who	believe	passionately	in	the	value	of	our	technology.	I	
believe	the	Company	is	today	in	a	strong	position	and	on	the	cusp	of	something	
truly	exciting	and	rewarding	for	all	stakeholders.
Financial Summary 
Total	revenue	for	the	year	ended		
31	March	2016	increased	by	15%		
to	¤52.8m	(2015:	¤46.1m).	Within		
this	total,	Accoya
	
wood	revenue	
increased	by	7%	to	¤43.5m	(2015:	
¤40.7m)	largely	as	a	result	of	pricing,	
while	licence	income	increased		
from	¤0.4m	to	¤2.8m	reflecting		
the	new	arrangements	with	our		
Accoya
	
licensee	Solvay.
Gross	profit	margin	improved	from	
27%	to	34%	due	to	the	higher	licence	
income,	increased	Accoya
	
prices	and	
continued	operating	efficiencies.	Other	
operating	costs	(excluding	exceptional	
items)	increased	by	15%	to	¤18.5m	
(2015:	¤16.0m)	due	to	the	inclusion	of	
¤1.6m	of	costs	relating	to	the	Tricoya
	
business	which	was	equity	accounted	
in	the	previous	year,	together	with	an	
increase	in	staff	costs	resulting	from	
increased	activity	levels.
The	above	improvements	resulted	in	
a	¤4.8m	increase	in	underlying	Group	
EBITDA	to	¤2.4m	(2015:	EBITDA	loss	
of	¤2.4m).	This	is	the	first	time	we	
have	been	EBITDA	positive	since	our	
restructuring	in	2010	and	2011.
Accoya
	
sales	volumes	increased	by 	
1%	as	a	result	of	our	pricing	strategy 	
which	enabled	us	to	manage	supply 	
and	demand	ahead	of	additional 	
manufacturing	capacity	becoming	
available	at	Arnhem,	expected	in 	
calendar	year	2017.	This	increase	will 	
initially	add	50%	to	our	production 	
capacity,	to	be	followed	by	a	fourth 	
reactor	adding	another	50%	as 	
demand	requires.	The	improved 	
pricing	implemented	in	the	second 	
half	of	the	previous	financial	year 	
were	complemented	by	operating 	
efficiencies	and	together	resulted	in	a 	
20%	improvement	in	the	manufacturing 	
facility	EBITDA,	an	increase	from	¤6.9m 	
to	¤8.3m.	
The	cash	balance	of	¤8.2m	at	
31	March	2016	(2015:	¤10.8m)	reflects	
an	improvement	in	the	underlying	
operating	cash	flow,	which	improved	
by	22%	to	¤3.5m	cash	inflow	from	
operating	activities	before	changes	in 	
working	capital.	We	have	also	invested 	
¤4.1m	principally	for	engineering	
work	for	the	Arnhem	expansion	and	
proposed	Tricoya
	
plant	in	Hull,	together	
with	maintenance	and	improvements	
to	the	existing	Arnhem	plant.
Operational progress
The	health	and	safety	of	our	staff	
is	our	priority	and	we	continue	to	
seek	improvements	to	ensure	we	do	
everything	we	can	to	exceed	industry	
expectations	by	challenging	our	
methods,	improving	our	reporting		
and	continuing	to	learn.
Accoya
	
wood	sales	volumes	remained	
relatively	flat	for	the	year	(33,847m
3
),	
following	price	increases	last	year	
which	we	implemented	to	improve	
profitability	and	to	help	manage	our	
capacity	utilisation,	with	the	result	that	
some	of	our	distributors,	in	particular	
in	North	America	managed	their	
inventory	levels.	
Demand	for	Accoya
	
continues	to	be	
strong	and	we	continue	to	believe	the	
long-term	market	opportunity	remains	
substantial,	with	in	excess	of	1	million	
m
3
	of	Accoya
	
sales	per	annum	being	
achievable	in	the	long-term.	In	light	of	
recent	improvements	to	our	existing	
Accoya
	
plant	we	would	expect	an	
increase	in	sales	volumes	in	the	new	
financial	year,	although	recognising	our 	
€2.4m
EBITDA; an increase  
from -€2.4m 07
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
short-term	manufacturing	capacity	is	
limited	to	approximately	40,000m
3
.	
In	November	2015	we	agreed	a 	
number	of	important	changes	to	our 	
relationship	with	our	Accoya
	
licensee,	
Solvay.	These	will	enable	us	to	double 	
the	capacity	of	our	manufacturing 	
plant	in	Arnhem	in	stages,	with	a 	
first	new	reactor	adding	50%	extra 	
capacity,	expected	to	be	operational 	
in	calendar	year	2017.	Solvay	remains 	
committed	to	Accoya
	
under	a	revised	
licence	agreement,	and	has	taken 	
over	responsibility	for	Accoya
	
sales	
and	marketing	in	a	revised	region 	
covering	most	of	central	Europe	and 	
Scandinavia,	committing	to	purchase	a	
minimum	of	76,000m
3
	over	five	years. 	
The	agreement	provides	a	platform 	
to	help	underpin	the	expansion	of 	
Arnhem	through	a	combination	of 		
fees	and	a	loan.
In	February	2016	we	were	very		
pleased	to	announce	BP’s	participation 	
in	the	proposed	consortium	to	fund,	
build	and	operate	the	world’s	first	
Tricoya
	
wood	elements	acetylation	
plant.	BP	Ventures	acquired	an	initial	
3%	equity	interest	in	our	Tricoya
	
business,	implying	a	valuation	of	
¤35m.	The	investment	was	a	first	step	
in	the	formation	of	a	consortium	led	
by	Accsys	and	with	BP	and	Medite,	
expected	to	result	in	the	creation	of	
a	new	operating	business	in	which	
Accsys	will	retain	a	substantial	
shareholding.	Considerable	progress	
has	been	made	by	the	parties	and	we	
look	forward	to	the	full	consortium	
being	finalised	later	in	2016	with	
additional	funding	necessary	to	build	
the	plant	in	Hull,	UK.
The	Tricoya
	
plant	is	expected	to	have	
an	initial	capacity	of	30,000	metric	
tonnes	of	acetylated	Tricoya
	
chips	per	
annum,	equivalent	to	approximately	
40,000m
3
	of	panel	products.	The	
acetylated	chips	will	be	used	as	
feedstock	for	the	production	of	high	
performance	MDF	or	particle	board	
panels	in	a	market	estimated	to	be	
approximately	200	million	m
3
	annually.	
It	is	proposed	that	the	plant	in	Hull	
will	be	built	in	such	a	way	that	further	
capacity	can	be	added	to	the	site	as	
demand	grows.
Outlook
The	agreements	with	Solvay	will	allow 	
Accsys	to	expand	our	manufacturing 	
capability	leading	to	higher	Accoya
	
volumes	and	higher	manufacturing 	
EBITDA	in	the	medium-term.	This 	
increased	capacity	will	also	provide 	
greater	flexibility	in	order	to	target 		
new	markets	as	we	continue	to 		
develop	demand	for	Accoya
	
globally		
as	well	as	provide	material	for 	
production	of	Medite	Tricoya, 		
ahead	of	the	new	Tricoya
	
plant	in		
Hull	becoming	operational.
The	progress	we	have	been	able	
to	make	in	respect	of	Tricoya
	
is	
particularly	exciting;	with	the	proposed	
consortium	providing	the	basis	for		
the	first	step	in	exploiting	a	market	
which	we	believe	is	in	excess	of	1.6	
million	m
3
	per	annum.	Accsys	will	
benefit	from	both	the	expected	
substantial	manufacturing	profits		
and	licensing	revenues.	
The	new	financial	year	has	started 	
with	demand	for	Accoya
	
continuing	
to	support	the	expansion	of	our 	
manufacturing	facilities	as	soon 		
as	we	can.	
I	believe	the	progress	we	have	made 	
over	the	last	two	years	has	put	the 	
Company	in	a	more	financially	stable 	
position	than	ever	before	and	I	am 	
confident	that	we	will	be	able	to	build 	
upon	this	in	order	to	achieve	our	goals 	
of	increasing	total	manufacturing 	
capacity	over	the	next	two	to 	
three	years.

Our technology
Accoya
®	
is	based	upon	acetylated	wood	
technology,	a	process	that	has	been	studied		
by	scientists	around	the	world	for	more	than		
80	years.
The	physical	properties	of	any	material	are 	
determined	by	its	chemical	structure.	Wood 	
contains	an	abundance	of	chemical	groups 	
called	“free	hydroxyls”	(-OH).	Free	hydroxyl 	
groups	absorb	and	release	water	according	to 	
changes	in	the	climatic	conditions	to	which	the 	
wood	is	exposed.	This	is	the	main	reason	why 	
wood	swells	and	shrinks.	It	is	also	believed	that 	
the	digestion	of	wood	by	enzymes	initiates	at	the 	
free	hydroxyl	sites	–	which	is	one	of	the	principal 	
reasons	why	wood	is	prone	to	decay. 	
Acetylation	effectively	changes	the	free	
hydroxyls	within	the	wood	into	acetyl	groups,	
which	already	naturally	exist	in	wood	at	lower	
levels.	This	is	done	by	reacting	the	wood	with	
acetic	anhydride,	which	comes	from	acetic	
acid	(known	as	vinegar	when	in	its	dilute	form).	
The superior qualities that our technology brings are driving customers to choose  
our materials over established wood products giving enormous scope to increase  
our penetration of this vast global market.
Our Market
When	the	free	hydroxyl	group	is	transformed	to	an	acetyl	
group,	boosting	the	acetyl	level,	the	ability	of	the	wood	to	
absorb	water	is	greatly	reduced,	rendering	the	wood	more	
dimensionally	stable	and,	because	it	is	no	longer	digestible,	
extremely	durable. 09

	of	Accoya,	however	the	total	global	solid	wood	market	is	understood	to	exceed		
400	million	m
3
	annually	and	we	believe	sales	in	excess	of	1	million	m
3
	annually	are	ultimately	achievable.	While	it	may	
take	some	time	for	Accoya
	
to	reach	its	full	market	potential,	we	are	confident	that	continued	strong	sales	growth	can	
be	generated.	The	majority	of	our	Accoya
	
sales	is	to	a	network	of	timber	distributors	which	in	turn	supply	a	variety	of	
industries,	principally	for	joinery	(windows	and	doors)	and	for	decking	and	cladding.	As	we	expand,	we	expect	that	
new	opportunities	will	also	be	developed	as	we	become	able	to	meet	the	demands	of	larger	scale	manufacturers	and	
also	as	we	continue	to	develop	our	product	and	its	applications.
Tricoya
	
panels’	enhanced	performance	and	moisture	resistance	makes	them	particularly	suited	to	external	
applications	including	façades	and	cladding,	soffits	and	eaves,	exterior	joinery,	wet	interiors,	door	skins,	flooring,	
signage	and	marine	uses.	Tricoya
	
displaces	alternative	more	expensive	or	less	easily	handled	products	and	opens	up	
major	new	market	opportunities	in	the	construction	sector.	
The	global	market	for	Tricoya
	
panel	products	is	estimated	in	excess	of	1.6	million	m
3
	and	up	to	approximately		
4.5	million	m
3
	per	annum.	This	would	occupy	around	1%	of	global	MDF	manufacturing	capacity.	Tricoya
	
panels		
were	introduced	to	the	market	by	Medite	in	2012,	manufactured	using	chipped	Accoya.	Sales	have	roughly	doubled	
each	year	since,	and	total	panel	sales	to	date	exceed	12,500m
3
	/	1,000,000m
2
,	representing	a	sales	value	of	
approximately	¤18m.
CASE STUDY
Windows, private  
residence – Germany
Accoya
®	
wood	has	recently	been	specified	by	
Architekturo	Siemonsen	for	windows	at	private	
residence	in	Hamburg,	Germany.
Fitted	by	Reinhard	Adling,	Accoya
	
was	chosen	
because	of	its	stability	and	durability	properties	
compared	to	other	woods.
Accoya
	
wood	is	the	perfect	substrate	for	
windows	and	doors	as	its	naturally	insulating	
and	is	so	stable	that	the	coatings	last	longer.	
Now	Accoya	is
	
approximately
	
10%	of	the	UK	
joinery	market	and	it	is	encouraging	to	see	that	
consumers	and	architects	are	specifying	Accoya
	
through	the	joinery	market. 10
Our key strengths Sustainability
Our	products	are	the	most	
environmentally	friendly	
building	solutions	over	
their	full	life	cycle,	made	
from	abundantly	available,	
fast	growing,	sustainably	
sourced,	renewable	
resources,	yet	with	
durability	and	dimensional	
stability	exceeding	the	
best	performing	tropical	
hardwoods.	They	are	natural	
building	materials	with	low	
maintenance	and	consistent	
qualities	of	the	highest	
performing	non-sustainable	
man-made	materials;	
while	benefiting	from	all	
positive	attributes	of	wood	
(sustainability,	strength,	
beauty)	without	the	
downfalls	(poor	durability		
&	stability).
Our Business  
Model
We	leverage	our	unique	
capabilities	to	create	value	
for	our	stakeholders	from	
our	proprietary	platform	
technology,	enabling	a	
cycle	of	reinvestment.	
Sustainability	is	at	the	
heart	of	everything	we	do.
Our people
Our	focus	on	R&D, 	
innovation	and	fulfilling 	
the	full	potential	
of	our	products	
and	technologies	is	
dependent	on	our	
employees.	A	significant	
amount	of	value	is 	
generated	from	know-
how;	from	working	
with	wood	products,	
understanding	our	
brand	on	a	global 	
basis,	to	optimising	the 	
acetylation	process.	
Therefore	we	have	
focussed	on	developing,	
motivating	and	retaining	
a	committed	team	with 	
the	necessary	skills	
and	experience	to	help 	
the	Group	meet	its 	
objectives.
Intellectual property,  
expertise and  
innovation
Accsys	has	developed	
a	number	of	families	of 	
registered	and	pending	
patents	relating	to	our 	
products	and	processes	
which	provide	robust	
protection	and	enable	us 	
to	market	our	products 	
and	processes	to	third 	
parties.	Equally	important	
is	extensive	know-
how	and	trade	secrets 	
covering	our	process,	raw 	
materials,	equipment	and	
products	which	provide	
commercial	protection,	
the	ability	to	generate 	
value	from	third	parties 	
and	a	basis	for	on-going 	
innovation.
Business partners 
Development	of	third	
party	relationships	is	
important	at	every	level 	
of	the	business.	Particular 	
importance	is	placed	
upon	those	which	help 	
develop	our	technology,	
products	and	their	place 	
in	the	market	including 	
equipment	manufacturers,	
wood	suppliers,	the	
acetyls	industry,	testing	
and	certification	bodies 	
as	well	as	wood	coating, 	
adhesives	and	other	
system	supply	specialists.	
Our	product	development	
team	seeks	to	co-develop 	
new	applications	directly	
with	other	companies.	In 	
addition,	we	will	continue 	
to	work	with	others	to 	
ensure	we	develop	larger 	
scale	manufacturing	
capacity.
Branding
Strong	branding	and	
trade	mark	protection	is 	
vital	and	has	enabled	our 	
products	to	generate	a 	
significant	presence	in	
a	relatively	short	time 	
in	what	is	otherwise 	
a	fragmented	market	
place.	We	portray	
that	our	products	are 	
revolutionary,	class	
leading	and	sustainable	
while	offering	value	for 	
money	when	considering	
performance	benefits	
and	the	product	lifecycle.
Intellectual property,

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our technology
Our	commitment	to	
R&D	and	innovation	
is	based	on	the	belief 	
that	wood	acetylation	
is	applicable	to	multiple 	
wood	products	and	
species	and	that	we	have 	
established	a	platform	
technology	that	can	be 	
developed	to	generate	
additional	products	
and	uses.	For	example, 	
different	species	of	
wood	will	enable	Accoya
	
to	be	used	for	even	more 	
purposes	while	opening	
up	greater	supply	chain 	
opportunities.	Our	
Tricoya
	
process,	which	is	
initially	expected	to	be 	
used	by	manufacturers	
of	MDF	boards,	also 	
has	the	potential	to	be 	
used	for	particle	board 	
manufacture.
Manufacturing
The	plant	generates	a 	
substantial	profit	on	a 	
standalone	basis	being	
break	even	at	only 	
approximately	50%	of	
its	current	capacity.	The 	
returns	will	be	further 	
improved	as	capacity	is 	
improved	and	expanded.	
In	addition	it	is	a 	
centre	for	carrying	out 	
commercial	level	R&D	
and	a	tool	for	evaluating 	
further	improvements	to	
our	processes.
Working with third parties
Manufacturing	our	
products	provides	the	
greatest	opportunity	for	
generating	profit	given	
the	value	that	is	added 	
via	our	process,	and 	
manufacturing	directly	
ourselves,	offers	significant 	
long-term	rewards.	
However,	we	have	and 	
will	continue	to	work	with 	
appropriate	third	parties	
in	order	to	help	us	achieve 	
our	long-term	objective	of 	
expanding	the	production	
footprint	globally	and	
in	particular	where	such 	
parties	have	resources	
or	technologies	which	
complement	our	own.
Our	ambition	to	retain 	
a	direct	interest	in 	
manufacturing	is	
characterised	by	our	
relationship	with	our	
licensee	Solvay	in	
Europe	and	in	respect 	
of	Tricoya,	where	our 	
proposed	consortium	
builds	upon	a	broader 	
level	of	experience	and 	
capabilities	in	the	acetyls 	
and	panel	industries.	
Working with  
third parties
Working	with	third		
parties	provides	the	
greatest	prospect	for	
taking	advantage	of		
a	substantial	global	
market	opportunity.
Manufacturing
Accsys’s	manufacturing	
plant	in	Arnhem	was 	
built	as	a	proof	of 	
concept	facility	and	has 	
since	been	improved	
and	capacity	increased	
through	constant	process	
improvements.	It	has	
demonstrated	that	our	
acetylation	process	
works	on	an	industrial 	
scale	and	confirmed	the 	
commercial	viability	of	
Accoya
	
and	Tricoya.
Outcome
Increasing	
revenue	and	
returns	enable	
continued	
investment	in	
R&D,	people	and	
partnerships	in	
order	to	take	
advantage	of	
the	substantial	
opportunity	
which	we	
believe	exists.

Chief 
Executive’s 
Report
A steady year for Accoya
 
sales
Total	revenue	for	the	year	ended	31	March	2016	increased	by	15%	to	¤52.8m	
(2015:	¤46.1m).	Within	this	total,	Accoya
	
wood	revenue	increased	by	7%	to	
¤43.5m	(2015:	¤40.7m)	largely	as	a	result	of	pricing,	while	licence	income	
increased	from	¤0.4m	to	¤2.8m	reflecting	the	enhanced	relationship	with		
our	Accoya
®	
licensee	Solvay.
Underlying	demand	for	Accoya
	
remains	
strong	and	I	am	pleased	to	report 	
that	Accoya
	
continues	to	gain	ever 	
greater	recognition	and	acceptance 	
in	the	market	place	as	the	benefits 	
of	Accoya
	
are	recognised	over	those 	
of	hardwoods	and	other	man-made 	
materials.	The	smaller	increase	in	sales 	
volume	compared	to	recent	years	was 	
in	part	a	result	of	our	pricing	strategy 	
in	order	to	manage	demand	as	we	near 	
our	existing	capacity.	In	addition,	sales 	
in	certain	geographies	were	less	than 	
had	been	expected,	with	our	customers 	
in	the	Benelux	taking	longer	to	recover 	
from	the	economic	downturn	and 	
some	customers	in	North	America 	
undergoing	a	period	of	destocking. 	
In	January,	Solvay	assumed	
responsibility	for	sales	and	marketing	
in	their	exclusive	region	which	includes	
Germany,	France,	Italy,	Spain,	Poland	
and	Scandinavia	and	have	committed	
to	purchase	a	minimum	of	76,000m
3
	
of	Accoya
	
from	Accsys	over	a	five	
year	period	to	help	support	the	
development	of	their	region.	We	
have	continued	to	work	closely	with	
Solvay	supporting	the	transition	and	
will	continue	to	develop	marketing	
campaigns	and	strategy	with	them,	
building	on	our	success	over	recent	
years.	Sales	volumes	in	their	region	
marginally	reduced	in	the	period	as		
a	result	of	the	transition	and	due	to	
some	de-stocking	of	key	customers,	
however	these	are	expected	to	
increase	in	the	new	financial	year.
The	assumption	of	responsibility	for 	
sales	in	Solvay’s	region	enables	us	to 	
redeploy	some	of	our	resources.	We 	
will	continue	to	focus	on	the	UK,	our 	
largest	and	strongest	market,	as	well	as 	
the	Benelux	which	has	underperformed 	
as	noted	above.	In	addition,	we	have 	
hired	new,	highly	experienced	staff 	
to	our	North	American	sales	team	as 	
we	believe	this	market	provides	the 	
greatest	opportunity	for	growth	in 		
the	longer-term.	
Sales	in	Asia	Pacific	grew	steadily	
with	growth	in	Japan,	Australia	and	
New	Zealand.	Sales	also	resumed	to	
Diamond	Wood	and	we	continue	to	
believe	the	entire	region	represents	
a	significant	long-term	opportunity	
for	Accoya.	
We	continue	to	develop	our	sales 	
and	marketing	methods	which	vary 	
depending	on	market	and	preferences 	
for	particular	applications.	This	has 	
also	enabled	us	to	learn	and	we	will 	
continue	to	transfer	knowledge	and 	
practices	between	markets	in	order 	
to	understand	how	best	to	take 	
advantage	of	the	market	opportunity 	
as	new	manufacturing	capacity 	
becomes	available.	
Accoya
	
sold	to	Medite	for	the	
manufacture	of	Medite	Tricoya
	
increased	by	21%	to	¤6.6m	(2015:	
¤5.5m).	The	margin	for	this	material	
remains	below	that	achieved	for	the	
majority	of	Accoya
	
we	sell,	reflecting	
our	investment	in	the	Tricoya
	
project	
and	that	the	current	manufacturing	
process	is	in	place	only	until	the	first	
dedicated	Tricoya
	
plant	is	operational.	
We	continue	to	expect	volumes	sold	
to	Medite	to	increase	marginally	in	
the	new	financial	year,	given	potential	
capacity	limitations	in	Arnhem.
We	have	59	Accoya
	
distributor,	supply	
and	agency	agreements	in	place	
covering	most	of	Europe,	Australia,	
Canada,	Chile,	China,	India,	Israel,	
Mexico,	Morocco,	New	Zealand,	South	
Africa,	parts	of	South-East	Asia	and	
Middle-East	and	the	USA.
The	increase	in	revenue	largely	resulted 	
from	an	approximate	5%	price	increase 	
for	our	Accoya
	
customers	implemented	
during	the	third	quarter	of	the	previous 	
financial	year	which	improved	our 	
margin	on	a	comparable	basis	in	the 	
first	half	of	the	new	financial	year.	The 	
second	half	of	the	year	was	impacted 	
by	our	maintenance	stop	in	October 	
and	a	Christmas	period	which	is	quiet 	
for	the	whole	industry.	In	addition,	the 	
19%
Manufacturing 
EBITDA increase 15
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
last	quarter	was	impacted	by	lower 	
sales	prices	to	Solvay,	following	their 	
assumption	of	sales	and	marketing 	
responsibilities	in	their	region	and	their 	
related	five	year	offtake	agreement. 	
There	were	no	significant	Accoya
	
price	changes	in	the	year,	other	than 	
minor	adjustments	to	reflect	some 	
regional	foreign	exchange	variations. 	
We	have	no	imminent	plans	for 	
significant	price	changes	however 	
we	will	continue	to	keep	prices	under 	
review	in	the	new	financial	year	given 	
the	underlying	demand	for	Accoya. 	
In	November	2015,	I	was	pleased	
that	Accsys	was	recognised	with	the	
Cradle	to	Cradle	Products	Innovator	
Award,	recognising	leaders	across	
industries	that	are	designing	for	
upcycling	and	making	products		
with	safe	ingredients	that	
are	perpetually	cycled	and	
manufactured	in	ways	that	respect	
humans	and	the	environment.
Another increase in Accoya
 
manufacturing plant profitability 
The	price	increases	and	on-going	
improvements	and	efficiency	gains	
enabled	manufacturing	gross	profit	
to	increase	from	25%	to	27%	with	
manufacturing	EBITDA	increasing		
by	19%	to	¤8.3m	(2015:	¤6.9m).	
We	continue	to	believe	our	existing	
manufacturing	is	an	illustration	
of	the	returns	achievable	when	
producing	Accoya
	
on	a	larger	scale.	
We	expect	the	economies	of	scale	
resulting	from	operating	at	full	
capacity	to	result	in	a	higher	gross	
margin.	Further	improvements	in	
profitability	are	expected	to	result	
from	the	expanded	plant	as	a	result	
of	economies	of	scale	associated	
with	operating	our	chemical	plant.	In	
turn	these	are	expected	to	improve	
the	profitability	of	the	overall	Group	
given	the	remainder	of	the	Group’s	
costs	are	less	variable	in	nature.
CASE STUDY
Masisa Tricoya
®
 XB chosen for 
premium brand – Chile
Masisa	Tricoya
	
XB	has	been	used	for	the	new	
decorative	facade	for	Bosch	House	located	in	
Alonso	de	Cordova,	Vitacura,	Chile.
Masisa	worked	with	the	architect	to	create	a	
modern	and	sustainable	design,	and	requirement	
for	the	customer.
The	brand	logo	was	also	made	from	Masisa	
Tricoya
	
XB,	avoiding	the	use	of	acrylic	signs.	The	
panels	were	coated	with	architectural	paints	to	
meet	with	UV	strength	and	durability. 16
Investing	in	our	manufacturing 	
process	and	developing	improvements 	
to	equipment	and	the	chemical 	
process	remains	a	core	part	of	our 	
business.	Improvements	are	sought 	
to	increase	capacity,	reliability	and 	
efficiency,	all	of	which	will	also	help 	
improve	the	profitability	of	our 	
licensee’s	plants.	We	will	continue	to 	
invest	in	the	new	financial	year,	and 	
will	be	incorporating	what	we	have 	
learnt	and	improved	so	far	into	our 	
new	reactors	and	expanded	plant. 	
Our	significant	research	and 	
development	programme	continues	
to	identify	future	improvements 	
to	our	process	as	well	as	product 	
and	application	developments.	We 	
continue	to	carry	out	both	research 	
and	development	into	additional 	
species	to	be	commercially	acetylated 	
which	we	will	believe	will	bring	further 	
market	and	supply	opportunities. 	
We	are	also	seeking	to	increase	the 	
strength	of	our	supply	chain	to	enable 	
our	future	growth	and	to	support 	
new	manufacturing	capacity	as	it 	
becomes	available.	
Enhanced collaboration with Solvay
In	November,	we	were	pleased	to 	
announce	a	new	arrangement	with	our 	
Accoya
	
licensee,	Solvay	Acetow	GmBH	
(‘Solvay’),	providing	the	framework 	
and	funding	for	Accsys	to	significantly 	
increase	our	manufacturing	capacity 	
in	Arnhem.	
Solvay	will	purchase	a	minimum	of	
76,000m
3
	of	Accoya
	
from	our	Arnhem	
plant	over	the	period	from	2016	to	
2020	(the	‘offtake	commitment’)	and	
has	taken	over	full	responsibility	for	
sales	and	marketing	for	a	reduced	
exclusive	region	in	Europe	from	
January	2016.	
The	arrangement	enables	Accsys	
to	generate	increased	Accoya
	
manufacturing	capacity	in	a	faster	
timescale	than	previously	would	have	
been	possible	and	Solvay	will	review	
the	optimal	timing	to	construct	its	
own	63,000m
3
	Accoya
	
manufacturing	
plant.	This	also	enables	Accsys	
to	generate	higher	returns	from	
manufacturing	a	higher	volume	of	
Accoya
	
over	the	next	few	years	than	
was	previously	envisaged	and	in	return	
Solvay	will	benefit	from	developing	
higher	demand	for	Accoya
	
to	be	
manufactured	from	its	own	plant	when 	
it	becomes	operational.	
We	will	double	our	existing	
manufacturing	capacity	in	Arnhem	
in	stages.	Work	has	commenced	
in	respect	of	the	first	stage	of	the	
expansion	which	will	result	in	a	
third	reactor,	adding	50%	additional	
capacity	(to	a	total	of	in	excess	of	
60,000m
3
).	We	have	completed	the	
pre-construction	engineering	and	
design	work,	which	also	includes	
the	chemical	backbone	enabling	a	
fourth	reactor	to	be	added	separately.	
We	expect	the	third	reactor	to	be	
operational	in	mid-2017	calendar	year.	
The	fourth	reactor	will	be	added	at	a	
later	date	as	demand	requires.	
The	addition	of	the	third	reactor	will	
be	funded	through	a	combination	
of	loans	and	fees	from	Solvay,	in	
addition	to	those	due	under	the	
offtake	commitment,	with	the	balance	
expected	to	be	met	by	our	own	
resources,	including	the	expected	sale	
and	leaseback	of	the	remaining	land	
at	Arnhem,	noting	that	our	existing	
manufacturing	site	was	subject	to	a	
similar	agreement	in	2011.	
Proposed Tricoya
® 
consortium
We	have	made	significant	and	exciting 	
progress	in	the	creation	of	a	new 	
consortium	which	is	expected	to	result 	
in	Accsys	holding	a	major	stake	in	a 	
valuable	new	business.	
In	February	2016	we	announced	
BP’s	participation	in	the	proposed	
consortium	(the	‘Consortium’)	to	fund,	
build	and	operate	the	world’s	first	
Tricoya
	
wood	elements	acetylation	
plant.	Accsys	and	BP	Ventures	(‘BPV’)	
agreed	initial	funding	in	respect	of	
the	Consortium,	with	BPV	acquiring	
an	initial	3%	equity	interest	in	Tricoya
	
Technologies	Limited	(‘TTL’),	implying	
a	valuation	of	TTL	at	¤35	million	today.

Solvay offtake 
agreement over  
5 years 17
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BPV’s	investment	follows	¤1.3m	
already	contributed	by	BP	and	
Medite	since	April	2015.	The	pre-
construction	engineering	and	
design	work	has	been	completed,	
engineering,	procurement	and	
construction	(EPC)	contractors	
have	been	shortlisted	and	detailed	
planning	is	continuing	for	the	plant,	
which	is	expected	to	be	located	
at	the	Saltend	Chemicals	Park	in	
Hull,	UK,	adjacent	to	BP’s	existing	
acetyls	facility.	BPV’s	on-going	
participation	in	the	Consortium	
remains	conditional	upon	the	full	
Consortium	being	finalised	later	this	
calendar	year.	
BP’s	involvement	results	from	a	
historical	interest	in	acetylation	
having	conducted	research	and	
development	into	wood	acetylation	
at	its	Hull	site	in	the	past.	BP	
Chemicals	has	also	been	a	key	
partner	of	Accsys,	supplying	acetic	
anhydride	for	its	Accoya
	
plant	in	
Arnhem	since	it	began	operations	
and	entering	into	a	collaborative	
strategic	relationship	in	2012.
The	Consortium	is	also	expected	to	
include	Medite,	part	of	the	Medite	
Smartply	group	and	Accsys’s	historic	
joint	development	partner.	Medite	
has	received	Board	approval	in	
principle	to	invest	in	the	Consortium	
and	to	enter	a	long-term	offtake	
commitment	for	up	to	nearly	
half	of	the	Tricoya
	
plant’s	initial	
annual	capacity.
The	Hull	plant	will	have	an	initial	
capacity	of	30,000	tonnes	
per	annum	(tpa)	(sufficient	
to	manufacture	40,000m
3
	of	
panels)	with	scope	for	expansion.	
Approximately	60%	of	the	plant’s	
output	is	expected	to	be	sold	under	
committed	take-or-pay	agreements	
with	Medite	and	Masisa;	cash	flow	
break-even	is	at	approximately	40%	
capacity.	The	plant	is	expected	to	
cost	approximately	¤61m,	with	a	
further	approximately	¤15m	required	
for	continued	market	seeding,	
marketing,	IP	development	and	
engineering	functions	to	cash		
break-even.	
The	global	market	for	Tricoya
	
panel	
products	is	estimated	at	between	1.6 	
million	and	4.5	million	m
3
	per	annum,	
which	would	occupy	around	1%	of 	
global	MDF	manufacturing	capacity. 	
Tricoya
	
panels	were	introduced	
to	the	market	by	Medite	in	2011, 	
manufactured	using	chipped	Accoya. 	
Sales	have	roughly	doubled	each	year 	
since,	and	total	panel	sales	to	date 	
exceed	13,000m
3
	(approximately	
1,200,000m
2
),	representing	a	sales 	
value	of	approximately	¤18m.	TTL 	
intends	to	grow	the	market	for 	
Tricoya
	
wood	elements	through	a 	
combination	of	own	manufacture	in 	
key	territories	and	licensing/partnering	
in	other	geographies.
BP	and	Medite	are	together	expected 	
to	invest	approximately	¤30m	and	up 	
to	¤20m	is	expected	to	be	provided 	
from	bank	debt,	which	is	possible 	
as	a	result	of	a	committed	offtake 	
agreement	from	Medite.	Accsys’s 	
contribution	is	substantially	in	the 	
form	of	intellectual	property	and	the 	
development	of	the	Tricoya
	
business	
to	date	such	that	our	remaining 	
contribution	is	expected	to	be	limited 	
to	approximately	¤1m	and	our	on-
going	provision	of	Accoya
	
as	market	
seeding	material,	as	we	have	been 	
since	2011.	
The	balance	of	approximately	¤25m	
is	expected	to	be	contributed	by	
the	final	consortium	members	and	
TTL	has	engaged	Opus	Corporate	
Finance	LLP	to	advise	in	this	respect.	
As	a	result,	Accsys	is	expected	
to	retain	a	substantial	interest	in	
the	consortium,	reflective	of	the	
substantial	investment	we	have	
made	in	respect	of	the	Tricoya
	
technology	and	market	development	
over	many	years.
The	formation	of	the	Consortium	
remains	conditional	upon	detailed	
agreements	being	finalised	between	
the	parties	including	the	debt	
and	equity	finance.	However	we	
are	confident	that	the	substantial	
progress	made	over	the	last	year	
by	the	Consortium	will	lead	to	the	
completion	later	this	year,	with	the	
Tricoya
	
plant	being	operational	
in	2018.	
Intellectual Property 
Accsys	continues	to	focus	on	and	
invest	heavily	in	the	generation	and	
protection	of	intellectual	property	
relating	to	the	innovation	associated	
with	its	acetylation	processes	
and	products	to	ensure	ongoing	
differentiation	and	competitive	
advantage	in	the	market	place.	
Whilst	each	new	innovation	is	
carefully	considered,	patenting	and/
or	maintaining	valuable	know-how	
as	a	trade	secret	remains	the	typical	
route	through	which	our	innovation	
is	protected.	
Accsys	currently	has	an	extensive 	
patent	portfolio	with	over	40 	
granted	patents	in	various	countries 	
throughout	the	world	and	over	120 	
pending	patent	applications	across 	
more	than	20	patent	families	covering 	
all	major	markets.	Significant	R&D 	
resources	are	employed	to	maximise 	
the	scope	of	our	patent	rights	to	not 	
only	cover	the	products	we	and	our 	
distributors	and	licensees	sell,	and	the 	
processes	by	which	these	products 	
are	made,	but	also	to	prevent 	
competitors	from	commercialising	
similar	products	and	processes.
Management	of	Company	know-
how	remains	an	essential	element	
of	safeguarding	our	innovation,	with	
confidentiality	protocols	in	place	
to	prevent	unauthorised	access	to	
such	know-how	and	to	place	strict	
contractual	obligations	on	third	
parties	collaborating	with	Accsys.	
Increasing	Company-wide	awareness	
of	the	importance	of	protecting	and	
controlling	our	know-how	is	a	key	
initiative	with	particular	focus	on	
minimising	risks	when	collaborating	
with	third	parties.
Our	well	established	trade	mark	
portfolio	remains	unchanged	and	
covers	the	key	distinctive	brands	
Accoya
®
,	Tricoya
®	
and	the	Trimarque	
Device	under	which	products	
are	marketed,	alongside	the	
corporate	Accsys	brand,	including	
transliterations	in	Arabic,	Chinese	
and	Japanese.	All	of	our	key	brands	
have	now	been	registered	in	over	50	
countries,	and	have	become	valuable	
house-hold	names	in	the	timber	and	
panel	industries. 18
Accsys	continues	to	maintain	an	
active	watch	on	the	commercial	and	
IP	activity	of	third	parties	to	monitor	
and	take	actions	if	its	IP	rights	are	
being	infringed,	to	identify	potentially	
valuable	third	party	IP	which	could	
be	exploited	via	a	strategic	alliance,	
in-licence	or	purchase	of	third	party	IP	
and	to	obtain	an	early	insight	into	third	
party	IP	which	could	potentially	hinder	
our	proposed	commercial	activity.
Both	the	patent	and	trade	mark	
portfolios,	together	with	other	
protected	IP,	including	material	
under	copyright	and	domain	names,	
continue	to	be	regularly	reviewed	to	
ensure	alignment	with	the	Company	
objectives	and	to	confirm	obligations	
to	licensees	are	being	fulfilled.	
Careful	IP	management,	effected	via	
our	qualified	in-house	IP	manager	
working	in	close	conjunction	with	
our	technology,	engineering,	product	
development,	marketing	and	
commercial	groups,	and	supported	
where	appropriate	by	external	
patent	and	trade	mark	attorneys,	
ensures	our	IP	portfolio	is	not	only	
maintained	and	protected,	but	is	
grown	in	a	cost	effective	manner,	
adding	value	to	our	manufacturing	
and	licensing	businesses.
Outlook
Managing	the	demand	for	Accoya
	
given	our	short-term	capacity 	
constraints	will	continue	to	be	a 	
challenge	in	the	shorter-term.	The 	
progress	we	have	made	in	the 	
year	towards	securing	additional 	
manufacturing	capacity	provides	
certainty	in	the	medium-term	such 	
that	I	am	confident	that	both	Accoya
	
and	Tricoya
	
sales	will	grow	in	the	new 	
financial	year,	although	such	growth 	
will	necessarily	be	more	limited	than 	
in	past	years	until	the	new	capacity 	
comes	on	stream.
The	new	agreement	with	Solvay	
provides	us	with	an	opportunity	to	
generate	higher	returns	than	previously	
envisaged	over	the	next	few	years	and	
in	the	longer-term	also	gives	us	more	
capability	to	develop	the	substantial	
market	which	we	continue	to	believe	
exists	for	Accoya
	
globally.	The	EBITDA	
level	expected	to	be	generated	from	
the	expanded	Arnhem	plant	will	reflect	
further	economies	of	scale	associated	
with	operating	a	chemical	plant.	This	
is	expected	to	result	in	significantly	
improved	EBITDA	for	the	Group	as	a	
whole	given	the	level	of	costs	incurred	
by	the	remainder	of	the	Group	which	is	
focussed	on	business	development.	
The	proposed	Consortium	for	Tricoya
	
and	the	detailed	plans	in	place	for	
the	first	dedicated	chip	acetylation	
plant	in	Hull	are	particularly	exciting.	
When	completed,	it	will	result	in	a	
substantial	new	operating	business	for	
which	Accsys	will	continue	to	have	a	
substantial	interest.
Our	financial	position	remains	good	
and	despite	the	significant	investment	
required	to	execute	both	the	Arnhem	
expansion	and	the	Tricoya
	
plant,	I	
am	confident	we	have	or	are	putting	
in	place	appropriate	financing	
arrangements	to	ensure	that	maximum	
possible	financial	returns	are	achieved	
for	shareholders.
The	new	financial	year	has	continued	
to	demonstrate	strong	underlying	
demand	for	Accoya.	On	an	operating	
activities	basis,	we	expect	to	remain	
cash	flow	positive	over	the	year	
ahead	as	we	look	towards	the	next	
key	milestone	in	our	development.	I	
am	confident	that	our	overall	position	
is	stronger	than	at	any	point	in	our	
history	and	I	am	excited	about	our	
long-term	growth	prospects.

Accoya
® 
selected for Royal 
Arena in Copenhagen – Denmark 
Danish	architecture	firm	3XN	were	
appointed	to	design	the	state	of	the	art	
arena	to	host	a	variety	of	international	
events	such	as	performing	arts,	sports	
matches	and	concerts	and	will	be	able	to	
seat	12,500	people,	with	additional	capacity	
for	15,000	standing.
The	architects’	aim	was	to	create	a	building	
that	will	stand	the	test	of	time	and	as	result	
specified	Accoya.	Around	250m
3
	of	Accoya
	
is	being	used	to	create	the	entire	façade	of	
the	arena,	which	is	due	for	completion	in	
late	2016.
To	complement	the	façade	3XN	have 	
designed	‘fins’	to	give	the	building	a 		
unique	wave-like	semi-transparent	style. 	
The	fins	have	been	made	from	Accoya
	
and	
provide	extra	light,	texture	and	elegance 		
to	the	building. 20
Financial 
Review
Income statement
Revenue
Total	revenue	for	the	year	ended 	
31	March	2016	increased	by	15%	to 	
¤52.8m	(2015:	¤46.1m).	Within	this 	
total,	Accoya
	
wood	revenue	increased	
by	7%	to	¤43.5m	(2015:	¤40.7m) 	
largely	as	a	result	of	pricing.	Accoya
	
revenue	includes	¤6.6m	of	sales	to 	
Medite	for	the	manufacture	of	Tricoya, 	
a	21%	increase	(2015:	¤5.5m).	Licence 	
income	increased	from	¤0.4m	to	¤2.8m 	
reflecting	the	new	agreements	with	our 	
Accoya
	
licensee	Solvay	in	the	period. 	
Other	revenue	of	¤6.5m	(2015:	¤5.0m)	
included	¤1.3m	in	respect	of	the	Global	
Marketing	agreement	with	Solvay	
which	expired	in	the	period.	¤0.9m	of	
other	revenue	was	recorded	in	respect	
of	the	monies	received	attributable	to	
the	Tricoya
	
project	with	the	remainder	
of	Other	income	largely	attributable	to	
sales	of	acetic	acid,	a	by-product	from	
the	acetylation	process.	
Gross margin
Gross	profit	margin	improved	from	
27%	to	34%,	resulting	from	higher	
licence	revenue,	price	increases	and	
improved	operating	efficiencies.	The	
gross	manufacturing	margin	increased	
from	25%	to	27%	largely	as	a	result	of	
price	increases	implemented	part	way	
through	the	previous	financial	year.	
Other operating costs
Other	operating	costs	increased	
by	15%	to	¤18.5m	(2015:	¤16.0m).	
This	increase	includes	¤1.6m	of	
fully	consolidated	operating	costs	
from	Tricoya
	
Technologies	Limited	
(‘TTL’),	which	were	previously	equity	
accounted	and	shown	separately	under	
share	of	joint	venture	loss.	In	addition,	
payroll	and	sales	and	marketing	costs	
increased	largely	as	a	result	of	higher	
activity	levels.	Headcount	increased	to	
an	average	of	121	(2015:	111),	with	staff	
costs	increasing	by	9.8%	to	¤11.1m.	
This	included	a	share	based	payment	
charge	of	¤1.0m	(2015:	¤1.4m).	
¤0.3m	of	the	increase	in	staff	costs	is	
attributable	to	foreign	exchange,	with	a	
further	¤0.4m	of	the	increase	in	other	
operating	costs	also	attributable	to	
foreign	exchange	(see	note	4).
An	exceptional	item	of	¤2.9m	was	also	
recorded	in	the	prior	period,	in	respect	
of	the	arbitration	with	Diamond	Wood	
which	concluded	in	the	prior	period	
(see	note	5).
Loss from operations
The	loss	from	operations	decreased	
by	96%	to	¤0.3m	(2015:	loss	of	¤6.7m)	
due	to	the	improvement	in	gross	
margin	described	above,	offset	by	
the	increase	in	operating	costs	and	
exceptional	costs	of	¤2.9m	in	the	prior	
period,	as	explained	above.	Excluding	
exceptional	costs,	the	loss	from	
operations	decreased	by	92%	to		
¤0.3m	(2015:	¤3.8m).
Share of joint venture loss and gain on 
acquisition of subsidiary
During	the	previous	period	TTL	had	
been	accounted	for	in	the	Accsys	
Group	accounts	using	the	equity	
method.	In	the	year	ended	31	March	
2015	TTL	recorded	revenue	of	¤0.5m	
and	total	costs	of	¤2.7m	resulting	in	
Accsys’	share	of	loss	of	¤1.1m.	
On	31	March	2015,	Accsys	acquired	the	
remaining	50%	equity	interest	in	TTL	
held	by	Ineos	and	as	a	result	owned	
100%	at	the	end	of	the	prior	period	
and	TTL	was	consolidated	throughout	
the	year	ended	31	March	2016.	The	
acquisition	was	accounted	for	as	an	
acquisition	of	a	subsidiary	and	the	
assets	and	liabilities	recorded	at	fair	
value.	A	gain	of	¤0.3m	was	recorded	as	
a	result	of	the	difference	between	the	
consideration	paid,	the	investment	in	
joint	venture	immediately	prior	to	the	
acquisition	and	the	fair	value	of	the	net	
assets	acquired	(see	note	9).
Finance income
Finance	income	of	¤0.01m	(2015:	
¤0.07m)	represents	interest	receivable	
on	bank	deposits.	
Finance expense
The	finance	expense	of	¤0.2m	(2015:	
¤0.2m)	is	primarily	due	to	interest	
element	arising	on	the	payments	
attributable	to	the	sale	and	leaseback	
of	part	of	the	Group’s	land	and	
buildings	in	Arnhem,	together	with	
interest	arising	on	the	new	leases	for	
office	equipment	in	the	London	office.	
This	also	includes	any	interest	payable	
upon	the	Group’s	finance	facilities.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Research & Development expenditure
¤2.0m	was	incurred	on	research	and	
development	activities	in	the	period	
(2015:	¤1.4m).	¤0.1m	(2015:	¤0.2m)	
has	been	capitalised	as	an	intangible	
asset	(see	note	16).
Taxation
The	net	tax	charge	of	¤0.4m	(2015: 	
¤0.6m)	primarily	represents	a	tax 	
charge	arising	from	manufacturing 	
offset	by	R&D	tax	credits	of 	
¤0.2m	(2015:	¤0.2m)	attributable 	
to	activities	carried	out	in	the 	
current	year.
Dividends
No	final	dividend	is	proposed	in	2016	
(2015	final	dividend:	¤nil).	The	Board	
deems	it	prudent	for	the	Company	
to	maintain	as	strong	a	balance	sheet	
as	possible	during	the	current	phase	
of	the	Company’s	growth	strategy.	
Earnings per share
Basic	and	diluted	loss	per	share	was	
¤0.01	(2015	basic	and	diluted	loss	
per	share	was	¤0.09).	
Balance sheet
Intangible assets
Intangible	asset	additions	of	¤1.5m	
(2015:	¤0.2m)	include	¤1.0m	relating	
to	the	Front	End	Engineering	
Design	(‘FEED’)	document	for	the	
construction	of	the	world’s	first	
Tricoya
	
plant.	In	addition	¤0.5m	
relates	to	capitalised	internal	
development	costs	for	both	Accoya
	
and	Tricoya
	
related	activities.	
Property, plant and equipment
Property,	plant	and	equipment	net	
additions	of	¤2.8m	(2015:	¤0.9m)	
includes	¤1.2m	relating	to	the	
expansion	of	our	existing	plant	in	
Arnhem,	predominantly	relating	to	
engineering	work.	In	addition	¤1.0m	
relates	to	technology	improvements	
and	items	of	maintenance	equipment	
at	our	Arnhem	production	facility,		
and	¤0.4m	relate	to	office	
equipment	in	London,	including	in	
respect	of	the	move	to	our	new		
head	office	in	London.
Available for sale investments
Accsys	Technologies	PLC	has 	
previously	purchased	a	total	of 	
21,666,734	unlisted	ordinary	shares 	
in	Diamond	Wood	China	Limited.	The 	
historical	cost	of	the	unlisted	shares 	
held	at	31	March	2016	is	¤10m	(2015: 	
¤10m).	However,	a	provision	for	the 	
impairment	of	the	entire	balance	of 	
¤10m	continues	to	be	recorded	as	at 	
31	March	2016	(see	note	18).
Inventory 
The	Group	had	total	inventory 	
balances	of	¤8.3m	(2015:	¤7.9m). 	
Finished	goods	consisting	of	Accoya
	
represented	¤5.8m	(2015:	¤4.8m)	and 	
raw	materials	and	work	in	progress, 	
primarily	consisting	of	unprocessed 	
lumber,	being	¤2.5m	(2015:	¤3.1m). 	
The	increase	is	attributable	to	the 	
planned	increase	in	sales	in	the	new 	
financial	year	together	with	the 	
previously	reported	overstocking	of 	
certain	items.	The	utilisation	of	these 	
items	commenced	in	the	second	half 	
of	the	financial	year	and	will	continue 	
in	the	new	financial	year. 	
Cash and cash equivalents
The	Group	had	cash	and	bank	
deposits	of	¤8.2m	at	the	end	of	the	
period	(2015:	¤10.8m).	The	decrease	
in	the	year	is	mainly	due	to	the	
changes	in	working	capital	of	¤3.0m	
(2015:	¤1.0m),	which	includes	¤1.7m	
revenue	released	from	deferred	
income,	plus	increases	of	¤0.7m	in	
trade	and	other	receivables,	and	
¤0.4m	in	inventories.	
¤3.5m	of	cash	in-flow	was	
attributable	to	cash	flows	from	
operating	activities	before	changes	
in	working	capital	(2015:	¤0.2m	
excluding	exceptional	items),	as	a	
result	of	the	reduction	in	operating	
loss	to	¤0.3m	(2015:	¤3.6m	
excluding	exceptional	items).	This	
was	offset	by	a	total	of	¤4.0m	of	
investing	activities	(2015:	¤0.7m),	
including	¤0.4m	in	respect	of	
capitalised	development	costs	(2015:	
¤0.2m)	and	¤2.6m	in	respect	of	
tangible	fixed	assets	(2015:	¤0.9m)	
including	in	respect	of	the	expansion	
of	plant	in	Arnhem.	In	addition	¤1.1m	
of	cash	out-flow	was	in	respect	of	
intangible	fixed	assets	(2015:	¤nil)	in	
TTL,	relating	to	the	completed	FEED	
study	for	the	new	Tricoya
	
plant.
Trade and other receivables
Trade	and	other	receivables	have	
increased	to	¤5.6m	(2015:	¤5.0m).	
Within	this,	trade	receivables	
increased	from	¤3.0m	to	¤4.0m		
due	to	higher	sales	in	March	2016.
Trade and other payables
Trade	and	other	payables	decreased 	
to	¤8.1m	(2015:	¤9.6m).	Included 	
within	this,	trade	payables	increased 	
to	¤4.3m	(2015:	¤3.8m).	In	addition 	
accruals	and	deferred	income 	
decreased	from	¤4.6m	to	¤3.0m	due 	
to	the	release	of	¤1.3m	of	deferred 	
income	relating	to	the	Global 	
Marketing	Agreement	with	Solvay 	
and	¤0.1m	of	revenue	in	TTL	which 	
reflects	funding	received	from	the	EC 	
in	respect	of	a	Life+	subsidy	relating 	
to	the	Tricoya
	
project.	Other	Payables	
decreased	from	¤1.0m	to	¤0.4m, 	
reflecting	the	recognition	of	income 	
associated	with	licensing	activities 	
referred	to	above.
Finance lease creditor
The	Group	has	previously	entered 	
into	a	sale	and	leaseback	agreement 	
for	part	of	the	Arnhem	land	and 	
buildings.	The	first	phase	resulted	in 	
proceeds	of	¤2.2m	which	has	been 	
accounted	for	as	a	finance	lease.	At 	
31	March	2016	there	are	¤2.0m	of 	
payments	committed	to	over	the 	
remaining	life	of	the	lease	(2015: 	
¤2.1m)	(see	note	28).	The	second 	
part	of	the	sale	and	leaseback	of 	
the	land	in	Arnhem	was	completed 	
in	February	2013,	however	this	has 	
been	accounted	for	as	an	operating 	
lease	(see	note	27).	In	addition	the 	
Group	entered	into	a	finance	lease 	
arrangement	in	respect	of	the	fit	out 	
and	furniture	for	the	London	office 	
resulting	in	a	liability	of	¤0.3m	at 	
year	end	(2015:	¤nil)	(see	note	28). 22
Capital structure
Details	of	the	issued	share	capital,	
together	with	the	details	of	the	
movements	in	the	Company’s	issued	
share	capital	in	the	year	are	included	
in	note	24.	The	Company	has	one	
class	of	Ordinary	shares	which	carry	
no	right	to	fixed	income.	Each	share	
carries	the	right	to	one	vote	at	general	
meetings	of	the	Company.	Details	of	
non-controlling	interests	associated	
with	Tricoya
	
Technologies	Limited	are	
set	out	in	note	9.
There	are	no	specific	restrictions	on	the	
size	of	a	holding	nor	on	the	transfer	of	
the	Company’s	shares,	which	are	both	
governed	by	the	general	provisions	
of	the	Articles	of	Association	and	
prevailing	legislation.	The	Directors	
are	not	aware	of	any	agreements	
between	holders	of	the	Company’s	
shares	that	may	result	in	restrictions	
on	the	transfer	of	securities	or	on	
voting	rights.
Details	of	employee	share	schemes	
are	set	out	in	note	15.	No	person	has	
any	special	rights	of	control	over	the	
Company’s	share	capital	and	all	issued	
shares	are	fully	paid.
Going concern
The	financial	statements	are	prepared	
on	a	going	concern	basis,	which	
assumes	that	the	Group	will	continue	
in	operational	existence	for	the	
foreseeable	future,	and	at	least	12	
months	from	the	date	these	financial	
statements	are	approved.
As	part	of	the	Group’s	going	concern	
review,	the	Directors	have	reviewed	
the	Group’s	trading	forecasts	and	
working	capital	requirements	for	the	
foreseeable	future.	These	forecasts	
indicate	that,	in	order	to	continue	as	a	
going	concern,	the	Group	is	dependent	
on	the	achievement	of	certain	
operating	performance	measures	
relating	to	the	production	and	sales	of	
Accoya
	
wood	from	the	plant	in	Arnhem	
and	the	collection	of	ongoing	working	
capital	items	in	line	with	internally	
agreed	budgets.	
The	Directors	have	considered	
the	internally	agreed	budgets	and	
performance	measures	and	believe	
that	appropriate	controls	and	
procedures	are	in	place	or	will	be	in	
place	to	make	sure	that	these	are	met.	
The	Directors	believe,	while	some	
uncertainty	inherently	remains	in	
achieving	the	budget,	in	particular	in	
relation	to	market	conditions	outside	
of	the	Group’s	control,	that	there	are	a	
sufficient	number	of	alternative	actions	
and	measures	that	can	be	taken	in	
order	to	achieve	the	Group’s	medium	
and	long-term	objectives.
Therefore,	the	Directors	believe	that	
the	going	concern	basis	is	the	most	
appropriate	on	which	to	prepare	the	
financial	statements.

Our Corporate Vision
A	focus	on	corporate	and	social 	
responsibility	lies	at	the	very	core	of 	
our	business.	Our	technologies	not 	
only	enable	us	to	manufacture	wood 	
products	that	offer	‘best	in	class’ 	
durability,	dimensional	stability	and	a 	
wide	spectrum	of	other	performance 	
and	environmental	advantages	
over	alternative	environmentally	
threatened	or	compromised	
products,	but	also	provide	attractive 	
opportunities	for	our	employees, 	
distributors,	licensees	and	other 	
stakeholders.	We	want	to	ensure	that 	
our	business	is	not	only	a	commercial 	
success,	but	also	run	in	a	responsible 	
fashion	as	we	continue	to	advance 	
technologies	for	a	better	world. 	
Accsys	has	already	developed	and	
is	commercially	producing	Accoya

solid	acetylated	wood.	We	have	
developed	the	process	for	the	
production	of	Tricoya
®
,	acetylated	
wood	elements	used	for	the	
production	of	panel	products.	We	
are	committed	to	increase	the	use	
of	these	products	globally	through	
sales	from	our	manufacturing	facility,	
and	on	a	substantially	larger	scale		
by	licensing	our	technologies	to	
other	companies	so	that	they	too		
can	manufacture	these	products.	
Accsys	aims	to	reduce	the	use 	
of	environmentally	unfriendly	
building	materials	and	products 	
by	the	utilisation	of	our	propriety 	
technology	and	the	introduction 	
of	our	products	around	the	world. 	
The	planet	continues	to	consume 	
endangered	materials	like	tropical 	
hardwood	and	non-renewable,	high 	
emitting	building	materials	such	as 	
plastics,	concrete	and	metals	at	an 	
alarming	rate.	Our	acetylated	wood 	
products	offer	alternative,	sustainable 	
new	materials	that	resolve	many	of 	
the	environmental	limitations	that 	
commonly	used	building	materials 	
have,	whilst	not	compromising	on 	
performance.	In	fact,	Accoya
	
is	the	
only	building	product	perfectly 	
fitting	in	the	bio-cycle	of	the	circular

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Through	the	certification	process 	
the	C2C	product	standard	steers 	
designers	and	manufacturers	
through	a	continuous	environmental 	
and	social	improvement	process 	
in	which	the	product	is	assessed 	
in	five	categories;	material	health, 	
material	recycling,	renewable	energy

management	and	social	responsibility. 	
The	Accoya
	
process	fits	perfectly	in	
the	bio-cycle	of	the	C2C	concept.	
Through	the	acetylation	process,		
the	part	of	wood	that	readily	bonds	
with	water	is	replaced	by	acetyl	
groups	which	are	naturally		
occurring	especially	in	the	more

and	without	adding	any	toxic	
substances,	it	ensures	performance	
and	material	health	to	the	highest	
level	possible	under	C2C	standards:	
the	platinum	level	for	which	it	has	
received	a	separate	award:	
http://bit.ly/29IswQE
At	end-of-life,	Accoya
	
provides	no	
challenges	whatsoever.	It	can	be 	
treated	similar	to	untreated	wood 	
and	thus	can	be	re-	or	upcycled	in 	
various	ways	for	example	to	produce 	
high	performance	boards	such	as 	
Tricoya
	
(www.tricoya.com),	but	
may	also	be	safely	used	as	a	clean 	
fuel	source	for	renewable	energy 	
production.	But	what	makes	Accoya
	
a	perfect	fit	with	Cradle	to	Cradle	is 	
that	even	if	just	discarded,	it	is	100% 	
biodegradable	over	time.	Therefore 	
it	comes	as	no	surprise	that	Accoya, 	
as	the	only	C2C	certified	structural 	
building	material	around,	has 	
achieved	Gold	level	certification. 	
In	conclusion,	Accoya
	
is	the	first	
natural	product	from	the	bio-
cycle	that	can	match	the	high	
performance	of	the	manmade	
materials	used	in	the	techno-cycle	
while	presenting	no	threat	in	the	end	
of	life	phase,	whatever	may	happen.	
Additional credits in LEED,  
BREEAM and Google’s Portico
Besides	being	a	very	credible	
product	certification	on	its	own,	
C2C	certification,	especially	at	the	
highest	levels,	now	also	results	in	
additional	credits	for	leading	green	
building	certification	systems	such	
as	LEED	and	BREEAM.	
It	is	for	these	reasons	that	Accoya
	
is	prescribed	in	many	C2C	inspired	
LEED	and	BREEAM	projects	
such	as	the	new	C2C	office	of	
the	Municipality	of	Venlo,	Early	
childhood	center	in	Wassenaar	by	
the	famous	Dutch	architectural	
firm	Kraaijvanger,	and	the	first	C2C	
inspired	business	park	2020	in	
Hoofddorp	by	Delta	Development	
of	which	Accsys	Technologies	is	
innovation	partner	as	well.
Since	2015	a	new	breakthrough	
occurred	when	Google	adopted	
C2C	Material	health	as	one	
of	the	compliant	certification	
schemes	within	Portico,	Google’s	
healthy	building	material	
assessment	software.
As	Accoya
	
received	C2C	Material	
Health	certification	at	the	highest,	
Platinum	level	it	is	now	amongst	
the	most	highly	rated	products	in	
Google’s	Portico,	earning	15	out	of	
16	points.	This	highlights	Accoya
	
as	an	optimised	product	with	a	
product	status	that	exceeds	criteria	
for	any	Google	construction	project	
throughout	the	globe.

CASE STUDY
Accoya
® 
selected for  
The New Venlo City  
Hall – Netherlands
Accoya
	
was	used	on	the	outside	of	the	building		
for	the	siding,	terraces	and	window	frames,	as		
well	as	the	doors	and	ceiling.
The	new	city	hall	in	Venlo	is	a	paramount	example	
of	applying	the	Cradle	to	Cradle	design	principles	
on	a	building	scale.	This	project	boasts	the	highest	
possible	application	level	of	Cradle	to	Cradle	
within	the	budget.
The	most	important	element	the	design	team	had	to 	
consider	was	the	use	of	appropriate	materials	which 	
have	green	credentials	and	can	be	recycled.	This 	
is	why	Accoya
	
was	selected	as	the	ideal	building 	
material.	Accoya
	
was	chosen	for	the	interior	and 	
exterior	of	the	building.	Accoya
	
is	gold	certified 	
Cradle	to	Cradle	and	recently	received	the	platinum 	
accolade	for	material	health	from	Cradle	to	Cradle.
Proven Green Performance
As	we	value	transparency 	
at	Accsys,	all	claims	about 	
sustainability	are	always	referenced 	
to	recognised	standards.	
Therefore,	the	environmental	
performance	of	Accoya
	
is	
thoroughly	tested	and	published	
following	uncompromising	
leading	independent	international	
methodologies	such	as	Life	Cycle	
Analysis	(LCA	following	ISO	
14040/44)	and	Environmental	
Product	Declarations	(EPD	
following	EN	15804	and	ISO	
14025).	For	example,	official	LCA	
/	carbon	footprint	studies	by	
Delft	University	of	Technology	
and	environmental	consultancy	
Verco	show	that	Accoya
	
wood	is	an	
environmentally	compatible	–	and	
even	carbon	negative	–	substitute	
for	many	traditional	carbon	intensive	
materials	such	as	plastics,	metals	
and	concrete,	as	well	as	for	various	
wood	species.	
Furthermore,	we	actively	seek	
to	acquire	the	most	respected	
ecolabels	available	and	have	
been	recognised	by	others	as	an	
exemplary	product	and	company	
in	the	field	of	sustainability	on	
many	occasions.

 Velodrome in the running  
for world record – Netherlands
Velodrome specialists Sauders Douma Architects from Stompetoren,  
completed the new cycling track in the Omnisport Apeldoorn multi-sport 
indoor arena. 
Accoya was selected as the ideal wood for the project as, due to the 
acetylation process, it will not splinter. This is a critical requirement for  
the project. Further evidence of this is also suggested as SDA designed  
the Velodrome in Tbilisi, Georgia and the Velodrome in Assen, the 
Netherlands which also uses Accoya wood. So far there are four  
Accoya Velodrome tracks worldwide and a further one underway.
Prior to the new Accoya track the architects used Larch wood. However, 
because of the humidity in the arena the wood was not able to stand up  
to elements. Now that the track has been replaced with Accoya it is 
hoped that new world records will be set.
The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is pleased to reveal Apeldoorn  
will host a round of the UCI Track Cycling World Cup for the first time, 
11–13 November 2016.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Directors present their report together with the 
audited consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2016.
Results and dividends
The consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
for the year is set out on page 56, and shows the loss  
for the year.
The Directors do not recommend the proposal of a final 
dividend in respect of the current year, consistent with

Principal activities and review of the business
The principal activity of the Group is the production  
and sale of Accoya
®
 solid wood and licensing of 
technology for the production and sale of Accoya 
wood and Tricoya
®
 wood elements via the Company’s 
subsidiaries, Titan Wood Limited, Titan Wood B.V., 
Titan Wood Technology B.V., Titan Wood Inc, Tricoya 
Technologies Limited and Tricoya Ventures UK Limited 
(collectively the ‘Group’). Manufactured through the 
Group’s proprietary acetylation processes, these 
products exhibit superior dimensional stability and 
durability compared with alternative natural, treated  
and modified woods as well as more resource intensive 
man-made materials. A review of the business is set

Principal risks and uncertainties
The business, financial condition or results of operations 
of the Group could be adversely affected by any of the 
risks set out below. The Group’s systems of control and 
protection are designed to help manage and control risks 
to an appropriate level rather than to eliminate them.
The Directors consider that the principal risks to 
achieving the Group’s objectives are those set out below:
(a) Economic and market conditions
  The Group’s operations comprise the manufacture 
of Accoya
®
 wood and licensing the technology to 
manufacture Accoya and Tricoya
®
 wood elements 
to third parties. The cost and availability of key 
inputs affects the profitability of the Group’s own 
manufacturing whilst also impacting the potential 
profitability of third parties interested in licensing 
the Group’s technology. The price of key inputs and 
security of supply are managed by the Group, partly 
through the development of long-term contractual 
supply agreements.
  An element of the Group’s strategy for growth 
envisages the Group selling new or existing products 
and services into other countries or into new markets. 
However, there can be no assurance that the Group 
will successfully execute this strategy for growth. The 
development of a mass market for a new product or 
process is affected by many factors, many of which 
are beyond the control of the Group, including the 
emergence of newer and more competitive products 
or processes and the future price of raw materials. 
If a mass market fails to develop or develops more 
slowly than anticipated, the Group may fail to achieve 
sustainable profitability. 
Directors’ Report
for the year ended 31 March 2016
32 (b) Regulatory, legislative and reputational risks
  The Group’s operations are subject to extensive 
regulatory requirements, particularly in relation 
to its manufacturing operations and employment 
policies. Changes in laws and regulations and their 
enforcement may adversely impact the Group’s 
operations in terms of costs, changes to business 
practices and restrictions on activities which could 
damage the Group’s reputation and brand.
(c) Employees
  The Group’s success depends on its ability to 
continue to attract, motivate and retain highly 
qualified employees. The highly qualified employees 
required by the Group in various capacities are 
sometimes in short supply in the labour market. 
There are risks associated with operating a chemical 
plant and accordingly the health and safety of 
our staff is made a priority. We continuously seek 
improvements to exceed industry expectations by 
challenging our methods, improving our reporting 
and continuing to learn.
(d) Intellectual property
  The Group’s strategy of licensing technology 
depends upon maintaining effective protection of 
its intellectual properties worldwide. Protection is 
afforded by a combination of trademarks, patents, 
secrecy, confidentiality agreements and the 
structuring of legal contracts relating to key licensing, 
engineering and supply arrangements. Unauthorised 
use of the Group’s intellectual property may 
adversely impact its ability to licence the technology 
and lead to additional expenditure to enforce legal 
rights. The wide geographical spread of our products 
increases this risk due to the increasingly varied and 
complex laws and regulations in which we seek to 
protect the Group’s intellectual property.
Further details of how risks and uncertainties relate to 
our strategy and performance in the year are shown on 
page 12.

Notes:
–  We have reported on all the emission sources required under 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013 for our manufacturing facility in 
Arnhem, the Netherlands.
–  Due to unavailability of data, GHG emissions related to our 
offices and staff travel our not included in the figures above.
–  Emissions have been calculated following the GHG Protocol 
– Corporate Accounting and Reporting (revised edition) 
using the following databases: IPCC 2006 Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 2007 IPCC Fourth 
Assessment Report and Eco-Invent v3.3.
–  Note that following Environmental Reporting Guidelines of 
Defra (2013), carbon offsets may be accounted for separately 
as a ‘NET’ figure, while the original electricity consumption 
figures should be presented as a ‘GROSS’ figure.
–  Following the same (Defra 2013) guidelines, the emissions 
associated with our supply chain (inputs and outputs)  
are not included in the figures above, for readers that  
are interested in the supply chain related figures we

purchase of Renewable Energy Credits may be accounted 
for separately as a ‘NET’ figure, while the original electricity 
consumption figures are presented as a ‘GROSS’ figure.
–  In the current year, Accsys has offset its CO
2
 emissions 
mainly through investing in verified carbon offset projects 
instead of through Renewable Energy Credits (see external 
carbon offsets) resulting in an amended presentation as 
recommended under the Defra guidelines.
Directors
The Directors of the Company during the year and up to 
the date of signing the financial statements were:
Sean Christie 
Paul Clegg  
Sue Farr   
Montague John ‘Nick’ Meyer 
Hans Pauli 
William Rudge  
Patrick Shanley 
Directors’ indemnities
The Company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance which gives appropriate cover for legal action 
brought against its Directors.
Employment policies
The Group operates an equal opportunities policy 
from recruitment and selection, through training and 
development, appraisal and promotion to retirement. 
It is our policy to promote an environment free from 
discrimination, harassment and victimisation, where 
everyone will receive equal treatment regardless of 
gender, colour, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, 
marital status or sexual orientation. All decisions relating 
to employment practises will be objective, free from bias 
and based solely upon work criteria and individual merit.
18% of employees in the period were female. 10% of the 
senior management team were female and one of the 
Board of Directors was female. 
Health and safety
Health and safety is the priority at all levels of the Group, 
in particular taking into account the chemical industry 
in which Accsys operates. Group companies have a 
responsibility to ensure that all reasonable precautions 
are taken to provide and maintain working conditions 
for employees and visitors alike, which are safe, healthy 
and in compliance with statutory requirements and 
appropriate codes of practice.
The avoidance of occupational accidents and illnesses 
is given a high priority. Detailed policies and procedures 
are in place to minimise risks and ensure appropriate 
action is understood in the event of an incident. A 
dedicated health and safety officer is retained at the 
Group’s manufacturing facility.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS I was appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee on 19 November 2015. I would like to thank 
Nick Meyer for his extremely valuable contribution 
during his time as Chairman and I look forward to his 
continuing support as he remains on the Committee.
I am pleased to present our 2016 Remuneration 
Report in which we have summarised the Company’s 
remuneration policy and described how the policy was 
implemented in the year to 31 March 2016 and how it will 
be implemented in the year ending March 2017 and over 
the following years.
Year ended 31 March 2016 – Performance and Pay
The year ended 31 March 2016 was another strong year 
for Accsys, as set out in the Chairman’s statement at 
the beginning of this Annual Report. This included a 15% 
increase in revenue and an underlying EBITDA profit 
of ¤2.4m, the first positive EBITDA since restructuring 
in 2010 and 2011, together with significant progress in 
respect of developing further manufacturing capacity 
for both Accoya
®
 and Tricoya
®
.
Remuneration policy considerations for 2016
The Accsys Board has been conscious that as the 
Company is evolving, its executive remuneration 
needed to be reviewed to ensure it reflects market 
and shareholder expectations. During the period, the 
Remuneration Committee has undertaken such a review 
using an independent adviser.
The purpose of this was not to increase overall pay 
levels but rather to put the Company on a clear journey 
to a more conventional remuneration framework with 
the clear focus on continuing to improve financial 
performance.
Accordingly, the key changes made during the year are 
as follows, noting that all changes remain within the 
approved Remuneration Policy:
• The salaries of Paul Clegg, Chief Executive Officer, 
and Hans Pauli, Executive Director, Corporate 
Development, other than a 2% increase applied earlier 
in the year for all staff, remain unchanged. The salary 
of William Rudge, Finance Director increased by 
22% reflecting that he has now been on the Board 
for three years and that his performance therefore 
warrants a market level salary.
• The annual bonus opportunity has previously 
operated informally within a policy cap of 200% of 
salary with a maximum of approximately 125% of 
salary paid in each of the last two years. Such awards 
have been satisfied through a mix of cash and shares. 
Going forward:
 – Absent extraordinary exceptional circumstances, 
the bonus opportunity will operate within a normal 
cap of 100% of salary for each Executive Director 
(the formal cap in the shareholder approved policy 
of up to 200% of salary remains although we 
would not envisage exceeding 100% other than in 
extraordinary exceptional cases). 
 – The awards are anticipated to be wholly satisfied in 
cash following the year-end although the option to 
substitute shares will be retained.
 – Formal claw-back provisions have been introduced 
which permits recoupment within 3 years for 
an act of gross misconduct or if an error in the 
calculation/underlying assumptions is found.
 – For the awards to be made in summer 2016 
in respect of performance for the year ended 
31 March 2016, the bonus has been determined 
by suitably challenging EBITDA targets subject to 
limited Committee discretion to adjust for changes 
in corporate strategy. 
• For the Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), practice to 
date has been to make awards occasionally (rather 
than annually). Going forward, it is proposed that:
 – Annual awards be made with the first such 
award made in the summer of 2016 and in each 
subsequent year.
 – The award to the CEO will be over shares worth 
100% of his then prevailing salary and over shares 
worth 50% of salary for other Executive Directors.
 – Awards will be subject to a 3 year performance 
period (i.e. year end March 2019) and a further 
2 year holding period.
 – A malus/claw-back provision will be introduced. 
 – 50% of the first awards will be subject to a relative 
TSR condition with 25% of that part vesting at 
median and 100% at upper quartile. The precise 
comparator group remains to be finalised but is 
likely to be a variant of the constituents of FTSE 
AIM companies.
 – The other 50% will be subject to an EBITDA per 
share target. EBITDA has been selected over the 
more common EPS given the Company focus on 
EBITDA growth. 
Remuneration Report
36 Format of the report and context of our policy
The Remuneration Report is prepared under the UK 
regime for the reporting of executive pay which was 
first adopted in 2014 as a result of our quote on AIM 
in the UK, our cross-listing on NYSE Euronext in the 
Netherlands and our UK incorporated status which 
means that we come within the definition of a “quoted 
company” in the UK Companies Act. Accordingly, and 
exceptionally amongst AIM companies, we are therefore 
legally required to comply with regime for the reporting 
and approval of directors’ remuneration by UK quoted 
companies, including a binding vote on the directors’ 
remuneration policy. The policy as set out in the 2015 
Annual Report and Accounts was approved by our 
shareholders at the AGM held on 17 September 2015  
and reflected an amendment to the section concerning 
Non-executive pay.
We remain committed to pay at appropriate, but not 
excessive, levels and to reflect market practice amongst 
AIM companies.
Over the following pages we have set out:
• Details of the implementation of our reward policy 
for the year ended 31 March 2016, within the 
Remuneration Report.
• The Group’s forward-looking Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy which was approved by shareholders at our 
2015 AGM and is therefore binding. All payments 
made to Directors from that time have been 
consistent with this policy.
Our policy, as set out in this report, focusses on our actual 
approach to pay which we believe is in our shareholders’ 
best interests. It includes the required formal caps (which 
we have set at higher levels than we envisage needing 
and which are not in any way an aspiration) but also 
retains appropriate, but limited, flexibility to address 
changing circumstances in the 3-year period in which  
it is planned to operate the policy.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Introduction
The following section contains the material required to be set out as the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for the 
purposes of Part 4 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013, which amended The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008.
At our 2016 AGM we will be holding one vote on remuneration matters: 
1) a vote on the implementation sections of this Remuneration Report (included within Part A)
The auditors have reported on certain parts of the Remuneration Report and stated whether, in their opinion, those 
parts of the Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
Those sections of the Report which have been subject to audit are clearly indicated.
PART A: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’s performance for the past seven years on the London Stock Exchange 
AIM compared with the performance of the FTSE AIM All Share index. The FTSE AIM All Share index has been 
selected for this comparison as it is a broad based index which the Directors believe most closely reflects the 
performance of companies with similar characteristics as the Company’s. A logarithmic scale has been used in 
order to more clearly set out the performance of Accsys’ shares in more recent periods.

1 Represents annual bonus paid in cash in the period, relating to performance for the previous financial year.
2  Represents annual bonus awarded in form of Ordinary shares, relating to performance for the previous financial year.  
Shares are held in an Employment Benefit Trust and will fully transfer to the individual after a period of 1 year, assuming  
still employed or a good leaver and subject to regulation, for example the AIM rules.
3 Gordon Campbell passed away on 26 April 2014.
4 Sue Farr and Sean Christie were appointed to the Board on 27 November 2014.
5  Benefit from Employee Share Plan reflects the value attributable to the matching share received under the plan, one  
year following investment by the individual.
6  The total figures have also been presented in Pounds Sterling in order to help provide a more relevant comparison  
between the two years as the majority of Directors’ remuneration, including 100% of the CEO’s remuneration is  
denominated in Sterling.
7 Sue Farr was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 19 November 2015 replacing Nick Meyer.
8  Paul Clegg received an increase in benefits from January 2016 to reflect additional travel costs following the move of  
the head office from Windsor to London.
Bonuses awarded in the form of cash and shares were determined by the Committee having taken into account of a 
broad range of financial and operational performance measures and also taking into account a degree of discretion, 
reflecting the longer-term and strategic objectives of the Company. Given the competitive nature of the Company’s 
sector these performance measures have been considered to be commercially sensitive and that comparable AIM 
companies are not subject to equivalent disclosure obligations and accordingly are not disclosed.
Pension entitlements relate to Company contributions to personal pension schemes. The Company does not 
operate any defined benefit pension scheme.

42 PART B: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out in this section of the Remuneration Report is effective for all 
payments made to Directors from 17 September 2015, being the date of the AGM in which it was approved. The 
policy remains as approved at the 2015 AGM. To assist the reader, the footnotes have been updated to explain how 
the policy is expected to be implemented.
 Remuneration policy
  The Company’s remuneration policy has been designed to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of 
the calibre required to deliver the business strategy. Individual remuneration packages are structured to align 
rewards with the performance of the Company and the interests of shareholders. The main principles are to:
• ensure that salaries are set at a market competitive level by benchmarking against appropriate 
external comparators,
• support high performance culture by rewarding upper quartile performance with upper quartile reward,
• maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and performance related pay,
• align long-term rewards with shareholders; and
• ensure that the overall package reflects market practice and takes account of remuneration elsewhere in  
the Group.
Policy Table 
Element and purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures 
Base salary
This is the core element 
of pay and reflects 
the individual’s role 
and position within 
the Group with some 
adjustment to reflect 
their capability and 
contribution.
Base salaries are reviewed against 
suitable external comparators, 
although the Committee does  
not strictly follow data but uses  
it as a reference point in 
considering, in its judgment,  
the appropriate level of salary 
having regard to other relevant 
factors including corporate and 
individual performance and any 
changes in an individual’s role  
and responsibilities. 
Base salary is paid monthly  
in cash.
In the normal course of events, 
the Executive Directors’ 
salaries would not normally 
be increased by more than 
the average awarded to staff 
generally and, in any event, 
no increase from current 
salary levels would be made 
that would take an Executive 
Directors’ salary above a limit 
of ¤400,000 p.a.
N/A
Benefits
To provide benefits 
valued by recipient.
Provide market competitive 
benefits in kind. Details of the 
benefits provided are set out in 
the section above. The Committee 
reserves discretion to introduce 
new benefits where it concludes 
that it is in the interests of Accsys 
to do so, having regard to the 
particular circumstances and to 
market practice. 
Where appropriate, the Company 
will meet certain costs relating to 
Executive Director relocations.
It is not possible to prescribe 
the likely change in the cost 
of insured benefits or the 
cost of some of the other 
reported benefits year-to-year, 
but the provision of benefits 
will operate within an annual 
limit of 20% of an Executive 
Director’s base salary (plus 
a further 100% in the case 
of relocations).

Annual Bonus Plan
To motivate employees 
and incentivise delivery 
of annual performance 
targets.
Annual bonus levels and the 
appropriateness of measures are 
reviewed annually to ensure they 
continue to support the strategy.
Annual bonus is delivered primarily 
in shares although the Committee 
proposes to pay annual bonuses 
substantially or entirely in cash once 
the business sustains a constant 
and steady level of working capital 
to support the Company’s growth 
strategy. 
Shares awarded as bonus vest one 
year after the date of award.
Share awards attract dividends, 
should the Company award any 
dividends.
To date, the annual bonus has 
operated on an uncapped ad 
hoc basis without a formal 
cap although the Committee 
has, in practice, remained 
within 120%. 
To comply with the legislation, 
a cap of 200% of base salary 
p.a. has been introduced but 
it should be particularly noted 
that this is not an aspiration.
The performance 
measures applied may be 
financial or non-financial 
and corporate, divisional 
or individual and in 
such proportions as the 
Committee considers 
appropriate. 
Attaining the threshold 
level of performance 
produces a nil pay-out.
The Committee retains 
discretion to adjust 
performance measures 
and targets during the 
year to take account 
of events outside of 
management control 
which were unforeseen 
when the measures 
and targets were 
originally set.
Long-Term Incentives
To motivate and 
incentivise delivery of 
sustained performance 
over the long-term, and 
to promote alignment 
with shareholders’ 
interests, the Group 
operates the Accsys 
Technologies 2013 Long-
Term Incentive Plan. 
Awards under the LTIP may be 
granted as nil-cost options.
Given the current absence of 
distributable reserves, it may not be 
possible to allot shares as fully paid 
so the Company reserves the right to 
require participants to pay par value 
and, in turn, allot further shares at par 
value which will generate a gain equal 
to the par value on shares subject to 
the award.
Malus provisions apply to unvested 
awards on the discovery of deficient 
performance, or alternatively, award 
cash bonuses to the equivalent amount.
Clawback of vested awards apply in 
the event of mis-booking of reserves, 
misstatement of earnings, censure 
by a regulatory authority or any 
other serious damage to Company 
reputation. 
Three types of awards can be granted:
•  Retention based awards, not subject 
to performance conditions but 
subject to continued employment 
for 3 years
•  Performance based awards, subject 
to performance conditions
•  Exceptional multiplier awards, 
subject to performance conditions 
which require the creation of 
significant value for shareholders
The LTIP allows for the grant 
of awards over up to 10% 
of issued share capital over 
a 10 year period (including 
outstanding awards under 
all other share plans but 
excluding shares issued in 
respect of annual bonus 
arrangements, any options 
or awards which have lapsed 
and any awards to be satisfied 
by shares purchased by an 
employees’ shares trust).
The Company will apply 
an internal limit such that 
no Executive Director will 
receive an award under the 
LTIP of more than 300% 
of base salary in any given 
financial year. In practice, 
the Company had not 
envisaged and continues not 
to envisage awards at even 
this level.
The Committee expressly 
reserves discretion to make 
such awards as it considers 
appropriate within these 
limits.
The Committee may 
set such performance 
conditions on LTIP 
awards as it considers 
appropriate (whether 
financial or non-financial 
and whether corporate, 
divisional or individual).
Once set, performance 
measures and targets 
will generally remain 
unaltered unless events 
occur which, in the 
Committee’s opinion, 
make it appropriate 
to substitute, vary or 
waive the performance 
conditions in such 
manner as the 
Committee thinks 
fit. Performance 
periods may be over 
such periods as the 
Committee selects 
at grant.
No less than 25% of 
awards vest for attaining 
the threshold level of 
performance conditions.

Employee Share Participation Plan
To encourage share 
ownership by employees, 
thereby allowing them 
to share in the long-term 
success of the Group and 
align their interests with 
those of the shareholders.
Executive Directors are able to 
participate in all-employee share 
plans on the same terms as other 
Group employees.
The Employee Share 
Participation Plan allows for 
individuals to subscribe for 
shares on two occasions 
during the year up to a limit 
of ¤5,000 per annum.
On each occasion a 
1:1 match for shares 
subscribed is offered 
subject to still being 
employed by the Company 
after one year.
Consistent with 
normal practice, 
such awards are not 
subject to performance 
conditions.
Chairman and Non-Executive  
Director fees
The fees paid to the Chairman 
and the fees of the other Non-
Executive Directors are set to 
be competitive with other listed 
companies of equivalent size and 
complexity.
Fee levels are periodically reviewed. 
The Company does not adopt 
a quantitative approach to pay 
positioning and exercises judgment 
as to what it considers to be 
reasonable in all the circumstances 
as regards quantum.
Fees are paid quarterly in cash.
Non-Executive Directors are not 
eligible to participate in incentive 
arrangements or receive pension 
provision or other benefits such as 
private medical insurance and life 
insurance.
The aggregate fees of 
the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors will 
not exceed ¤500,000 
(increased from ¤250,000) 
p.a. in aggregate.
The Company reserves the 
right to vary the structure 
of fees within this limit 
including, for example, 
introducing time-based 
fees or reflecting the 
establishment of new  
Board Committees.

Notes to the policy table
1. Annual bonus performance measures for year ended March 2017
As set out in Part 1, it is intended to operate the annual bonus plan more formally than it has previously been.
• Absent extraordinary exceptional circumstances, the bonus opportunity will operate within a normal cap of 100% of salary  
for each Executive Director (the formal cap in the shareholder approved policy of up to 200% of salary remains although we 
would not envisage exceeding 100% other than in extraordinary exceptional cases). 
• The awards are anticipated to be wholly satisfied in cash following the year-end although the option to substitute shares  
will be retained.
• Formal claw-back provisions have been introduced which permits recoupment within 3 years for an act of gross misconduct  
or if an error in the calculation/underlying assumptions is found.
For awards to be made in summer 2016 in respect of performance for the year ended 31 March 2016, which will be recorded in  
the year ending March 2017, the bonus has been determined by suitably challenging EBITDA targets subject to limited Committee 
discretion to adjust for changes in corporate strategy.
2. Performance conditions for LTIP awards in the year ending March 2017
It is expected that LTIP awards will be made in the summer of 2016 for the reasons set out in the section ‘Remuneration policy 
considerations for 2016’. It is expected that: 
• The award to the CEO will be over shares worth 100% of his then prevailing salary and over shares worth 50% of salary for 
other Executive Directors.
• Awards will be subject to a three year performance period (i.e. year end March 2019) and a further 2 year holding period.
• A malus/claw-back provision will be introduced. 
• 50% of the first awards will be subject to a relative TSR condition with 25% of that part vesting at median and 100% at  
upper quartile. The precise comparator group remains to be finalised but is likely to be a variant of the constituents of FTSE 
AIM companies.
• The other 50% will be subject to an EBITDA per share target. EBITDA has been selected over the more common EPS given  
the Company focus on EBITDA growth.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the policy table continued
3. Differences between the policy on remuneration for Directors from the policy on remuneration of other employees
Where Accsys’ pay policy for Directors differs to its pay policies for groups of employees, this reflects the appropriate market  
rate position for the relevant roles. 
4. Stating maximum amounts for the remuneration policy
The new UK regulations and related investor guidance encourages companies to disclose a cap within which each element of 
Remuneration Policy will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
5. Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised that 
corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or another) and business travel for Directors (and exceptionally their 
families) may technically come within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to 
authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
6. Employee Share Participation plan
While the Directors have participated in the Employee Share Participation plan in previous years, and it remains part of the formal 
policy, in practice the Directors do not participate in the plan.
Recruitment remuneration policy
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the 
appointment and promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill 
sets to deliver our strategic aims. However, as an external recruitment has not taken place for a considerable 
period of time, the preparation of this policy is challenging as it provides for an event which has not been the 
Company’s practice.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new 
Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee 
will be to apply the general policy for Executive Directors 
as set out above and structure a package in accordance 
with that policy. Consistent with the new UK regulations, 
the caps contained within the policy for fixed pay do not 
apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not 
envisage exceeding these caps in practice.
The annual bonus and long-term incentive compensation 
arrangements will operate (including the maximum award 
levels) as detailed in the general policy in relation to 
any newly appointed Executive Director. For an internal 
appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect 
of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or 
be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
expenses as it considers appropriate. 
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make 
additional awards in connection with the recruitment to  
buy-out awards forfeited by the individual on leaving a 
previous employer. 
For the avoidance of doubt, buy-out awards are not subject 
to a formal cap. Any recruitment-related awards which are 
not buy-outs will be subject to the limits for incentive pay as 
stated in the general policy.
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is, in 
the view of the Committee, necessary and will in all cases 
seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such awards under 
the terms of the existing incentive pay structure. It may, 
however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out 
awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing 
annual and equity-based pay structures. Details of any 
recruitment-related awards will be appropriately disclosed.
All buy-outs, whether under the annual bonus plan, LTIP or 
otherwise, will take account of the service obligations and 
performance requirements for any remuneration relinquished 
by the individual when leaving a previous employer. The 
Committee will seek to make buy-outs subject to what are, 
in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect of, service 
and performance. However, the Committee may choose to 
relax this requirement in certain cases (such as where the 
service and/or performance requirements are materially 
completed), and where the Committee considers it to be in 
the interests of shareholders, or where such factors are, in the 
view of the Committee, reflected in some other way, such as a 
significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited.
A new Non-Executive Director would be recruited on the terms explained above in respect of the main policy for 
such Directors.
Remuneration Report continued
46 Potential rewards under different scenarios
The charts below show the potential pay-out under the proposed arrangements for each Executive Director under 
different scenarios.
Notes:
1  Fixed pay out reflects basic salaries, benefits in kind and pension allowances in place at the start of the year ending 31 March 2017. 
2  The threshold pay-out levels are based upon the actual performance against the targets as measured based upon the results for 
the year ended 31 March 2016. The maximum is based on a payment of 100%, being the maximum target (noting the policy allows 
for a 200% cap which remains in place in exceptional circumstances rather than representing a realistic estimate).
3  No new options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2016. New options are expected to be granted in the year ended 
31 March 2017 as set out in the introduction to the Remuneration Report. The graphs above reflects that options previously 
granted under the LTIP plan in the year ended 31 March 2014 are expected to vest (in whole or in part) and become exercisable  
in the year ended 31 March 2017, being the first options to vest since the CEO joined the group in 2009.
  Threshold in the above graphs assumes full vesting of Element A with Element B vesting at threshold levels and nil vesting of 
Element C. Maximum in the graph above assumes full vesting of Elements A, B and C.
Directors’ service contracts
The Company’s general approach on recruiting a new Executive Director would be to follow the terms of the 
contracts of Mr Pauli and Mr Rudge. However, it is difficult to be definitive regarding a currently unforeseen event and 
the Company reserves the right to introduce a longer initial notice period (of up to 2 years) reducing over time.
Executive Director service contracts, which do not contain expiry dates, provide that compensation provisions for 
termination without notice will only extend to salary, certain fixed benefits and pension. In the case of William Rudge 
and Hans Pauli such sums may be paid in instalments and cease if the individual finds an alternative role. 
Following a change of control, if the Company terminates Paul Clegg’s employment in breach of or in accordance 
with the terms of his service contract or if Paul Clegg terminates the employment in response to a fundamental 
breach of contract by the Company or in accordance with the terms of his service contract, then he will be entitled 
to a termination payment comprising 12 months base pay and benefits, plus an amount in respect of bonus of at least 
the level of the average of historic bonus levels (or a higher discretionary amount awarded in respect of Company 
and personal performance in the financial year of termination), unpaid expenses and the value of accrued holiday 
entitlement.

Paul Clegg 2 September 2009 12
Hans Pauli 1 March 2010 6

Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to accept (and retain the fees from) outside 
appointments on external boards as long as these are not deemed to interfere with the business of the Group.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Remuneration Report continued
Termination policy summary
In practice, the facts surrounding any termination do not always fit neatly into defined categories for good or 
bad leavers. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Committee to consider the suitable treatment on a termination 
having regard to all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at that time. This policy applies both to any 
negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and any treatment which the Committee may choose to apply 
under the discretions available to it under the terms of the annual bonus and LTIP plans. The potential treatments 
on termination under these plans are summarised below.
Incentives Good leaver
If a leaver is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’;  
i.e. leaving through redundancy, retirement,  
ill health, disability or death, sale of part of  
the Group or otherwise at the discretion  
of the Remuneration Committee
Bad leaver
If a leaver is deemed  
to be a ‘bad leaver’;  
typically voluntary 
resignation or leaving  
or disciplinary reasons
Exceptional events 
For example change in control  
or winding up of the Company 
Annual bonus Pro-rated bonus. Pro-rating to reflect only the 
period worked. Performance metrics determined 
by the Remuneration Committee.
Annual bonus awarded in shares,but still held in the 
Employee Benefit Trust for a year, will fully vest.
No awards made Either the annual bonus will continue 
for the year or there will be a pro-rated 
bonus. Performance metrics determined 
by the Remuneration Committee
LTIP Will receive a pro-rated award subject to the 
application of the performance conditions at the 
normal measurement date. 
All awards will  
normally lapse 
Awards vest after taking into account 
both the application of the performance 
conditions at the date of the event and the 
period of time served (other than in the 
respect of retention based awards) 
The Company has power to enter into settlement agreements with Executives and to pay compensation to settle 
potential legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of termination of an Executive 
Director, the Company may pay a contribution towards the individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as 
part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For 
the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
Non-Executive Directors’ contracts
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and 
responsibilities. Appointment is for a fixed term of three years, terminable by three months’ notice on either side.

Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
As explained in the general policy section of the Remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account Group-
wide pay and employment conditions. The Committee reviews the average Group-wide base salary increase and 
bonus costs and is responsible for all discretionary and all-employee share arrangements.
Consistent with normal practice, the Committee did not consult with employees in preparing the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy.
Consideration of shareholders’ views
Each year the Committee takes into account the approval levels of remuneration related matters at our annual general 
meeting in determining that the current Directors’ remuneration policy remains appropriate for the Company.
The Committee seeks to build an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the 
remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes to the Company’s executive pay 
arrangements in particular.
48 Corporate Governance
Details of the Company’s corporate governance arrangements are set out below. The Board of Directors 
acknowledges the importance of the Principles set out in The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council. Neither the 2010 or 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code are compulsory for AIM 
listed or Euronext listed companies. The Board has applied the principles as far as practicable and appropriate for  
a relatively small public company.
The Board of Directors
During the period the Board comprised a Non-Executive Chairman, three Non-Executive Directors and three 
Executive Directors. 
The Board meets regularly and is responsible for strategy, performance, approval of major capital projects and 
the framework of internal controls. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate 
and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to all Directors in advance of Board meetings. All Directors 
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. The appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole. In addition, procedures are in place to enable the Directors to obtain 
independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
During the year, all serving Directors attended the quarterly Board meetings that were held. In addition to the 
scheduled meetings there is frequent contact between all the Directors in connection with the Company’s business 
including Audit and Nomination and Remuneration committee meetings which are held as required, but as a 
minimum twice per annum.
Directors are subject to re-election by the shareholders at Annual General Meetings. The Articles of Association 
provide that Directors will be subject to re-election at the first opportunity after their appointment and the Board 
submit to re-election at intervals of three years.
Day to day operating decisions are made by the Senior Management Team of which the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Executive Director, Corporate Development and Finance Director are members. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consisted of Sean Christie (Chairman), Patrick Shanley, Nick Meyer and Sue Farr. The Audit 
Committee meets at least twice a year and is responsible for monitoring compliance with accounting and legal 
requirements and for reviewing the annual and interim financial statements prior to their submission for approval by 
the Board. The Committee also discusses the scope of the audit and its findings and considers the appointment and 
fees of the external auditors. The Audit Committee continues to believe that it is not currently appropriate for the 
Company to maintain a dedicated internal audit function due to its size.
The Audit Committee considers the independence and objectivity of the external auditors on an annual basis, 
with particular regard to non-audit services. The non-audit fees are considered by the Board not to affect the 
independence or objectivity of the auditors. The Audit Committee monitors such costs in the context of the audit 
fee for the period, ensuring that the value of non-audit service does not increase to a level where it could affect 
the auditors’ objectivity and independence. The Board also receives an annual confirmation of independence 
from the auditors.
Nominations & Remuneration Committee
The Nominations and Remuneration Committee consists of Sue Farr (Chairman, following appointment on 
19 November 2015), Patrick Shanley, Sean Christie and Nick Meyer. The Committee’s role is to consider and approve 
the nomination of Directors and the remuneration and benefits of the Executive Directors, including the award of 
share options and bonus share awards. In framing the Company’s remuneration policy, the Nominations  
& Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to Section D of The UK Corporate Governance Code.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Corporate Governance continued
Internal Financial Control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company’s system of internal financial control and 
places importance on maintaining a strong control environment. The key procedures which the Directors have 
established with a view to providing effective internal financial control are as follows:
• the Company’s organisational structure has clear lines of responsibility;
• the Company prepares a comprehensive annual budget that is approved by the Board. Monthly results are reported 
against the budget and variances are closely monitored by the Directors; and
• the Board is responsible for identifying the major business risks faced by the Company and for determining the 
appropriate courses of action to manage those risks.
The Directors recognise, however, that such a system of internal financial control can only provide reasonable,  
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority.
There is regular dialogue with shareholders including presentations after the Company’s preliminary announcement 
of the year-end results and six monthly results. The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with 
investors and welcomes their participation. The Chairman aims to ensure that the Directors are available at Annual 
General Meetings to answer questions.

The attendance of individual Directors at meetings of the Board and its committees in the year under review was

certain routine matters such as the issue of shares in respect of the Employee Share Scheme.
50 Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
English company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit  
or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and the applicable UK Accounting Standards is insufficient to enable users to understand  
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the financial position  
and financial performance.
In preparing both the Group and the Company financial statements, suitable accounting policies have been used 
and applied consistently, and reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made. Applicable 
accounting standards have been followed. The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis 
as disclosed in the Statutory Information section of the Directors’ Report and Business Review. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the  
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 30 and 31 of this annual report, confirm that:
• to the best of their knowledge, the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group;
• to the best of their knowledge, the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of principal risks and uncertainties that it 
faces; and
• they consider the annual report, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Accsys Technologies PLC’s Group 
financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2016 and of its loss and cash 
flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements (the ‘Annual 
Report’), comprise:
• the consolidated statement of financial position as at 
31 March 2016;
• the consolidated statement of other comprehensive 
income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of cash flow for the year 
then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for 
the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, and applicable law.
In applying the financial reporting framework, 
the Directors have made a number of subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they 
have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements; and
• the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement set out page 49 and 50 with respect to 
internal control and risk management systems and 
about share capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to  
report by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of 
Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, a corporate governance 
statement has not been prepared by the parent 
Company. We have no exceptions to report arising  
from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 51, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a  
true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared 
for and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Group Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the Members of Accsys Technologies PLC
54 What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK 
& Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing 
the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and 
other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw 
conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or 
a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of Accsys Technologies PLC for 
the year ended 31 March 2016 and on the information in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow 
for the year ended 31 March 2016

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention (except for certain 
financial instruments and equity investments which are measured at fair value), in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as endorsed by the 
European Union, interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their financial statements under adopted IFRS. 
Going Concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future, and at least 12 months from the date these financial statements 
are approved.
As part of the Group’s going concern review, the Directors have reviewed the Group’s trading forecasts and 
working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. These forecasts indicate that, in order to continue as a 
going concern, the Group is dependent on the achievement of certain operating performance measures relating to 
the production and sales of Accoya
®
 wood from the plant in Arnhem and the collection of on-going working capital 
items in line with internally agreed budgets. 
The Directors have considered the internally agreed budgets and performance measures and believe that 
appropriate controls and procedures are in place or will be in place to make sure that these are met. The Directors 
believe that while some uncertainty inherently remains in achieving the budget, in particular in relation to market 
conditions outside of the Group’s control, that there are a sufficient number of alternative actions and measures 
that can be taken in order to achieve the Group’s medium and long-term objectives.
Therefore the Directors believe that the going concern basis is the most appropriate on which to prepare the 
financial statements.
Changes in accounting policies
No new accounting standards, amendments or interpretations have been adopted in the period which have any 
impact on these financial statements. 
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall outside the ordinary activities of the Group and which by 
virtue of their size or incidence, have been separately disclosed in order to improve a reader’s understanding 
of the financial statements. These include items relating to the restructuring of a significant part of the Group, 
impairment losses (or the reversal of previously recorded exceptional impairments), expenditure relating to the 
integration and implementation of significant acquisitions and other one-off events or transactions. See note 5 
for details of exceptional items.
Business combinations
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of 
another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated 
financial statements present the results of the Group as if they formed a single entity. Inter-company transactions 
and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. 
In the consolidated statement of financial position, the acquirer’s identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent 
liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the date on which control is obtained.
As allowed under IFRS 1, some business combinations effected prior to transition to IFRS, were accounted for using 
the merger method of accounting. Under this method, assets and liabilities are included in the consolidation at 
their book values, not fair values, and any differences between the cost of investment and net assets acquired were 
taken to the merger reserve. The majority of the merger reserve arose from a corporate restructuring in the year 
ended 31 March 2006 which introduced Accsys Technologies PLC as the new holding company.
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ending 31 March 2016
60 Joint ventures
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and shares joint control over 
strategic, financial and operating decisions with one or more other ventures under a contractual arrangement. The 
Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income, expenditure and cash flows of such jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using the equity method. The equity method records the Group’s share of the results of the joint 
venture entity on a separate line in the Group’s financial statements.
The total carrying values of investments in joint ventures represent the cost of each investment including the carrying 
value of any goodwill, the share of post-acquisition retained earnings, any other movements in reserves and any long-
term debt interests which in substance form part of the Group’s net investment. The carrying values of joint ventures 
are reviewed on a regular basis and if an impairment in value has occurred, the carrying value is impaired in the period 
in which the relevant circumstances are identified. The Group’s share of a joint venture’s losses in excess of its interest 
in that associate is not recognised unless the Group has an obligation to fund such losses.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is 
no evidence of impairment.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the Group and that the revenue can be reliably measured. The 
following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised.
 Manufacturing revenue
  Revenue is recognised in respect of the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the goods have been passed to the buyer, the timing of which is dependent on the particular shipment terms. 
When a customer provides untreated wood to be processed by the Group in order to produce Accoya
®
, revenue 
is recognised when the Group’s obligations under the relevant customer contract have been substantially 
completed, which is before the finished Accoya has been collected by the customer. Manufacturing revenue 
includes the sale of Accoya wood and other revenue, principally relating to the sale of acetic acid.
 Licensing fees and Marketing income
  Licence fee and marketing income is recognised over the period of the relevant agreements according to the 
specific terms of each agreement or the quantities and/or values of the licensed product sold. The accounting 
policy for the recognition of licence fees is based upon an assessment of the work required before the licence 
is signed and subsequently during the design, construction and commissioning of the licensees’ plant, with an 
appropriate proportion of the fee recognised upon signing and the balance recognised as the project progresses 
to completion. Marketing revenue when the Company acts as principal is recognised based on the actual work 
completed in the period. The amount of any cash or billings received but not recognised as income is included in 
the financial statements as deferred income and shown as a liability.
Finance income
Interest accrues using the effective interest method, i.e. the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Finance expense
Finance expenses include the fees associated with the Group’s credit facilities which are expensed over the period 
which the Group has access to the facilities. 
Finance expenses also include an allocation of finance charges in respect of the sale and leaseback of the Arnhem 
land and buildings, and the lease of London Office fit out and furniture, accounted for as a finance lease. The total 
finance charge (calculated as the difference between the total minimum lease payments and the liability at the 
inception of the lease) is allocated over the life of the lease using the sum-of-digits method.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ending 31 March 2016
1. Accounting Policies continued
Share based payments
The Company awards share options and nil cost options to acquire shares of the Company to certain Directors 
and employees. The Company also awards bonuses to certain Directors and employees in the form of the award of 
deferred shares of the Company. 
In addition the Company operated an Employee Share Participation Plan under which employees subscribe for new 
shares which are held by a trust for the benefit of the subscribing employees. The Shares are released to employees 
after one year, together with an additional, matching share on a 1 for 1 basis.
The fair value of options, deferred shares and matching shares granted are recognised as an employee expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
options or shares. 
The fair value of share options granted is measured using a modified Black Scholes model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted 
to reflect the actual number of share options that vest only where vesting is dependent upon the satisfaction of 
service and non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is 
based on the number of options which eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of 
the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when 
paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Pensions
The Group contributes to certain defined contribution pension and employee benefit schemes on behalf of its 
employees. These costs are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on an accruals basis.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current 
tax includes the expected impact of claims submitted by the Group to tax authorities in respect of enhanced tax 
relief for expenditure on research and development.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are 
not provided for:
• the initial recognition of goodwill,
• the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a 
business combination, and 
• differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
62 Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (the functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, 
the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in Euro, which is the functional currency of 
the parent Company, and the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average monthly exchange rates prevailing in the month in which the transaction took place. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and the foreign currency 
translation reserve.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be 
received and the Group will comply with the attached conditions. When the grant relates to an expense item, it 
is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is 
intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset they are credited to a deferred income account and 
released to the statement of comprehensive income over the expected useful life of the relevant asset on a straight 
line basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is the difference between the fair value of the 
consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. It is capitalised, and is 
subject to annual impairment reviews by the Directors. Any impairment arising is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income. Where the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is greater than the 
fair value of consideration paid, the resulting amount is treated as a gain on a bargain purchase and has been 
recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets
Intellectual property rights, including patents, which cover a portfolio of novel processes and products, are shown 
in the financial statements at cost less accumulated amortisation and any amounts by which the carrying value 
is assessed during an annual review to have been impaired. At present, the useful economic life of the intellectual 
property is considered to be 20 years. 
Internal development costs are incurred as part of the Group’s activities including new processes, process 
improvements, identifying new species and improving the Group’s existing products. Research costs are expensed 
as incurred. Development costs are capitalised when all of the criteria set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ (including 
criteria concerning technical feasibility, ability and intention to use or sell, ability to generate future economic 
benefits, ability to complete the development and ability to reliably measure the expenditure) have been met.  
These internal development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life, between  
10 and 20 years.

1. Accounting Policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charged. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset as well as costs of bringing the asset to the working condition and 
location of its intended use. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual 
value of each asset, except freehold land, over its expected useful life on a straight line basis, as follows:
Plant and machinery   These assets comprise pilot plants and production facilities. These facilities are 
depreciated from the date they become available for use at rates applicable to 
the asset lives expected for each class of asset, with rates between 5% and 20%.
Office equipment  Between 20% and 50%.
Leased land and buildings Land held under a finance lease is depreciated over the life of the lease.
Freehold land   Freehold land is not depreciated.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amount of the non-current non-financial assets of the Group is compared to the recoverable 
amount of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be 
recoverable, or in the case of goodwill, annually. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less cost to sell. In assessing the value in use, the expected future cash flows from the assets are determined 
by applying a discount rate to the anticipated pre-tax future cash flows. An impairment charge is recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets’ recoverable 
amount. The revised carrying amounts are amortised or depreciated in line with Group accounting policies. A 
previously recognised impairment loss, other than on goodwill, is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as 
a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted in the impairment. This reversal is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net 
of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units) for purposes of assessing impairment. 
Leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to 
the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance expenses and reduction of lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. 
Inventories
Raw materials, which consist of unprocessed timber and chemicals used in manufacturing operations are valued at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. The basis on which cost is derived is a first-in, first-out basis.
Finished goods, comprising processed timber, are stated at the lower of weighted average cost of production or 
net realisable value. Costs include direct materials, direct labour costs and production overheads (excluding the 
depreciation/depletion of relevant property and plant and equipment) absorbed at an appropriate level of capacity 
utilisation. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all expected costs to completion and costs 
to be incurred in selling and distribution.
64 Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as cash and cash equivalents, available for sale investments and loans and receivables, 
depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are 
measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value, through profit or loss directly attributable 
transaction costs. 
Except where a reliable fair value cannot be obtained, unlisted shares held by the Group are classified as available 
for sale investments and are stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity, with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where an 
investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the 
profit or loss in the year. Where it is not possible to obtain a reliable fair value, these investments are held at cost 
less provision for impairment.
Loans and receivables, which comprise non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determinable payments that 
are not quoted on an active market are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method, less provision for impairment.
 Trade and other receivables
  These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an 
active market. They arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers. Trade receivables 
are initially recognised at fair value less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. A provision for impairment 
is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect debts. Bad debts are written 
off when identified.
 Cash and cash equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-
term deposits, including liquidity funds, with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the 
statement of consolidated cash flow, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities 
 Other financial liabilities
  Trade payables and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the 
definition of a financial liability. The Group’s shares are classified as equity instruments.
Segmental Reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief 
Executive. The Chief Executive is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions.

2. Accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management has to make judgements on how to apply the 
Group’s accounting policies and make estimates about the future. The critical judgments that have been made in 
arriving at the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the key sources of estimation and 
uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
in the next financial year are discussed below:
 Revenue recognition
  The Group has considered the criteria for the recognition of fee income from licensees over the period of the 
agreement and is satisfied that the recognition of such revenue is appropriate. The recognition of fees is based 
upon an assessment of the work required before the licence is signed and subsequently during the construction 
and commissioning of the licensees’ plant, with an appropriate proportion of the fee recognised upon signing 
and the balance recognised as the project progresses to completion. The Group also considers the recoverability 
of amounts before recognising them as income.
 Goodwill
  The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting 
policy stated above. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value 
in use calculations. These calculations require the use of judgements in relation to discount rates and future 
forecasts (see note 16). The recoverability of these balances is dependent upon the level of future licence fees 
and manufacturing revenues. While the scope and timing of the production facilities to be built under the 
Group’s existing and future agreements remains uncertain, the Directors remain confident that revenue from 
own manufacturing, existing licensees, new licence or consortium agreements will be generated, demonstrating 
the recoverability of these balances.
 Intellectual property rights and property, plant and equipment
  The Group tests the carrying amount of the intellectual property rights and property, plant and equipment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable. These 
calculations require the use of estimates in respect of future cash flows from the assets by applying a discount 
rate to the anticipated pre-tax future cash flows. The Group also reviews the estimated useful lives at the end of 
each annual reporting period (see note 16 & 17). The price of the Accoya wood and the raw materials and other 
inputs vary according to market conditions outside of the Group’s control. Should the price of the raw materials 
increase greater than the sales price or in a way which no longer makes Accoya competitive, then the carrying 
value of the property, plant and equipment or IPR may be in doubt and become impaired. The Directors 
consider that the current market and best estimates of future prices mean that this risk is limited.
 Inventories
  The Group reviews the net realisable value of, and demand for, its inventory on a monthly basis to provide 
assurance that recorded inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after taking into account 
the age and condition of inventory (see note 21).
 Available for sale investments
  The Group has an investment in unlisted equity shares carried at nil value. The investment is valued at cost less 
any impairment as a reliable fair value cannot be obtained since there is no active market for the shares and 
there is currently uncertainty around the future funding of the business. The Group makes appropriate enquiries 
and considers all of the information available to it in order to assess whether any impairment has occurred  
(see note 18).
66 New standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective at the date of authorisation of these financial statements:
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have 
not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet 
been adopted by the EU). 
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
• IFRS 10 (amendments) ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
• IFRS 11 (amendments) ‘Joint arrangements’ 
• IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory deferral accounts’ 
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
• IAS 1 (amendments) ‘presentation of financial statements’ 
• IAS 7 (amendments) ‘Cash flow statements’ 
• IAS 12 (amendments) ‘Income taxes’

• IAS 27 (amendments) ‘Separate financial statements’
• IAS 28 (amendments) ‘Associates and joint ventures’
• IAS 38 (amendments) ‘Intangible assets’
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.

4. Other operating costs
Other operating costs consist of the operating costs, other than the cost of sales, associated with the operation of 
the plant in Arnhem and the offices in Dallas and London (previously Windsor):

Other operating costs 3,554 2,395
Administration costs 6,628 6,719
Exceptional Items – 2,937
18,460 18,922
During the period, ¤420,000 (2015: ¤201,000) of development costs were capitalised and included in intangible 
fixed assets, including ¤282,000 (2015: ¤nil) which were capitalised within Tricoya Technologies Limited (‘TTL’). In 
addition ¤367,000 of internal costs have been capitalised and are included within tangible fixed assets in relation to 
the expansion of our plant in Arnhem, the Netherlands (2015: ¤nil).
Total operating costs (excluding exceptional items) have increased by ¤2,475,000. However this includes a total of 
¤1,666,000 of consolidated operating costs incurred by TTL in the current year, which were previously reported 
separately under the share of joint venture loss (2015: share of loss was ¤1.1m) (see note 9).
Other operating costs largely relate to costs associated with the Group’s manufacturing office in the Netherlands, 
excluding research & development costs.
Administration costs also include the costs associated with the Group’s head office in London (previously Windsor), 
the US office in Dallas together with business development and management costs.
Exceptional costs in the prior year relate to the arbitration with Diamond Wood (see note 5).
5. Exceptional items
Exceptional items were recorded in previous periods as follows:
On 25 July 2014 Accsys announced that the arbitration tribunal (the ‘Tribunal’) appointed in relation to the dispute 
between Accsys and Diamond Wood China Limited (‘Diamond Wood’) had issued its award. In response to 
Diamond Wood’s claim against Accsys, namely for damages in excess of ¤140 million as previously published by 
Diamond Wood, and for the continuation of the Licence Agreement, the Tribunal ruled that Diamond Wood could 
only claim for limited damages (if any) up to a maximum of ¤0.3m. However, the Tribunal also ruled that the licence 
agreement between the two parties is to continue. In addition the Tribunal issued a final award in respect of costs 
payable to Diamond Wood as well as any remaining own legal costs. The exceptional item reported in the financial 
year to 31 March 2015 therefore represents the final amounts paid in respect of the above arbitration with Diamond 
Wood of ¤2.9m. 
In addition there was also an exceptional item gain of ¤267,000 recorded relating to the acquisition of the 
remaining 50% of Tricoya Technologies Limited in the prior period (see note 9).

9. Joint venture and business combination – Tricoya Technologies Limited
Tricoya Technologies Limited (‘TTL’), was incorporated in order to develop and exploit Accsys’ Tricoya
®
 technology 
for use within the worldwide panel products market estimated to be worth more than ¤60 billion annually. 
During the previous period and up until 31 March 2015, TTL operated as a 50:50 joint venture with Ineos and TTL 
was accounted for using the equity method reflecting that it was a joint venture. 
On 31 March 2015 Accsys acquired Ineos’s 50% equity interest as part of terms which included the termination of 
the joint venture agreement and for consideration of ¤1. Therefore as at 31 March 2015, Accsys owned 100% of the 
share capital of TTL and its balance sheet has been fully consolidated from 31 March 2015. An exceptional gain of 
¤267,000 was recorded in the prior year as a gain on acquisition of subsidiary due to this bargain purchase.
In February 2016 BP’s participation in the proposed consortium (the ‘Consortium’) to fund, build and operate the 
world’s first Tricoya
®
 wood elements acetylation plant was announced. Accsys and BP Ventures (‘BPV’) agreed 
initial funding in respect of the Consortium, with BPV acquiring an initial 3% equity interest in Tricoya Technologies 
Limited (‘TTL’), implying a valuation of TTL at ¤35 million today. The plant is expected to be located at the Saltend 
Chemicals Park in Hull, UK, adjacent to BP’s existing acetyls facility.
BPV’s on-going participation in the Consortium remains conditional upon the full Consortium being finalised later this 
calendar year. The Consortium is also expected to include Medite, part of the Medite Smartply group and Accsys’s 
historic joint development partner. Medite has received Board approval in principle to invest in the Consortium and to 
enter a long-term offtake commitment for up to nearly half of the Tricoya plant’s initial annual capacity.
The Hull plant will have an initial capacity of 30,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) (sufficient to manufacture 40,000m
3
 
of panels) and scope to expand. Approximately 60% of the plant’s output is expected to be sold under committed 
take-or-pay agreements with Medite and Masisa; cash flow break-even is at approximately 40% capacity. The plant 
is expected to cost approximately ¤61m, with a further approximately ¤15m required for continued market seeding, 
marketing, IP development and engineering functions to cash breakeven. 
72 BP and Medite are together expected to invest approximately ¤30m and up to ¤20m is expected to be provided 
from bank debt, which is possible as a result of a committed offtake agreement from Medite. Accsys contribution  
is substantially in the form of intellectual property and the development of the Tricoya business to date such that 
our remaining contribution is expected to be limited to approximately ¤1m and our on-going provision of Accoya  
as market seeding material as we have been since 2011. 
The balance of approximately ¤25m is expected to be contributed by the final consortium members and TTL 
has engaged Opus Corporate Finance LLP to advise in this respect. As a result, Accsys is expected to retain a 
substantial interest in the consortium, reflective of the substantial investment we have made in respect of the 
Tricoya technology and market development over many years.
The formation of the Consortium remains conditional upon detailed agreements being finalised between the 
parties including the third party debt and equity finance. However we are confident that the substantial progress 
made over the last year by the Consortium will lead to the completion later this year, with the Tricoya plant being 
operational in 2018. 
During the period ended 31 March 2016, TTL has been fully consolidated and the results are included as part of the 
overall Group results and included within the Business Development and Research and Development segments as 
set out in note 3.

The weighted average number of shares has been represented for all periods to take account of the 5 to 1 share 
consolidation which became effective on 12th September 2014.
15. Share based payments
The Group operates a number of share schemes which give rise to a share based payment charge. The Group 
operates a Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) in order to reward members of the senior management team and the 
Executive Directors. As part of the award of nil costs options under the LTIP, the recipients relinquished all share 
options that they held which had been awarded under the 2005 and 2008 Share Option plans. Other employees 
continue to hold options awarded under these earlier schemes.
In addition, the Group operated an Employee Share Participation Plan, which is available to all employees, and also 
makes annual awards under the Employee Benefit Trust. Details of all these schemes are given below.
Options – total
The following figures take into account options awarded under the LTIP in the period together with share options 
awarded in previous years under the 2005 and 2008 Share Option schemes.

The exercise price of options outstanding at the end of the year ranged between ¤nil (for LTIP options) and ¤12.90 
(2015: ¤nil and ¤12.90) and their weighted average contractual life was 6.9 years (2015: 7.9 years).
Of the total number of options outstanding at the end of the year, 124,555 (2015: 77,057) had vested and were 
exercisable at the end of the year. 20,000 options were exercised in the current year (2015: nil). 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
In the 2014 financial year, the Group established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, the participants of which are key 
members of the management team. The establishment of the LTIP was approved by the shareholders at the AGM in 
September 2013. 
A prerequisite of participation in the LTIP was for the management team to agree to the cancellation of their entire 
outstanding share options, providing the Company with a 5% reduction in the level of dilution to make the new 
awards. A cancellation was agreed as the most appropriate action as it would focus the management team on the 
new LTIP and not on historical awards or arrangements. Details of the share options cancelled upon implementation 
of the LTIP in September 2013 (previously awarded under the 2005 and 2008 Share Option schemes) are set out 
further below.
 LTIP overview
  Under the LTIP, awards can be granted on a discretionary basis to key members of the management team. In 2013, 
an initial ‘one off’ grant was made in order to focus the management team on the growth of the Company over the 
next three years. Awards were granted in the form of nil-cost options and consist of the following ‘elements’:
Element Objective Description
A Retention based award 
to lock-in executives 
who have contributed to 
the turnaround
In consideration to agreeing to the cancellation of the participant’s existing 
options, a proportion of the new share award vests on continuity of 
employment over the next three years.
To ensure there is no value shift to the participants via the cancellation, this 
element requires an additional three years of services from the participant 
and will be forfeited if the share price at the end of the performance period 
is below ¤0.65.
B Performance based  
share award
This element aligns the participant to the future success of the Company 
by linking the level of vesting to EBITDA and share price growth against 
the constituents of the MSCI Europe Index (or another other broad based 
European index as deemed appropriate by the Remuneration Committee).
C Exceptional performance 
multiplier
This element ensures that if significant value is created for shareholders 
then participants will be entitled to receive an appropriate proportion of 
this value.

 Performance conditions
  Awards granted under the LTIP are subject to continued employment and satisfaction of the performance 
conditions. Performance will be measured at the end of a three year performance period for each Element. 
  Element A – Vesting is contingent upon continued employment for three years and share price not falling below 
¤0.65 at the end of the performance period.
 Element B – Measured against two equally weighted performance conditions:
Threshold Target Maximum
EBITDA  
(50% of Element B)

 Note:

 Element C – This element vests in full if the share price is at or above ¤1.30 at the end of the performance period.
 Awards made in September 2013
  Immediately following the establishment of the new LTIP in September 2013, awards were made to members of 
the management team. A total of 4,278,630 nil cost options were awarded. 1,593,331 were allocated as Element 
A, 1,837,572 as Element B and 847,727 were allocated as Element C. At the same time, a total of 4,456,229 of 
old options were cancelled. As at 31 March 2016, 175,174 options had been forfeited due to one leaver during the 
period. All other recipients were still employed by the Group as at 31 March 2016.
  Element A was designed to recognise the contribution made by individuals to the turnaround of the Company and 
the cancellation of the existing options was a prerequisite for participation in the LTIP. The quantum of Element 
A for each participant was linked to the expected value of the existing options which were cancelled where there 
was a reasonable probability of pay out. As a result, under IFRS 2, the award of Element A was accounted for as 
a modification of the existing share options and as the award was designed to avoid any transfer of value, the 
resulting share based payment charge is the same as if the existing options had not been cancelled.
  Elements B and C have been accounted for as new awards with the fair value calculated based on a modified 
Black-Scholes model assuming inputs described below:

options were outstanding at an exercise price of ¤9.90.
  Options granted on 8 December 2008 vest to one third of the options granted upon achievement of each of  
the following:

  Once vested these options may be exercised until 8 December 2018. At 31 March 2016, 37,110 (2015: 37,110) of 
these options were outstanding at an exercise price of ¤4.85.
  Options granted on 27 July 2010 were partially exchanged in the period for new awards issued under the LTIP. 
30% of the options vest on achievement of median TSR. Once vested, these options may be exercised until 27 
July 2020. Full vesting of the options granted occurs upon achievement of upper quartile TSR measured over 
the three year period. At 31 March 2016, 164,321 (2015: 164,321) of these options were outstanding at an exercise 
price of ¤1.20.
  Options granted on 1 August 2011 were partially exchanged in the period for new awards issued under the

2005 and 2008 Share Option schemes continued
TSR is measured on a relative basis compared to the FTSE Small Cap index over a three year period from grant 
date. Unless discretion is exercised by the Nomination & Remuneration Committee, all options are forfeit following 
an option holder’s termination of contract.
No options were granted under the 2005 or 2008 Share Option schemes in the current or previous period.
The fair value of share options granted under the 2005 and 2008 Share Option Schemes during the previous years 
was calculated based on a modified Black-Scholes model assuming inputs shown below for more recent awards:
Grant date August 2011 July 2010

Expected volatility 85% 60%

Fair value of option ¤0.200 ¤0.532
The figures in the table and notes above have been adjusted to reflect the 5 for 1 share consolidation which 
became effective on 12 September 2014. Volatility was estimated by reference to the historic volatility since 
October 2005 when the Company’s shares were listed on AIM. The resulting fair value is expensed over the 
vesting period of the options on the assumption that a proportion of options will lapse over the service period  
as employees leave the Group.
Employee Benefit Trust – Share bonus award
Following a share issue on 6 July 2015, in connection with the employee remuneration and incentivisation 
arrangements for the period from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, 951,295 (2015: 783,597) new Ordinary shares were 
held by an Employee Benefit Trust, the beneficiaries of which are primarily the Executive Directors and Senior 
Managers. Such new Ordinary shares vest if the employees remain in employment with the Company at the vesting 
date, being 1 July 2016 (subject to certain other provisions including regulations, good-leaver, take-over and 
nomination and remuneration committee discretion provisions). As at 31 March 2016, the Employment Benefit Trust 
was consolidated by the Company and the 944,529 shares are recorded as Own Shares within equity. During the 
period, 746,241 Ordinary shares awarded in the prior year vested.
Employee Share Participation Plan
During the year, the Company continued to operate the Employee Share Participation Plan (the ‘Plan’) that was 
initiated in a prior year. The Plan was intended to promote the long-term growth and profitability of Accsys by 
providing employees with an opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in new Ordinary shares (‘Shares’) in the 
Company as an additional benefit of employment. 
Under the terms of the Plan, the Company issues these Shares to a trust for the benefit of the subscribing 
employees. The Shares are released to employees after one year, together with an additional Share on a 1 for 1 
matched basis provided the employee has remained in the employment of Accsys at that point in time (subject 
to good leaver provisions). The Plan is in line with industry approved employee share plans and was open for 
subscription by employees twice in the year following release of annual and half yearly financial results. The 
maximum amount available for subscription by any employee is ¤5,000 per annum.
During the year ended 31 March 2016 the plan was open for subscription twice. In July 2015 various employees 
subscribed for a total of 63,909 Shares at an acquisition price of ¤0.97 per Share. In December 2015 various 
employees subscribed for a total of 16,302 Shares at an acquisition price of ¤0.92 per Share. Also during the year, 
1 for 1 Matching shares were awarded in respect of subscriptions that were made in the previous year as a result of 
all participants continuing to remain in employment at the point of vesting. 27,825 Matching shares were issued to 
employees in July 2015 and 53,922 shares were issued in January 2016.

The carrying value of internal development costs, intellectual property rights and goodwill on consolidation are 
considered part of a single cash-generating unit which incorporates the manufacturing and licensing operations 
given the manufacturing reliance on IP of the Group. The recoverable amount of internal development costs, 
intellectual property rights and goodwill relating to this operation is determined based on a value in use calculation 
which uses cash flow projections based on Board approved financial budgets. Cash flows have been projected 
for a period of 10 years plus assumptions concerning a terminal value, corresponding with the expected minimum 
life of the intellectual property rights and based on a pre-tax discount rate of 20% per annum (2015: 20%). The 
key assumption used in the value in use calculations is the level of future licence fees and manufacturing revenues 
estimated by management over the budget period. These have been based on past experience and expected 
future revenues. The Directors have considered whether a reasonably possible change in assumptions may result in 
an impairment. An impairment would arise if the total volume of forecast Accoya manufactured is 95% lower than 
projected sales in future years.

Accsys Technologies PLC has previously purchased a total of 21,666,734 unlisted ordinary shares in Diamond Wood 
China. The carrying value of the investment is carried at cost less any provision for impairment, rather than at its fair 
value, as there is no active market for these shares, and there is significant uncertainty over the future of Diamond 
Wood, and as such a reliable fair value cannot be calculated. 
The historical cost of the unlisted shares held at 31 March 2016 is ¤10m (2015: ¤10m). However, a provision for the 
impairment of the entire balance of ¤10m continues to be recorded as at 31 March 2016 (see note 5).
19. Deferred Taxation
The Group has a deferred tax asset of ¤nil (2015: ¤nil) relating to trading losses brought forward.
The Group also has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of ¤23,167,000 (2015: ¤23,186,000) which is largely 
in respect of trading losses of the UK subsidiary. The deferred tax asset has not been recognised due to the 
uncertainty of the timing of future expected profits of the related legal entity which is dependent on the profits 
attributable to licensing and future manufacturing income.

The opening balance of the capital redemption reserve which represents the amounts transferred from share 
capital on redemption of deferred shares in a previous period. The movement in the current period reflects 
obligations arising from the investment by BP Ventures into Tricoya Technologies Limited and that BP Venture’s  
on-going participation is conditional upon the finalisation of the full proposed consortium.
The merger reserve arose prior to transition to IFRS when merger accounting was adopted.
The other reserve represents the amounts received for subsidiary share capital from non-controlling interests  
(see note 26).
In the prior year, on 31 March 2015, Accsys agreed to acquire the remaining 50% equity in Tricoya Technologies 
Limited from Ineos. As a result of this agreement and the termination of the joint venture agreement, all of the 
warrant instruments which had been executed in 2012 in favour of Ineos lapsed.
26. Transactions with non-controlling interests
On 3 February 2016, Tricoya Technologies Limited (‘TTL’) issued 500,000 Series A Preference shares for the 
consideration of ¤1m for 3% equity share capital of TTL. The carrying amount of the non-controlling interests in TTL 
on the date of acquisition was ¤71,000. The Group recognised an increase in other reserves as summarised below.

an operating lease. 
In addition, in the current period agreements were entered into for the lease of office fit-out and furniture for the 
London head office for a total of ¤0.4m (see note 16).

Finance lease
Agreements were reached in August 2011 for the sale and leaseback of the land and buildings in Arnhem under 
which a total of ¤4m was received. ¤2.2m was received in 2011 with the remaining amount received in the 
following period. The transaction has resulted in a finance lease creditor of ¤1,977,000 as at 31 March 2016 (2015: 
¤2,063,000). The total lease term is 15 years. 
In addition, in the current period agreements were entered into for lease of the fit-out and office furniture for the 
London head office for a total of ¤0.4m. These transactions have resulted in a finance lease creditor of ¤325,000 as 
at 31 March 2016 (2015: ¤nil) (see note 27 and 28). 
Warrants
In 2012 the Company executed a warrant instrument in favour of Ineos, allowing Ineos the opportunity to purchase 
up to a further 3,293,647 shares at a price of ¤1.05 per share at certain times up until 19 October 2016. All 3,293,647 
warrants lapsed on 31 March 2015.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the return to shareholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable owners of the 
parent Company, comprising share capital, reserves and accumulated losses.
The Board reviews the capital structure on a regular basis. As part of that review, the Board considers the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. Based on the review, the Group will balance its overall 
capital structure through new share issues and the raising of debt if required.
No final dividend is proposed in 2016 (2015: ¤nil). The Board deems it prudent for the Company to protect as strong 
a statement of financial position as possible during the current phase of the Company’s growth strategy.

rating of AA).
All assets and liabilities mature within one year except for the finance leases, for which details are given in note 28.
Trade payables are payable on various terms, typically not longer than 30 days.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s treasury policy is structured to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the 
development of its business whilst managing its currency, interest rate, counterparty credit and liquidity risks. The 
Group’s treasury strategy and policy are developed centrally and approved by the Board. 
Foreign currency risk management
Currency exposures are limited as the Group’s functional currency is the Euro with the majority of operating costs 
and balances denominated in Euros. A smaller proportion of expenditure is incurred in US dollars and pounds 
sterling. In addition some raw materials, while priced in Euros, are sourced from countries which are not within the 
Eurozone. The Group monitors any potential underlying exposure to other exchange rates.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s borrowings are limited to the sale and leaseback of the Arnhem land and buildings, and the lease of the 
office fit out and furniture in London. In addition, the interest rate in respect of the loan facility agreed with Solvay 
is fixed. Therefore the Group is not exposed to interest rate risk in relation to financial liabilities. Surplus funds are 
invested in short-term interest rate deposits to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates. The Group does not 
enter into any hedging arrangements.
Credit risk management
The Group is exposed to credit risk due to its trade receivables due from customers and cash deposits with financial 
institutions. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to their carrying amount recognised at the 
balance sheet date.
The Group ensures that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history to reduce the risk where 
this is considered necessary. The Directors consider the trade receivables at year end to be of good credit quality 
including those that are past due (see note 22). The Group is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure 
in respect of any single counterparty or any group of counterparties with similar characteristics other than the 
balances which are provided for as described in note 22.
The Group has credit risk from financial institutions. Cash deposits are placed with a group of financial institutions 
with suitable credit ratings in order to manage credit risk with any one financial institution.

Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity 
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking 
facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profile of financial 
assets and liabilities.
In addition to the sale and leaseback of the Arnhem land and buildings described above, the Group has finance 
facilities available which are secured on trade receivables and inventories:
 Trade receivables facility
  On 28 February 2011 the Group entered a trade receivable financing and credit management agreement with 
Fortis Commercial Banking for a period of at least two years from the closing date and with a facility limit of 
¤1.5m. After two years the agreement renews for rolling one year periods. The facility is secured upon the 
Group’s trade receivable. 
 Inventories facility
  On 17 January 2013 the Group entered a credit facility agreement with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. with a facility limit 
of ¤3.0m for the financing of the Group’s operating activities. The facility is secured against the inventories of 
the Group.
Both facilities are subject to interest at 1.5% above the ABN AMRO base rate of 3.6% as at 31 March 2016 (2015: 
3.8%). At 31 March 2016, the Group had ¤nil (2015: ¤nil) borrowed under both of the facilities.
 Solvay Loan
  On 25 November 2015 the Group entered a term loan facility agreement with Solvay Acetow GmBH with a facility 
of up to ¤9.5m to be used to design, procure and build an extension to the capacity of the Arnhem Plant, with a 
new reactor (or reactors) for the manufacture of Accoya
®
 at a design capacity of approximately 20,000m
3
 per 
reactor per annum. The facility is secured against the new reactor and associated assets. This facility is subject to 
interest at 7.5% per annum. At 31 March 2016, the Group had ¤nil borrowed under this facility.
Fair value of financial instruments
In the opinion of the Directors, there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of all 
financial assets and financial liabilities.

90 Report on the parent company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the Accsys Technologies PLC’s 
parent company financial statements (the ‘financial 
statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 March 2016;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements (the ‘Annual Report’) 
comprise:
• the company balance sheet as at 31 March 2016;
• the notes to the company financial statements, which 
include a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation of the financial statements 
is United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and 
applicable law (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, 
the Directors have made a number of subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they 
have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements; and
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required  
to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information  
and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of 
Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 51, the Directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared 
for and only for the company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent Auditors’ Report continued
to the members of Accsys Technologies PLC
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK 
and Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing 
the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and 
other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw 
conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or 
a combination of both
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of Accsys Technologies PLC for the year 
ended 31 March 2016.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of Accsys Technologies PLC (‘the Company’) have been prepared in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101) for the year ended 31 March 2016. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation 
of land and buildings and derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or 
loss, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s 
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 3 of the Group financial statements.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial 
statements, in accordance with FRS 101:
• The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 101, and has not disclosed information required by 
the standard as the consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent 
disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’. 
• The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 101 and not disclosed related party 
transactions with wholly owned subsidiary undertakings.
• The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 101 and the requirements of IAS 7 to 
not disclose a Statement of Cash Flows.
As permitted under section 408 of the Act the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the year. The loss for the financial year was ¤970,000 (2015: loss of ¤1,080,000). The results of the parent 
company are disclosed in the reserves reconciliation in note 11. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in the financial statements.
Investments
Except where a reliable fair value cannot be obtained, unlisted shares held by the Group are stated at historical 
cost less any provision for impairment. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in 
equity, with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in the profit or loss. Where investment 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the profit or loss 
in the year. Where it is not possible to obtain a reliable fair value, these investments are held at cost less provision 
for impairment.
Share based payments
When the parent entity grants options over equity instruments directly to the employees of a subsidiary 
undertaking, then in the parent company financial statements the effect of the share based payment is capitalised 
as part of the investment in the subsidiary as a capital contribution, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a modified Black Scholes model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted 
to reflect the actual number of share options that vest only where vesting is dependent upon the satisfaction of 
service and non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is 
based on the number of options which eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of 
the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Notes to the Company Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 
94 1. Accounting policies continued
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full in respect of taxation deferred by timing differences between the treatment 
of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes except for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to 
the extent that the Company anticipates making sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb the reversal of the 
underlying timing differences. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when 
paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charged. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset as well as costs of bringing the asset to the working condition and 
location of its intended use. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual 
value of each asset, except freehold land, over its expected useful life on a straight line basis, as follows:
Office equipment: Between 20% and 50%
Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities
Trade payables and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2. Profit and loss account
A loss of ¤970,000 (2015: loss of ¤1,080,000) is dealt with in the company financial statements of Accsys 
Technologies PLC. The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and not presented a profit and loss account for the Company. Fees payable to the Company’s 
auditors for the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements was ¤74,000 (2015: ¤72,000). Fees payable to 
the Company’s auditors for the audit of the Company’s subsidiaries was ¤106,000 (2015: ¤91,000) and fees payable 
for other services were ¤134,000 (2015: ¤98,000).
The information disclosed in the Group’s consolidated financial statements under IFRS2 ‘Share-based payment’ 
is within note 15, providing further information regarding the Company’s equity settled share based payment 
arrangements.
3. Employees
The Company had no employees other than Executive Directors (2016: 3 and 2015: 3) during the current or prior 
year. Non-executive Directors received emoluments in respect of their services to the Company of ¤279,000 (2015: 
¤144,000). Details have been included in the Remuneration Report. The Company did not operate any pension 
schemes during the current or preceding year.

Unlisted securities available for resale – –
Accsys Technologies PLC has previously purchased a total of 21,666,734 unlisted ordinary shares in Diamond Wood 
China. The carrying value of the investment is carried at cost less any provision for impairment, rather than at its fair 
value, as there is no active market for these shares, and there is significant uncertainty over the future of Diamond 
Wood, and as such a reliable fair value cannot be calculated. 
The historical cost of the unlisted shares held at 31 March 2016 is ¤10m (2015: ¤10m). However, a provision for the 
impairment of the entire balance of ¤10m continues to be recorded as at 31 March 2016 (see note 5).

The amounts owed by Group undertakings are payable on demand, however the Company has indicated it has no 
intention of demanding payment within the next twelve months. The Directors have considered the recoverability of 
the balances, taking into account the net assets as well as the long-term expected performance of the subsidiaries 
and do not consider that any impairment is currently required. However, a degree of risk remains over the carrying 
value given the relative uncertainty of the future results.

The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of ¤1.1m (2015: ¤1.0m) which is largely in respect of trading 
losses. The deferred tax asset has not been recognised due to the uncertainty of the timing of future expected 
profits of the fellow subsidiary (in which the Company is in the same tax group) attributable to licensing activities.
15. Transition to FRS 101
On transition to FRS 101 the Directors have assessed whether there are any measurement differences compared  
to the financial statements previously prepared under UK GAAP. This assessment covers the period from and  
after the date of transition to FRS 101 on 1 April 2014. No material differences were identified and consequently  
no restatements have been made of comparative information presented in these financial statements.

Annual Report & Accounts
For the year ended 31 January 2010 LiDCO Group Plc
www.lidco.com
During an average life span of 70 years, the human heart will pump more
than 400 million litres of blood. Monitoring of the key hemodynamic
parameters – blood pressure, cardiac output, oxygen delivery and fluid
status – can provide a practical, early warning of cardiovascular change.
LiDCO is a manufacturer of minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring
equipment and disposables. LiDCO's products are the result of a
multi-disciplinary developmental approach that combines physiological
expertise, sensor and computing technology with novel graphical user
software. The transformation of raw and complex physiological data into
more useable and effective information has been a key objective
throughout the development of the Company's products.
Our monitors are designed to display this key data in a way that clearly,
quickly and simply identifies the underlying drivers (blood flow, arterial tone
and fluid status) underlying the hemodynamic changes. Following an
appropriate intervention by the user the LiDCO monitor then measures the
response of the patient to a drug or fluid intervention. Early intervention
to avoid such potentially dangerous and life threatening hemodynamic
events has been demonstrated to reduce complications and length of stay
in high risk surgery patients.

LiDCO is a manufacturer of minimally invasive hemodynamic
monitoring equipment and disposables for use in hospitals.
These products are used primarily for the management of adult
hospital patients requiring critical care and those at major
cardiovascular risk during surgery.
02 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Evidence
Globally there is a growing body of clinical
evidence that the monitoring and targeting
of optimal hemodynamic levels can improve
the standard of care and clinical outcome of
high-risk surgery patients. Such improved
care reduces the incidence of complications,
reduces bed days and costs. The use of LiDCO’s
technology to target oxygen levels in high-risk
surgery patients has been shown to reduce
bed stay by an average of 12 days per patient.
National guidelines have been written to
encourage the expansion of the use of
hemodynamic monitoring in certain surgical
procedures. It is estimated that the worldwide
market for hemodynamic monitoring will grow
to $800m per annum over the coming years.
Distribution network
The Company sells via its own direct sales force
to hospitals in the UK, and in export markets
predominantly through a worldwide network
of speciality critical care and anesthesia
distributors. LiDCO’s distributors for the USA
and Japan are Covidien and Becton Dickinson
respectively – both multi billion dollar medical
device corporations.
Products
LiDCOplus is a computer-based platform
monitor used in the Intensive Care Unit for
real-time continuous display of hemodynamic
parameters.
LiDCOrapid is our new hemodynamic monitor
designed specifically for use in the Operating
Theatre for fluid and drug management.
LiDCO single-patient-use disposables is
used in conjunction with the LiDCOplus and
LiDCOrapid. 03 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10

reducing costly surgical complications, demand
for minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring
products is likely to grow.
04 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
I am pleased to report another very
good year for LiDCO and we have made
excellent progress on our strategy for
growth. Revenues grew by 18%, our
installed base of monitors increased by
a record 37% and disposables unit sales
rose 26%. We ended the year with
important new distribution partnerships
in place, a strengthened cash position
and no borrowings. Against a background
of the banking crisis, currency
fluctuations, and subsequent recession,
we believe that this is a considerable
achievement.
Our strategy for growth remains clearly
focused on three key areas: products,
market access and evidence and
awareness.
Market access
LiDCO’s sales and distribution operations
focus on specific types of patient within
target clinical settings.
Until 2008, our market was mainly
intensive and critical care units, but the
launch of the LiDCOrapid gave us access
to the high-risk surgery market potentially
worth US$800m. Furthermore, the
product’s ease of use has attracted a wide
range of distributors in both new and
existing territories. In 2009/10, two thirds
of our sales were exports. We significantly
improved the Group’s access to two of
the world’s biggest markets, the USA and
Japan through distribution partnerships
with Aspect Medical Systems, Inc (now
part of Covidien) and Becton, Dickinson
and Company (BD).
Products
We create high value, high margin
products that are innovative and have
strong intellectual property protection.
Our products are developed in close
consultation with leading clinicians and
assembled at our London facility, under
strict quality standards. Our portfolio
of integrated products enables
measurement, analysis, audit, training
and sharing of real-time and historic
hemodynamic data, in both critical care
units and the operating theatre. Demand
for other older, invasive catheter-based
hemodynamic monitoring is declining due
to concerns over associated risks. LiDCO’s
products not only help improve patient
outcomes by significantly reducing
infections and length of hospital stays,
they also save money as a result.
Launched in 2008, the LiDCOrapid
monitor and disposables meet the needs
of the growing high-risk surgery market
and other applications where quick and
easy set-up is required and continuous
trend information is important. During
the year we continued to focus our sales
resources on establishing the LiDCOrapid
in the market. 05 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Evidence and awareness
We recognise that continued sales growth
depends on a growing appreciation in the
acute care community of the clinical and
economic benefits of making the use of
hemodynamic monitoring part of normal
protocol. We will increasingly promote
knowledge and understanding of our
products, highlighting their advantages to
clinicians, administrators and healthcare
policy makers.
Scientific evidence is increasingly linking
the optimisation of patients’
hemodynamic status with better
outcomes and reduced hospital stays.
LiDCO has been selected as the sole
technology for two multi-centre
government-funded studies in the UK
and US. OPTIMISE is sponsored by the UK
Government for optimising cardiovascular
management in high-risk abdominal
surgery patients and in the US, MOnIToR
is a transplantation donor organ
optimisation study.
Financial position
To strengthen the Group’s balance
sheet and reduce exposure to potentially
uncertain banking facilities, £3.02m (net)
was raised through the issue of
31,916,000 ordinary shares last summer
to existing investors, new institutional
funds and management. This, together
with the licence fees received, enabled
the Group to repay its borrowings.
The Group’s cash balance at the year end
was £1.8m. Our robust position, coupled
with our partners’ strong balance sheets,
means we have the capital structure to
address the growing market, if necessary,
through placing (rather than selling)
of monitors and deriving income from
recurring disposable sales.
Prospects
Healthcare is expected to remain one
of the most defended expenditures in
developed countries. As hospitals seek
to improve efficiency by reducing costly
surgical complications, demand for
minimally invasive hemodynamic
monitoring products is likely to grow.
The addition of the LiDCOrapid to our
portfolio and the expansion of our
distributor network will enable us to take
full advantage of future opportunities.
I would like to thank our shareholders
for their continued support over the past
year. I am also grateful to my fellow
directors for their wise counsel, our staff
for their dedication and hard work and
our Clinical Advisory Board for their
valuable contribution. We look forward
with confidence to delivering our first
profit this year.

06 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Overview
This was another productive year during
which the Group maintained growth,
repaid its borrowings and reduced
distribution costs whilst significantly
expanding its route to market. Sales
increased by 18% to £5.4m, split between
42% capital (including licence fees) and
58% recurring revenue. We are in a strong
position to generate continued growth,
with the right products, a strengthened
balance sheet and increasing sales
resources.
The worldwide recession and the
requirement for universal healthcare
coverage in the USA means that hospital
finances are under increasing stress.
Reducing complications, wound and
central line infections and length of stay
in high-risk surgery patients has become
a prime objective. During the year we
accumulated new clinical data and
improved customer awareness of the
potential savings from using LiDCO’s
products. Abstracts and papers on the
use of our technology in: organ
transplantation, major and bariatric
surgery, intensive care and cardiology
were published by investigators in Europe,
the USA and Asia. Customers have an
increasingly strong evidence-based
business case for the adoption of
advanced hemodynamic monitoring.
The use of LiDCO technology on high-risk
surgery patients can reduce complications
by more than a third, costs by £4,800 per
patient and hospital stay by up to 12
days¹. The LiDCOrapid monitor can be
used to optimise fluids and blood flow
both in or outside of surgery and in
conscious or ventilated patients. Other
products that are incrementally invasive
and/or that can only be easily used in
ventilated patients, are often less practical
for the management of the whole surgical
pathway.
In the USA, new legislation will extend
healthcare cover to an additional 32
million people. This programme is also
trying to lower costs through a series of
public policy mechanisms within Medicare
and Medicaid and is likely over time to
fundamentally change the way doctors
are reimbursed and will encourage the
adoption of the safest, cheapest and most
effective medical procedures. The USA is
currently spending 15.3% of GDP on
healthcare – about double that of the UK.
Medicare has decided not to reimburse
healthcare providers for treatment of
hospital-acquired infections. We believe
this will encourage use of LiDCO products
to implement fluid optimisation strategies
in high-risk patients.
Worldwide, there looks to be a general
need to improve the efficiency of
treatments for high-risk patients, and
ultimately there is likely to be convergence
on what is “best practice”. Companies
that are proven to provide the best, most
cost-effective and most widely adoptable
technology will prosper. Hospitals will also
require training in the adoption of new
technology and “best practice”; this is
why we are developing further training
materials and a hemodynamic workshop
in conjunction with St George’s Hospital,
London.
Outlook and prospects
The global market for hemodynamic
monitoring products will continue to
grow. We estimate worldwide sales
revenues for minimally invasive
hemodynamic monitoring products grew
by less than the average 30% seen in the
previous two years. We believe this was
a consequence of global economic
disruption coupled with what proved
to be reduced, or in some cases entirely
absent capital and disposable revenue
budgets. However, market drivers remain
and have become more relevant.
Customers will continue to move away
from the use of the older, invasive catheter
products. Medicare in the USA is no
longer prepared to pay hospitals for
treatment of catheter and surgery related
complications and infections.
The focus is shifting from hospitals
increasing the number of surgeries
undertaken towards improving the quality
of care. In the UK, NHS expenditure at
7.7% of GDP is forecast to be ring fenced
to the extent possible given the deficit
and economy. So it is likely that the NHS
will need to make annual efficiency
savings of more than £4bn by 2012-13.
Expectations regarding hospital efficiency
savings are outlined in a new national
programme: QIPP – Quality, Innovation,
Productivity and Prevention. A key
element of this programme is pathway
redesign. In particular, the increasing
adoption of ‘enhanced’ surgical pathways
is encouraged. Elements of the pathways
include better pre-operative assessment
and planning; the goal being to reduce
the stress of the operation with post-
operative care structured around
achieving the earliest recovery. Better
intra-operative fluid management and,
if necessary, continued hemodynamic
monitoring and targeted post-operative
oxygen delivery are necessary to achieve
the best results. 07 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Markets
In April 2009 an exclusive sales and
marketing licence for the LiDCOrapid was
granted to BD in Japan. In July, Aspect
Medical was appointed as distributor for
the LiDCOrapid for the USA. BD and
Covidien, – who acquired Aspect in
October – are major global medical
technology groups. The combined up-
front licence fees from these distribution
agreements amounted to £940,000.
The Group had a record year in terms of
the number of monitors sold and placed
in hospitals; the lower priced LiDCOrapid
was the key driver behind this. Capital
sales, excluding Med One sales, are
reflective of the increased numbers sold
and were up by £210,000 (13%).
LiDCO’s strategy is to sell directly to
hospitals in the UK and work with
existing third party distributors in export
territories. The new US arrangements
materially improved sales force
representation while significantly reducing
our US distribution costs by about
£650,000 per annum. The integration
of Covidien’s Nellcor critical care and
Aspect’s surgery sales teams took place
this February. The enlarged team, which
we believe to be the largest monitoring
equipment sales force in the USA gives us
a far greater reach into the USA than was
originally envisaged with Aspect.
Sales in the USA doubled across the
period through the above changes in
the distribution channel. All sales staff
have now had at least their initial training
and are incentivised through a sales
commission plan. Further training is an
on-going process. New accounts have
already been secured and we expect
the sales pipeline to grow substantially
during 2010.

We anticipate that BD’s sales in Japan will

In the UK we expect the hemodynamic
monitoring market to continue to grow,
and we have a developing pipeline of new
accounts. There is a growing expectation
that hospitals will adopt hemodynamic
monitoring as part of their plans to re-
engineer surgical pathways. We have
recruited a new UK sales manager and
are looking to add to our sales and nurse
educator team in the year. We are also
excited about our collaboration with the
St George’s Hospital simulation centre in
London, where we will be running regular
courses that deal with the practical
implementation of our technology.
The staff there who have used our
technology for many years and have
experience of saving up to 12 bed days
per high-risk surgery patient undergoing
LiDCO-directed therapies.
A study was conducted using LiDCO’s
products that assessed the value of
simultaneous brain and hemodynamic
monitoring during major peripheral
vascular surgery in high-risk patients.
The technical synergies between
Covidien’s depth of anesthesia monitoring
(BIS) and LiDCO’s technology have great
potential to deliver the market’s most
evolved fluid and hemodynamic
monitoring product. Combining these
technologies into a monitor on the
LiDCOrapid platform is an exciting and
commercially valuable project that is now
underway. Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
continued
We are optimistic about sales in 2010,
although still concerned about the economy
and the return to economic growth. We expect
good disposables sales revenue growth in all
territories, as monitors installed in the latter
part of 2009 begin to contribute to disposables
revenues, augmented by additional income
generated by our expanded sales force.
08 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Sales and trading
Revenues were up 18% to £5.37m
(2008: £4.53m), with a 73% increase in
the number of LiDCO monitors sold /
placed in the year (565 up vs 326).
Disposables numbers were up 26% at
37,918 and associated income was also
up, by 21% at £3.13m. Export sales now
represent 66% of income – up from 52%.
Disposable revenue growth and the
higher numbers of monitors placed have
been driven by demand for the
LiDCOrapid through our expanded
distribution network. Monitor sales,
excluding Med One sales, are more
reflective of the increased numbers sold
and were in fact up by £210,000 (13%).
Paradoxically, total capital income
(including Med One income) was down
£104,000. This was a consequence of the
higher number of lower priced
LiDCOrapid monitors sold coupled to prior
period capital revenues being improved
by the sales of monitors placed in the UK
(£314,000) to Med One. Although sales
of placed monitors to Med One have been
useful in the past to improve cash flow
and to reduce risk, our stronger capital
base means that we are now in a position
to finance this ourselves – hence there
were no such sales in the period.
The installed base at the year end stands
at 2075 units, an increase of 37% in the
year. The LiDCOrapid portion of this grew
by 514 units, an increase of 84% over the
previous year and now represents 38% of
the installed base. This has been achieved
within 21 months of launch and across a
turbulent economic period. As previously
reported, the focus necessary to launch
and promote the LiDCOrapid had a knock-
on effect on the growth and capital
revenues from sales of our calibrated
product – the LiDCOplus monitor.
The lack of capital budgets in hospitals
delayed product sales for most of the year.
The disposables revenues almost certainly
underplay the full impact the increase in
installed base is likely to have on future
disposables sales. As monitors are
transferred from distributors into hospitals,
LiDCOrapid smart card sales should
produce further growth in this income
stream.
Geographic segmental sales reporting
The installed base increased in all regions
by between 17% and 63%. The strongest
growth was in the USA where monitors
sold/placed and revenue were up 349%
and 121% respectively including
distributor stocking sales. In the UK,
despite a severe slowdown in activity by
the NHS, particularly in the first half of the
year, the number of monitors sold/placed
increased modestly 47 vs 43. However,
overall revenues were affected negatively
by hospitals moving to the placing model
of acquisition, rather than capital purchase
(16 vs 8), and greater numbers of lower
priced LiDCOrapid monitors in the mix of
monitors sold. In continental Europe,
distributor stocks moved more slowly than
expected to their respective customers,
resulting in a general destocking of
monitors occurring during the period.
We expect sales of monitors to European
distributors to improve in 2010. However,
there are continuing issues for some
territories as distributors have to fund cash
flow issues stemming from increasingly
delayed payment times.

Disposables units sold increased in all
regions with income up in UK, USA and
ROW cumulatively up by £0.6m (29%).
Although disposables unit numbers in the
EU rose by 4%, income was down
£40,000 due to a mix shift towards the
lower transfer price of the LiDCOrapid
smart card. Some cannibalisation of
higher priced LiDCOplus sensor sales
by lower price LiDCOrapid disposables,
at both hospital and distributor levels,
has clearly occurred in the year. Whilst this
may continue, it should be increasingly
diluted by the growing LiDCOrapid sales
into new accounts where LiDCOplus
monitors have not been purchased.
We are optimistic about sales in 2010, although still concerned about the
economy and the return to economic growth. We expect good disposables
sales revenue growth in all territories, as monitors installed in the latter part
of 2009 begin to contribute to disposables revenues, augmented by
additional income generated by our expanded sales force.

disposables, service contracts and fees
for use increased by 21% from £2.57m
to £3.13m.
The average margin across all products
against external procurement costs fell
during the period from 81% to 75%.
This was partly a consequence of higher
monitor costs due to exchange rate
movements and partly due to reduced
margins achieved on sales of LiDCOrapid
monitors to distributors. Future
profitability will significantly depend
on margins achieved on disposables.
These remained high during the year,
albeit with a small reduction in margins
on smart cards due to the increased
proportion sold to distributors. Margins
achieved on LiDCOplus sensors remained
steady at 86% and on smart cards fell by
3% to 92%.
Sales of LiDCOrapid smart cards are
expected to be an important revenue
stream in future. It is too early to establish
the average smart card usage per monitor
but in the UK customers using it for more
than 12 months we have seen rates in
individual hospitals as high as 11 cards per
monitor per month.
Overall gross margin on sales including
Med One costs was 61%, down from 67%
last year. Med One payments in the period
amounted to £688,000 (2008/09:
£587,000). There were no sales to Med
One during the year (2008/09 £314,000)
and as a result Med One payments have
now peaked and should reduce to nil over
the next two years, increasing the overall
gross margin.
The effect of the movement in foreign
exchange rates during the year was to
increase administration expenses by
£223,000 in comparison to the previous
year. In addition, non-US related sales and
marketing costs increased £127,000.
Thus, although the bulk of the US sales
force was transferred to Aspect in July
2009 (which reduced costs in the second
half by about £325,000), administrative
expenses increased by £16,000.
A significant element of the adverse
fluctuations in exchange rates was the
sales and marketing overhead in the USA.
Taxation
As the Group is still at the pre-profit stage
there was no tax charge for the year.
The Group has a potential deferred tax
asset of £6.4m although this has not been
recognised in the accounts. In the UK,
the Group qualifies for research and
development tax credits, which are
estimated as £120,000 in 2009/10 and
are shown in the income statement.
Cash, financing and working capital
The net cash outflow before financing
activities was £1.044m (2009: £1.8m),
with an outflow of £743,000 in the first
half and £301,000 in the second.
Historically the Group has used bank
loans, overdrafts and invoice discount
financing facilities as a means of providing
working capital. To reduce our
dependence on such facilities in future,
the Group issued 31,916,000 new
ordinary shares at 10p to existing
investors, including management and to
new institutional investors raising £3.02m
net of costs. This allowed the Group to
repay overdraft and invoice discount
balances of £608,000 outstanding at the
start of the year. The Group was also in
receipt of £940,000 in up-front licence
fees from Aspect and BD. As well as
strengthening the balance sheet, these
funds will more readily help the Group
to adopt a placing model for its monitors
with its UK customer base. Cash balances
at 31 January 2010 amounted to £1.85m.
The Board anticipate this will be sufficient
to see the Group through to profitability
and positive cash flow. In addition the
Group has an unutilised overdraft facility
of £500,000.
Inventory at the year end was £1.09m,
an increase of £41,000, but as a
percentage of turnover reduced from
23% to 20%. Expenditure on fixed and
intangible assets in the year of £606,000
was broadly similar to the previous year
and below the charge for depreciation
and amortisation of £672,000.
Expenditure on fixed and intangible assets
is not expected to rise significantly in the
foreseeable future. 11 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
The Group issued warrants to Aspect over
13,915,324 ordinary shares. The warrants
are exercisable in two stages, provided
Aspect achieves its sales minimums in
the first two years of the agreement.
The warrants are exercisable at 14.3
pence per share.
The Group continues to monitor
overheads and cash carefully and is
expecting to achieve its maiden profit
in the current financial year.
Product development
The first half of 2010 will see us continue
to refine the LiDCOrapid graphical user
interface whilst improving and simplifying
customer use and connectivity to our
monitors. The first phase of these changes
was completed in July 2009 when we
announced the launch of the LiDCOrapid
version 1.02. This new software added
user-adjustable timescales for trending
fluid parameters, and two extra screens
(History and Data charting). These
enhancements are being seamlessly added
to our installed monitor base and have
been well received by our UK and export
customers in the six months since launch.
The next revision of the LiDCOrapid
software – version 1.03 will be available
later this summer and will have a
number of new features:
• Universal pressure waveform module:
This – and associated LiDCOrapid software
changes – will allow wider market
adoption by making it easier to access
arterial blood pressure data where, to
date, access has been difficult, or where
the primary patient monitor does not
provide the necessary analogue arterial
pressure output.
• LiDCO Monitor language localisation:
This converts the information on the
LiDCOrapid monitors’ screens from
English into 22 languages. Users can select
from the appropriate language menu on
the start-up screen.
• RS232 Communication changes:
This will allow the LiDCOrapid monitor
to communicate with a wider range of
hospital information systems – one current
project is to connect to GE’s information
system. Hospitals increasingly require that
hemodynamic monitors can pass data to
their information systems. A configurable
output makes this an easier process.
Platform evolution – the LiDCO & BIS
Combination Monitor
There is considerable interest from
customers in producing a combined
product that can realise the synergies
between Aspect’s (now Covidien)
Bispectral Index (BIS) product and the
LiDCOrapid monitor. The former ensures
the correct depth of anesthesia is
achieved, and the latter is used while the
patient remains in surgery to restore blood
pressure and cardiac output to pre-surgery
levels.
To quantify the value of a LiDCO and BIS
combination, we supported a prospective
study at King’s College Hospital, London.
This study has now concluded successfully
and some of the results have been
submitted for presentation. The results
demonstrate that their simultaneous
availability produces a unique insight into
the underlying factors driving the large
blood pressure changes occurring when a
patient is anesthetized.
Evidence – development of supportive
clinical and business cases
Our growth strategy is clearly focused
on providing minimally invasive
hemodynamic monitoring products that
can be effectively sold through our direct
sales force and distribution channel
partners. Increasingly our customers are
demanding that such products are
supported with higher levels of evidence
that their use will be cost-effective.
Helpfully as time moves on, more and
more customers are documenting how
our products have helped with the care
of their patients. Over the last year
valuable insights into specific uses have
been demonstrated in the fields of:
organ transplantation, major and bariatric
surgery, intensive care and cardiology.
At the start of this year the UK’s National
Technology Adoption Centre (NTAC)
reported UK Hospital’s Trusts experiences
using/adopting the technique of
hemodynamic intra-operative goal
directed fluid management. NTAC’s role
is to work with NHS organisations to
understand and overcome the barriers to
the implementation of evidence based
technologies that will deliver improved
patient outcomes and effective use of NHS
resources. The result of that work was the
development of a business case template
that is intended to be tailored by NHS
Trusts to facilitate the implementation of
this technique with the goal of improving
clinical outcomes following major surgery,
leading to reduced hospital stay driving
improved efficiency and productivity.
Customers have an increasingly strong
evidence-based business case for the
adoption of advanced hemodynamic
monitoring that coincides with a strong
imperative to reduce costs and improve
productivity.
Regulatory affairs and quality
During the year LiDCO was successfully
audited against the requirements of
ISO13485:2003, ISO9001:2000, the EU
Medical Devices Directive and the Health
Canada Medical Device Regulations.
Our activities and products comply with
the requirements of all recently published
EU Directives – the Waste Electrical &
Electronic Equipments (WEEE) regulations;
the Restrictions of the use of certain
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations;
the Registration, Evaluation and
Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH)
regulations; the Waste Batteries and
Accumulators regulations; the Batteries
and Accumulators (Placing on the Market)
regulations; the Machinery Directive and
the Eco Design Directive.
LiDCO’s products are registered in a
number of major territories and
registration of LiDCO products is ongoing
in Japan, China, Colombia, Russia and
Argentina.

Corporate Governance Report 15 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Committees of the Board
Audit Committee
The members of the Committee are Ms Wallis (Chairman) and Mr Brown. The external auditors also attend meetings. The
Committee considers financial reporting and internal controls. It also reviews the scope and results of the external audit and the
independence and objectivity of the auditors. It meets at least twice a year and reviews the interim and annual financial statements
before they are submitted for approval by the Board. The Committee met twice during the year. The Committee considers annually
whether the auditors remain independent for the purposes of the audit. This year the fee for non-audit work is £10,000 against an
audit fee of £42,000. The Committee is satisfied that the auditors remain independent for the purposes of the annual audit.
The Committee considers that given the size of the Company and its current stage of development a separate internal audit
function cannot be justified, but the matter is re-considered annually by the Committee.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee are Ms Wallis (Chairman) and Mr Brown. The Committee reviews and sets the remuneration of the
executive directors. It also reviews the policy for the salaries and bonuses of all other staff. It advises on share schemes and approves
the granting of share options. The Committee met six times during the year.
Nomination Committee
The members of the Committee are Ms Wallis (Chairman), Mr Brown and Dr O’Brien. The Committee considers, at the request of the
Board, candidates for new appointments to the Board and advises on all matters relating to Board appointments. The Committee did
not meet during the year.

The Company seeks to maintain and enhance good relations with its shareholders. The Company’s interim and annual reports are
supplemented by public announcements to the market on technological and commercial progress. All investors have access to
up-to-date information on the Company via its website, www.lidco.com, which also provides contact details for investor relations
enquiries. All shareholders are invited to make use of the Company’s Annual General Meeting to raise any questions regarding the
management or performance of the Company.
The Chief Executive, Chairman and Finance Director meet regularly with shareholders and the investing community and report
to the Board feedback from those meetings. Both non-executive directors have the opportunity to attend shareholder meetings.
The Board is kept informed on market views about the Company. 16 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
The Company recognises the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility.
At the core of LiDCO are its medical monitors for hemodynamic monitoring which have been developed over a number of years
and continue to be developed. The original objective of the design of these products was to translate specialist physiological
parameters and principles into useable information and tangible protocols to improve clinical outcomes. The Company has been
successful in achieving this objective and its products, which are used in hospitals in many parts of the world, are life saving and
help surgeons to improve the outcome of clinical operations for the benefit of the patient both during and after surgery and help
hospitals to reduce their costs.
LiDCO works with its employees, customers and suppliers to conduct its business in an ethical way. The Company is of a relatively
small size but growing and thus the Company’s commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility is dynamic and is reviewed by the
Board on a regular basis.
Employees
The Company recognises that an essential part of its continued success is the support and involvement of its employees.
• Effective communication is essential to ensure its employees are fully engaged with the business. The senior management team
meets regularly throughout the year as a forum to discuss interdepartmental issues and briefing sessions are also held by the Chief
Executive to update employees on Company progress, strategy and objectives.
• Employees have annual appraisals to set objectives, identify strengths and areas for development.
• Training is provided where necessary to enhance job performance and aid development.
• The Company has a share option scheme with a high level of employee participation.
• The Company regularly reviews the benefits offered to employees and has introduced childcare vouchers which are available to all
employees.
Environment
Whilst not of substantial impact compared with many other manufacturing industries, nevertheless the Company recognises its
activities have an impact on the environment and acknowledges its responsibility to ensure this is minimised.
• In accordance with the requirements of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations (WEEE), the Company has
signed up to a compliance system to recycle and dispose of electrical equipment waste.
• Where possible, other products are recycled within the Company.
• Paper, cardboard and ink cartridge recycling collection facilities are in place in London and Cambridge.
• Redundant computer equipment is offered to employees or disposed of in accordance with good practice.
• Company purchased vehicles are run on diesel fuel for fuel efficiency.
• The Company continually reviews the chemicals it uses in its manufacturing processes with the aim of using the least toxic and
most environmentally friendly products commensurate with producing high quality products.
Ethics and Values
• The Company designs and manufactures life saving products which help clinicians to improve the outcome of clinical operations
for the benefit of patients both during and after surgery and helps hospitals to reduce their costs.
• The Company aims for all employees to have job satisfaction, a safe and secure working environment, the feeling that their
achievements are recognised and an opportunity to develop their full potential.
• The Company recognises customer needs for a high level of customer service and quality of its products, at the right price.
Health and Safety
• As a producer of medical products the Company operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to regular inspection
and audit.
• The Company uses an external specialist to advise on its health and safety policy and practice. Stringent procedures are in place in
areas of the Company where risks are apparent, and the Company provides a physically safe working environment, training,
protective clothing and equipment to all employees who undertake their duties.
• All Company car drivers are provided with a full driving risk assessment and training upon joining, and a further paper based risk
assessment is completed every three years.
• Health and safety issues are regularly reviewed at Board meetings.
Shareholders
The Company aims to treat its stakeholders in a responsible manner. It maintains regular contact with its major shareholders to
explain developments in the business and all shareholders are invited to question management at the Annual General Meeting.
See also “Relations with Shareholders” in the Corporate Governance Report on page 15.
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement 17 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
The directors present their Remuneration Report which covers the remuneration of both the executive and non-executive directors.
The report will be subject to shareholder vote at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in June 2010.
Committee membership
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is made up of the following non-executive directors:
T A Wallis (Chairman)
I G Brown
Neither of the Committee members has any day-to-day involvement in the running of the Company, nor do they have any business
or other relationship that could affect, or appear to affect, the exercise of their independent judgement, other than as shareholders.
No director plays a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Committee determines on behalf of the Board, the remuneration for the executive directors and reviews remuneration policies
for all employees. Remuneration levels are set in order to attract high calibre recruits and to retain and motivate those directors and
employees once they have joined the Company to ensure the future success of the business and to deliver shareholder value. This is
achieved by a combination of base salary, bonuses and share options, which are offered to executive directors and employees at all
levels. The Committee met six times in the year.
Base salary
All four executive directors receive a base salary and, if appropriate, an allowance in lieu of benefits. The salary reflects the
experience and level of competence of the individual to whom it applies, as judged by the Committee, taking into account salary
levels in the market.
Annual bonus
The executive directors who served during the year are members of the Company’s Senior Management Bonus Scheme. Under the
terms of the Scheme, the Remuneration Committee assesses the directors’ individual performances soon after the end of the
financial year, judged against pre-determined targets.
The criteria for awarding bonuses during the year included corporate and individual objectives. Corporate objectives included sales
performance and operating loss. Bonuses are capped at 50% of base salary.
Remuneration policy of the non-executive directors
The Board determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors. The non-executive directors do not participate in the
Group’s share option schemes and are not eligible for annual incentive payments or benefits in kind.

The directors of LiDCO Group Plc present their annual report and audited financial statements (Annual Report) for the year ended
31 January 2010.
Principal activities, business review and business risks
The principal activity of the Group is the development, manufacture and sale of cardiac monitoring equipment.
The business review is included in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement and Corporate Social Responsibility
Statement which should be read as part of this Directors’ Report.
The key commercial risks associated with the business are:
• healthcare spending – the Group’s performance is affected by hospitals’ expenditure and any, or developing, capital budgetary
constraints, which the Group mitigates by targeting its efforts and resources according to sales opportunities where budgets are likely to
be available and a wider geographic sales growth predominantly through an expanding specialist distributor network;
• competitive activity from other producers of hemodynamic monitors who sell competing products which may restrict the Group’s ability
to maintain or make further progress in increasing its share of the growing minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring market. The
Group addresses this by encouraging independent clinical validation of its products, introducing product developments/enhancements
and sponsoring clinical studies that focus on patient outcome improvement; and
• the Group relies on distributors for its sales and marketing activities outside of the UK. The Group mitigates the risk of distributor
underperformance by selecting distributors with the requisite resources, skills, access to customers and creditworthiness and by providing
training programmes and extensive support both in the initial phase following appointment and on an ongoing basis.
The key financial risk is the management and maintenance of sufficient cash balances to support the ongoing development, supply and
marketing of the LiDCO products.
Results and dividends
The Group’s revenue for the year was £5,367,000 (2008/9: £4,532,000). The Group made a consolidated loss after taxation of £1,427,000
(2008/9: £1,650,000). The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2007/8: £nil).
The Company’s share price at 29 January 2010 was 18.25p (2009: 7.00p)
Research and development
The Group continued to develop the LiDCO systems during the year. Details of the costs expended on research and development are set
out in Notes 3 and 8 to the financial statements on pages 32 and 35 respectively.

Directors’ indemnities and Directors’ and Officers’ insurance
The Company has exercised the power given by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting to extend the indemnities to directors
and officers against liability to third parties. The directors also have Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover in place in respect of personal
liabilities which may be incurred by directors and officers in the course of their service with the Company.
Employment policy
Equal opportunity is given to all employees regardless of their gender, race or ethnic origin, religion, age, disability, or sexual orientation.
The policy of the directors is to encourage the involvement of all employees in the development and performance of the Group. Employees
are briefed on the Group’s activities through meetings and discussions with management and all employees are encouraged to give their
views on matters of common concern through the line management. A significant number of employees have share options.
Supplier payment policy
It is and will continue to be the policy of the Group to negotiate with suppliers so as to obtain the best available terms taking account of
quality, delivery, price and period of settlement and, having agreed those terms, to abide by them. The Group’s average creditor payment
period as at 31 January 2010 was 25 days (2008/9:42days).
Significant shareholdings
As at 16 April 2010, the Company has been notified that the following shareholders, other than directors, had the following interest of 3%
or more of the Company’s ordinary share capital:

Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The parent company financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements,
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in
business. 22 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
In so far as the directors are aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient funds to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has continued to invest in the development of its operations and in
particular its direct and indirect sales channels during the year. As a result the Group has continued to trade at a loss during the year ended
31 January 2010.
The Group finances its operations through shareholders funds and an overdraft facility. The directors have approved forecasts for the
foreseeable future, which indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds to trade during that period. In May and June 2009, 31,916,000
new ordinary shares were issued at 10 pence per share to existing investors, management and new institutional funds raising £3.02m (net).
During the year the Group appointed a new distributor in the USA. As part of the agreement, the Group transferred the bulk of its US sales
force to the distributor reducing US sales costs by about £650,000 in a full year. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that would be required in the event that the Company had insufficient funding available.
Accountability and audit – Going concern
As noted in the accounting policies and the basis of current financial projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company has access to adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Financial risk management
The Financial Risk Management objectives and policies of the Group, including the exposure to interest rate risk, liquidity risk and currency
risk are set out in note 13 to the financial statements on pages 37 to 39.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Board monitors progress against the Group’s strategy and by reference to the KPIs, specifically revenue growth, gross margin, working
capital levels and market position. These KPIs have been addressed in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review and the Financial Review.
Internal controls, regulation and risk management
The composition of the Board and the senior management team provides a suitable range of knowledge and experience to enable adequate
risk monitoring. The Company has implemented an organisational structure with clearly-defined responsibilities and lines of accountability.
Detailed budgets are prepared annually and progress against budget and forecasts are reviewed monthly. Underpinning the monthly
financial reporting is a system of internal control, based on authorisation procedures.
The adequacy of internal controls and the internal control structures was reviewed by the Board in April 2010.
As a medical device Company, LiDCO also has a system of regulatory controls, to ensure compliance with all requirements of the Medicines
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and other medical bodies. During the year
the Company was compliant with ISO13485 (Medical Devices – Quality Management Systems) and ISO 9001 (Quality Management
Systems).
The Board has established a process involving all departments for the comprehensive assessment of key risks to the business. The risk
register is updated on an ongoing basis and reviewed by the Board four times a year. Actions to mitigate risks are identified and agreed.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditors and to authorise the directors to set their remuneration will be proposed at
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice to convene the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on Tuesday 29 June 2010 is set out on pages 5 to 6 of the
separate circular, which includes an explanation of each resolution.
By order of the Board

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity
For the year ended 31 January 2010
The accompanying accounting policies and notes form an integral part of these financial statements. 28 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
1 Principal accounting policies
The Group’s principal activity is the development, manufacture and sale of cardiac monitoring equipment. LiDCO Group Plc is the Group’s ultimate
parent company. It is incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales and situated at the address shown on page [1]. The Group’s shares are listed
on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group, International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations (IFRIC) as adopted by the EU and those parts of the Companies Act
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. They are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions,
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout all periods presented in these financial statements. These accounting policies
comply with each IFRS that is mandatory for accounting periods ending on 31 January 2010.
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Improving
disclosures about financial instruments’ and IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’. IAS 1 (revised) brings new disclosure requirements regarding owner and
non-owner changes in equity which are now required to be shown separately. These financial statements have been prepared under the revised
disclosure requirements which requires the presentation of a comparative balance sheet at the start of the comparative period. Management
consider this is unnecessary since the 2007 balance sheet is the same as that previously published. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be
identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board. IFRS 7 requires enhanced
disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
The forthcoming standards may affect the preparation of the Group’s financial statements in the future:
IFRIC 16: Hedges;
IFRS 3: Business combinations;
IAS 39: Financial instruments.
These standards are effective but the Group has not adopted them early.
IFRS standards and interpretations not yet adopted
As of 31 January 2010, the following standards and interpretations are in issue but not yet adopted by the EU:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2013)
• Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement – Amendments to IFRIC 14 (effective 1 January 2011)
• IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments (effective 1 July 2010)
• Improvements to IFRSs (issued 16 April 2009)
• Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions – Amendment to IFRS 2 (effective 1 January 2010)
• Amendment to IFRS 1 Additional Exemptions for First-time Adopters (effective 1 January 2010)
• IAS 24 (revised 2009) Related Party Disclosures (effective 1 January 2011)
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has continued to invest in the development of its operations and in particular its direct
and indirect sales channels during the year. As a result the Group has continued to trade at a loss during the year ended 31 January 2010.
The Group finances its operations through shareholders’ funds and an overdraft facility. The directors have approved forecasts for the foreseeable
future, which indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds to trade during that period. During the year the Group appointed a new distributor
in the USA. As part of the agreement, the Group transferred the bulk of its US sales force to the distributor reducing US sales costs by about
£650,000 in a full year.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historic cost convention. The measurement basis and significant accounting policies are set out
below.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 January 2010.
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic
benefits from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
Business combinations are dealt with by the purchase method. The purchase method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable assets
and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the acquisition date whether or not they were recognised in the statements of the
subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated balance sheet at their
fair values which are also used as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. The results of any
subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period, where applicable are included from the date of acquisition. All intra-group transactions,
balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 January 2010 29 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Revenue recognition
Revenues are recognised at fair value of the consideration receivable net of the amount of value added taxes.
Sale of goods
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of products to entities outside the
consolidated entity. Sales revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods passes to the customer, which is normally
upon delivery, and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The Group has an arrangement for the placing of monitors in hospitals with Med One Capital Funding, LLC, a US company that has trading
relationships with the majority of US hospitals and provides a number of deferred payment arrangements together with product support and advice.
The Group sells monitors to Med One and recognises the revenue as a sale. Title to the monitors passes to Med One, as do the significant risks and
rewards of ownership and there is no obligation for the Group to re-purchase the monitors. The full revenue arising from any subsequent sale of
consumables relating to these monitors is recognised as revenue by the Group. Med One is entitled to a portion of the monthly revenue from the
sale of consumables for a period of three years and payments made to Med One in this way are included within cost of sales.
Licence fees
Licence fees are recognised in accordance with the substance of the relevant distribution agreement, provided that it is probable that the economic
benefit associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. Licence fees received in advance
of the recognition of those fees is shown as deferred income.
Delivery of services
Revenue from rendering services is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Interest income
Interest income is brought to account as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Other income
Other income is brought to account when the consolidated entity’s right to receive income is established and the amount can be reliably measured.
Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefit.
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset, and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably
Capitalised development costs which comprise cost of materials, labour and attributable overheads are amortised over a period of three to five years.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
Intangible assets – development costs
Intangible assets represent costs relating to product registration in new countries, software development costs and clinical trials on the LiDCO
system. Where the directors are satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of these projects, the expenditure has been capitalised
and is amortised in equal amounts over the useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. The amortisation periods generally applicable are:
Clinical trials Three years
Product registration costs Five years
Software development Three years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value
of these assets by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives which are re-assessed annually. The periods/rates generally
applicable are:
Leasehold improvements Over the expected life of the lease
Plant and machinery 10% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 12.5% per annum
Office equipment 20% per annum
Computer equipment 33% per annum
Medical monitors 20% per annum
Medical monitors include equipment on long term loan to hospitals for active use where the hospital pays for disposables. Also included in this
category is equipment for demonstration purposes, clinical trials and testing. 30 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
1 Principal accounting policies continued
Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of fair value or present value of the minimum lease payments in the balance sheet and
depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital
balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statements account on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less the estimated costs of selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to
their existing locations and condition.
Income tax
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on the taxable result for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other
income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are
calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate to
items that are charged or credited directly to equity (such as the revaluation of land) in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or
credited directly to equity.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates
subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised and initially recognised at fair value amount and subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less provisions for impairment. Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-
down is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and demand deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, and which are
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into
and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are
recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are initially recorded at fair value net of issue costs.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting
policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other creditors. Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method.
Share-based payments
The Group has two equity-settled share-based remuneration schemes for employees. Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value
of the options at the date of grant is calculated using a pricing model and is charged to the income statement over the vesting period. Market
related performance conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted and a charge is made irrespective of whether the market
related performance conditions are satisfied. In respect of awards with non market related performance conditions, an estimate of the proportion
that will vest is made at the award date which is adjusted if the number of share options expected to vest differs from the previous estimates. Any
cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period.
Where the Group issues share warrants in respect of distributor arrangements, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is calculated using
a pricing model and is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued 31 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Impairment
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to
determine the extent of impairment loss.
Key judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies
The Group’s management makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated based on
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the
future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on the management’s
estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates
can result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the income statement in specific periods (notes 7 & 8).
Inventory
The Group reviews the net realisable value of, and demand for, its inventory on a regular basis to provide assurance that recorded inventory is stated
at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Factors that could impact estimated demand and selling prices include the timing and success of future
technological innovations, competitor actions, supplier prices and economic trends (note 9).
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are primarily due from three groups, hospitals in the UK and USA where direct sales are made, global distributors predominantly in
the USA and Japan and independent distributors, predominantly in Europe and the Rest of the World. In making provision for overdue trade
receivables, management consider the first two groups to be generally of lower risk than those due from independent distributors and apply a lower
level of provision. The size of the distributor together with its financial credit rating and the length of relationship with the Group are also taken into
account (note 10).
Revenue recognition
The recognition of sales to Med One, as fully explained in the accounting policy on revenue recognition above, is considered to be a key judgment.
The monitors are judged to have been sold to Med One when title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed. Regarding the
sale of consumables, the obligation to pay Med One is judged to arise when the consumables have been sold to the end user customer.
Licence income
The Group may receive licence fees in connection with the granting of exclusive distribution rights for overseas territories. When recognising such
licence fees the management considers the substance of the relevant distribution agreement. Any work that the Group needs to undertake to fulfill
its obligation is taken into consideration and the period over which the work is likely to be performed. Revenue is only recognised provided that it is
probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured.
Normally such licence fees are received on signature of the distribution agreement.
2 Revenue and segmental information
The Group has one segment – the supply of monitors, consumables and support services associated with the use of the LiDCO’s cardiac monitoring
equipment. Geographical and product type analysis is used by the chief operating decision maker to monitor sales activity and is presented below:

Sales of monitors to Med One as detailed in Note 1 under revenue recognition during the year amounted to £nil (2008/09: £314,000). Payments
to Med One relating to consumables and included within cost of sales amounted to £688,000 (2008/09: £587,000) during the year.
The Group can identify trade receivables and trade payables relating to the geographical areas. As noted above, the Group has one segment and
other assets and liabilities together with non sales related overheads are not accounted for on a segment by segment basis. Accordingly, segment
assets, liabilities and segment cash flows are not provided.
All non-current assets are located in the United Kingdom.

The related deferred tax asset of approximately £6.7m (2009: £6.4m) has not been recognised due to the uncertainty of future taxable profits.
6 Loss per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of
shares in issue during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the calculation described above adjusted to allow for the
issue of shares on the assumed conversion of all dilutive options. Share options are regarded as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to
ordinary shares would increase the loss per share.

13 Financial instruments
Financial risks
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, borrowings and items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise
from its operations.
The main risks that arise from the Group’s financial instruments are credit, interest rate, liquidity and currency risk. The Board reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful
receivables, estimates by management based on prior experience of customers which is typified by a small number of high value accounts and their
assessment of the current economic environment. The maximum exposure is £3,370,000 (2009: £2,072,000).
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are reputable international banks.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage this financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity through the use of variable rate bank facilities is available to meet
foreseeable needs and to invest surplus cash assets safely and profitably.
Liquidity risk analysis
The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long term financial liabilities as well as cash-
outflows due in day-to-day business. Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis.
The Group maintains cash and marketable securities to meet its liquidity requirements. Funding for long-term liquidity needs is additionally secured
by an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
As at 31 January 2010, the Group’s liabilities have contractual maturities which are summarised below:
Current Non Current

Market risks
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of shareholder funds and variable rate bank facilities. The Group accepts the risk attached to
interest rate fluctuations as interest rates have been relatively stable or declined over the last three years and the interest expense is a small
proportion of total administrative expenses.
Currency risk
The Group manages currency risk by assessing the net exposure in each non-sterling currency in which exposure arises. The only significant
exposure relates to US dollars. The Group accepts the risk attached to fluctuations in the US dollar exchange rate as the US dollar based loan liability
and US dollar payables are party mitigated by US dollar receivables from sales. This risk reduced significantly during the year with the transfer of the
bulk of the US sales force to Aspect Medical Systems Inc.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to
shareholders through an optimal balance of debt and equity.
The Board reviews the capital structure, including the level of indebtedness and interest cover as required. As part of this review, the Board considers
the cost of capital and the risk associated with each class of capital.
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. The currency where the Group is most exposed to foreign currency
volatility is US dollars.
Transactions and balances of the subsidiaries are denominated in the local currency and had the following balances denominated in US dollars:
US Dollars
2010 2009

Cash and cash equivalents 394 79
Invoice discounting financing facility – (97)
Trade and other payables (37) (253)
436 305
No hedging instruments are used. The Group keeps under review the extent of its exposure to currency fluctuations, which relate entirely to trading
transactions.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net result for the year and equity in regards to the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities
and the sterling to US dollar exchange rates. It assumes a percentage change in the exchange rate based on the foreign currency financial
instruments held at each balance sheet date. Both of these percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange
rates in the previous 12 months.
US Dollars
2010 2009
Currency fluctuation 11% 25%
If sterling had strengthened against the US dollar by the percentage above retrospectively, then this would have had the following impact:
US Dollars

£’000 £’000
Net result for the year (76) (12)

US Dollars
2010 2009
£’000 £’000
Net result for the year 76 12
Equity 76 12
Exposure to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending on the volume of overseas transactions. Nonetheless, the analysis above is
considered to be representative of the Group’s exposure to currency risk.

Fair value is determined by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee or warrant holder. The expected life used in the model
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
These fair values for options granted during the year were calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following inputs:
2010 2009
Weighted average share price (p) 13.3 7.8
Weighted average exercise price (p) 13.3 7.8
Expected volatility 50% 40% – 45%
Expected life 3.5 3.5
Risk free rate 3.0%-3.5% 3.0%-3.5%
Expected dividend yield – –
The expected volatility is based on the Group’s historical share price averaged over a period equal to the expected life. The expected life is the
average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is based on the UK Government gilts. The share options outstanding at the end of
the year have exercise prices of between 0.5p and 28.25p per share. The weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding options
was 5.45 years.
Share warrants in respect of distributor arrangements
During the year the Group issued share warrants in respect of an arrangement with Aspect Medical Systems Inc. Warrants were issued over a total
of 13,915,324 shares at an exercise price of 14.3 pence which represented a 20% premium over the mid market price for a period of 10 days
before and 10 days after the date of the distributor agreement. The fair value of the warrants at the date of grant has been calculated using the
same pricing model as that used for the equity-settled share option schemes and will be charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
The distributor may exercise the warrants subject to purchasing certain minimum quantities of monitors and disposables during the first and second
years of the distribution agreement.

1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, the separate
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The principal accounting policies
of the Company are set out below.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has continued to invest in the development of its operations and in particular its direct
and indirect sales channels during the year. As a result the Group has continued to trade at a loss during the year ended 31 January 2010.
The Group finances its operations through shareholders’ funds and an overdraft facility. The directors have approved forecasts for the foreseeable
future, which indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds to trade during that period. During the year the Group appointed a new distributor
in the USA. As part of the agreement, the Group transferred the bulk of its US sales force to the distributor reducing US sales costs by about
£650,000 in a full year.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates
subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Share-based payment charges
The Group has two equity-settled share-based remuneration schemes for employees. Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value
of the options at the date of grant is calculated using a pricing model and is charged to the income statement over the vesting period. Market
related performance conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted and a charge is made irrespective of whether the market
related performance conditions are satisfied. In respect of awards with non market related performance conditions, an estimate of the proportion
that will vest is made at the award date which is adjusted if the number of share options expected to vest differs from the previous estimates. Any
cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period.
Where the Group issues share warrants in respect of distributor arrangements, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is calculated using
a pricing model and is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.

The amount due from subsidiary relates to the ongoing funding provided to the principal trading subsidiary, LiDCO Limited, whilst it continues to be
loss-making. The directors made a provision for impairment of £12m in the year to 31 January 2008, and consider that no further impairment
provision is necessary at 31 January 2010. The timing of the repayment of this debt is uncertain and unlikely to be within one year.

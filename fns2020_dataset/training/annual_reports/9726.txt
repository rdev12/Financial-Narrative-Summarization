Highlights
The Group’s performance in 2014 was badly 
affected hit by the impact of strong currency 
headwinds accounting for the six per cent 
decline in reported revenues. On a local currency 
basis, weaker revenues in Alexander Proudfoot 
were offset by a stronger performance in 
Kurt Salmon. We have invested in and taken 
action to restore growth and proﬁtability in 
Alexander Proudfoot and I am conﬁdent that 
we will begin to see the beneﬁts in 2015. 
Kurt Salmon has performed well in North 
America and other geographies and, despite 
continued macro economic weakness in 
France, it is now well placed to prosper in 
its core markets. 
Some of the signiﬁcant reduction in our 
proﬁtability has been caused by our decision 
to develop and invest in Alexander Proudfoot 
to establish a ﬁrm platform for future proﬁtable 
growth. After a long period during which it has 
been successful and proﬁtable we are investing 
in the business to establish Alexander Proudfoot 
on a clear growth path. In the short term the 
action we have taken has adversely affected 
our 2014 results but we believe that the changes 
we are making will lead to a better performing 
and less volatile business in the future. As 
previously announced in 2015 I will continue to 
support our Group Chief Executive, Nick Stagg, 
in his additional role as Chief Executive of 
Alexander Proudfoot. Proudfoot has a distinctive 
and valuable offering in a crowded consulting 
market and we need to preserve and enhance 
what makes it different and compelling to clients.
Kurt Salmon had a good start to 2014 and 
despite some signs of weakness in the third 
quarter, it delivered a strong performance 
towards the end of the year, which bodes 
well for 2015. In its French business, 
revenues are stable and margins in 2014 
beneﬁted from the management action taken 
in 2013 to adjust resources to lower activity 
levels. We saw positive underlying trends in 
revenue elsewhere in Europe. In North America 
Kurt Salmon delivered an excellent performance 
and our challenge now is to respond to 
improving demand by growing our capacity 
to deliver, which may affect margins in 2015 
as we recruit. Kurt Salmon continues to beneﬁt 
from increasing work in digital transformation 
for clients across all sectors, and it has 
developed a real expertise here which is proving 
to be a competitive advantage.
The Group remains in a good ﬁnancial position. 
Despite weaker proﬁts in 2014 we have 
produced strong operating cash ﬂows and have 
reduced our net indebtedness further in the 
year to £33.6m at the year end. The Board is 
proposing to maintain the dividend for the full 
year at 0.825p per share. 
Kurt Salmon and Alexander Proudfoot are 
long established and successful consulting 
businesses with a superb portfolio of clients 
and highly capable employees. The Board 
of MCG will continue to focus on promoting 
proﬁtable growth in these businesses to beneﬁt 
our shareholders.

Chief Executive’s review

Overview 
The Group’s proﬁt performance in 2014 was 
affected by currency headwinds, weaker 
revenues in Alexander Proudfoot and the 
adverse impact on proﬁt of the change 
initiatives being implemented in that business 
to build a more ﬂexible model focused on 
proﬁtable growth. As a consequence, 
Alexander Proudfoot reported a small loss 
in 2014 but the Board believes that the current 
strategy for the business will deliver an 
improved performance in 2015 and beyond.
In Kurt Salmon, revenues on a constant currency 
basis increased in 2014 from the previous year 
and the underlying operating proﬁt margin also 
increased slightly. Continued weakness in its 
key French market has contrasted with 
impressive revenue growth in the North 
American operations, and the business is 
well placed to beneﬁt from further growth 
opportunities in 2015.
MCG operates globally, with 96% of revenues 
in 2014 coming from projects delivered outside 
the UK. The same proportion of the Group’s 
revenues in the year were billed in currencies 
other than Sterling and most of these currencies 
weakened signiﬁcantly (in terms of average 
exchange rates) between 2013 and 2014. 
All of the 6% reported reduction in Group 
revenues in to 2014 is attributable 
to currency translation.
MCG’s strategy is to exploit the platform 
provided by its existing businesses to drive 
organic revenue and margin growth. We have 
no current intention to make large scale 
acquisitions but will look to add capabilities 
where appropriate through smaller acquisitions 
and team hires. We will focus on opportunities 
in growth markets and industry sectors where 
we can readily exploit our strengths. The 
geographical spread of our businesses and 
our existing global ofﬁce infrastructure will 
support an increase in operational activity.

Results for the year
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 
2014 was £242.8m, 6% lower than the 
previous year (2013: £257.3m). As noted, 
currency headwinds had a signiﬁcant effect 
on reported revenues in both of MCG’s 
businesses, accounting for all of the year 
on year reduction. Alexander Proudfoot’s 
revenues on a constant currency basis 
in 2014 were 4% lower than those in the 
previous year, with both ﬁrst and second half 
reported revenues in the order of £30m, in 
contrast to 2013, which beneﬁted from 
a much stronger second half. On the same 
constant currency basis, and excluding the 
Cleversys business sold in 2013, Kurt Salmon’s 
revenues increased by more than 4% from 
the previous year.
Underlying operating proﬁt in 2014 was £11.8m 
(2013: £21.2m), the £9.4m reduction principally 
reﬂecting the impact of lower revenues and 
margins in Alexander Proudfoot, resulting in 
a loss for the year as a whole in that business 
of £1.6m. Underlying operating proﬁt in Kurt 
Salmon was slightly lower than the previous 
year in absolute terms at £13.4m, although 
the margin improved slightly on 2013.
Underlying operating proﬁt for 2014 reﬂects 
a charge of £2.4m relating to share awards 
made to employees (2013: £3.9m). During 
the year 105 senior employees received 
awards over approximately 9.4 million shares 
in total, generally vesting over three years 
and conditional upon continued employment, 
and in some cases also subject to ﬁnancial 
or share price performance. At the year end 
there were outstanding awards in place over 
35.5 million shares relating to 141 employees 
(2013: 48.8 million shares and 135 employees). 
Some 24.0 million of these share awards, 
should they vest, are required to be satisﬁed 
from existing MCG shares and the other awards 
may be satisﬁed from existing or new shares. 
The Group’s employee beneﬁt trusts held 
8.5 million shares at the year end for this 
purpose and a further 2.4 million treasury 
shares were held by the Group which may be 
used to satisfy share awards. 
The Group’s reported non-recurring expenses 
of £2.9m in 2014 (2013: £1.5m), which are 
largely related to the change initiatives 
implemented in Alexander Proudfoot and 
mainly comprises redundancy costs and the 
costs associated with the departure of the 
former Chief Executive of that business in 
March 2014.
The charge for amortisation of acquired 
intangibles was £0.8m (2013: £2.2m). 
Consequently the proﬁt from operations 
decreased to £8.1m (2013: £17.5m), 
representing a margin of 3.3% (2013: 6.8%). 
The net interest expense was lower at 
£3.2m (2013: £3.5m). In accordance with 
IAS 19R the reported net interest charge for 
2014 includes an imputed charge in relation 
to deﬁned beneﬁt pensions of £0.8m 
(2013: £1.2m). 
The proﬁt before tax was lower at £4.9m 
(2013: £14.0m). The tax charge was £5.9m 
(2013: £4.9m). After adjusting for non-underlying 
items, the underlying effective tax rate was 
89% (2013: 34%). The signiﬁcant increase 
in the tax charge and the underlying tax rate 
in 2014 reﬂects the impact of project-speciﬁc 
tax charges in the Alexander Proudfoot 
business in certain geographies, together 
with revenue-based taxes or unrelieved losses 
in certain jurisdictions. A large component 
of the £5.9m tax charge for the year is a £2.8m 
non-cash item relating to the utilisation of part 
of the deferred tax asset relating to brought 
forward losses.
Consequently, there was a loss for the year 
attributable to the shareholders of £1.0m 
(2013: a proﬁt of £9.1m). Underlying earnings 
per share were 0.2p (2013: 2.4p) and the basic 
loss per share was 0.2p (2013: EPS 1.9p).

Annual report and accounts 2014
Balance sheet and dividend
The weak ﬁrst half revenue performance 
in Alexander Proudfoot resulted in net debt 
rising to £48.0m at the half year stage; however, 
strong cash generation from operations in the 
second half reduced net debt by £14.4m to 
£33.6m at the end of the year (2013: £39.8m). 
This equates to 2.04x adjusted EBITDA for 
2014 as measured for the purpose of the 
Group’s borrowing facility, an increase from 
1.46x at the previous year end, reﬂecting lower 
proﬁts in 2014. As a precautionary measure 
in order to provide some additional headroom 
the maximum leverage covenant has been 
increased at the next two quarterly testing 
dates in March and June 2015, from 2.75x to 3x. 
Positive working capital movements meant that 
cash generated by operations was £17.6m, 
signiﬁcantly higher than in the previous year 
(2013: £6.7m).
During 2014 the Group’s employee beneﬁt 
trusts purchased 3.8 million of the Company’s 
ordinary shares of 1p each for a total 
consideration of £1.0m. 
The interim dividend for 2014 of 0.23p per share 
was paid on 6 January 2015. The Board is 
recommending, subject to shareholder approval, 
an unchanged total dividend for the year 
of 0.825p per share. The directors therefore 
recommend, subject to shareholder approval, 
a ﬁnal dividend for 2014 of 0.595p per share to 
be paid on 7 July 2015 to shareholders on the 
register on 15 May 2015. 
Summary 
The Group’s reported results for 2014 are in line 
with our revised expectations highlighted in 
the trading update on 6 October 2014. The 
primary driver of what is a disappointing overall 
result for the Group was the performance of 
Alexander Proudfoot, which experienced a 
year of planned change and weak revenues, 
and strong currency headwinds. 
Alexander Proudfoot has been a successful 
and highly proﬁtable business for many years 
but it has always suffered from volatility in its 
revenues from quarter to quarter and has not 
been able to grow revenues consistently year 
on year. The MCG Board decided in March 2014 
to make a number of changes designed in 
part to mitigate revenue volatility, but primarily 
to restore the growth potential of business 
for the longer term. This has involved some 
investment and additional cost, and consequent 
margin erosion in 2014, which unfortunately 
has coincided with a year in which revenues 
were weak in both the ﬁrst and second halves. 
As a result the business has reported a small 
underlying operating loss for the ﬁrst time in 
more than a decade. Good progress has been 
made with the “growth plan” initiatives so 
far and these continue in 2015, with some 
further adverse margin impact this year but 
alongside an encouraging revenue trend 
at this stage of the year, which, if maintained, 
should restore the business to proﬁtability.
Kurt Salmon’s performance provided a 
contrast between its two largest markets 
in France and North America, which each 
produced around 40% of divisional revenues. 
In North America both the retail and consumer 
goods and the healthcare practices produced 
excellent underlying revenue growth in 
US Dollars and good margins. In France 
activity levels were broadly ﬂat year on year, 
although total revenues in Euros were slightly 
lower than 2013 in a market which continues 
to be affected by macro economic weakness 
and shows few clear signs of growth. In overall 
terms Kurt Salmon increased underlying 
revenues on a constant currency basis by more 
than 4% and slightly increased its underlying 
operating proﬁt margin, but currency headwinds 
led to a reported decrease in revenue and 
proﬁt in absolute terms.
Net debt has decreased year on year to £33.6m 
(2013: £39.8m) and remains at a comfortable 
level in relation to the Group’s bank facility and 
covenant requirements. The normal phasing 
of cash ﬂows means that indebtedness tends 
to increase towards the half year stage with 
stronger cash generation in the second half 
of the year, as was the case in 2014.

Outlook
Kurt Salmon has had a good start to 2015, with 
continuing strong demand in North America. 
In France our business has seen some beneﬁt 
in the ﬁrst two months of the year from a slightly 
more optimistic outlook amongst some clients, 
perhaps partly in anticipation of a positive 
impact on businesses from a weaker Euro 
and Quantitative Easing in the Eurozone. 
The current order book in Kurt Salmon is 
slightly higher than the same period last year. 
For Kurt Salmon overall, we expect the trends 
we saw in 2014 to continue in 2015. As we 
increase the pace of recruitment this year 
in our growth markets, there is likely to be 
some negative margin impact in the short 
term before new senior employees become 
fully productive.
Alexander Proudfoot has had a satisfactory start 
to 2015. There is a promising pipeline of 
opportunities at this stage, although the current 
order book is a little lower than the same stage 
last year and the rate of order input will need 
to build from current levels to meet our 
objectives over the course of the year as a 
whole. The new and enhanced offerings which 
we have developed have had some recent 
success with clients. The investment and 
change initiatives that we launched in 2014 are 
continuing this year and will continue have some 
adverse effect on proﬁtability, as we build a 
ﬁrmer platform to generate revenue growth. 
Recent shifts in exchange rates, if they persist, 
are likely to have some impact on MCG’s 
reported results in 2015 compared with 2014. 
The Group’s reported results will beneﬁt from 
a stronger US Dollar, but a weaker Euro will 
have the opposite effect on reported revenues 
and proﬁts in Sterling.
We will continue to work to develop 
our businesses with selective investment 
and recruitment in those sectors and 
geographies where there are good 
prospects for proﬁtable growth in order 
to deliver value to our shareholders.

Our approach 
The most successful organisations integrate 
strategic insight, operational excellence and 
a deep understanding of their customers. 
They take an integrated approach, refusing 
to compromise between these key 
components of competitive advantage. 
So does Kurt Salmon.
Succeeding today is not enough. The world’s

it delivering “success for what’s next”.
Digital disruption is the new normal

At Kurt Salmon we help our clients to

Results for the year
Kurt Salmon’s reported revenue for 2014 
was £181.9m, £6.6m or 3.5% lower than 
2013 revenues of £188.5m. Revenues in 
2013 included £5.0m from the Cleversys 
business, which was sold in September of 
that year. On a constant currency basis 2014 
revenues would have been £191.7m, an 
increase of 2% on the previous year, or more 
than 4% if the Cleversys revenues in 2013 
are excluded. 
Underlying operating proﬁt for 2014 was £13.4m 
(2013: £13.8m), representing a slightly improved 
margin of 7.4% (2013: 7.3%). 
The number of staff employed by Kurt Salmon 
increased during the year from 1,131 at the 
end of 2013 to 1,161 at the end of 2014. The 
overall increase in headcount mainly reﬂects 
a deliberate increase in capacity in North 
America in response to growth in demand, 
whilst in Europe there has been some net 
recruitment on a smaller scale. Kurt Salmon 
continues to recruit in the higher growth 
sectors and geographies within the business. 
Average headcount during 2014 was lower 
than the previous year at 1,140 (2013: 1,227), 
reﬂecting the impact of the initiatives which 
reduced headcount during 2013.

Review of operations
Kurt Salmon is organised on the basis of 
geography and global industry verticals. 
Kurt Salmon has its headquarter operations 
in Paris and New York. In Continental 
Europe, Kurt Salmon operates from ofﬁces 
in France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg 
and Switzerland. It operates in the UK from 
MCG’s head ofﬁce location in London, and 
in the US from ofﬁces in New York, Atlanta 
and San Francisco. In Asia, Kurt Salmon has 
ofﬁces in Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Kurt Salmon’s operations in North America 
represent nearly 40% of the division as a whole, 
the largest element of which is the retail and 
consumer goods practice which contributed 
nearly two thirds of North American revenues 
in 2014. This practice delivered an impressive 
performance in 2014, growing revenues by 
more than 12% on a constant currency basis. 
The business has beneﬁted from increasing 
demand from US retail clients facing the 
challenges of adapting business models 
and operations to a digital environment. 
Kurt Salmon’s healthcare consulting practice 
represents around 20% of North American 
revenues and continued to make good progress, 
growing revenues by nearly 7% on a constant 
currency basis. Kurt Salmon’s other activities 
in North America are represented by its 
New York based ﬁnancial sector and related 
CIO advisory practices, which, in aggregate, 
delivered slightly lower year on year revenues 
on a constant currency basis. 
Kurt Salmon’s French consulting practice 
produced about 40% of divisional revenues 
in 2014 and market conditions in France have 
therefore continued to be a key driver for the 
business as a whole. Kurt Salmon remains a 
leader in the French management consulting 
market with a stable blue chip client base and 
a high proportion of its annual revenues derived 
from clients who have been commissioning 
work from Kurt Salmon for many years. 
Demand for Kurt Salmon’s services was 
broadly stable during the year, but the year 
did not bring clear signs of growth in the 
French market and business sentiment 
remained fragile. Overall revenues in France 
were some 4% lower than the previous year 
on a constant currency basis but this was 
exacerbated in terms of reported results by 
the weaker Euro. Headcount in France 
increased slightly during 2014, mainly through 
recruitment at more junior levels.
Elsewhere in Europe, Kurt Salmon’s 
operations in the UK, Germany, Luxembourg, 
Belgium and Switzerland together 
represented approximately 15% of total 
divisional revenues in 2014. In aggregate 
these other European practices performed 
well in 2014, generating near double-digit 
revenue growth on a constant currency basis, 
led by a particularly strong performance from 
the retail practices in Germany and the UK.
In Asia the Kurt Salmon retail consulting 
operations in China and Japan have continued 
to make progress but these are relatively small 
components of the division as a whole and 
reported revenues in 2014 were affected by 
signiﬁcant currency headwinds.
The overall underlying operating proﬁt margin 
for Kurt Salmon overall in 2014 was slightly 
better than the previous year at 7.4%, on 
slightly lower reported revenues. While 
margins in the French business remain 
weaker than those in North America at this 
stage, France remains an important and 
proﬁtable market for Kurt Salmon. In Kurt 
Salmon’s North American operations there 
are good short term prospects for organic 
growth and management will continue 
to explore opportunities for investment, 
recognising the need to balance the impact 
of costs associated with promoting growth 
initiatives with the overall proﬁtability of 
the business.

Results for the year
Alexander Proudfoot’s reported revenue for 
2014 was 12% lower than 2013 at £60.9m 
(2013: £68.8m). The year on year comparison 
has been affected by a signiﬁcant negative 
currency translation effect; at constant 
exchange rates, 2014 revenues would have 
been £66.2m, a decrease of 4% on 2013. 
The business reported a broadly break-even 
position for the ﬁrst half of 2014 on revenues 
of £31.3m and a loss of £1.7m in the second 
half on slightly weaker revenues of £29.6m, 
compared with underlying operating proﬁt of 
£7.4m and a margin of 10.8% for 2013 as a 
whole. The loss for 2014 reﬂects both the 
margin impact of weaker revenues and, as 
expected, the impact of additional expenses 
and investment associated with the change 
initiatives announced in March 2014. 
The number of staff employed by Alexander 
Proudfoot decreased from 337 at the end 
of 2013 to 327 at the end of 2014. Whilst 
overall headcount has reduced slightly at 
the year end there has been investment 
in people and capabilities during 2014, in 
particular in adding industry sector expertise 
and strengthening the team of executives 
responsible for business development. Average 
headcount during 2014 was slightly higher 
than the previous year at 343 (2013: 332).

Review of operations 
During 2014 Alexander Proudfoot was organised 
on the basis of six business units: Europe, 
North America, Africa, Brazil, Chile and Hong 
Kong. The business is headquartered 
in Atlanta in the US. Alexander Proudfoot serves 
clients globally and, frequently, the project 
delivery location lies outside the geography 
of the business unit from which it is sold and 
managed. In the second quarter of 2014 a 
dedicated natural resources business unit 
was established, working across geographies. 
Alexander Proudfoot had a slow start to 2014. 
The opening order book at the beginning of 
the year was stronger than at the same time 
in 2013 but the rate of order input in the ﬁrst 
quarter was lower than in the second half of 
2013 and so revenues were consequently 
weaker. There was some improvement in 
order input at the half year stage but the third 
quarter was disappointing and saw the 
postponement of certain signiﬁcant planned 
client projects from 2014 to 2015, affecting the 
North American business unit in particular. As 
a result the trading update on 6 October 2014 
reported that MCG expected Alexander 
Proudfoot to deliver second half revenues in 
2014 close to those in the ﬁrst half of the 
year and a small operating loss for the year 
as a whole; actual results for the year are in 
line with these revised expectations. 
The revenue weakness in 2014 was not 
obviously driven by common macro economic 
factors across all geographies. Revenues in 
the North American business unit, representing 
around one third of total revenues in 2014, were 
signiﬁcantly weaker than in 2013. In Europe, 
2014 revenues were broadly stable versus 2013. 
Elsewhere the business units in Brazil and Africa 
reported weaker revenues, whilst revenues 
from the business units in Latin America and 
Asia were higher than the previous year.
The proportion of work for clients in the natural 
resources sector was higher than in 2013, 
at around half the total revenue for the year 
(2013: approximately one third), and higher 
in absolute terms. Alexander Proudfoot 
continues to excel in this sector, where 
the business has a distinctive offering well 
suited to the practical operational issues 
faced by its clients in often difﬁcult locations. 
Alexander Proudfoot’s work in natural resources 
is diverse, ranging from precious metals to 
aggregates and phosphates. Work for clients 
in the oil and gas sector has been a relatively 
small proportion of the total and has not been 
signiﬁcantly affected by falling oil prices. 
Alexander Proudfoot has continued to ﬁnd 
success across a range of other industries, 
with the ﬁnancial services and manufacturing 
sectors again being the most signiﬁcant sources 
of revenue after natural resources clients. 
In March 2014 the then Chief Executive of 
Alexander Proudfoot stepped down and the 
MCG Board announced that it intended to 
invest in and develop the Alexander 
Proudfoot offering in order to help build a more 
stable and predictable revenue base and drive 
top-line growth. A series of initiatives has been 
implemented to enhance sales and operations, 
introduce innovations relating to the offering 
and explore new contracting models with 
clients. Good progress was made during 2014 
with these changes which we believe will in 
time deliver improved performance. As 
previously reported, these initiatives have 
required investment principally in recruitment 
and lower utilisation and have had an adverse 
effect on underlying proﬁt in 2014 estimated 
at more than £2m in the year, compounding 
the margin impact of weaker than expected 
revenues. Much of the focus of the change 
initiatives has been on the North American 
operations and the adverse margin impact 
in 2014 has been most apparent here. 
Alexander Proudfoot has a unique and 
compelling offering that produces real and 
sustainable performance improvement for 
its clients. The business has a global reach 
and a ﬂexible capability and is well placed 
to grow in those industry sectors where 
it has a strong track record of success, 
in both developed and emerging markets. 
It continues to operate very effectively in 
emerging market locations and in 2014 nearly 
60% of total revenues related to work delivered 
outside North America and Western Europe 
(2013: nearly 50%). The strategy of the 
MCG Board and the Alexander Proudfoot 
management team is to build on these existing 
strengths, and to develop and invest in the 
offering, in order to provide a more stable 
revenue base and establish a sound platform 
for long-term proﬁtable growth.

This is driven by the Board. Emphasis is placed 
on ensuring that we continue to create and 
maintain trust in and loyalty to our Group by 
all our stakeholders. 
The Board is responsible for the social, 
environmental and ethical (“SEE“) impact 
of the Group’s business and ensures that any 
risks arising are being managed appropriately. 
On an annual basis the Board assesses the 
Group’s exposure to SEE matters based 
on feedback from management. Overall, for 
the current year the Board has concluded that 
the Group’s exposure to SEE risks is limited, 
primarily due to the nature of its operations. 
Further information on the environmental and 
ethical policies adopted is provided below.
The Group has an active corporate social 
responsibility agenda which covers work 
with various non-proﬁt organisations and 
government ministries. 
Human rights and health 
and safety requirements
The Group is committed to achieving and 
maintaining the highest standards of health, 
safety and welfare and human rights for its 
employees throughout the world. Employees 
are the Group’s most important asset and 
their health and safety is critical to business 
performance by reducing the costs associated

 Overview
 Strategic report
 Governance
 Financials
The Group aims to comply with all laws, 
regulations and ofﬁcial guidelines relating to 
health and safety and human rights in all its 
ofﬁces throughout the world. Due to the many 
different locations of the Group’s ofﬁces, 
the Group does not have a single detailed 
worldwide policy. Instead, it is the responsibility 
of a senior employee in each ofﬁce to ensure 
that his or her ofﬁce meets the high standards 
for which the Group aims.
Group ethics
The Group subscribes to the Association 
of Management Consulting Firms’ Code 
of Ethics (available at www.amcf.org) and, 
in the UK, the Code of Practice of the UK 
Management Consultancies Association 
(available at www.mca.org.uk).
The codes of ethics conform to regulatory 
and legislative initiatives and assure the users 
of consulting services that members are 
publicly committed to providing the highest 
quality work. 
Whistleblowing
The Board considers the ﬁnancial management 
team as holding an important role in corporate 
governance, having both the responsibility 
and authority to protect, balance and 
preserve the interests of all stakeholders. 
All employees can voice their concerns 
about any unethical behaviour through a 
conﬁdential internal whistleblowing process.
Employees
The Group operates in an increasing number 
of countries and its employment practices 
vary to meet local requirements and best 
practices within a framework established 
by the Group.
It is Group policy that all people be treated with 
dignity and respect. The Group is committed to 
providing and fostering a working environment 
that is free from harassment, discrimination, 
victimisation or bullying.
Our ability to operate as a high performing 
organisation depends on our inclusion of 
people who come from diverse backgrounds. 
This is particularly the case given the wide 
geographical spread of the Group’s operations. 
It is Group policy to ensure equal opportunities 
exist without discrimination for all employees, 
irrespective of their race, colour, creed, religion, 
gender, ancestry, citizenship, sexual preference, 
marital status, national origin, age, pregnancy, 
disability or any other reason prohibited by 
the laws of the individual countries in which 
it operates. This applies with respect to 
recruitment, promotion, compensation, transfer, 
retention, training and other employment 
actions. In South Africa the Group operates 
positive discrimination in respect of previously 
disadvantaged individuals. Wherever possible 
the employment of members of staff who 
become disabled will be continued and 
appropriate training and career development 
will be offered.
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on the 
involvement of its employees and has continued 
to keep them informed on matters affecting 
them as employees and on the various factors 
affecting the performance of the Group. 
This is achieved through formal and informal 
meetings. The Chief Executive has a travel 
schedule which includes all the business 
locations and holds informal discussions with 
a wide range of employees. The Group operates 
various bonus schemes for employees, which 
are linked to the proﬁtability of the business 
unit and the Group. 24

Our impact
As a member of the FTSE4Good index, the Group ensures 


Environmental policy
The Group’s environmental policy aims 
to minimise, where practical, the Group’s 
impact on the environment. 
As a group of professional services companies, 
the Group’s business has a relatively small 
impact on the environment. Nevertheless, the 
Board recognises the quality of the environment 
in which it operates is a concern for its 
stakeholders and others in the community and 
consequently is essential to the long-term 
ﬁnancial performance of the Group.
As a member of the FTSE4Good index, the 
Group ensures that all laws, regulations and 
ofﬁcial guidelines in the countries in which 
it operates are complied with. The Group 
is also a member of the United Nations 
Global Compact.
The Group’s Environmental Ofﬁcer is 
responsible for the ongoing monitoring 
of areas where the Group could have an 
impact on the environment and takes steps 
to reduce this impact. These are detailed 
below. Reviews of the quantitative impact 
on the environment in these and other areas 
will continue to be undertaken to enable 
the Group’s environmental performance 
to be assessed and further improved.
Waste and recycling
The increase in waste generated is a serious 
problem in many of the countries in which 
the Group operates. The shortage of new 
landﬁll sites in these countries is well 
documented, as are the potential health 
impacts and carbon dioxide emissions 
caused by landﬁll sites.
Energy use and climate change
Carbon dioxide is one of the most signiﬁcant 
air pollutants as a by product of energy 
consumption and is the major contributor 
to the “enhanced greenhouse gas effect“. 
We continue with the programme to measure 
the amount of electricity being used in our 
largest ofﬁces, to identify where reductions 
can be made in the future.
Due to the nature of the business and the need 
for employees with appropriate experience to 
work on projects, employees regularly need 
to travel to clients’ sites. The Group’s employees 
are encouraged, wherever possible, to share 
private road transport or use public transport.

Whilst further improvements are being 
targeted, the Group continues to progress in 
reducing energy consumption. The principal 
methods adopted by the Group to reduce 
energy consumption are as follows:
 – installing automatic power off systems 
on lights and certain equipment;
 – using energy efﬁcient lighting;
 – using time switches on air conditioning 
systems; and
 – reducing travel by making use of video 
conferencing and web-based facilities.

Financial review
Highlights Exchange rates
MCG derives the vast majority of its revenue 
and proﬁt from outside the UK and in currencies 
other than Sterling. As the Group’s results 
are presented in Sterling, changes in average 
exchange rates, particularly those of the 
US Dollar and the Euro in relation to Sterling, 
can have a signiﬁcant effect on the translation 
of those results. On average in 2014 compared 
with 2013, Sterling strengthened by 
approximately 5% against the Euro, the 
currency in which around 45% of the Group’s 
revenues were denominated. About 40% of 
the Group’s 2014 revenues were generated 
in US Dollars and Sterling strengthened against 
the US Dollar, also by approximately 5%. The 
average exchange rates used to translate the 
2014 results were £1=$1.6494 (2013: 
£1=$1.5653) for the US Dollar and £1=€1.2411 
(2013: £1=€1.1781) for the Euro. Sterling also 
strengthened signiﬁcantly during 2014 against 
the Brazilian Real (by 13%), South African 
Rand (by 15%) and Japanese Yen (by 12%), 
which had a signiﬁcant adverse impact on the 
reported results of the Alexander Proudfoot 
operations in Brazil and South Africa and 
the Kurt Salmon operations in Asia. In overall 
terms, changes in average exchange rates 
had a signiﬁcant negative effect on reported 
revenue for the Group as a whole in 2014.
Whilst the translation impact on reported 
revenues of changes in exchange rates has 
been signiﬁcant, the proﬁt impact of exchange 
rate shifts is mitigated by the large degree 
of natural hedging in the Group’s operations 
in that its expenses are broadly denominated 
in a similar mix of currencies to its revenues. 
However, the proportion of the Group’s 
expenses that are denominated in Sterling 
is somewhat higher than revenues in that 
currency and therefore does have some 
negative impact on reported Group proﬁt 
margins when Sterling has strengthened.
Revenue
Total revenue for 2014 was £14.5m lower than 
the previous year at £242.8m (2013: £257.3m). 
The decrease in revenue reﬂects lower reported 
revenues both in the Kurt Salmon business 
and in Alexander Proudfoot, although all of the 
6% reduction is accounted for by the currency 
translation effects of stronger Sterling. 
Alexander Proudfoot accounted for 25% of 
Group revenue (2013: 27%) and Kurt Salmon 
for 75% (2013: 73%).
Alexander Proudfoot reported 2014 revenues 
12% lower than the previous year at £60.9m 
(2013: £68.8m), much of which is attributable 
to signiﬁcant negative currency translation 
effect. At 2013 exchange rates, 2014 revenues 
would have been £66.2m, a decrease of 4% 
on 2013. 
Kurt Salmon’s revenues for the year were 
3.5% lower than the previous year at £181.9m 
(2013: £188.5m). On a constant currency basis 
2014 revenues would have been £191.7m, an 
increase of 2% on the previous year, or more 
than 4% if 2013 revenues from the Cleversys 
business (sold in September 2013) are excluded.

 Overview

 Governance
 Financials
In terms of geography for the Group as a 
whole, the business units in the Americas 
reported a 5% decrease in revenue to £103.2m 
(2013: £108.4m). Revenue from the Americas 
accounted for 43% of Group revenue 
(2013: 42%). Revenues from Europe 
decreased by 7% to £120.1m (2013: £129.7m), 
slightly reducing its share of total Group revenues 
to 49% (2013: 50%). The Rest of the World, 
with revenues predominantly from Africa, 
Japan and China, accounted for 8% of Group 
revenue (2013: 7%) at £19.5m (2013: £19.2m). 
Segmental revenues are reported on the basis 
of the location of the business unit where the 
client project is sold and the revenue accounted 
for, which is the basis on which the Group’s 
operations are managed. This may differ from 
the geography in which the project is delivered, 
particularly in the Alexander Proudfoot 
business. As in previous years, a proportion 
of the revenues generated in the European 
and North American business units of 
Alexander Proudfoot in 2014 related to 
services which were delivered elsewhere, 
in Latin America, Africa and Asia. As a result, 
in 2014 approximately 20% (2013: 17%) 
of overall Group revenues related to work 
delivered outside North America and 
Western Europe. Revenue from projects 
delivered in the UK accounted for less than 
4% of total Group revenue in 2014.
Employees
There were 1,509 people employed in the 
Group at the end of 2014 compared to 1,490 
at the end of 2013, reﬂecting net recruitment 
in Kurt Salmon. The average number of 
people employed by the Group during the 
year was 1,504 (2013: 1,581).
Underlying operating proﬁt
Underlying operating proﬁt in 2014 was £9.4m 
lower at £11.8m (2013: £21.2m). This chieﬂy 
reﬂects the weaker revenue and margin 
performance in Alexander Proudfoot. As a 
result the underlying operating proﬁt margin 
for the Group as a whole decreased from 
8.2% in 2013 to 4.9% in 2014.
Underlying operating proﬁt in 2014 reﬂected 
a charge of £2.4m relating to share awards 
(2013: £3.9m). Excluding the cost of share 
awards, underlying operating proﬁt was £14.2m, 
which represents a margin of 5.8% (2013: 
£25.1m and 9.8%).
Alexander Proudfoot reported a loss of £1.6m 
(2013: a proﬁt of £7.4m) on total revenues, 12% 
lower than the previous year. Kurt Salmon 
reported a slightly lower underlying operating 
proﬁt of £13.4m (2013: £13.8m) and slightly 
improved margin of 7.4% (2013: 7.3%). 
Non-recurring costs
The Group is reporting non-recurring expenses 
of £2.9m in 2014 (2013: £1.5m). Restructuring 
costs arising from planned management action 
in Alexander Proudfoot, including costs 
associated with the departure of the former 
Chief Executive of that business in March 2014, 
account for £2.4m of the total. These 
non-recurring costs were related to the 
wider change initiatives being implemented 
in Alexander Proudfoot. Some additional 
redundancy costs related to Kurt Salmon 
are also included.
Proﬁt from operations
The charge for the amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets was £0.8m (2013: £2.2m). 
Consequently the proﬁt from operations 
decreased to £8.1m (2013: £17.5m), 
a margin of 3.3% (2013: 6.8%).
Interest
The total interest payable on borrowings was 
£2.4m (2013: £2.4m). Taking into account 
interest received on bank deposits and ﬁnance 
charges related to retirement beneﬁt plans, 
the total net ﬁnance charge was £3.2m 
(2013: £3.5m).
The interest margin paid on the outstanding 
balance of the debt drawn under the borrowing 
facility in place during 2014 was 2.25%–2.75% 
above Euribor and US Dollar Libor (2013: 
2.25%–2.75%).

Taxation
The total taxation expense for the year was 
£5.9m (2013: £4.9m). After adjusting for 
non-underlying items, the underlying effective 
tax rate was 89% (2013: 34%). The increase 
in the underlying tax rate in 2014 reﬂects 
the impact of project-speciﬁc tax charges in 
the Alexander Proudfoot business in certain 
geographies, revenue-based taxes in some 
geographies which in some cases have not 
allowed the business to take advantage of 
cost deductions at the corporate level, and 
unrelieved losses, in certain tax jurisdictions. 
A signiﬁcant component of the £5.9m total 
tax charge is a £2.8m non-cash expense 
relating to utilisation of part of the deferred 
tax asset.
The Group still has tax losses in various 
jurisdictions upon which no deferred tax asset 
has been recognised as the ability to utilise 
these tax losses is uncertain and dependent 
on trading proﬁtability, a factor which tends 
to increase the effective tax rate. The remaining 
tax losses available to the Group which are 
likely to be utilised are reﬂected in the deferred 
tax assets in the Group balance sheet.
Earnings per share
The Group reported a loss for the year 
attributable to the shareholders of £1.0m 
(2013: proﬁt of £9.1m). This generated a 
basic loss per share of 0.2p (2013: EPS 1.9p). 
Underlying earnings per share, after 
adjusting  for non-recurring items and the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, were 
lower at 0.2p (2013: 2.4p).
Net assets
The Group holds the vast majority of its assets 
and liabilities in currencies other than Sterling, 
particularly the US Dollar and the Euro, and 
translates the value of these into Sterling 
at the year end exchange rate. Comparing 
exchange rates at the beginning and the end 
of 2013, Sterling strengthened against the Euro 
by 6.6% and weakened against the US Dollar 
by 5.5%. This had the net effect of reducing the 
Sterling value of the Group’s assets and liabilities 
at the end of 2014. The year end exchange rates 
used to translate the 2014 balance sheet were 
£1=$1.5560 (2013: £1=$1.6471) for the 
US Dollar and £1=€1.2757 (2013: £1=€1.1970) 
for the Euro. During 2014 net assets decreased 
to £197.7m (2013: £210.9m), principally due to 
the net impact of currency movements.
The largest item on the balance sheet is the 
intangible asset recognised on the acquisitions 
of the businesses that now form Kurt Salmon 
of £210.6m (2013: £213.8m). This is held in 
US Dollars and Euros. Net trade receivables 
decreased to £40.7m (2013: £45.0m) and 
accrued income decreased to £15.2m 
(2013: £17.0m), reﬂecting lower revenues 
versus 2013 and improved billing and collection 
at the 2014 year end. Debtor days (in relation 
to trade receivables) at the end of 2014 were 
49 days (2013: 62 days). Accruals increased 
slightly to £38.5m (2013: £37.8m). Long-term 
provisions decreased to £4.9m (2013: £5.3m), 
largely reﬂecting the unwinding of provisions 
for surplus property.
Pension obligations
The Group’s retirement beneﬁts liability relates 
to: a closed US deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme; 
a closed US post-retirement medical beneﬁts 
plan; French statutory retirement provisions; 
and an unfunded German retirement obligation. 
There are no deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes 
in the Group that are open to new employees 
and, in the case of the closed US deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension scheme, the existing members 
are not accruing further beneﬁts. The Group 
actively manages the potential liabilities arising 
from these schemes, regularly reviewing 
performance in conjunction with qualiﬁed 
independent actuaries and making changes 
where appropriate. The net post-retirement 
obligation for these schemes increased from 
£19.6m at 31 December 2013 to £22.9m at 
31 December 2014, principally as a result of 
the use of lower discount rates in calculating 
the obligations. Cash contributions to the US 
deﬁned beneﬁt scheme amounted to £1.2m 
in 2014 (2013: £1.2m).
Liquidity and capital resources
The Group’s capital structure is reviewed 
regularly to ensure that it remains relevant 
to the business and its planned development. 
During 2014 the trustees of the Management 
Consulting Group PLC employee beneﬁt trusts 
purchased 3.8 million of the Company’s shares, 
for a total consideration of £1.0m, for use in 
satisfying future awards under the Company’s 
employee share incentive plans.
At 31 December 2014 2.4 million shares 
purchased by the Company were held 
as treasury shares and were therefore 
excluded from the reported share capital 
in the Group balance sheet. A further 
8.5 million shares were held by the trustees 
of the Management Consulting Group PLC 
employee beneﬁt trusts.

Net debt
The Group ended the year with net debt 
of £33.6m compared with £48.0m at 
30 June 2014 and £39.8m at the end 
of 2013. The year on year decrease in net 
debt reﬂects strong cash generation from 
operations in 2014 in spite of lower proﬁts, 
in part reﬂecting an improved working 
capital position.
During 2014 the Group was ﬁnanced by a 
multi-currency borrowing facility negotiated 
in December 2011 that runs until July 2016. 
The facility is a revolving credit facility for 
up to £85m.
There are two ﬁnancial covenants under the 
facility, which were calculated at 30 June and 
31 December 2014. The ﬁrst of these is that 
interest cover must be greater than four times 
at the calculation dates. At 31 December 2014 
the interest cover covenant ratio was 7.0 
(31 December 2013: 11.7). The second covenant 
is a leverage covenant, which is that net debt 
divided by adjusted EBITDA must remain below 
2.75 times at the calculation dates (increased 
to 3.0 times for the covenant testing dates 
on 31 March 2015 and 30 June 2015). Under 
the borrowing facility net debt for covenant 
testing purposes is measured on the basis 
of average exchange rates over the relevant 
period, consistent with the measurement 
of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is 
deﬁned as underlying operating proﬁt plus 
certain non-cash items such as depreciation 
and amortisation. At 31 December 2014 
the leverage covenant ratio was 2.04 times 
(31 December 2013: 1.46). The gross 
amount drawn down at that date was 
£58.5m (2013: £54.5m).
Foreign exchange exposure
The Group’s foreign exchange exposure is 
primarily a translation risk as the majority of 
the Group’s business is transacted in Euros 
and US Dollars. The goodwill arising on 
acquisitions is also denominated in these 
currencies. Drawdowns under the Group’s 
borrowing facility are made in US Dollars 
and Euros to provide a partial hedge against 
these. Treasury activities are managed on a 
day-to-day basis by a treasurer and ﬁnance 
staff, reporting to the Group Finance Director. 
There are established treasury policies that 
are reviewed regularly to ensure that they 
remain relevant to the business. The objective 
of these policies is to provide liquidity across 
the Group at minimum risk and cost and to 
hedge known ﬁnancial exposures. The Group’s 
net debt position is closely monitored and 
there are effective forecasting procedures 
in place.
Cash ﬂow
Cash generated by operations in 2014 was 
£10.9m higher than the previous year at 
£17.6m (2013: £6.7m), reﬂecting favourable 
working capital movements. Cash outﬂows 
as a result of dividend payments were £4.1m 
(2013: £3.9m). Cash outﬂows related to capital 
expenditure were £1.1m (2013: £2.5m).
Dividend
An interim dividend for the 2014 ﬁnancial year 
of 0.23p per share was paid to shareholders 
on 6 January 2015. The directors recommend, 
subject to shareholder approval, a ﬁnal dividend 
of 0.595p per share to be paid on 7 July 2015 
to shareholders on the register at 15 May 2015. 
The recommended total dividend for the 2014 
ﬁnancial year is therefore 0.825p per share 
(2013: 0.825p per share).
Business resources and investment 
in the future
The Group’s key assets are its client 
relationships, its people and its intellectual 
property. Client relationships are strengthened 
by the regular review of every engagement 
in conjunction with the client throughout its 
duration. This enables timely resolution of 
any issues so that the client remains highly 
satisﬁed with our performance. It is our 
objective that every client becomes a reference 
for future clients. The remuneration policies 
of the Group are designed to retain key 
individuals by rewarding performance and 
deferring the payment of a portion of incentive 
pay contingent on continued employment. 
The performance of each employee is regularly 
reviewed and plans are established to deal 
with any performance issues. Evaluation 
systems are in place throughout the Group. 
The training requirements of employees are 
also reviewed and tailored training programmes 
have been established for each of the core 
functions. The headcount needs of the 
business are reviewed in view of the projected 
requirements of the business as indicated by 
the order book and prospects. The Group has 
developed knowledge management systems 
that capture the intellectual property that has 
been developed through many years of assisting 
clients. Client needs are regularly reviewed 
and new services are developed in accordance 
with these. Appropriate steps are taken to 
safeguard the security of the Group’s intellectual 
property and legal or other action is taken as 
necessary to protect this. The Group continues 
to invest in its client relationships, its people 
and its intellectual property to ensure that the 
Group is prepared to face its challenges and 
to focus client awareness on the Group’s 
brands and the services offered.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group has operating and ﬁnancial policies 
and procedures designed to maximise 
shareholder value within a deﬁned risk 
management framework. The key risks to which 
the business is exposed are reviewed regularly 
by senior management and the Board. The 
major risks facing the business and the means 
by which they are mitigated and managed are 
set out on the principal risks and uncertainties 
pages 32 to 33. The directors are not aware 
of any material outstanding litigation against 
the Group.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Strategic Report. The ﬁnancial 
position of the Group is described in this 
Financial Review. In addition, note 23 of the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital and its exposure to risks. 
The Group’s committed borrowing facilities 
are detailed under the “Liquidity and capital 
resources” section of this Financial Review. 
The Group prepares regular business forecasts 
and monitors its projected compliance with 
the borrowing facility covenants which are 
reviewed by the Board. Forecasts are 
adjusted for sensitivities, which address the 
principal risks to which the Group is exposed, 
and consideration is given to actions open 
to management to mitigate the impact of 
these sensitivities.
In particular this includes the discretionary 
nature of a signiﬁcant amount of the costs 
incurred by the Group. The Board has concluded 
that the Group has adequate resources to be 
able to operate within the level of its current 
facility and remain compliant with the terms 
of the borrowing facility for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, the going concern 
basis has been adopted in preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements. For further details 
please refer to note 2 to the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
Key performance indicators
The key performance indicators used by 
the Board to monitor progress are: revenue 
growth; operating proﬁt; operating margin; 
net debt; and earnings per share. These key 
performance indicators are used to monitor 
performance as they indicate achievement 
against the Group’s objectives of delivering 
shareholder value and proﬁt and margin 
growth. In addition, other measures are used 
at the level of divisional management, including 
order input, business unit performance, staff 
retention and client satisfaction, which the 
directors considered to fall within an 
acceptable range during the year.

Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). This preparation 
requires estimates and judgements that affect 
the reported level of assets and liabilities, 
revenues and costs, and the related disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the ﬁnancial statements. Critical accounting 
policies are those that are reﬂective of 
signiﬁcant judgements and uncertainties and 
potentially result in materially different results 
under different assumptions and conditions. 
The Board considers that the Group’s critical 
accounting policies are limited to those 
described below.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable 
for services provided to third parties in the 
normal course of business. Revenue from 
services is recognised when the service has 
been provided and the right to consideration 
earned. When a service has been provided to 
third parties but no billing made, the amount 
receivable is estimated. This estimate is 
based on the nature of the service supplied 
and the terms of the contract. Any signiﬁcant 
underestimation or overestimation of 
amounts receivable could have a material 
effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial position and 
results of operations.
Goodwill and other intangible ﬁxed assets
Under IFRS goodwill is capitalised and tested 
for impairment annually or when events or 
changes in circumstance indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are capitalised 
and amortised over their remaining useful 
economic lives.
Employee beneﬁts
Accounting for pensions and other post-
retirement beneﬁts involves judgement about 
uncertain events, including discount rates, life 
expectancy, future pay inﬂation and expected 
healthcare trend rates. Determination of the 
projected beneﬁt obligations for deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension schemes and post-retirement plans 
are relevant to the recorded amounts in the 
statement of recognised income and expense 
and the liability recorded in the balance sheet.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in 
numerous jurisdictions. There are transactions 
and calculations for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain until agreed with 
the tax authorities. Where the ﬁnal outcome 
is different from the initial estimate, these 
adjustments will impact the income tax and 
deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period 
in which such determination is made.
Provisions
The Group has onerous property leases 
which require judgement in terms of the 
provision being carried on the balance sheet.
Summary of critical accounting policies
The Group’s management has discussed the 
development of the estimates and disclosures 
related to each of these matters with the Audit 
and Risk Committee. Additional discussion of 
the application of these estimates and other 
accounting policies is provided in note 2 to 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

 Overview

 Financials
Changes in demand for MCG’s services can signiﬁcantly 
impact revenues and proﬁts. The Group’s businesses operate 
in a number of geographies and industry sectors and demand 
for their services can be affected by global, regional or national 
macro economic conditions and conditions within individual 
industry sectors. The Group’s businesses operate in a competitive 
environment, where other consulting ﬁrms seek to provide 
similar services to MCG’s clients.
Any failure by the Group to retain its existing client relationships 
could result in a signiﬁcant reduction in the Group’s revenues. 
MCG’s businesses typically contract with clients for the delivery 
of project related consulting services over relatively short periods. 
Individual clients of the Group may change their preferred suppliers 
of the services that the Group’s businesses provide or may 
change the quantity of such services or the price at which they 
buy such services. Potential unforeseen contractual liabilities 
may arise from client engagements that are 
not completed satisfactorily.
The Group is dependent on the recruitment and retention 
of key personnel to develop and maintain relationships 
with clients and to deliver high quality services. Any failure 
to attract and retain such personnel which results in their 
unforeseen departure from the business may have detrimental 
consequences on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
The intellectual capital of the Group’s businesses, including 
its methodologies and its track record of successful sale and 
delivery of assignments to clients, is a key asset which must 
be maintained, continually developed and protected, so that 
its offerings remain distinctive and attractive to clients. It is 
possible that employees who exit the business may appropriate 
this intellectual capital for use by themselves or by the 
Group’s competitors.
The Group reports its results and ﬁnancial position in Pounds 
Sterling, but operates in and provides services to clients in 
many countries around the world, conducting most of its business 
in other currencies. In particular, a signiﬁcant proportion of 
the Group’s business is conducted in US Dollars and Euros. 
Fluctuations in prevailing exchange rates may have a signiﬁcant 
impact on reported revenues and proﬁts.
The Group seeks to monitor demand for its services, to anticipate 
changes in demand and competitive pressures where possible, 
and to develop a strategy and offering to exploit opportunities for 
growth in geographies and sectors where demand is increasing. 
The diversity of MCG’s businesses provides some protection 
against adverse trends in individual sectors or geographies and the 
Group retains some ﬂexibility (in Alexander Proudfoot in particular) 
in its ability to deploy staff to areas of higher demand to optimise 
utilisation. A signiﬁcant proportion of the total remuneration paid 
to senior employees is in the form of variable pay related to 
ﬁnancial performance, which provides some proﬁt mitigation 
in the event of a decline in revenues.
MCG’s businesses have longstanding relationships with key 
clients. The Group’s business processes are designed to promote 
and enhance such relationships to generate revenues over much 
longer periods than those of a typical single project. This includes 
a focus on the delivery of high quality work that meets clients’ 
expectations and human resources management policies that 
emphasise the importance of maintaining and developing client 
relationships. Potential contractual liabilities arising from client 
engagements are managed through the control of contractual 
conditions and insurance arrangements.
The Group seeks to develop remuneration policies and 
structures that reward good performance and promote continued 
employment with the Group, consistent with prevailing market 
levels of remuneration. For senior employees a signiﬁcant element 
of total remuneration is variable and linked to ﬁnancial and other 
performance measures, which provides opportunities for enhanced 
rewards. Conditional share awards to staff are structured to include 
retention criteria and may also be linked to ﬁnancial targets or 
share price performance over a period longer than one year.
The Group maintains a comprehensive knowledge management 
system to record its methodologies and track record of client 
assignments. It develops and refreshes these continually in 
response to, and in anticipation of, market demand. The Group 
protects its intellectual property through appropriate contractual 
arrangements with employees and others, and through legal 
action where necessary.
Where appropriate, the Group will undertake hedging to mitigate 
currency risk. This is rarely undertaken since the Group’s cost 
base is, in broad terms, located in those countries in which the 
Group generates revenues. The currencies in which costs and 
revenues are denominated are therefore, to a great extent, 
matched and this tends to reduce the impact of exchange 
rate ﬂuctuations on reported proﬁts.
Reducing 
We have continued to 
invest to develop new 
offerings and to build 
our intellectual capital 
in the digital space.

Staff retention has been 
managed effectively and 
we have recruited in

 Overview
 Strategic report
 Governance
 Financials
The Board continues its commitment to 
high standards of corporate governance. 
Whilst in 2013 there were a number 
of changes in legislation which needed 
to be taken into account in our corporate 
governance structures and reﬂected 
in the annual report and accounts for 
the ﬁrst time, this year the landscape 
has remained relatively unchanged. 
Accordingly, the relevant legislation 
remains the September 2012 version 
of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Code”) and The Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (“the Regulations”). 
Last year in compliance with the Regulations 
the Directors‘ Remuneration Report introduced 
a separate section setting out our remuneration 
policy and this was adopted following a binding 
vote at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. 
This year there is just the normal advisory vote 
on the annual implementation of the policy, 
although we do include the remuneration 
policy for ease of reference.
Our Board is composed of directors from 
differing international backgrounds with a range 
of business experience and we recognise the 
importance of diversity on the Board. During 
2014 the Board members continued to bring 
a wide range of experience and knowledge 
to bear in developing strategy, challenging 
management and bringing fresh perspectives. 
In this regard, we appreciate the importance 
of the Board meeting senior management 
and each year the Board holds certain of 
its meetings at its main business locations 
abroad, giving the Board the opportunity 
to meet local management.
On 5 March 2014, we announced that 
Luiz Carvalho was stepping down as CEO 
of Alexander Proudfoot and as a director 
of MCG. Our Group CEO, Nick Stagg, took 
on the Alexander Proudfoot CEO role on 
an interim basis in addition to his Group role. 
In view of this I increased my day-to-day 
involvement with the Group, supporting 
the executive management team. 
It was originally envisaged that I would 
stand down from your Board at the end of 
2014. However, in view of Nick’s continuing 
involvement in the Alexander Proudfoot CEO 
role, it was agreed that I should continue for 
a further year as Chairman.
We have commenced the search for new 
independent non-executive directors using 
external search agents, looking to broaden the 
Board’s diversity, both in terms of their business 
background – industry and geographical markets 
– and gender, and we expect to announce 
appointments in the coming months.
The Board has considered carefully the 
requirements of Section 1 of the Code and 
the Board considers the Company has complied 
with the Code throughout the year.

Board of Directors
The Board is collectively responsible to our 
shareholders for the success of the Company. 
From 1 January 2014 until 5 March 2014 the 
Board comprised the non-executive Chairman, 
four executive directors and ﬁve non-executive 
directors. On 5 March 2014 Luiz Carvalho stood 
down as an executive director. Thus from 
6 March 2014 until the year end the Board 
comprised the non-executive Chairman, 
three executive directors and ﬁve non-executive 
directors. The Code requires that smaller 
companies should have at least two independent 
non-executive directors and the Company 
complied with this aspect. The Company also 
complied with the requirement to separate 
the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive.
Mr Ferriss, Mr Simon and Mr Waldron were 
considered to be independent non-executive 
directors throughout the year. Mr Ferriss and 
Mr Simon have just passed the ninth anniversary 
of their appointment on the Board. The Board 
has speciﬁcally considered whether they remain 
independent in accordance with guidance in 
the Code. Both Mr Ferriss and Mr Simon have 
maintained a range of other unrelated business 
interests and the Board has determined that 
they remain independent in character and 
judgement and there are no other relationships 
or circumstances which are likely to affect or 
could appear to affect their judgement.
The roles of the Board and management 
are clearly deﬁned. Throughout the year, the 
roles of Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior 
Independent Director were separated and clearly 
deﬁned in writing. The terms and conditions 
of appointment of the non-executive directors 
are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered ofﬁce and will also be available 
at the Annual General Meeting.
The Board is satisﬁed that each of the 
non-executive directors committed sufﬁcient 
time during 2014 for the fulﬁlment of their 
duties as directors of the Company. None 
of the non-executive directors has any 
conﬂict of interest which has not been 
disclosed to the Board.
During and at the end of the ﬁnancial year 
no director had a material interest in any 
contract of signiﬁcance to which the Company 
or any subsidiary was a party. Information 
on the directors’ interests in the shares of 
the Company are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. Related party 
transactions are disclosed in note 25.
Election and re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association contain 
detailed rules for the appointment and 
retirement of directors. There is a formal 
procedure in place to select and appoint new 
directors to the Board. These directors are 
required to retire at the next Annual General 
Meeting, but can offer themselves for 
re-election by shareholders. Under the 
Articles, all directors are required to submit 
themselves for re-election at intervals not 
exceeding three years. However, the Board 
agreed that, with effect from the 2011 Annual 
General Meeting, directors should stand for 
re-election every year.
On appointment, directors are provided with 
formal details of their responsibilities under 
legislation applicable to a company listed 
in the UK. Changes to such legislation and 
other relevant factors affecting the Group 
are communicated to all directors. Newly 
appointed directors are also required to 
participate in an induction programme in order 
to familiarise themselves with the Group’s 
businesses. Regular presentations are made 
to the Board by senior management in order 
to refresh and expand this knowledge.
The Board annually evaluates the performance 
of individual directors, the Board as a whole 
and its Committees. This review comprises 
the completion of structured questionnaires 
by each director and follow up interviews 
carried out by the Company Secretary. 
The results of this process are presented to 
the Board and via individual discussions with 
the Chairman. The results of the evaluation 
were approved by the Chairman and an agreed 
plan of action produced. The results are 
speciﬁcally taken into account when considering 
the reappointment of directors.
All directors are authorised to obtain, at 
the Company’s expense and subject to the 
Chairman’s approval, independent legal or other 
professional advice where they consider it 
necessary. All directors have access to the 
Company Secretary who oversees their 
ongoing training and development needs.
Operation of the Board
The Board meets regularly. There is a 
core of six meetings each year with further 
ad hoc meetings scheduled when necessary. 
Ten meetings were held during 2014. 
All members of the Board are supplied, 
in advance of meetings, with appropriate 
information covering matters which are 
to be considered. During the year the 
Chairman met the non-executive directors 
in the absence of the executive directors.

The number of Board and Committee meetings 
eligible for attendance and attended by each 
of the directors during the year are in the 
table on the previous page.
Financial matters
The Group has adopted a code of ethical conduct 
applicable to the Board and all members 
of the ﬁnance function. In addition, it has a 
whistleblowing policy whereby procedures 
exist that allow employees to report any ﬁnancial 
wrongdoing that they believe may have occurred.
The Board has also deﬁned which services can 
be purchased from the Group’s auditor and has 
adopted procedures in respect of the purchase 
of these services to minimise the risk of an 
actual or perceived conﬂict of interest. 
Relations with investors and 
the Annual General Meeting
Registered shareholders are sent copies 
of both the annual report and accounts and 
the half year report. The Group’s website, 
www.mcgplc.com, also contains information 
relevant to investors.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director met, and are available to 
meet, key shareholders throughout the year 
and in particular around the time of the full 
year results and the half year results.
The notice convening the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 22 April 2015 is contained 
in the circular to shareholders. To ensure our 
shareholders have time to consider our annual 
report and accounts and Notice of the AGM 
and lodge their proxy votes, the documents 
are made available more than 20 working days 
prior to the meeting. We offer all shareholders 
the choice of submitting proxy votes either 
electronically or in paper format. 
Visit the investor relations website for more 
information: www.mcgplc.com/investors.
Internal controls
The Company, as required by the Listing 
Rules, has complied with the Code provisions 
on internal control having established the 
procedures necessary to implement the revised 
Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control issued 
in October 2005 (“the Turnbull Committee 
Report”) and by reporting in accordance 
with that guidance.
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Company’s system of internal control and 
reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role 
of management is to implement Board policies 
on risk and control. The system of internal control 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. 
In pursuing these objectives, internal controls 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
There is a continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks 
faced by the Company which is in accordance 
with the guidance set out in the Turnbull 
Committee Report and has been in place for 
the year under review and up to the date of 
approval of the annual report and accounts. 
This process, which is regularly reviewed 
by the Board, is as follows:
 – the Group’s management operates a risk 
management process which identiﬁes the 
key risks facing the business and reports 
to the Audit and Risk Committee and the 
Board on how those risks are being managed. 
This is based on a risk register produced 
by executive management which identiﬁes 
those key risks, the probability of those risks 
occurring, their impact if they do occur and 
the actions being taken to manage those risks 
to the desired level. This risk register is 
discussed at the Audit and Risk Committee 
and Board meetings on a regular basis and 
regular monitoring reports are presented to 
the Board. The management of these risks 
is monitored by the internal audit function;
 – large acquisitions and capital projects 
require Board approval; and 
 – there is regular communication between 
management and the Board on matters 
relating to risk and control.
The Board has established a strong control 
framework within which the Group operates. 
This contains the following key elements:
 – organisational structure with clearly deﬁned 
lines of responsibility, delegation of authority 
and reporting requirements;
 – deﬁned expenditure and contract 
authorisation levels;
 – on-site, video and teleconferencing reviews 
of operations, covering all aspects of each 
business, are conducted by Group executive 
management on a regular basis throughout 
the year;
 – the ﬁnancial reporting and information 
systems which comprise a comprehensive 
annual budget which is approved by the 
Board; weekly reports of key operating 
information; cash ﬂow and capital expenditure 
reporting; monthly results; and forward 
performance indicators which are measured 
against the annual budget and the prior year’s 
results. Signiﬁcant variances are reviewed by 
the Board and executive management and 
action is taken as appropriate. The forecast 
for the year is revised when necessary;
 – Group tax and treasury functions are 
coordinated centrally. There is weekly cash 
and treasury reporting to Group management 
and periodic reporting to the Board on the 
Group’s tax and treasury positions; and
 – internal audits are performed by Group’s 
internal audit function.
During the course of its review of the system 
of internal control, the Board has not identiﬁed 
nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses 
which it deemed to be signiﬁcant. Therefore 
a conﬁrmation in respect of necessary actions 
has not been deemed appropriate.
The Annual General Meeting gives all 
shareholders the opportunity to communicate 
directly with the Board. 
 – During the year, the directors are available 
to respond to enquiries from investors on 
the Group’s operations. 
 – Effective communication with fund managers, 
institutional investors and analysts is actively 
pursued and this encompasses issues 
such as performance, policy and strategy.
During the year, the executive directors 
hold discussions with major shareholders. 
 – The Chairman is available to shareholders

Membership
During 2014 the membership 
of the Committee was:
Julian Waldron,  
Chairman of the  
Audit and Risk Committee
This report describes the membership and 
operation of the Audit and Risk Committee.
Structure
The Code recommends that the Committee 
should comprise at least two members and 
that all members should be independent 
non-executive directors. The Committee 
comprised three independent non-executive 
directors throughout the year.
The Code provides that at least one member 
of the Committee should have recent and 
relevant ﬁnancial experience. Mr Ferriss is 
a banker and Mr Waldron is the chief ﬁnancial 
ofﬁcer of a French listed company and both 
are considered to have such experience. 
The proﬁles and qualiﬁcations of the Committee 
members are shown on pages 36 and 37. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, 
Group Head of Finance, Head of Internal Audit, 
other ﬁnancial managers and external auditors 
are invited to attend Audit Committee meetings. 
The Committee met four times during the 
year. The external auditor attended all of the 
meetings and the Committee met privately 
with it on one occasion. 
The Chairman of the Committee reported 
to the Board on the Committee’s activities 
after each meeting, identifying relevant matters 
requiring communication to the Board and 
recommendations on the steps to be taken. 
The performance of the Committee was 
considered as part of the Board performance 
evaluation process and it was considered 
to operate effectively. In addition, the 
Committee members complete a detailed 
self-assessment as an aid to maintaining 
the Committee’s effectiveness.

 Overview

 Governance
 Financials
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed and updated with effect from 3 March 2015 
to conform with current best practice and the revised guidance from the Financial Reporting 
Council on Audit Committees. They are available on the Group’s website (www.mcgplc.com) 
as well as in hard copy format from the Company Secretary. 
Operation of the Committee
The Committee works with a structured 
annual agenda of matters tied in to the key 
events in the Company’s ﬁnancial reporting 
cycle, together with various standing items 
the Committee is required to consider.
The Committee has discharged its 
responsibilities during the year as follows:
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The Committee reviewed the interim ﬁnancial 
statements and the annual report and accounts. 
Following discussion with both management 
and the external auditor, the Committee’s 
determination of the key risks of misstatement 
for 2014 was the same as for 2013 and the 
steps it took to address these are shown 
in the table below.
The Committee also discussed these matters 
with the external auditor regarding the nature 
and extent of their audit procedures in these 
areas.
Presentations were made by management 
and the external auditor about the key technical 
and judgemental matters relevant to the ﬁnancial 
statements. The Committee was satisﬁed 
that it was appropriate for the Board to 
approve the ﬁnancial statements.
Role of the Committee
The role of the Committee is, in summary:
1 to monitor the integrity of the ﬁnancial 
statements of the Company and any 
formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s ﬁnancial performance, 
reviewing signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting 
judgements contained in them;
2 to assist the Board in ensuring the 
annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy;
3 to review the Group’s internal 
ﬁnancial controls and to review the 
Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems;
4 to monitor and review the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal audit function;
5 to make recommendations to the 
Board in relation to the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the 
external auditor and to approve the 
remuneration and terms of engagement 
of the external auditor;
6 to review and monitor the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity 
and the effectiveness of the audit 
process; and
7 to develop and implement the policy 
on the engagement of the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services, 
and to report to the Board, identifying 
any matters in respect of which it 
considers that action or improvement 
is needed and recommending the 
steps to be taken.
Key risks How the Committee addressed the risk
  The assessment of the carrying value of 
goodwill due to the signiﬁcance of the 
goodwill asset on the balance sheet.
The Committee reviewed the carrying value 
of goodwill at the year end, considering 
a goodwill impairment review report from 
management which set out the key assumptions 
and judgements underlying the review, including 
those on ﬁnancial projections and discount 
rates, and also included a sensitivity analysis. 
The Committee also considered the procedural 
controls surrounding the production of 
the ﬁnancial projections.
  The recognition and recoverability 
of deferred tax assets, in particular 
those in overseas jurisdictions.
  Revenue recognition, including the 
valuation of revenue, and debtor and 
accrued income exposure due to the 
risk on the timing of revenue recognition 
on contracts which span the year end.
The Committee reviewed a report from 
management setting out details of the 
deferred tax assets at the year end, including 
the underlying geographical analysis of tax 
losses, and considered the recoverability of 
the assets concerned alongside the other tax 
attributes and risks within the Group.
The Committee considered the accounting 
policy for revenue recognition and the 
adequacy of the controls in place to ensure 
contractual terms are appropriate in the 
divisions’ accounting systems, and controls 
ensure the appropriate recognition of revenue 
arising therefrom. 44

INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROL AND RISK 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The Committee reviewed the register of 
Group risks prepared by management, 
recommendations made by the external 
auditor and internal audit reports. A review 
of the register of Group risks was carried 
out by internal audit. The Committee was 
satisﬁed that it was appropriate for the Board 
to make the statements regarding internal 
controls included in the Corporate 
Governance Statement. 
INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
The Head of Internal Audit reports to the 
Committee, which reviewed and approved the 
annual internal audit work programme and 
reviewed all internal audit reports prepared in 
the year. The internal audit function also assists 
executive management on special projects.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee oversees the relationship 
with the external auditor and ensures that the 
external auditor continues to be independent, 
objective and effective in its work, as well as 
considering the reappointment of the auditor 
each year in light of this. 
Independence
The Committee undertakes a structured 
annual review of the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor and, with 
the external auditor, has in place procedures 
to ensure this is not compromised. The 
procedures include:
 – Audit partner rotation – The Committee 
consider this is a key control in ensuring 
continued independence and objectivity by 
reducing the risk of familiarity. The current 
audit partner was appointed with effect 
from the audit of the 2012 annual report 
and accounts.
 – Restrictions on the nature and amount 
of non-audit work – In accordance with 
the Code, the Committee has established 
policies that the auditor shall not provide 
any services that would potentially result 
in them auditing the result of their own 
work or which are prohibited under the 
US Sarbanes Oxley Act and procedures 
to ensure compliance with the policies. 
The Committee reviews annually its policy 
and procedures on this area to ensure 
they remain appropriate in the context 
of regulatory changes and changes in 
the nature of the Group’s activities. Under 
the procedures in force in the year, the 
Committee pre-approves any permitted 
non-audit engagements with fees of more 
than £25,000 or which would cause the 
cumulative fees of such engagements for 
the year to exceed £100,000. At each 
Committee meeting a report is presented 
on non-audit activities and fees payable to 
the external auditor in order to ensure that 
the non-audit work is appropriate and 
relationship between non-audit fees and 
audit fees is not inappropriate.
 – The relationship of the auditor with 
senior management – The Committee 
reviews the relationship to ensure it has 
not become compromised due to 
familiarity or other factors.
The Committee has considered the 
independence of the external auditor and 
is satisﬁed that independence has been 
maintained and Deloitte LLP has formally 
conﬁrmed its continuing independence 
to the Committee.
Audit effectiveness
The Committee reviews the external audit 
plan proposed by the auditor and participated 
in the review of the quality of the service 
that they provided. The Committee’s 
consideration includes:
 – a review of the external audit plan;
 – the auditor’s assessment of Group 
accounting and business risks;
 – the auditor’s own quality control procedure;
 – the auditor’s assessment of the key risks 
of misstatement;
 – consideration of the audit strategy 
and its communication;
 – whether the stafﬁng of the external 
audit has continuity whilst maintaining 
independence; and
 – communication of the ﬁndings to the 
Committee and the quality and key 
features of its work.
Audit tendering
The Audit Committee has noted the changes 
to the Code and related guidance regarding 
the tendering of external audit contracts at 
least every ten years. As the Company is not 
in the FTSE 350, the process is not mandatory. 
However, the Committee is mindful that the 
current external auditor was appointed in 
2001 and will continue to give consideration 
to the timing of a formal tender in the light of 
the regulatory regime, its assessment of the 
independence of the current auditor and any 
future changes in regulations.
Reappointment
There are no contractual obligations that act 
to restrict the Committee’s choice of external 
auditor. As a consequence of its satisfaction 
with the results of the procedures outlined 
above, the Committee has recommended 
to the Board that the external auditor be 
reappointed. Deloitte LLP has expressed 
its willingness to continue in ofﬁce as 
auditor and a resolution to reappoint them 
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Auditor and disclosure of information 
to auditor
Each director who held ofﬁce at the date of 
approval of this annual report and accounts 
conﬁrms that, so far as the director is aware:
 – there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 – the director has taken all the steps that he 
ought to have taken as a director in order 
to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

The Nominations Committee
Structure
The Code recommends that a majority of the 
members of the Nominations Committee should 
be independent non-executive directors. The 
majority of the Committee was independent 
throughout 2014.
The Nominations Committee adopted formal 
terms of reference dated 14 March 2003. 
These were updated on 2 March 2007 and 
are available from the Group’s website 
(www.mcgplc.com) or the Company 
Secretary upon request.
Activities
The Committee meets on an ad hoc basis 
as required. The Committee has ongoing 
succession plans particularly in respect 
of non-executive directors approaching 
retirement due to their length of service. 
The Committee has identiﬁed the skill sets 
needed for new non-executive directors, 
taking into account that one will need to take 
on the chairmanship of the Audit and Risk 
Committee and considering the diversity 
of the Board, and instructed a search agency 
to identify suitable candidates. Interviews 
with candidates are ongoing with a view to 
appointments in the coming months.

Membership
During 2014 the membership 
of the Committee was:
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to write to you again as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee to summarise 
the activities of the Committee during 2014 
and to provide an overview of our strategy 
and business performance and the linkage 
to our executives’ remuneration outcomes 
for the year under review. 
Shareholders approved our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy as set out in the 2013 
Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2014 
AGM and the Remuneration Committee is 
comfortable that the policy remains appropriate 
and should continue to operate for 2015 with 
no changes proposed. There will therefore not 
be a shareholder vote on policy at the 2015 
AGM. However, our Remuneration Policy 
has been included in this report to assist 
shareholders in reviewing the Company’s 
implementation of its policy during 2014. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration, which 
describes the implementation of the policy 
during the year, will again be subject to an 
advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM.
During 2014 the Remuneration Committee has 
dealt with the following speciﬁc remuneration 
matters in addition to its normal annual 
timetable. On 5 March 2014 Luiz Carvalho 
stepped down as CEO of Alexander Proudfoot 
and as an Executive Director of Management 
Consulting Group, but remained an employee 
on garden leave until 5 March 2015. The 
Committee agreed the terms of Mr Carvalho’s 
remuneration on his cessation as set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration and 
within the terms of our shareholder approved 
Remuneration Policy. 
As a result of Mr Carvalho’s departure, 
Nick Stagg took on the role of CEO of 
Alexander Proudfoot on an interim basis 
in addition to his Group CEO role and our 
Chairman, Alan Barber, agreed to increase the 
time he spends at MCG and the Committee 
agreed an increase to his fee to reﬂect this 
increased time commitment. Towards the 
end of 2014 the Committee reviewed the terms 
on which the Chairman was engaged by the 
Company and, as part of the arrangements to 
retain Mr Barber as Chairman until the end of 
2015, agreed that he be provided with a ﬁxed 
term agreement for one year effective from 
1 January 2015. 
During the year it was also necessary for 
the Committee to review the remuneration 
arrangements for Mr Mahjoub in the context 
of his role and responsibilities. Mr Mahjoub 
had last had an increase to his base salary 
on 1 January 2010 and it was agreed that 
Mr Mahjoub’s salary should be increased 
from 1 July 2014 by 5% to €525,000 per 
annum. Mr Mahjoub was also provided with 
a car allowance and a pension contribution, 
further details of which are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consistent with our approach in 2013 our aim 
is to have a simple remuneration package for 
the executive directors which reﬂects their 
day-to-day duties and responsibilities, whilst 
having a signiﬁcant element of remuneration 
which is performance related through the use 
of annual bonus and share incentive schemes 
in order to align the interests of executive 
directors with those of shareholders. As always, 
the Committee remains mindful of the interest 
in executive remuneration and has sought 
to ensure that the remuneration policies and 
practices at Management Consulting Group 
drive behaviour that is in the long-term interests 
of the Company and its shareholders. 
Chairman’s summary statement 47
Management Consulting Group PLC  
Annual report and accounts 2014
 Overview
 Strategic report
 Governance
 Financials
As outlined in the Chairman’s statement, whilst 
we have taken action to restore the growth 
and proﬁtability of Alexander Proudfoot, the 
weak revenues in that business badly hit the 
Group’s performance and its overall proﬁtability 
in 2014. Kurt Salmon has performed well 
in North America and other geographies, 
although France has remained weak. These 
factors are reﬂected in the annual bonus 
for 2014, with there being no bonus for the 
achievement of Group ﬁnancial objectives. 
Performance against management’s individual 
strategic objectives, which are essential to 
restoring the growth and prosperity of the 
business, was strong - further details are set 
out on page 57. Due to disappointing TSR 
performance the performance conditions set 
for the PSP awards granted on 5 January 2012 
(in respect of the ﬁnancial year 2011) have not 
been met and there is therefore no vesting 
of these awards.
The Committee continues to believe that our 
Remuneration Policy supports and rewards 
the Group’s business strategy and results as 
demonstrated by the remuneration outcomes 
for the year. I hope, therefore, that you will 
be supportive of the remuneration resolution 
being presented at our AGM. I will be happy 
to engage with you if there are any matters 
set out in the report which you would like 
to discuss in the meantime.
Yours sincerely
Andrew Simon 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
5 March 2015
Structure
The Code recommends that the Committee 
should comprise at least two independent 
non-executive directors. The Committee 
comprised three independent and one 
non-independent non-executive directors 
throughout the year.
The terms of reference for the Committee 
were last updated in December 2010. They 
were last reviewed in 2014 and no changes 
were deemed necessary. Copies are available 
on the Group’s website.
Operation of the Committee
In determining the directors’ remuneration for 
the year, the Committee consulted the Chairman 
save in relation to his own remuneration. 
No director is involved in deciding their own 
remuneration. The Committee makes use of 
published reports on directors’ remuneration 
packages and advice from independent external 
advisers is obtained when required. New Bridge 
Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt, an 
Aon plc company) is the independent adviser 
to the Remuneration Committee. Aon plc 
also provided insurance broking services to 
the Company during the year. The Committee 
has been advised that NBS operates as a 
distinct business within the Aon Group and 
that there is a robust separation between the 
business activities and management of NBS 
and the wider Aon Group. The Committee 
considers that this provision of other services 
by Aon plc does not prejudice New Bridge 
Street’s independence. New Bridge Street 
provides advice to the Remuneration Committee 
on the operation of the Company’s incentive 
schemes and the remuneration of executive 
and non-executive directors as well as 
employee remuneration and may also advise 
the Committee on other matters within the 
Committee’s terms of reference. 
The Board carried out a review of its operations, 
including the functioning of its Committees, and 
deemed the operation of the Remuneration 
Committee to be satisfactory.

This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the 
remuneration policy for the Company and has been prepared in 
accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
The policy was developed taking into account the principles  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 and the views 
of our major shareholders and describes the policy applicable 
from 2014 onwards. 
Policy overview
OVERVIEW 
The Committee reviews and determines, on 
behalf of the Board, the salary, fees, beneﬁts, 
pension packages and bonus and share 
incentives of the Chairman and the executive 
directors. The Committee also reviews, on 
behalf of the Board, the remuneration packages 
of the highest paid executives and the 
Company Secretary.
HOW THE VIEWS OF SHAREHOLDERS AND 
EMPLOYEES ARE T AKEN INTO ACCOUNT
The Remuneration Committee engages 
proactively with shareholders. When any 
material changes are proposed to the 
remuneration policy, the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman will inform major 
shareholders and offer a meeting to discuss 
the proposals and take into consideration any 
feedback received.
The Remuneration Committee also considers 
shareholder feedback received at the AGM 
and at any other time, for example, via general 
letters from investors and circulated to 
remuneration committee chairs. This 
feedback and that received during speciﬁc 
consultation exercises is considered as 
part of the Company’s annual review of 
remuneration policy.
Details of votes cast for and against 
the resolution to approve last year’s 
Remuneration Report and matters 
discussed with shareholders during the 
year are provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
There is no consultation with employees.
Remuneration policy
Compensation packages for executive 
directors are set by reference to individual 
and corporate performance, individual 
competencies, external market comparisons 
and remuneration levels below Board level in 
the Group. The package for each executive 
director currently comprises a basic salary, 
an annual bonus, share incentives, pension 
contributions and beneﬁts.
The Remuneration Committee has regard to 
associated risks arising throughout the Group 
when setting remuneration. In particular, the 
Committee ensures that the targets attached 
to variable pay schemes are set so that they 
do not encourage any undue risk taking 
by executives.
In order to align the interests of executive 
directors with the interests of shareholders, 
a signiﬁcant proportion of executive directors’ 
remuneration is performance related through 
the use of annual bonus and share incentive 
schemes.
Fees for the Chairman and non-executive 
directors are reviewed annually by the Board 
based on market information obtained from 
external surveys, time commitment and 
relevant experience.
Remuneration policy report
This 2014 Remuneration Report is divided 
into two sections: 
 – Remuneration Policy Report, setting out 
the framework within which the Company 
remunerates its Directors. The Company’s 
remuneration policy was put to a shareholder 
vote at the 2014 Annual General Meeting 
of the Company (“AGM”) and was approved 
by 83% of shareholders. There is no 
requirement to vote on the policy in 2015 
unless any changes to the policy are 
proposed, and the Committee does not 
intend making any changes to the policy at 
this time. The policy is included in this 2014 
Remuneration Report for information only; 
the chart showing remuneration scenarios 
on page 54 has been updated to reﬂect 
proposed 2015 remuneration levels and 
minor changes to the text of the policy 
have been made to reﬂect the fact that 
the policy has already been approved by 
shareholders. Where additional information 
has been included in the policy this has 
been clearly indicated.
 – Annual Report on Remuneration, setting 
out how the Company’s present remuneration 
policy was applied during 2014 and how 
the policy will be implemented in 2015. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration will 
be subject to an advisory resolution at the 
AGM on 22 April 2015. Details of the 
resolution and its status as an advisory 
vote are set out in the Notes to the 
Notice of Meeting.

market whilst ensuring that they take account, 
where applicable, of the pay and employment 
conditions of other employees within their business 
units and countries of employment as well as market 
practice in the countries in which they are operating.
The Committee will usually review executive 
directors’ base salaries at the end of each calendar 
year with any increases effective from 1 January.
The Directors’ salaries (and other elements of the 
remuneration package) are paid in the currency 
appropriate to their geographic location.
There is no prescribed maximum annual 
increase. The Committee is guided by the 
general increase for the broader employee 
population of the Group and the country 
and business unit in which the director is 
employed, but on occasions may need to 
recognise that higher increases may be 
appropriate, for example, development in 
role, change in responsibility, where the 
size, composition and/or complexity of the 
Group changes or where an individual is 
materially below market comparators.
Details of the outcome of the most recent 
salary review are provided in the Annual 
Remuneration Report.
Beneﬁts To provide market 
competitive beneﬁts 
to ensure the wellbeing 
of employees
Beneﬁts vary according to the employing country  
of the executive director but may comprise some  
or all of the following: a car (or car allowance), 
insurances for life, personal accident, disability, 
permanent health and family medical cover.
Value of beneﬁts is based on the cost to 
the company, is not pre-determined and 
does not represent a signiﬁcant part of 
the executives’ overall remuneration.
Additional beneﬁts may be provided  
and the range of those beneﬁts may 
vary taking into account market practice, 
the relevant circumstances and the 
requirements of the executive.
Pension To provide market 
competitive beneﬁts
A company contribution to a money purchase 
pension scheme or provision of cash allowance 
in lieu of pension at the request of the individual. 
For directors based outside the UK, contributions 
to relevant retirement arrangements in those other 
countries, e.g. US 401(k) retirement provisions.
Only base salary is pensionable.
UK resident: 17.5% of salary.
Non-UK resident: retirement provision will 
be consistent with market practice in the 
relevant country. 50

Annual bonus To incentivise and reward 
delivery of the Company’s 
operational objectives
Not less than 70% of the annual bonus is 
assessed on ﬁnancial targets set around the 
Group’s and individual businesses’ budgeted 
proﬁts and revenue (“ﬁnancial objectives”) 
with not more than 30% based on the 
achievement of non-ﬁnancial strategic objectives 
(“personal objectives”). The Committee 
retains the discretion to set alternative metrics 
from year to year if it deems this appropriate, 
provided always that at least 70% will be based 
on ﬁnancial measures. Performance is 
measured over one year.
Details of the performance targets set for 
the year under review and performance 
against them is provided in the Annual 
Remuneration Report. 
A clawback mechanism applies to all 
participants in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s accounts 
and also for other deﬁned reasons. 
The maximum bonus opportunity for all 
executive directors is 100% of salary. 
0% of salary vests for threshold performance.
For performance below threshold, no bonus 
is payable.
A graduated scale of targets operates between 
entry level and maximum performance.
Long-term

Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
Awards vest subject to continued 
employment and satisfaction of challenging 
performance conditions measured over 
three years.
All outstanding awards are subject to 
absolute total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
targets. The Committee intends that future 
awards will continue to be subject to absolute 
TSR targets but retains the ﬂexibility to set 
targets using other measures if it considers 
that these are appropriate based on the 
strategic aims of the Company.
In addition to the speciﬁed performance 
condition, the Committee must be satisﬁed 
that the vesting level is warranted by the 
Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance 
over the three year performance period.
A clawback mechanism applies in the event 
of a material misstatement of the Group’s 
accounts and also for other deﬁned reasons.
Maximum award in any ﬁnancial year over 
shares with a market value (at date of award) 
of 100% of annual base salary in that ﬁnancial 
year. In exceptional circumstances, this limit 
may be increased to 200% of an employee’s 
annual base salary.
20% of the award vests for threshold 
performance.
No vesting for below threshold performance.

Chairman

director fees
To attract and retain 
a high-calibre Chairman 
and non-executive 
directors by offering 
a market competitive  
fee level
The Chairman and non-executive directors 
are not normally entitled to bonuses or pension 
contributions or to participate in any share 
scheme. However, the Company may provide 
beneﬁts if deemed appropriate.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his 
responsibilities. The non-executives are paid 
a basic fee. The Chairmen of the main Board 
Committees and the Senior Independent 
Director are paid an additional fee to reﬂect 
their extra responsibilities. 
Non-executives may be paid additional 
fees for other responsibilities such as being 
appointed to the Supervisory Board of 
subsidiaries of the Company. 
The level of these fees is normally reviewed 
annually by the Committee and Chief Executive 
for the Chairman and by the Chairman and 
executive directors for the non-executive 
directors, with reference to market levels in 
comparably sized FTSE companies and taking 
into account the role, responsibilities and 
time commitment, and a recommendation 
is then made to the Board. Fees are paid in 
cash. If there is a change in responsibility 
and/or time commitments during the year 
then the Board can change the level of fees 
from the date of the change. 
As for the executive directors, there is 
no prescribed maximum annual increase.
Fees will be set taking account of market 
data and time commitment, experience 
and responsibility. Increases will normally 
be in line with inﬂation but on occasions 
the Board will need to take account 
of increased responsibilities and 
time commitment. 
Shareholding 
guidelines
To align interests of executive 
directors with those of 
shareholders
Executive directors are required to retain 
50% of the post-tax shares received under 
LTIPs until their shareholding represents 
100% of their base salary. 
n/a
The Committee will operate the annual bonus 
plan and Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) 
according to the rules of each respective plan 
and consistent with normal market practice 
and the Listing Rules, including ﬂexibility in a 
number of regards. How the Committee will 
retain ﬂexibility includes (albeit with quantum 
and performance targets restricted to the 
descriptions detailed above):
 – who participates in the plan;
 – when to make awards and payments;
 – how to determine the size of an award, 
a payment, or when and how much of 
an award should vest;
 – the testing of a performance condition over 
a shortened performance period;
 – how to deal with a change of control 
or restructuring of the Group;
 – whether a director is a good/bad leaver for 
incentive plan purposes, what proportion 
of awards vest at the original vesting date 
or whether and what proportion of 
awards may vest at the time of leaving;
 – how and whether an award may 
be adjusted in certain circumstances 
(e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate 
restructuring or special dividends); and
 – what the weighting, measures and 
targets should be for the annual bonus 
plan and PSP from year to year. 52
Management Consulting Group PLC  
Annual report and accounts 2014
Report of the Remuneration Committee continued
Remuneration policy continued
The Committee also retains the discretion 
within the policy to adjust existing targets 
and/or set different measures and alter 
weighting for the annual bonus plan and for 
the PSP if events happen that cause it to 
determine that the targets are no longer 
appropriate and amendment is required so 
they can achieve their original intended 
purpose and provided the new targets are 
not materially less difﬁcult to satisfy. The 
Committee will disclose any changes and 
the reasons for those changes in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration for the year in 
which the alteration is made. 
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority 
is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current 
or former directors (such as the payment 
of last year’s annual bonus or the vesting/
exercise of share awards granted in the past) 
that have been disclosed in previous 
Remuneration Reports and in respect of 
long-term incentive awards as detailed 
on pages 58 to 59 of the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. Details of any payments to 
former directors will be set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Choice of performance measures 
and approach to target setting
The performance measures and targets 
set for the executive directors’ annual 
bonus and PSP awards are carefully selected 
to align with the Company’s strategic and 
key performance indicators. 
For the annual bonus, ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
strategic measures are reviewed and selected 
by the Committee annually. The measures 
selected and weighting between them may 
vary annually depending on the key priorities 
of the business for the year ahead. Robust 
and demanding targets will be set annually 
taking into account the economic environment, 
market expectations and the Company’s 
budget, business plan and strategic priorities 
for the year ahead.
The Company has used an absolute TSR for 
a number of years in line with the Group’s 
strategy of delivering superior returns to its 
shareholders. The Committee will continue 
to review the choice of performance measures 
and the appropriateness of targets prior to 
each PSP award being made and will set 
robust and stretching targets for any 
measures used. 
Differences in remuneration policy 
for executive directors compared 
to other employees
The remuneration policy for the executive 
directors is designed with regard to the policy 
for employees across the group as a whole. 
For example, the Committee takes into 
account the general basic salary increase 
for the broader employee population when 
determining the annual salary review for 
the executive directors. There are some 
differences in the structure of the remuneration 
policy for the executive directors and other 
senior employees compared to the wider 
employee group, which the Remuneration 
Committee believes are necessary to reﬂect 
the different levels of responsibility. The key 
differences in remuneration policy between 
the executive directors/other senior employees 
and employees across the Group are the 
increased emphasis on performance-related 
pay and the inclusion of a share-based 
long-term incentive plan. 
Other director positions
Mr Stagg is a director of Shinetrip Ltd and 
a non-voting adviser to the board of Wedlake 
Bell LLP. The Company recognises that 
executive directors may be invited to become 
non-executive directors of other companies 
and/or sit on the board of subsidiary companies 
and that such appointments can broaden their 
knowledge and experience to the beneﬁt of 
the Group and they are entitled to retain any 
fees earned. Such fees will be disclosed in 
the annual report on remuneration for the 
relevant year.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new director 
would be set in accordance with the terms 
of the Company’s approved remuneration 
policy in force at the time of appointment. 
Currently, for an executive director, this would 
facilitate annual bonus and PSP payments 
of no more than 100% of salary for each, 
except in exceptional circumstances where 
PSP limits of no more than 200% of salary 
may be made. This exceptional limit allows, 
in particular, for recruitment in exceptional 
circumstances meeting local market needs. 
For the annual bonus, speciﬁc targets 
could be introduced for an individual where 
necessary for the ﬁrst year of appointment 
if it is appropriate to do so to reﬂect the 
individual’s responsibilities and the point in 
the year in which they joined the Board. For 
long-term incentives, an award may be made 
in the year of joining or, alternatively, the award 
can be delayed until the following year.
The salary for a new executive director may 
(but will not necessarily) be set below the 
normal market rate, with phased increases 
over the ﬁrst few years as the executive 
gains experience in their new role. 
The Committee may offer additional 
cash and/or share-based elements when 
it considers these to be in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders. 
Such payments would only take account 
of remuneration relinquished when leaving 
the former employer and would reﬂect (as far 
as possible) the nature and time horizons 
attaching to that remuneration and the impact 
of any performance conditions and be of a 
broadly similar quantum. 
For an internal executive director appointment, 
any variable pay element awarded in respect 
of the prior role will be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms, adjusted as relevant 
to take into account the appointment. 
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may 
continue and as such are part of the Company’s 
remuneration policy for its executive directors.

 Financials
For external and internal executive 
appointments, the Committee may agree 
that the Company will meet certain 
relocation expenses as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or 
non-executive director, the fee arrangement 
would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.
Service contracts and payments 
for loss of ofﬁce
No director has a service contract containing 
more than a one year notice period or with 
pre-determined compensation provisions 
upon termination exceeding one year’s salary 
and beneﬁts. It is the Company’s policy that, 
except where prescribed by law, there should 
be no automatic entitlement to bonuses or 
share-based payments in the event of an early 
termination. All newly appointed executive 
directors will have contracts terminable at 
any time on up to one year’s notice. 
Mr Stagg and Mr Povey have contracts with 
the Company which either party is able to 
terminate by giving twelve months’ notice. 
Mr Mahjoub has an appointment letter in 
respect of his role as a director of the 
Company which may be terminated with 
no notice. Mr Mahjoub also has a contract 
with a Group company which either party 
is able to terminate by giving three months’ 
notice. Mr Stagg’s and Mr Povey’s contracts 
continue until age 65. Mr Mahjoub’s contract 
continues until the mandatory retirement 
age as speciﬁed under French employment 
legislation. Mr Carvalho stepped down 
from his role in March 2014 and details of his 
contract (which were set out in the shareholder 
approved policy) have been deleted from 
this section.
A director’s service contract may be terminated 
without notice and without any further payment 
or compensation, except for sums accrued 
up to the date of termination, on the occurrence 
of certain events such as gross misconduct. 
If the employing company terminates the 
employment of an executive director in other 
circumstances, compensation is limited to 
salary due for any unexpired notice period and 
any amount assessed by the Remuneration 
Committee as representing the value of 
other contractual beneﬁts (including pension) 
which would have been received during the 
period. In addition, in these circumstances 
Mr Stagg may be entitled to retain his car. The 
Committee also has the discretion to pay 
statutory entitlements or sums to settle or 
compromise claims in connection with a 
termination if necessary. In the event of a 
change of control of the Company there is no 
enhancement to contractual terms. Service 
contracts are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered ofﬁce. 
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period Twelve months for all executive directors except Mr Mahjoub, 
who is on three months’ notice.
Termination payment
Base salary plus beneﬁts (including pension where applicable), 
paid monthly and subject to mitigation.
In addition, any statutory entitlements would be paid 
as necessary. 
Remuneration entitlements A pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period 
of active service along with vesting for outstanding share 
awards (in certain circumstances – see below).
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control There are no enhanced terms in relation to a change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to 
an executive director under the Company’s 
share plans will be determined based on the 
relevant plan rules. The default treatment 
is that any outstanding unvested awards 
lapse on cessation of employment. However, 
in certain prescribed circumstances, such 
as death, injury, disability, retirement, the 
sale of the executive’s employing company 
or business in which he was employed out 
of the Group, or in other circumstances at 
the discretion of the Committee (taking 
into account the individual’s performance 
and the reasons for their departure), awards 
may vest at the normal vesting date. In these 
circumstances the awards remain subject to 
performance conditions measured over the 
original time period and are reduced pro-rata 
to reﬂect the proportion of the performance 
period actually served. The Remuneration 
Committee has the discretion to disapply time 
pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do 
so although it is envisaged that this would 
only be applied in exceptional circumstances. 
The Remuneration Committee may decide 
to allow the awards to vest on cessation of 
employment, in which case vesting will be 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions at that time and 
reduced on a time pro-rated basis (although 
the Remuneration Committee can disapply 
time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate 
to do so). 
In determining whether an executive’s 
awards should be allowed to vest (subject 
to performance conditions being met), 
the Committee will take into account 
the performance of the individual and 
the reasons for their departure.
In the event of change of control, awards 
would be eligible to vest based on (i) the 
extent to which performance targets had 
been met, as assessed by the Committee, 
over the shortened performance period and 
(ii) subject to a pro rate reduction for time 
(which the Committee retains discretion 
to disapply if it considers it appropriate 
to do so).  54

Chairman and non-executive directors 
The shareholder approved policy states that the chairman and non-executive directors do not have service contracts and all are appointed 
for limited terms and subject to annual reappointment at the AGM. At the time the policy was approved, neither the Chairman nor the 
non-executive directors were subject to notice periods or had any rights to compensation on termination, although the policy reserves 
the right to introduce notice periods if they are considered appropriate. In 2014 the Committee reviewed the terms on which the Chairman 
is engaged by the Company and agreed that the Chairman should be provided with a ﬁxed term agreement for one year effective from 
1 January 2015. 
Reward scenarios
The chart below provides an indication of the remuneration of the executive directors at minimum, in line with expectation on-target 
and maximum performance, in accordance with the policy to be implemented in 2015. The chart does not include share price movement 
and all other assumptions are noted below.
 
Assumptions: 
1 Fixed pay consists of base salary, beneﬁts and pension. 
2 Base salaries are as at 1 January 2015. 
3 Value of beneﬁts is based on the expected value for 2015. Pension is based on 2015 policy applied to 1 January 2015 salaries. 
4 Target annual bonus is 60% of maximum. 
5 Target PSP award assumes vesting of 50% of award in the year. 
6 Maximum is full vesting of annual bonus and PSP award in the year. 
7 Annual bonus and PSP awards are in accordance with implementation of policy for 2015. 
8 No share price appreciation is assumed.

2015 SALARY REVIEW
With the departure of Mr Carvalho in early 2014 and the increase in time commitment of the Chairman, the Committee agreed in 2014 that it 
was necessary to review the remuneration arrangements for Mr Mahjoub in the context of his role and responsibilities. For 2015 Mr Mahjoub’s 
salary is €525,000 per annum with a car allowance of €22,500 per annum and a pension contribution of 10% of base salary.
The other executive directors’ salaries have been reviewed with effect from 1 January 2015 and there are no increases.
The current salaries as at 1 January 2015 are as follows:
Salary as at
1 January 2014
Salary as at
1 January 2015 % increase
N S Stagg £400,000 £400,000 0%
C J Povey £250,000 £250,000 0%
C Mahjoub €500,000 €525,000 5%
Fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors 
A summary of fees as at 1 January 2015 is as follows:
Fees at
1 January 2014
Fees at
1 January 2015 % increase
Chairman £300,000 (from 1 April 2014) £300,000 0%
Base fee £35,000 £35,000 0%
Senior Independent Director and Committee Chair £5,000 £5,000 0%
As mentioned in the 2013 Annual Report on Remuneration, with Mr Carvalho stepping down from his role on 5 March 2014 and Mr Stagg 
taking on the role of CEO of Alexander Proudfoot as well as his Group CEO role, the Chairman agreed to increase his day-to-day time commitment 
with the Group and his fees were reviewed and increased to £300,000 p.a. In 2014 the Committee reviewed the terms on which the Chairman 
is engaged by the Company and agreed that the Chairman should be provided with a ﬁxed term agreement for one year effective from 
1 January 2015.
Mr Capello and Mr Di Spiezio Sardo, who were appointed to the Board as non-executive directors on 18 June 2010, have voluntarily agreed not 
to take fees. The Chairman and non-executive directors are not normally entitled to bonuses or pension contributions or to participate in any share 
scheme. However, the Company may provide beneﬁts if deemed appropriate.
PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THE ANNUAL BONUS AND LTIP AWARDS TO BE GRANTED IN 2015
For 2015, the major part of the annual bonus will be assessed on ﬁnancial targets set around the Group’s and individual businesses’ budgeted 
proﬁts from operations and revenue with the remainder based on the achievement of personal strategic objectives.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year for the annual bonus as these include 
items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. Disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be seen in next 
year’s Annual Remuneration Report.
The annual bonus maximum opportunity and maximum PSP award grant level is 100% of base salary.
The performance conditions for any PSP awards to be granted in 2015 will be agreed by the Remuneration Committee prior to grant. 
The performance conditions attached to awards will be disclosed in the appropriate RNS announcement.

PSP awards made during the year 
No PSP awards were granted to executive directors in 2014.
Vesting of PSP awards
In 2012 each executive director received two awards. The ﬁrst award made on 6 January 2012 was in respect of ﬁnancial year 2011 and the 
second was in respect of the ﬁnancial year 2012. No awards were made in the ﬁnancial year 2011. Thus the underlying intention of not awarding 
more than 100% of base salary per year was maintained. The PSP awards granted on 6 January 2012 (in respect of the ﬁnancial year 2011) 
were based on performance to the third anniversary of the date of grant. The performance conditions for these awards and performance 
achieved were as follows:
Metric Condition Actual % vesting

The share prices on the dates of grant were 31.00p on 6 January 2012, 35.25p on 7 March 2012, 24.63p on 31 August 2012 and 28.5p on 
7 March 2013.
Except for the directors shown in the above tables no other director held share awards at 31 December 2014. There have been no variations 
to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share awards during the ﬁnancial year.
The market price at 31 December 2014 was 15.875p and the range during 2014 was 15.75p to 29.50p.
Outstanding PSP awards
Awards made to executive directors in respect of the ﬁnancial years 2012 and 2013 will vest in three years, subject to the individual director’s 
continued employment with the Company’s group and the achievement of a TSR performance condition set out in the table below: 
Date of grant 31 August 2012 7 March 2013
Share price at grant 24.63p 28.5p
20% vesting at TSR creation of 5.0p 5.0p
100% vesting at TSR creation of 25.0p 25.0p
Straight-line vesting between 20% and 100%.
In addition to the TSR performance condition, the Committee must be satisﬁed that the vesting level is warranted by the Company’s underlying 
ﬁnancial performance over the three year performance period.
At 31 December 2014, there were awards outstanding over new shares under the 2008 Performance Share Plan of 11.4 million (excluding the 
awards lapsing on 5 January 2015), comprising 2.3% of the issued share capital. 
Shareholders have approved that the aggregate options and awards over new issue shares outstanding are limited to 12.8% of the fully diluted 
share capital.
Deferred Share Bonus (“DSB”)
Prior to 2013 part of a larger annual bonus entitlement was paid in deferred shares. In 2013 the annual bonus maximum of the executive directors 
was reduced and there is no longer a deferred share element. Deferred shares are released three years after the end of the relevant ﬁnancial 
year with the exception of Mr Mahjoub’s 2012 award in respect of his annual bonus in the ﬁnancial year 2011 which vested on 31 May 2014. 60

Directors’ shareholding and share interests
To align the interests of the executive directors and senior management with shareholders, participating executives are required to build up 
shareholdings through the retention of shares vesting under the Company’s share plans. The executive directors are required to build up a 
shareholding equivalent to 100% of salary, to be achieved through retaining at least 50% of their net of taxes gain arising from any shares 
vesting or acquired under the long-term incentive share plans, until such time as the upper limit of their share ownership target has been met.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH 
The regulations require this report to contain a graph illustrating the Company’s performance compared with an appropriate “broad equity market 
index” over the past ﬁve years. Management Consulting Group PLC is a constituent of the FTSE All-Share Index and, accordingly, that index is 
considered the most appropriate form of “broad equity market index” against which the Group’s performance should be plotted. Performance, 
as required by the legislation, is measured by TSR (share price growth plus dividends paid). 
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2014, of £100 invested in Management Consulting Group PLC on 31 December 2009 compared 
with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE All-Share Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening ﬁnancial year ends.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare such ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements under IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU. Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and the parent company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Group and the parent company and enable them to ensure that the 
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the parent 
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Chairman’s Statement, Business Review and the Financial Review contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the ﬁnancial 
condition, results of operations and businesses of the Group. These statements and forecasts involve risk and uncertainty because they relate 
to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results or developments 
to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements and forecasts. The forward-looking statements are 
based on the directors’ current views and information known to them at 5 March 2015. The directors do not make any undertaking to update 
or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Nothing in this report should 
be construed as a proﬁt forecast.
Responsibility statement 
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
 – the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.

Opinion on ﬁnancial statements of Management Consulting Group PLC 
In our opinion:
 – the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 
and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 – the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union;
 – the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The ﬁnancial statements comprise the Group income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group statement of changes in 
equity, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash ﬂow statement, the Company balance sheet, the Company statement of changes in equity, the 
Company cash ﬂow statement and the related notes 1 to 26. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within the Financial Review that the Group is a going concern. 
We conﬁrm that:
 – we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements 
is appropriate; and
 – we have not identiﬁed any material uncertainties that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These remain unchanged from the risks identiﬁed in 2013. 
Carrying value of goodwill
Risk description
The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill due to the signiﬁcance of the goodwill asset on the balance sheet 
(£253.2 million) and judgements required in respect of forecasting future cash ﬂows, associated discount rates and 
growth rates.
Further information in this area is discussed in the critical accounting judgements in note 2 of the accounts.
How the scope  
of our audit  
responded  
to the risk
We tested management’s assumptions used in the impairment model for goodwill, described in note 10 to the ﬁnancial 
statements. We considered and evaluated the key assumptions, which we judged to be future cash ﬂows, growth rates 
and the discount rate applied, to the separate cash-generating units, Kurt Salmon and Proudfoot, through benchmarking 
against comparator businesses, comparison against the market rate and the prevailing Group cost of capital, and our 
understanding of the future prospects of the business, with particular focus on assessment of forecasts against historical 
forecast accuracy. We used our internal valuation specialists to assess the calculation methodology for the discount rate. 
We have critically assessed the reasonableness of sensitivities applied by management against the base case scenario  
and recalculated the headroom available under the sensitised position. In addition, we have considered the levels to which 
proﬁts would have to decline before an impairment is triggered.
We have audited the mechanics of the impairment model prepared by management.

Revenue recognition
Risk description
Revenue recognition, speciﬁcally the valuation of revenue, and receivable and accrued income exposure due to the risk on 
the timing of revenue recognition on contracts which span the year end which involves a level of management judgement.
Further information in this area is discussed in the critical accounting judgements in note 2 of the accounts.
How the scope  
of our audit  
responded  
to the risk
We assessed the revenue recognition policies applied in the two divisions of the Group, including the valuation and timing 
of revenue recognition. We evaluated the design and implementation of revenue controls across the locations subject to a 
full audit.
We performed substantive tests on a sample of projects, agreeing fees and project dates to contracts. Independent 
recalculation was performed on a sample of the accrued and deferred income balances by reference to the revenue 
recognised and pre-year end billing; in addition, accrued balances were tied to post-year end billings. Time reports were 
assessed and used to recalculate revenue recognised for the year under review. We assessed whether the revenue 
recognition policies adopted complied with IFRS.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Risk description
Recognition and recoverability of £14.7 million deferred tax assets, in particular those in overseas jurisdictions due to the 
judgement in assessing the probability that sufﬁcient future taxable proﬁts will be generated against which the deferred 
tax asset can be offset.
Further information in this area is discussed in the critical accounting judgements in note 2 of the accounts.
How the scope  
of our audit  
responded  
to the risk
We tested and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s assumptions and estimates in relation to the likelihood of 
generating future taxable proﬁts to support the recognition of deferred tax assets as described in note 15 to the ﬁnancial 
statements, considering those assumptions and supporting forecasts and estimates as well as the appropriateness of 
tax disclosures. 
We used our internal tax specialists to assess tax rates against local tax legislation and review supporting documentation 
as well as assessing management’s assumptions and estimates.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the signiﬁcant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on page 43.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements is not modiﬁed with respect to any of the 
risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or inﬂuenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £0.45 million, which is below 10% of pre-tax proﬁt, below 0.2% of revenue and below 0.25% 
of equity. This is a change of approach from 2013, where materiality of £1.05 million was calculated having regard to a number of factors including 
the level of non-recurring items and average of pre-tax proﬁt over the previous three years and was below 7.5% of pre-tax proﬁt, below 0.5% 
of revenue and below 0.5% of equity. The change has been made following emerging market practice and changing investor expectations.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £20,000 (2013: £50,000), as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identiﬁed when assessing the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.  66

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at ﬁve 
key locations being the UK, the US, France, South Africa and Germany, the key components of which were all subject to a full audit. These 
locations represent the principal business units within each of the Group’s reportable segments and the full audits undertaken at these 
locations account for 79% of the Group’s revenue and 81% of the Group’s total assets. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis 
for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identiﬁed above. Our audit work at the ﬁve key locations was executed 
at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and capped at £325,000. The Group audit 
team also performed speciﬁed audit procedures on a number of locations across the Group, accounting for a further 12% of the Group’s 
revenue and 7% of the Group’s total assets.
The Group audit team met with the management teams in the UK, the US and France this year. The Senior Statutory Auditor also attended 
audit close meetings at these locations. Annually, for each of the signiﬁcant components, we include the component audit team in our team 
brieﬁng, discuss and agree their risk assessment and audit approach before their work commences, attend the audit close meetings either via 
telephone, teleconference or in person, and review a selection of working papers on scoped signiﬁcant audit risks.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to conﬁrm our conclusion that there 
were no signiﬁcant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated ﬁnancial information of the remaining components not subject to audit 
or audit of speciﬁed account balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
ADEQUACY OF EXPLANATIONS RECEIVED AND ACCOUNTING RECORDS 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
OUR DUTY TO READ OTHER INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited ﬁnancial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identiﬁed any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and 
the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We conﬁrm that we 
have not identiﬁed any such inconsistencies or misleading statements. 67

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review 
team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that 
the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
ﬁnancial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Management Consulting Group PLC  
Annual report and accounts 2014
1. General information
Management Consulting Group PLC (the “Company“) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. 
The address of the registered ofﬁce is given on page 115. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activity are set out in note 3 
and in the Financial Review.
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current and preceding year in dealing with items which are considered 
material in relation to the ﬁnancial statements.
(A) BASIS OF PREPARATION
The ﬁnancial statements of Management Consulting Group PLC and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS“). The ﬁnancial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union (“EU”) and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards (“IAS“) regulation. 
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, the Company 
has elected not to present its own income statement. Its separate ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial instruments. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out below. The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the parent company’s ﬁnancial 
statements are the same as those adopted in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements except that the parent company’s investments in subsidiaries 
are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report. The ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position, borrowing facilities and principal risks and uncertainties 
are described in the Financial Review. In addition, note 23 to the Group ﬁnancial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its ﬁnancial risk management objectives, details of its ﬁnancial instruments and its exposures to liquidity 
risk and credit risk.
As detailed under “Liquidity and capital resources” in the Financial Review, the Group has a borrowing facility, which runs until July 2016. 
The facility is a fully revolving credit facility under which the Group can draw up to £85m. The facility is subject to ﬁnancial covenants (referred 
to in note 23). At 31 December 2014, £58.5m was drawn on the facility. The Group prepares regular business forecasts and monitors its projected 
compliance with its banking covenants, which are reviewed by the Board. Forecasts are adjusted for reasonable sensitivities that address the 
principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed. Consideration is given to the potential actions available to management to mitigate 
the impact of one or more of these sensitivities, in particular the discretionary nature of a signiﬁcant amount of cost incurred by the Group. 
The Board has concluded that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility and remain covenant compliant for 
the foreseeable future, being a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements, and, accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and ﬁnancial statements.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any material 
impact on the disclosures or amounts reported in these ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
IFRIC 21 Levies

At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued 
but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 11 (amendments) clariﬁcation of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
IAS 19 (amendments) deﬁned beneﬁt plans: employee contributions
IAS 27 (amendments) equity method in separate ﬁnancial statements
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) sale of contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2010–2012
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2011–2013
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012–2014 cycle
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group 
in future periods, except as follows:
IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of ﬁnancial instruments and IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and 
related disclosures.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The discussion and analysis of the Group’s ﬁnancial position and results are based on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of the ﬁnancial statements requires the development of estimates and judgements that 
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and costs and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the ﬁnancial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Critical accounting policies are deﬁned as those that are reﬂective of signiﬁcant judgements and uncertainties and potentially result in materially 
different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Board considers that the Group’s critical accounting policies are limited to 
those described below. The Group’s management has discussed the development of the estimates and disclosures related to each of these 
matters with the Audit and Risk Committee.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts chargeable for services provided to third parties in the normal course of business. Revenue from services is 
recognised when the service is provided and the right to consideration earned. To the extent that a service has been provided to third parties 
but no billing made, the amount is recognised as revenue and recorded as accrued income. Revenue recognised in this manner is based on an 
assessment of the fair value of the services provided at the balance sheet date as proportion of the total value of the engagement. This assessment 
is an estimate which is based on the nature of the service supplied and the terms of the contract and is calculated with reference to time spent 
as a proportion of the total time required to complete the service. Costs are expensed as incurred except to the extent that they relate to future 
services that have not yet been rendered, in which case they are recognised as an asset provided that they are expected to be recovered. 
Any signiﬁcant underestimation or over-estimation of amounts receivable could have a material effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial position and 
results of operations. Billings made in advance of services being provided are recognised as deferred income.
Goodwill and other intangible ﬁxed assets
Under IFRS goodwill is capitalised and tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives. Changes in assumptions 
used in the Group’s impairment reviews or estimated useful economic lives could have a material effect on the presentation of the Group’s 
ﬁnancial position and results of operations. Details of the impairment test calculations are set out in note 10. 78

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
(A) BASIS OF PREPARATION continued
Employee beneﬁts
Accounting for pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts involves judgements about uncertain events, including, but not limited to, discount 
rates, life expectancy, future pay inﬂation and expected healthcare trend rates. Determination of the projected beneﬁt obligations for the Group’s 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme and post-retirement plans are important to the recorded amount of the beneﬁt expense in the income statement 
and the net liability recorded in the balance sheet. Actuarial valuations are carried out annually. These determine the expense recorded in the 
income statement, the net liability recognised in the balance sheet, and items to be recorded in the consolidated statement of recognised 
income and expense. Details of the assumptions used are included in note 17 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income 
taxes. There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. 
Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
income tax and deferred tax liabilities and assets in the period in which such determination is made. 
Provisions
The Group has onerous property leases which require judgement in terms of the provision being carried on the balance sheet. 
(B) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
Subsidiaries
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its “subsidiaries”) 
made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The 
existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group 
controls another entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the Group income statement from 
or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal, respectively. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries 
to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. In the income statement the results of subsidiaries acquired during the 
period are classiﬁed as part of continuing operations from the date control is achieved. The results of subsidiaries that are disposed of during 
the period are classiﬁed within discontinued operations in the income statement.
Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
(C) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is the aggregate of the fair values, 
at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for resale which are recognised and measured at fair value less 
costs to sell. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss as incurred. Where applicable the consideration for the acquisition 
includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent 
changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). 
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classiﬁed as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance 
with the relevant IFRS. The measurement period is the period from acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about 
facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year. 
(D) GOODWILL
Goodwill arising in a business combination represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
recognised identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity. If, after reassessment, the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, 
the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently 
when there is indication of impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt or 
loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to equity prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining any subsequent proﬁt or loss and disposal. 79

(E) INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Acquired intangible assets (e.g. customer relationships, trademarks, licences) are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives. Purchased computer software licences are capitalised as intangible assets on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire 
and bring into use the speciﬁc software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed 
three years. Costs associated with developing software are capitalised as intangible assets when they are separable or arise from contractual 
or other legal rights. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred. All other 
intangible assets are amortised from three years to a maximum of ten years depending on useful economic life.
(F) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is charged 
so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, less estimated residual value, by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives of 
between three and seven years.
(G) LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the 
related lease.
(H) IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever events or 
changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by cash-generating units.
For goodwill Alexander Proudfoot and Kurt Salmon are treated as separate cash-generating units.
(I) DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION
Dividends to holders of common shares are recognised as a liability in the Group and parent company’s ﬁnancial statements in the period 
in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established. For interim dividends the shareholders’ right to receive payment 
is the same as the date of payment. For ﬁnal dividends the shareholders have a right to receive payment once the proposed dividend has 
been approved by the Board.
(J) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value, which are held for short-term cash 
investment purposes.
(K) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period 
of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classiﬁed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the balance sheet date. 80

(L) T AXA TION
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for 
the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years or are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which such differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be recovered in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred 
tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
(M) PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outﬂow 
of resources will be required to settle that obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.
(N) OWN SHARES
The Company shares held by the employee beneﬁt trusts established in respect of certain share-based awards are presented as a reduction 
of equity.
(O) INVESTMENTS
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets are classiﬁed as either at fair value through proﬁt and loss (“FVTPL”) or available-for-sale (“AFS”) ﬁnancial assets, 
depending on the nature and purpose of the ﬁnancial assets, which is determined at the time of original recognition. Financial assets at FVTPL 
are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in proﬁt or loss. AFS ﬁnancial assets are measured at fair value and changes 
therein, other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on AFS monetary items, are recognised directly in equity. When 
an AFS investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to proﬁt or loss.
The investments in the parent company balance sheet represent equity holdings in subsidiary companies. These are carried at cost less 
impaired amounts.
(P) INTEREST INCOME
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces 
the carrying amount to its recoverable amount.
(Q) DIVIDEND INCOME
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(R) OPERATING LEASES
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 81

(S) RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS
For deﬁned contribution pension schemes, the amount charged to the income statement represents the contributions payable in the period. 
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet.
For the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the amounts charged to the income statement are the current service costs and gains and losses on 
settlements and curtailments. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement if the beneﬁts have vested. If the 
beneﬁts have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs. The interest cost is calculated by applying 
a discount rate to the net deﬁned liability or asset.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income. The US deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme 
is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group in separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets 
are measured at fair value. Liabilities in relation to the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method 
and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme 
liabilities. Actuarial valuations are obtained at each balance sheet date. The resulting deﬁned beneﬁt asset or liability is presented on the face 
of the balance sheet.
(T) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Share awards are made to selected employees on a discretionary basis. Awards are measured at their fair value (which is measured using 
the stochastic pricing model at the date of grant) and are recognised as an employee beneﬁts expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions, 
with a corresponding increase in the share compensation reserve. The expected life used in the valuation model has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (in respect of the nominal value) and share premium 
(in respect of the balance) when the options are exercised. Where options do not vest, a transfer is made from the share compensation 
reserve to retained earnings.
(U) FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The individual ﬁnancial statements of each Group entity are drawn up in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the results and ﬁnancial position of each entity 
are expressed in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, transactions 
in currencies other than Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items 
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign company are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement and retranslation of monetary items are included in the income statement for the period. 
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the 
period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly 
in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations (including 
comparatives) are expressed in Sterling using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items (including 
comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rate for the period unless exchange rates ﬂuctuated signiﬁcantly during that period, 
in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising are classiﬁed as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
recognised in the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
(V) NON-RECURRING ITEMS
Non-recurring items are those signiﬁcant credits or charges which, in the opinion of the directors, should be separately disclosed by virtue of their 
size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. Transactions that may give rise to non-recurring items 
include charges for impairment, restructuring costs, acquisition costs, discontinued operations and proﬁts/losses on disposal of subsidiaries. 82

7. Tax continued
The average tax rate applicable across the Group has increased to 48% (2013: 33%). This rate has been calculated at the rates prevailing in the 
jurisdictions where the Group operates. The increase in the average rate arises due to the split of proﬁt and loss making jurisdictions and the 
corporate tax rates applied in those jurisdictions.

ANAL YSIS OF GOODWILL
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units (“CGUs“) that are expected to beneﬁt from that business 
combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:

10. Intangible assets and goodwill continued
ANAL YSIS OF GOODWILL continued
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding 
the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to EBITA during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
and tax rates speciﬁc to the CGU. Goodwill is tested against the value in use of operating segments on the basis that, given the integrated 
nature of the segments, it cannot be reasonably allocated to a lower level of CGU.
The Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts based on the most recent ﬁnancial budgets and the strategic plan for the next three years. The budget 
and strategic plan were prepared on a bottom-up basis, taking into account market and economic factors speciﬁc to the geographies and practices 
of the divisions and have been approved by the Board. The key assumptions underlying the forecasts are revenue and EBITA, with growth 
forecast in each of the three years. EBITA is deemed to be a reasonable proxy for cash. Assumed EBITA rates for both CGUs are consistent 
with past experience and industry norms.
The cash ﬂow forecast for Kurt Salmon assumes some revenue growth in 2015, reﬂecting the regional mix for the business as a whole, which 
includes stabilised client activity levels in France and better short-term prospects in North America and Asia. EBITA margins are assumed to 
remain stable next year with modest growth in the following year.
The cash ﬂow forecast for Alexander Proudfoot assumes signiﬁcant revenue growth in 2015 together with a corresponding EBITA margin 
improvement following change initiatives implemented during 2014. 
Beyond the three year strategic plan, cash ﬂows for Kurt Salmon are extrapolated based on steady long-term growth assumptions reﬂecting 
the long-term average growth rates, which for Kurt Salmon is a rate of 1.8% (2013: 2.25%) for the European region and 1.9% (2013: 3.1%) for 
the Americas region. For Alexander Proudfoot we apply a long-term average growth rate of 1.6% (2013: 3.5%) for Europe and 1.9% (2013: 3.25%) 
for the Americas regions. 
The rates used to discount the forecast post-tax cash ﬂows for each CGU are 8.54% (2013: 7.98%) for Kurt Salmon and 9.29% (2013: 8.02%) 
for Alexander Proudfoot. CGU discount rates are based on the relevant regional weighted average cost of capital.
Following the 2014 impairment review management concluded that the recoverable amounts for both the Alexander Proudfoot and the Kurt Salmon 
CGUs exceeded carrying value. However, sensitivity analysis on key assumptions included in the impairment review of the Kurt Salmon CGU 
indicates that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions over the course of the next year could result in the recoverable amount falling 
below the carrying value as at 31 December 2014. The carrying value of the Alexander Proudfoot CGU remained satisfactory having taken into 
account reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.

The fair values above are based on the reports received at the balance sheet date from independent investment advisers. Dividends are recorded 
when the right to receive payment is established.
The fair values represent the principal amounts on which dividends are received. The timing of dividend receipts varies but generally they are 
received every six months or annually. Dividend income is recorded in the income statement when received.
Financial assets primarily comprise investments in corporate securities. The main risk associated with these investments is the risk of changes 
in market value. Investment performance is regularly monitored and, where appropriate, professional advice is obtained. 92

15. Tax assets and liabilities continued
At 31 December 2014 the Group recognised deferred tax assets totalling £14.7m (2013: £16.5m), of which £4.4m (2013: £6.9m) are in respect 
of US tax losses, £7.6m (2013: £7.0m) are in respect of other temporary differences relating to the US and £2.7m (2013: £2.6m) in respect of 
other temporary differences relating to non-US jurisdictions. The Group believes there will be sufﬁcient future taxable proﬁts to utilise these 
tax losses and the deductions arising from the reversal of these other deferred tax assets. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
respect of non-US tax losses.
At 31 December 2014 the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets totalling £26.2m (2013: £26.0m), of which £6.0m (2013: £5.7m) are 
in respect of US tax losses, £19.1m (2013: £20.3m) are in respect of non-US losses and £1.1m (2013: £nil) are in respect of temporary differences 
other than losses. Based on the current tax rules in the respective jurisdictions, the non-US losses of £74.8m are expected to expire as follows: 
£12.7m by the end of 2018, £2.0m by the end of 2023, £1.2m by the end of 2033, with the remaining £58.9m being carried forward indeﬁnitely. 
The losses may be subject to adjustment on tax audit and it is uncertain if there will be sufﬁcient future proﬁts against which the losses can 
be offset.
No deferred tax liability is recognised in relation to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences which would give rise to the liability and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The unrecognised deferred tax liability at 31 December 2014 of £1.5m (2013: £1.8m) is in respect of the unremitted earnings of those 
overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of tax due in overseas 
intermediate holding companies and dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES
The Group operates a number of deﬁned contribution pension schemes throughout the world. The total cost charged to income in respect 
of deﬁned contribution schemes was £9,227,000 (2013 represented: £9,212,000), representing contributions payable to these schemes by the 
Group at rates speciﬁed in the rules of the plans.
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES
In the US the Group operates a closed deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme and a closed unfunded plan which provides beneﬁts in respect of 
post-retirement medical costs. In France, the Group has a statutory unfunded post-retirement beneﬁt obligation. In Germany, the Group has 
an unfunded post-retirement beneﬁt obligation and, in the UK, a funded pension scheme, which is deﬁned contribution with deﬁned beneﬁt 
underpin; both plans are closed to new employees. Actuarial valuations are obtained annually from independent qualiﬁed actuaries for each 
of the deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements.
The retirement beneﬁt obligations are summarised below:
2014
 £’000 
2013
£’000
US deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme 8,340 5,529
US post-retirement medical plan 2,499 3,256
French statutory obligation 2,501 1,991
German obligation 9,580 8,806
UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme — —
22,920 19,582
A 1% change in the discount rates used in calculating the above obligations is estimated to affect the total retirement beneﬁt obligation by 
£7,640,000 (2013: £6,500,000). The cumulative amount of other gains and losses recognised in the other comprehensive income since the 
date of transition to IFRS is a loss of £22,428,000 (2013: £18,600,000). 96

US schemes
The funded US deﬁned beneﬁts pension scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 February 2001 and further beneﬁt accruals 
ceased for all members with effect from 31 December 2001. The US medical beneﬁts plan applies only to certain former employees who 
retired prior to 30 September 1995 and to the post-retirement medical costs of a small number of current and former employees who were 
employed at that date.
The principal assumptions used for the recent actuarial valuations were:
2014

Discount rate 3.99 4.73
General inﬂation assumption n/a n/a
There are neither guaranteed nor discretionary increases to beneﬁts after retirement. The mortality table used was the RP 2014 mortality tables 
for males and females projected with scale MP2014 (2013: scale BB-2D). The discount rate assumption was changed to reﬂect changes in 
long-term corporate bond yields. Expected pension contributions for 2015 are £1,720,000.

The Company has two classes of shares: 1p ordinary shares that carry no right to ﬁxed income; and 24p deferred shares that (i) have no entitlement 
to any dividend, (ii) whose voting rights are restricted to matters in connection with a winding up of the Company or abrogation of rights attaching 
to deferred shares and (iii) whose entitlement to a return of capital on a winding up of the Company is limited to the amount paid up on the deferred 
shares up to a maximum of 24p per share but only after any and all ordinary shares then in issue shall have received payment in respect of such 
amount as is paid up or credited as paid up on those ordinary shares plus the payment in cash or specie of £10m for every 1p paid up or credited 
as paid up on those ordinary shares. 
An net expense of £2,410,000 (2013: £3,928,000) has been recognised in the year in respect of share awards. The cumulative share compensation 
reserve at 31 December 2014 is £5,737,000 (2013: £6,239,000). The weighted average fair value of awards granted in the year was 23.49p 
(2013: 28.15p). 
(B) SHARE AWARDS 
Conditional awards
The Performance Share Plan was introduced during 2008. Any employee (including an executive director) of the Company and its subsidiaries 
is eligible to participate in the Plan at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”).
The Committee may grant awards as conditional shares, a nil (or nominal) cost option with a short exercise period or as forfeitable shares. 
The Committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash.
The vesting of awards is subject to performance conditions set by the Committee. Further details in respect of share awards made to directors 
can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 58.
Number of shares
Outstanding at 1 January 2014 22,973,000
Forfeited during the year (5,475,000)
Lapsed during the year (6,081,000)
Outstanding at 31 December 2014 11,417,000
The performance conditions for conditional awards granted during the year are either purely TSR based or a combination of share price 
performance and the achievement of other non-market based ﬁnancial targets. The remaining awards are exercisable note earlier than the 
period January 2015 to April 2016.
The fair value of conditional awards was determined using the stochastic valuation model. Expected volatility was assessed by considering 
the historic volatility of the Company’s share price.  103

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND TREASURY POLICIES
Review of treasury policies
The Group and Company are ﬁnanced by shareholders’ equity and debt. The Group and Company’s capital structures are reviewed regularly 
to ensure that each remains relevant to the business and its planned development. There are established treasury policies that are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that they remain relevant to the business. 
Risk management
The objective of the Group and Company’s treasury policies is to provide liquidity for the Group and Company at minimum risk and minimum 
cost and to hedge known ﬁnancial exposures, when economically efﬁcient. The main treasury risks faced by the Group and Company are country 
speciﬁc liquidity risks. The Group and Company’s objectives regarding interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk are, 
respectively, to minimise interest charges; minimise realised exchange losses on foreign currency transactions; ensure that the Group and Company 
only deal with creditworthy customers; and ensure that the Group and Company have sufﬁcient resources available to meet their liabilities as 
they fall due. Investment of the Group and Company’s cash is made within policies that cover counterparty risk and liquidity. Surplus cash 
is invested generally in overnight deposits or commensurate with the maturity of loan draw downs. Draw downs under the multi-currency 
revolving credit facility arrangement allow for interest maturities of up to six months in US Dollars and Euros and other major currencies. The 
Group’s revolving credit facilities were drawn down in Euros, US Dollars and Sterling, the three major currencies in which the Group operates.  106

Covenant compliance
As detailed under “Liquidity and capital resources” in the Financial Review, in December 2011 the Group put in place a new borrowing facility, 
which runs until July 2016. The facility is a fully revolving multi-currency credit facility for up to £85m which is subject to two ﬁnancial covenants: 
Group net debt and Group interest cover. The Group’s net debt position is closely monitored and there are effective cash forecasting procedures 
in place. These procedures involve careful review of future billing levels and new business prospects with operational management. Information 
on borrowings is shown in note 16.
The most important foreign currencies for the Group and the Company are the US Dollar and the Euro. The relevant exchange rates to Sterling were:
